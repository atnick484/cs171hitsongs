Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.\u201d\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names of those who came to Gatsby\u2019s house that summer. It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed \u201cThis schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.\u201d But I can still read the gray names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby\u2019s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.\n\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie\u2019s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\n\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett\u2019s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga\u2019s girls.\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (\u201cRot-Gut.\u201d) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly\u2014they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as \u201cthe boarder.\u201d\u2014I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O\u2019donavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names\u2014Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.\n\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O\u2019brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\n\nAll these people came to Gatsby\u2019s house in the summer.\n\nAt nine o\u2019clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby\u2019s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.\n\n\u201cGood morning, old sport. You\u2019re having lunch with me to-day and I thought we\u2019d ride up together.\u201d\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American\u2014that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty, isn\u2019t it, old sport?\u201d He jumped off to give me a better view. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever seen it before?\u201d\nI\u2019d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.\n\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say: So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road-house next door.\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn\u2019t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit.\n\u201cLook here, old sport,\u201d he broke out surprisingly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your opinion of me, anyhow?\u201d\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to tell you something about my life,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.\u201d\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you God\u2019s truth.\u201d His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. \u201cI am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West \u2014 all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.\u201d\nHe looked at me sideways \u2014 and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase \u201ceducated at Oxford,\u201d or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn\u2019t something a little sinister about him, after all\n\u201cWhat part of the Middle West?\u201d I inquired casually.\n\u201cSan Francisco.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cMy family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\u201d\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\u201cAfter that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe \u2014 Paris, Venice, Rome \u2014 collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\u201d\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned \u201ccharacter\u201d leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne\n\u201cThen came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn\u2019t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration \u2014 even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!\u201d\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them \u2014 with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro\u2019s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro\u2019s warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one from Montenegro.\u201d\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look\n\n\u201cOrderi di Danilo,\u201d ran the circular legend, \u201cMontenegro, Nicolas Rex.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMajor Jay Gatsby,\u201d I read, \u201cFor Valour Extraordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad \u2014 the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.\u201d\n\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger \u2014 with a cricket bat in his hand.\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make a big request of you to-day,\u201d he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, \u201cso I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn\u2019t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear about it this afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt lunch?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you\u2019re taking Miss Baker to tea.\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean you\u2019re in love with Miss Baker?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, old sport, I\u2019m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what \u201cthis matter\u201d was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn\u2019t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I\u2019d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.\nHe wouldn\u2019t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.\n\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Long Island City \u2014 only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar \u201cjug \u2014 jug \u2014 spat!\u201d of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.\n\n\u201cAll right, old sport,\u201d called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cRight you are,\u201d agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. \u201cKnow you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cThe picture of Oxford?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.\u201d\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby\u2019s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we crossed Blackwell\u2019s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.\n\n\u201cAnything can happen now that we\u2019ve slid over this bridge,\u201d I thought; \u201cAnything at all....\u201d\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.\nRoaring noon. In a well\u2014fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\n\n\u201cMr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.\u201d\n\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\n\n\u201c\u2014So I took one look at him,\u201d said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, \u201cand what do you think I did?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I inquired politely.\n\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\n\n\u201cI handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid: \u2018all right, Katspaugh, don\u2019t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.\u2019 He shut it then and there.\u201d\n\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\n\n\u201cHighballs?\u201d asked the head waiter.\n\n\u201cThis is a nice restaurant here,\u201d said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \u201cBut I like across the street better!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, highballs,\u201d agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: \u201cIt\u2019s too hot over there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHot and small\u2014yes,\u201d said Mr. Wolfshiem, \u201cbut full of memories.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat place is that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe old Metropole.\n\n\u201cThe old Metropole,\u201d brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. \u201cFilled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can\u2019t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. \u2018all right,\u2019 says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.\n\n\u201c\u2018Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don\u2019t you, so help me, move outside this room.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was four o\u2019clock in the morning then, and if we\u2019d of raised the blinds we\u2019d of seen daylight.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he go?\u201d I asked innocently.\n\n\u201cSure he went.\u201d Mr. Wolfshiem\u2019s nose flashed at me indignantly. \u201cHe turned around in the door and says: \u2018Don\u2019t let that waiter take away my coffee!\u2019 Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour of them were electrocuted,\u201d I said, remembering.\n\n\u201cFive, with Becker.\u201d His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. \u201cI understand you\u2019re looking for a business gonnegtion.\u201d\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthis isn\u2019t the man.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo?\u201d Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\n\u201cThis is just a friend. I told you we\u2019d talk about that some other time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Mr. Wolfshiem, \u201cI had a wrong man.\u201d\n\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room\u2014he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.\n\n\u201cLook here, old sport,\u201d said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.\u201d\n\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like mysteries,\u201d I answered. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing underhand,\u201d he assured me. \u201cMiss Baker\u2019s a great sportswoman, you know, and she\u2019d never do anything that wasn\u2019t all right.\u201d\n\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\n\n\u201cHe has to telephone,\u201d said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. \u201cFine fellow, isn\u2019t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an Oggsford man.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d\n\u201cHe went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most famous colleges in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you known Gatsby for a long time?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cSeveral years,\u201d he answered in a gratified way. \u201cI made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: \u2018There\u2019s the kind of man you\u2019d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.\u2019.\u201d He paused. \u201cI see you\u2019re looking at my cuff buttons.\u201d I hadn\u2019t been looking at them, but I did now.\nThey were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.\n\u201cFinest specimens of human molars,\u201d he informed me.\n\u201cWell!\u201d I inspected them. \u201cThat\u2019s a very interesting idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \u201cYeah, Gatsby\u2019s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n\n\u201cI have enjoyed my lunch,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurry, Meyer,\u201d said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very polite, but I belong to another generation,\u201d he announced solemnly. \u201cYou sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your\u2014\u2014\u201d He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. \u201cAs for me, I am fifty years old, and I won\u2019t impose myself on you any longer.\u201d\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.\n\n\u201cHe becomes very sentimental sometimes,\u201d explained Gatsby. \u201cThis is one of his sentimental days. He\u2019s quite a character around New York\u2014a denizen of Broadway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is he, anyhow, an actor?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cA dentist?\u201d\n\n\u201cMeyer Wolfshiem? No, he\u2019s a gambler.\u201d Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: \u201cHe\u2019s the man who fixed the World\u2019s Series back in 1919.\u201d\n\u201cFixed the World\u2019s Series?\u201d I repeated.\n\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World\u2019s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people\u2014with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.\n\n\u201cHow did he happen to do that?\u201d I asked after a minute.\n\n\u201cHe just saw the opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he in jail?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t get him, old sport. He\u2019s a smart man.\u201d\n\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.\n\n\u201cCome along with me for a minute,\u201d I said; \u201cI\u2019ve got to say hello to some one.\u201d When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d he demamded eagerly. \u201cDaisy\u2019s furious because you haven\u2019t called up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.\u201d\n\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby\u2019s face.\n\u201cHow\u2019ve you been, anyhow?\u201d demanded Tom of me. \u201cHow\u2019d you happen to come up this far to eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.\u201d\n\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen\u2014\u2014\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\n\n\u2014I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT, in a disapproving way.\n\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay\u2019s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night. \u201cAnyways, for an hour!\u201d\n\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn\u2019t see me until I was five feet away.\n\n\u201cHello, Jordan,\u201d she called unexpectedly. \u201cPlease come here.\u201d\n\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn\u2019t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn\u2019t lay eyes on him again for over four years\u2014even after I\u2019d met him on Long Island I didn\u2019t realize it was the same man.\n\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn\u2019t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd\u2014when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors were circulating about her\u2014how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say good-by to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn\u2019t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn\u2019t play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town, who couldn\u2019t get into the army at all.\n\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nI was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress\u2014and as drunk as a monkey. she had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\n\u201c\u2018Gratulate me,\u201d she muttered. \u201cNever had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Daisy?\u201d\n\nI was scared, I can tell you; I\u2019d never seen a girl like that before.\n\u201cHere, deares\u2019.\u201d She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \u201cTake \u2019em down-stairs and give \u2019em back to whoever they belong to. Tell \u2019em all Daisy\u2019s change\u2019 her mine. Say: \u2018Daisy\u2019s change\u2019 her mine!\u2019.\u201d\nShe began to cry\u2014she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother\u2019s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn\u2019t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o\u2019clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months\u2019 trip to the South Seas.\n\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I\u2019d never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a minute she\u2019d look around uneasily, and say: \u201cWhere\u2019s Tom gone?\u201d and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together\u2014it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken\u2014she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesn\u2019t drink. It\u2019s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don\u2019t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all\u2014and yet there\u2019s something in that voice of hers. . . .\n\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you\u2014do you remember?\u2014if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: \u201cWhat Gatsby?\u201d and when I described him\u2014I was half asleep\u2014she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasn\u2019t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the Sheik of Araby.\nYour love belongs to me.\nAt night when you\u2019re are asleep\nInto your tent I\u2019ll creep\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt was a strange coincidence,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a coincidence at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cGatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\u201d\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor.\n\n\u201cHe wants to know,\u201d continued Jordan, \u201cif you\u2019ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.\u201d\n\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths\u2014so that he could \u201ccome over.\u201d some afternoon to a stranger\u2019s garden.\n\n\u201cDid I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s afraid, he\u2019s waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see, he\u2019s a regular tough underneath it all.\u201d\n\nSomething worried me.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he ask you to arrange a meeting?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants her to see his house,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd your house is right next door.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,\u201d went on Jordan, \u201cbut she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York\u2014and I thought he\u2019d go mad:\n\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want to do anything out of the way!\u2019 he kept saying. \u2018I want to see her right next door.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen I said you were a particular friend of Tom\u2019s, he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn\u2019t know very much about Tom, though he says he\u2019s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan\u2019s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn\u2019t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \u201cThere are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Daisy ought to have something in her life,\u201d murmured Jordan to me.\n\u201cDoes she want to see Gatsby?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn\u2019t want her to know. You\u2019re just supposed to invite her to tea.\u201d\n\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.18Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/1134888", "artist_names": "The

eternally\n\nSomeday we shall return\nTo this place upon the meadow\nWe'll walk out in the rain\nHear the birds above singing once again\n\nOh, you'll hold me in your arms\nAnd say once again you love me\nAnd if your love is true\nEverything will be just as wonderful\n\nYou'll hold me in your arms\nAnd say once again you love me\nAnd if your love is true\nEverything will be just as

forget all your troubles, forget all your cares\n[Chorus]\nSo go downtown\nThings will be great when you're downtown\nNo finer place for sure, downtown\nEverything's waiting for you\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't hang around and let your problems surround you\nThere are movie shows downtown\nMaybe you know some little places to go to\nWhere they never close downtown\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nJust listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova\nYou'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over\nHappy again\nThe lights are much brighter there\nYou can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares\n\n[Chorus]\nSo go downtown\nWhere all the lights are bright, downtown\nWaiting for you tonight, downtown\nYou're gonna be alright now, downtown\n\n[Instrumental Break w/ Backing Vocals]\nDowntown\nDowntown\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd you may find somebody kind to help and understand you\nSomeone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to\nGuide them along\nSo

He was invested with the dignity of priest, and, as such, he had the power to throw over persons or things the superstitious protection of the \"taboo.\"\n\nThe \"taboo,\" which is common to all the Polynesian races, has the primary effect of isolating the \"tabooed\" person and preventing the use of \"tabooed\" things. According to the Maori doctrine, anyone who laid sacrilegious hands on what had been declared \"taboo,\" would be punished with death by the insulted deity, and even if the god delayed the vindication of his power, the priests took care to accelerate his vengeance.\n\nBy the chiefs, the \"taboo\" is made a political engine, except in some cases, for domestic reasons. For instance, a native is tabooed for several days when his hair is cut; when he is tattooed; when he is building a canoe, or a house; when he is seriously ill, and when he is dead. If excessive consumption threatens to exterminate the fish of a river, or ruin the early crop of sweet potatoes, these things are put under the protection of the taboo. If a chief wishes to clear his house of hangers-on, he taboos it; if an English trader displeases him he is tabooed. His interdict has the effect of the old royal \"veto.\"\n\nIf an object is tabooed, no one can touch it with impunity. When a native is under the interdict, certain aliments are denied him for a prescribed period. If he is relieved, as regards the severe diet, his slaves feed him with the viands he is forbidden to touch with his hands; if he is poor and has no slaves, he has to take up the food with his mouth, like an animal.\n\nIn short, the most trifling acts of the Maories are directed and modified by this singular custom, the deity is brought into constant contact with their daily life. The taboo has the same weight as a law; or rather, the code of the Maories, indisputable and undisputed, is comprised in the frequent applications of the taboo.\nAs to the prisoners confined in the Ware-Atoua, it was an arbitrary taboo which had saved them from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, friends and partisans of Kai-Koumou, desisted at once on hearing their chief's voice, and protected the captives from the rest.\n\nGlenarvan cherished no illusive hopes as to his own fate; nothing but his death could atone for the murder of a chief, and among these people death was only the concluding act of a martyrdom of torture. Glenarvan, therefore, was fully prepared to pay the penalty of the righteous indignation that nerved his arm, but he hoped that the wrath of Kai-Koumou would not extend beyond himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could picture their agonies or measure their sufferings? Robert and Paganel had not been restored to them, but their fate was no doubtful matter. They were too surely the first victims of the frenzied natives. Even McNabbs, who was always sanguine, had abandoned hope. John Mangles was nearly frantic at the sight of Mary Grant's despair at being separated from her brother. Glenarvan pondered over the terrible request of Lady Helena, who preferred dying by his hand to submitting to torture and slavery. How was he to summon the terrible courage!\n\n\"And Mary? who has a right to strike her dead?\" thought John, whose heart was broken.\n\nEscape was clearly impossible. Ten warriors, armed to the teeth, kept watch at the door of Ware-Atoua.\n\nThe morning of February 13th arrived. No communication had taken place between the natives and the \"tabooed\" prisoners. A limited supply of provisions was in the house, which the unhappy inmates scarcely touched. Misery deadened the pangs of hunger. The day passed without change, and without hope; the funeral ceremonies of the dead chief would doubtless be the signal for their execution.\n\nAlthough Glenarvan did not conceal from himself the probability that Kai-Koumou had given up all idea of exchange, the Major still cherished a spark of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, as he reminded Glenarvan of the effect produced on the chief by the death of Kara-Tete\u2014\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou, in his heart, is very much obliged to you?\"\n\nBut even McNabbs' remarks failed to awaken hope in Glenarvan's mind. The next day passed without any appearance of preparation for their punishment; and this was the reason of the delay.\n\nThe Maories believe that for three days after death the soul inhabits the body, and therefore, for three times twenty-four hours, the corpse remains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed. Till February 15th the \"pah\" was deserted.\nJohn Mangles, hoisted on Wilson's shoulders, frequently reconnoitered the outer defences. Not a single native was visible; only the watchful sentinels relieving guard at the door of the Ware-Atoua.\n\nBut on the third day the huts opened; all the savages, men, women, and children, in all several hundred Maories, assembled in the \"pah,\" silent and calm.\n\nKai-Koumou came out of his house, and surrounded by the principal chiefs of his tribe, he took his stand on a mound some feet above the level, in the center of the enclosure. The crowd of natives formed in a half circle some distance off, in dead silence.\n\nAt a sign from Kai-Koumou, a warrior bent his steps toward Ware-Atoua.\n\"Remember,\" said Lady Helena to her husband. Glenarvan pressed her to his heart, and Mary Grant went closer to John Mangles, and said hurriedly:\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan cannot but think if a wife may claim death at her husband's hands, to escape a shameful life, a betrothed wife may claim death at the hands of her betrothed husband, to escape the same fate. John! at this last moment I ask you, have we not long been betrothed to each other in our secret hearts? May I rely on you, as Lady Helena relies on Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain in his despair. \"Ah! dear Mary\u2014\"\n\nThe mat was lifted, and the captives led to Kai-Koumou; the two women were resigned to their fate; the men dissembled their sufferings with superhuman effort.\n\nThey arrived in the presence of the Maori chief.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tete,\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did,\" answered Glenarvan.\n\n\"You die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" asked Glenarvan, with a beating heart.\n\n\"Oh! if our Tohonga's life was not more precious than yours!\" exclaimed Kai-Koumou, with a ferocious expression of regret.\n\nAt this moment there was a commotion among the natives. Glenarvan looked quickly around; the crowd made way, and a warrior appeared heated by running, and sinking with fatigue.\n\nKai-Koumou, as soon as he saw him, said in English, evidently for the benefit of the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the Pakekas?\"\n\"Yes,\" answered the Maori.\n\n\"You have seen the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I have seen him.\"\n\n\"Alive?\"\n\n\"Dead! English have shot him.\"\n\nIt was all over with Glenarvan and his companions.\n\n\"All!\" cried Kai-Koumou; \"you all die to-morrow at daybreak.\"\n\nPunishment fell on all indiscriminately. Lady Helena and Mary Grant were grateful to Heaven for the boon.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to Ware-Atoua. They were destined to attend the obsequies of the chief and the bloody rites that accompanied them. A guard of natives conducted them to the foot of an immense kauri, and then stood on guard without taking their eyes off the prisoners.\n\nThe three prescribed days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tete, and the soul of the dead warrior had finally departed; so the ceremonies commenced.\n\nThe body was laid on a small mound in the central enclosure. It was clothed in a rich dress, and wrapped in a magnificent flax mat. His head, adorned with feathers, was encircled with a crown of green leaves. His face, arms, and chest had been rubbed with oil, and did not show any sign of decay.\n\nThe parents and friends arrived at the foot of the mound, and at a certain moment, as if the leader of an orchestra were leading a funeral chant, there arose a great wail of tears, sighs, and sobs. They lamented the deceased with a plaintive rhythm and doleful cadence. The kinsmen beat their heads; the kinswomen tore their faces with their nails and lavished more blood than tears. But these demonstrations were not sufficient to propitiate the soul of the deceased, whose wrath might strike the survivors of his tribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, were anxious that he should have nothing to wish for in the other world. The wife of Kara-Tete was not to be parted from him; indeed, she would have refused to survive him. It was a custom, as well as a duty, and Maori history has no lack of such sacrifices.\n\nThis woman came on the scene; she was still young. Her disheveled hair flowed over her shoulders. Her sobs and cries filled the air. Incoherent words, regrets, sobs, broken phrases in which she extolled the virtues of the dead, alternated with her moans, and in a crowning paroxysm of sorrow, she threw herself at the foot of the mound and beat her head on the earth.\n\nThe Kai-Koumou drew near; suddenly the wretched victim rose; but a violent blow from a \"mere,\" a kind of club brandished by the chief, struck her to the ground; she fell senseless.\n\nHorrible yells followed; a hundred arms threatened the terror-stricken captives. But no one moved, for the funeral ceremonies were not yet over.\n\nThe wife of Kara-Tete had joined her husband. The two bodies lay stretched side by side. But in the future life, even the presence of his faithful companion was not enough. Who would attend on them in the realm of Noui-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them into the other world.\n\nSix unfortunate fellows were brought to the mound. They were attendants whom the pitiless usages of war had reduced to slavery. During the chief's lifetime they had borne the severest privations, and been subjected to all kinds of ill-usage; they had been scantily fed, and incessantly occupied like beasts of burden, and now, according to Maori ideas, they were to resume to all eternity this life of bondage.\n\nThese poor creatures appeared quite resigned to their destiny. They were not taken by surprise. Their unbound hands showed that they met their fate without resistance.\n\nTheir death was speedy and not aggravated by tedious suffering; torture was reserved for the authors of the murder, who, only twenty paces off, averted their eyes from the horrible scene which was to grow yet more horrible.\n\nSix blows of the mere, delivered by the hands of six powerful warriors, felled the victims in the midst of a sea of blood.\n\nThis was the signal for a fearful scene of cannibalism. The bodies of slaves are not protected by taboo like those of their masters. They belong to the tribe; they were a sort of small change thrown among the mourners, and the moment the sacrifice was over, the whole crowd, chiefs, warriors, old men, women, children, without distinction of age, or sex, fell upon the senseless remains with brutal appetite. Faster than a rapid pen could describe it, the bodies, still reeking, were dismembered, divided, cut up, not into morsels, but into crumbs. Of the two hundred Maories present everyone obtained a share. They fought, they struggled, they quarreled over the smallest fragment. The drops of hot blood splashed over these festive monsters, and the whole of this detestable crew groveled under a rain of blood. It was like the delirious fury of tigers fighting over their prey, or like a circus where the wild beasts devour the deer. This scene ended, a score of fires were lit at various points of the \"pah\"; the smell of charred flesh polluted the air; and but for the fearful tumult of the festival, but for the cries that emanated from these flesh-sated throats, the captives might have heard the bones crunching under the teeth of the cannibals.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with horror, tried to conceal this fearful scene from the eyes of the two poor ladies. They understood then what fate awaited them next day at dawn, and also with what cruel torture this death would be preceded. They were dumb with horror.\n\nThe funeral dances commenced. Strong liquors distilled from the \"piper excelsum\" animated the intoxication of the natives. They had nothing human left. It seemed possible that the \"taboo\" might be forgotten, and they might rush upon the prisoners, who were already terrified at their delirious gestures.\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had kept his own senses amidst the general delirium. He allowed an hour for this orgy of blood to attain its maximum and then cease, and the final scene of the obsequies was performed with the accustomed ceremonial.\n\nThe corpses of Kara-Tete and his wife were raised, the limbs were bent, and laid against the stomach according to the Maori usage; then came the funeral, not the final interment, but a burial until the moment when the earth had destroyed the flesh and nothing remained but the skeleton.\n\nThe place of \"oudoupa,\" or the tomb, had been chosen outside the fortress, about two miles off at the top of a low hill called Maunganamu, situated on the right bank of the lake, and to this spot the body was to be taken. Two palanquins of a very primitive kind, hand-barrows, in fact, were brought to the foot of the mound, and the corpses doubled up so that they were sitting rather than lying, and their garments kept in place by a band of hanes, were placed on them. Four warriors took up the litters on their shoulders, and the whole tribe, repeating their funeral chant, followed in procession to the place of sepulture.\nThe captives, still strictly guarded, saw the funeral cortege leave the inner inclosure of the \"pah\"; then the chants and cries grew fainter. For about half an hour the funeral procession remained out of sight, in the hollow valley, and then came in sight again winding up the mountain side; the distance gave a fantastic effect to the undulating movement of this long serpentine column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at an elevation of about 800 feet, on the summit of Maunganamu, where the burial place of Kara-Tete had been prepared. An ordinary Maori would have had nothing but a hole and a heap of earth. But a powerful and formidable chief destined to speedy deification, was honored with a tomb worthy of his exploits.\n\nThe \"oudoupa\" had been fenced round, and posts, surmounted with faces painted in red ochre, stood near the grave where the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the \"Waidoua,\" the spirit of the dead, lives on mortal food, as the body did in this life. Therefore, food was deposited in the inclosure as well as the arms and clothing of the deceased. Nothing was omitted for comfort. The husband and wife were laid side by side, then covered with earth and grass, after another series of laments.\n\nThen the procession wound slowly down the mountain, and henceforth none dare ascend the slope of Maunganamu on pain of death, for it was \"tabooed,\" like Tongariro, where lie the ashes of a chief killed by an earthquake in 1846.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

NISSIM BERNARD \u2014 OUTLINE OF THE STRANGE CHARACTER OF MOREL \u2014 M. DE CHARLUS DINES WITH THE VERDURINS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my fear lest the pleasure I found in this solitary excursion might weaken my memory of my grandmother, I sought to revive this by thinking of some great mental suffering that she had undergone; in response to my appeal that suffering tried to build itself in my heart, threw up vast pillars there; but my heart was doubtless too small for it, I had not the strength to bear so great a grief, my attention was distracted at the moment when it was approaching completion, and its arches collapsed before joining as, before they have perfected their curve, the waves of the sea totter and break\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, if only from my dreams when I was asleep, I might have learned that my grief for my grandmother\u2019s death was diminishing, for she appeared in them less crushed by the idea that I had formed of her non-existence. I saw her an invalid still, but on the road to recovery, I found her in better health. And if she made any allusion to what she had suffered, I stopped her mouth with my kisses and assured her that she was now permanently cured. I should have liked to call the sceptics to witness that death is indeed a malady from which one recovers. Only, I no longer found in my grandmother the rich spontaneity of old times. Her words were no more than a feeble, docile response, almost a mere echo of mine; she was nothing more than the reflexion of my own thoughts\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incapable as I still was of feeling any fresh physical desire, Albertine was beginning nevertheless to inspire in me a desire for happiness. Certain dreams of shared affection, always floating on the surface of our minds, ally themselves readily by a sort of affinity with the memory (provided that this has already become slightly vague) of a woman with whom we have taken our pleasure. This sentiment recalled to me aspects of Albertine\u2019s face, more gentle, less gay, quite different from those that would have been evoked by physical desire; and as it was also less pressing than that desire I would gladly have postponed its realisation until the following winter, without seeking to see Albertine again at Balbec, before her departure. But even in the midst of a grief that is still keen physical desire will revive. From my bed, where I was made to spend hours every day resting, I longed for Albertine to come and resume our former amusements. Do we not see, in the very room in which they have lost a child, its parents soon come together again to give the little angel a baby brother? I tried to distract my mind from this desire by going to the window to look at that day\u2019s sea. As in the former year, the seas, from one day to another, were rarely the same. Nor, however, did they at all resemble those of that first year, whether because we were now in spring with its storms, or because even if I had come down at the same time as before, the different, more changeable weather might have discouraged from visiting this coast certain seas, indolent, vaporous and fragile, which I had seen throughout long, scorching days, asleep upon the beach, their bluish bosoms, only, faintly stirring, with a soft palpitation, or, as was most probable, because my eyes, taught by Elstir to retain precisely those elements that before I had deliberately rejected, would now gaze for hours at what in the former year they had been incapable of seeing. The contrast that used then to strike me so forcibly between the country drives that I took with Mme. de Villeparisis and this proximity, fluid, inaccessible, mythological, of the eternal Ocean, no longer existed for me. And there were days now when, on the contrary, the sea itself seemed almost rural. On the days, few and far between, of really fine weather, the heat had traced upon the waters, as it might be across country, a dusty white track, at the end of which the pointed mast of a fishing-boat stood up like a village steeple. A tug, of which one could see only the funnel, was smoking in the distance like a factory amid the fields, while alone against the horizon a convex patch of white, sketched there doubtless by a sail but apparently a solid plastered surface, made one think of the sunlit wall of some isolated building, an hospital or a school. And the clouds and the wind, on days when these were added to the sun, completed if not the error of judgment, at any rate the illusion of the first glance, the suggestion that it aroused in the imagination. For the alternation of sharply defined patches of colour like those produced in the country by the proximity of different crops, the rough, yellow, almost muddy irregularities of the marine surface, the banks, the slopes that hid from sight a vessel upon which a crew of nimble sailors seemed to be reaping a harvest, all this upon stormy days made the ocean a thing as varied, as solid, as broken, as populous, as civilised as the earth with its carriage roads over which I used to travel, and was soon to be travelling again. And once, unable any longer to hold out against my desire, instead of going back to bed I put on my clothes and started off to Incarville, to find Albertine. I would ask her to come with me to Douville, where I would pay calls at F\u00e9terne upon Mme. de Cambremer and at la Raspeli\u00e8re upon Mme. Verdurin. Albertine would wait for me meanwhile upon the beach and we would return together after dark. I went to take the train on the local light railway, of which I had picked up, the time before, from Albertine and her friends all the nicknames current in the district, where it was known as theTwister because of its numberless windings, the Crawler because the train never seemed to move, the Transatlantic because of a horrible siren which it sounded to clear people off the line, the Decauville and the Funi, albeit there was nothing funicular about it but because it climbed the cliff, and, although not, strictly speaking, a Decauville, had a 60 centimetre gauge, the B. A. G. because it ran between Balbec and Grattevast via Angerville, the Tram and the T. S. N. because it was a branch of the Tramways of Southern Normandy. I took my seat in a compartment in which I was alone; it was a day of glorious sunshine, and stiflingly hot; I drew down the blue blind which shut off all but a single ray of sunlight. But immediately I beheld my grandmother, as she had appeared sitting in the train, on our leaving Paris for Balbec, when, in her sorrow at seeing me drink beer, she had preferred not to look, to shut her eyes and pretend to be asleep. I, who in my childhood had been unable to endure her anguish when my grandfather tasted brandy, I had inflicted this anguish upon her, not merely of seeing me accept, at the invitation of another, a drink which she regarded as bad for me, I had forced her to leave me free to swill it down to my heart\u2019s content, worse still, by my bursts of passion, my choking fits, I had forced her to help, to advise me to do so, with a supreme resignation of which I saw now in my memory the mute, despairing image, her eyes closed to shut out the sight. So vivid a memory had, like the stroke of a magic wand, restored the mood that I had been gradually outgrowing for some time past; what had I to do with Rosemond\u00e9 when my lips were wholly possessed by the desperate longing to kiss a dead woman, what had I to say to the Cambremers and Verdurins when my heart was beating so violently because at every moment there was being renewed in it the pain that my grandmother had suffered. I could not remain in the compartment. As soon as the train stopped at Maineville-la-Teinturiere, abandoning all my plans, I alighted. Maineville had of late acquired considerable importance and a reputation all its own, because a director of various casinos, a caterer in pleasure, had set up, just outside it, with a luxurious display of bad taste that could vie with that of any smart hotel, an establishment to which we shall return anon, and which was, to put it briefly, the first brothel for \u2018exclusive\u2019 people that it had occurred to anyone to build upon the coast of France. It was the only one. True, every port has its own, but intended for sailors only, and for lovers of the picturesque whom it amuses to see, next door to the primeval parish church, the bawd, hardly less ancient, venerable and moss-grown, standing outside her ill-famed door, waiting for the return of the fishing fleet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hurrying past the glittering house of \u2018pleasure,\u2019 insolently erected there despite the protests which the heads of families had addressed in vain to the mayor, I reached the cliff and followed its winding paths in the direction of Balbec. I heard, without responding to it, the appeal of the hawthorns. Neighbours, in humbler circumstances, of the blossoming apple trees, they found them very coarse, without denying the fresh complexion of the rosy-petalled daughters of those wealthy brewers of cider. They knew that, with a lesser dowry, they were more sought after, and were attractive enough by themselves in their tattered whiteness\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On my return, the hotel porter handed me a black-bordered letter in which the Marquis and the Marquise de Gonneville, the Vicomte and the Vicomtesse d\u2019Amfreville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Berneville, the Marquis and the Marquise de Graincourt, the Comte d\u2019Amenoncourt, the Comtesse de Maineville, the Comte and the Comtesse de Franquetot, the Comtesse de Chaverny n\u00e9e d\u2019Aigleville, begged to announce, and from which I understood at length why it had been sent to me when I caught sight of the names of the Marquise de Cambremer n\u00e9e du Mesnil la Guichard, the Marquis and the Marquise de Cambremer, and saw that the deceased, a cousin of the Cambremers, was named El\u00e9onore-Euphrasie-Humbertine de Cambremer, Comtesse de Criquetot. In the whole extent of this provincial family, the enumeration of which filled the closely printed lines, not a single commoner, and on the other hand not a single title that one knew, but the entire muster-roll of the nobles of the region who made their names \u2014 those of all the interesting spots in the neighbourhood \u2014 ring out their joyous endings in ville, in court, sometimes on a duller note (in tot). Garbed in the roof-tiles of their castle or in the roughcast of their parish church, their nodding heads barely reaching above the vault of the nave or banqueting hall, and then only to cap themselves with the Norman lantern or the dovecot of the pepperpot turret, they gave the impression of having sounded the rallying call to all the charming villages straggling or scattered over a radius of fifty leagues, and to have paraded them in massed formation, without one absentee, one intruder, on the compact, rectangular draught-board of the aristocratic letter edged with black\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother had gone upstairs to her room, meditating the phrase of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cI see nothing of the people who seek to distract me from you; the truth of the matter is that they are seeking to prevent me from thinking of you, and that annoys me.\u201d\u2014 because the chief magistrate had told her that she ought to find some distraction. To me he whispered: \u201cThat\u2019s the Princesse de Parme!\u201d My fears were dispelled when I saw that the woman whom the magistrate pointed out to me bore not the slightest resemblance to Her Royal Highness. But as she had engaged a room in which to spend the night after paying a visit to Mme. de Luxembourg, the report of her coming had the effect upon many people of making them take each newcomer for the Princesse de Parme \u2014 and upon me of making me go and shut myself up in my attic\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no wish to remain there by myself. It was barely four o\u2019clock. I asked Fran\u00e7oise to go and find Albertine, so that she might spend the rest of the afternoon with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be untrue, I think, to say that there were already symptoms of that painful and perpetual mistrust which Albertine was to inspire in me, not to mention the special character, emphatically Gomorrhan, which that mistrust was to assume. Certainly, even that afternoon \u2014 but this was not the first time \u2014 I grew anxious as I was kept waiting. Fran\u00e7oise, once she had started, stayed away so long that I began to despair. I had not lighted the lamp. The daylight had almost gone. The wind was making the flag over the casino flap. And, fainter still in the silence of the beach over which the tide was rising, and like a voice rendering and enhancing the troubling emptiness of this restless, unnatural hour, a little barrel organ that had stopped outside the hotel was playing Viennese waltzes. At length Fran\u00e7oise arrived, but unaccompanied. \u201cI have been as quick as I could but she wouldn\u2019t come because she didn\u2019t think she was looking smart enough. If she was five minutes painting herself and powdering herself, she was an hour by the clock. You\u2019ll be having a regular scentshop in here. She\u2019s coming, she stayed behind to tidy herself at the glass. I thought I should find her here.\u201d There was still a long time to wait before Albertine appeared. But the gaiety, the charm that she shewed on this occasion dispelled my sorrow. She informed me (in contradiction of what she had said the other day) that she would be staying for the whole season and asked me whether we could not arrange, as in the former year, to meet daily. I told her that at the moment I was too melancholy and that I would rather send for her from time to time at the last moment, as I did in Paris. \u201cIf ever you\u2019re feeling worried, or feel that you want me, do not hesitate,\u201d she told me, \u201cto send for me, I shall come immediately, and if you are not afraid of its creating a scandal in the hotel, I shall stay as long as you like.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise, in bringing her to me, had assumed the joyous air she wore whenever she had gone out of her way to please me and had been successful. But Albertine herself contributed nothing to her joy, and the very next day Fran\u00e7oise was to greet me with the profound observation: \u201cMonsieur ought not to see that young lady. I know quite well the sort she is, she\u2019ll land you in trouble.\u201d As I escorted Albertine to the door I saw in the lighted dining-room the Princesse de Parme. I merely gave her a glance, taking care not to be seen. But I must say that I found a certain grandeur in the royal politeness which had made me smile at the Guermantes\u2019. It is a fundamental rule that sovereign princes are at home wherever they are, and this rule is conventionally expressed in obsolete and useless customs such as that which requires the host to carry his hat in his hand, in his own house, to shew that he is not in his own home but in the Prince\u2019s. Now the Princesse de Parme may not have formulated this idea to herself, but she was so imbued with it that all her actions, spontaneously invented to suit the circumstances, pointed to it. When she rose from table she handed a lavish tip to Aim\u00e9, as though he had been there solely for her and she were rewarding, before leaving a country house, a footman who had been detailed to wait upon her. Nor did she stop at the tip, but with a gracious smile bestowed on him a few friendly, flattering words, with a store of which her mother had provided her. Another moment, and she would have told him that, just as the hotel was perfectly managed, so Normandy was a garden of roses and that she preferred France to any other country in the world. Another coin slipped from the Princess\u2019s fingers, for the wine waiter, for whom she had sent and to whom she made a point of expressing her satisfaction like a general after an inspection. The lift-boy had come up at that moment with a message for her; he too received a little speech, a smile and a tip, all this interspersed with encouraging and humble words intended to prove to them that she was only one of themselves. As Aim\u00e9, the wine waiter, the lift-boy and the rest felt that it would be impolite not to grin from ear to ear at a person who smiled at them, she was presently surrounded by a cluster of servants with whom she chatted kindly; such ways being unfamiliar in smart hotels, the people who passed by, not knowing who she was, thought they beheld a permanent resident at Balbec, who, because of her humble origin, or for professional reasons (she was perhaps the wife of an agent for champagne) was less different from the domestics than the really smart visitors. As for me, I thought of the palace at Parma, of the counsels, partly religious, partly political, given to this Princess, who behaved towards the lower orders as though she had been obliged to conciliate them in order to reign over them one day. All the more, as if she were already reigning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went upstairs again to my room, but I was not alone there. I could hear some one softly playing Schumann. No doubt it happens at times that people, even those whom we love best, become saturated with the melancholy or irritation that emanates from us. There is nevertheless an inanimate object which is capable of a power of exasperation to which no human being will ever attain: to wit, a piano\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had made me take a note of the dates on which she would be going away for a few days to visit various girl friends, and had made me write down their addresses as well, in case I should want her on one of those evenings, for none of them lived very far away. This meant that when I tried to find her, going from one girl to another, she became more and more entwined in ropes of flowers. I must confess that many of her friends \u2014 I was not yet in love with her \u2014 gave me, at one watering-place or another, moments of pleasure. These obliging young comrades did not seem to me to be very many. But recently I have thought it over, their names have recurred to me. I counted that, in that one season, a dozen conferred on me their ephemeral favours. A name came back to me later, which made thirteen. I then, with almost a child\u2019s delight in cruelty, dwelt upon that number. Alas, I realised that I had forgotten the first of them all, Albertine who no longer existed and who made the fourteenth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had, to resume the thread of my narrative, written down the names and addresses of the girls with whom I should find her upon the days when she was not to be at Incarville, but privately had decided that I would devote those days rather to calling upon Mme. Verdurin. In any case, our desire for different women varies in intensity. One evening we cannot bear to let one out of our sight who, after that, for the next month or two, will never enter our mind. Then there is the law of change, for a study of which this is not the place, under which, after an over-exertion of the flesh, the woman whose image haunts our momentary senility is one to whom we would barely give more than a kiss on the brow. As for Albertine, I saw her seldom, and only upon the very infrequent evenings when I felt that I could not live without her. If this desire seized me when she was too far from Balbec for Fran\u00e7oise to be able to go and fetch her, I used to send the lift-boy to Egreville, to La Sogne, to Saint-Frichoux, asking him to finish his work a little earlier than usual. He would come into my room, but would leave the door open for, albeit he was conscientious at his \u2018job\u2019 which was pretty hard, consisting in endless cleanings from five o\u2019clock in the morning, he could never bring himself to make the effort to shut a door, and, if one were to remark to him that it was open, would turn back and, summoning up all his strength, give it a gentle push. With the democratic pride that marked him, a pride to which, in more liberal careers, the members of a profession that is at all numerous never attain, barristers, doctors and men of letters speaking simply of a \u2018brother\u2019 barrister, doctor or man of letters, he, employing, and rightly, a term that is confined to close corporations like the Academy, would say to me in speaking of a page who was in charge of the lift upon alternate days: \u201cI shall get my colleagueto take my place.\u201d This pride did not prevent him from accepting, with a view to increasing what he called his \u2018salary,\u2019 remuneration for his errands, a fact which had made Fran\u00e7oise take a dislike to him: \u201cYes, the first time you see him you would give him the sacrament without confession, but there are days when his tongue is as smooth as a prison door. It\u2019s your money he\u2019s after.\u201d This was the category in which she had so often in-cluded Eulalie, and in which, alas (when I think of all the trouble that was one day to come of it), she already placed Albertine, because she saw me often asking Mamma, on behalf of my impecunious friend, for trinkets and other little presents, which Fran\u00e7oise held to be inexcusable because Mme. Bontemps had only a general servant. A moment later the lift-boy, having removed what I should have called his livery and he called his tunic, appeared wearing a straw hat, carrying a cane, holding himself stiffly erect, for his mother had warned him never to adopt the \u2018working-class\u2019 or \u2018pageboy\u2019 style. Just as, thanks to books, all knowledge is open to a work-ing man, who ceases to be such when he has finished his work, so, thanks to a \u2018boater\u2019 hat and a pair of gloves, elegance became accessible to the lift-boy who, having ceased for the evening to take the visitors upstairs, imagined himself, like a young surgeon who has taken off his overall, or Serjeant Saint-Loup out of uniform, a typical young man about town. He was not for that matter lacking in ambition, or in talent either in manipu-lating his machine and not bringing you to a standstill between two floors. But his vocabulary was defective. I credited him with ambition because he said in speaking of the porter, under whom he served: \u201cMy porter,\u201d in the same tone in which a man who owned what the page would have called a \u2018private mansion\u2019 in Paris would have referred to his footman. As for the lift-boy\u2019s vocabulary, it is curious that anybody who heard people, fifty times a day, calling for the \u2018lift,\u2019 should never himself call it anything but a \u2018left.\u2019 There were certain things about this boy that were extremely annoying: whatever I might be saying to him he would interrupt with a phrase: \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d which seemed either to imply that my remark was so obvious that anybody would have thought of it, or else to take all the credit for it to himself, as though it were he that was drawing my attention to the subject. \u201cI should say so!\u201d or \u201cI say!\u201d exclaimed with the utmost emphasis, issued from his lips every other minute, over matters to which he had never given a thought, a trick which irritated me so much that I immediately began to say the opposite to shew him that he knew nothing about it. But to my second assertion, albeit it was incompatible with the first, he replied none the less stoutly: \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cI say!\u201d as though these words were inevitable. I found it difficult, also, to forgive him the trick of employing certain terms proper to his calling, which would therefore have sounded perfectly correct in their literal sense, in a figurative sense only, which gave them an air of feeble witticism, for instance the verb to pedal. He never used it when he had gone anywhere on his bicycle. But if, on foot, he had hurried to arrive somewhere in time, then, to indicate that he had walked fast, he would exclaim: \u201cI should say I didn\u2019t half pedal!\u201d The lift-boy was on the small side, clumsily built and by no means good looking. This did not prevent him, whenever one spoke to him of some tall, slim, handsome young man, from saying: \u201cOh, yes, I know, a fellow who is just my height.\u201d And one day when I was expecting him to bring me the answer to a message, hearing somebody come upstairs, I had in my impatience opened the door of my room and caught sight of a page as beautiful as Endymion, with incredibly perfect features, who was bringing a message to a lady whom I did not know. When the lift-boy returned, in telling him how impatiently I had waited for the answer, I mentioned to him that I had thought I heard him come upstairs but that it had turned out to be a page from the H\u00f4tel de Normandie. \u201cOh, yes, I know,\u201d he said, \u201cthey have only the one, a boy about my build. He\u2019s so like me in face, too, that we\u2019re always being mistaken; anybody would think he was my brother.\u201d Lastly, he always wanted to appear to have understood you perfectly from the first second, which meant that as soon as you asked him to do anything he would say: \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand all that,\u201d with a precision and a tone of intelligence which for some time deceived me; but other people, as we get to know them, are like a metal dipped in an acid bath, and we see them gradually lose their good qualities (and their bad qualities too, at times). Before giving him my instructions, I saw that he had left the door open; I pointed this out to him, I was afraid that people might hear us; he acceded to my request and returned, having reduced the gap. \u201cAnything to oblige. But there\u2019s nobody on this floor except us two.\u201d Immediately I heard one, then a second, then a third person go by. This annoyed me partly because of the risk of my being overheard, but more still because I could see that it did not in the least surprise him and was a perfectly normal occurrence. \u201cYes, that\u2019ll be the maid next door going for her things. Oh, that\u2019s of no importance, it\u2019s the bottler putting away his keys. No, no, it\u2019s nothing, you can say what you want, it\u2019s my colleague just going on duty.\u201d Then, as the reasons that all these people had for passing did not diminish my dislike of the thought that they might overhear me, at a formal order from me he went, not to shut the door, which was beyond the strength of this bicyclist who longed for a \u2018motor,\u2019 but to push it a little closer to. \u201cNow we shall be quite quiet.\u201d So quiet were we that an American lady burst in and withdrew with apologies for having mistaken the number of her room. \u201cYou are going to bring this young lady back with you,\u201d I told him, after first going and banging the door with all my might (which brought in another page to see whether a window had been left open). \u201cYou remember the name: Mlle. Albertine Simonet. Anyhow, it\u2019s on the envelope. You need only say to her that it\u2019s from me. She will be delighted to come,\u201d I added, to encourage him and preserve a scrap of my own self-esteem. \u201cI should say so!\u201d \u201cNot at all, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that she will be glad to come. It\u2019s a great nuisance getting here from Berneville.\u201d \u201cI understand!\u201d \u201cYou will tell her to come with you.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, I understand perfectly,\u201d he replied, in that sharp, precise tone which had long ceased to make a \u2018good impression\u2019 upon me because I knew that it was almost mechanical and covered with its apparent clearness plenty of uncertainty and stupidity. \u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t any too much time,\u201d said the lift-boy, who, carrying to extremes the grammatical rule that forbids the repetition of personal pronouns before coordinate verbs, omitted the pronoun altogether. \u201cCan go there all right. Leave was stopped this afternoon, because there was a dinner for twenty at luncheon. And it was my turn off duty to-day. So it\u2019s all right if I go out a bit this evening. Take my bike with me. Get there in no time.\u201d And an hour later he reappeared and said: \u201cMonsieur\u2019s had to wait, but the young lady\u2019s come with me. She\u2019s down below.\u201d \u201cOh, thanks very much; the porter won\u2019t be cross with me?\u201d \u201cMonsieur Paul? Doesn\u2019t even know where I\u2019ve been. The head of the door himself can\u2019t say a word.\u201d But once, after I had told him: \u201cYou absolutely must bring her back with you,\u201d he reported to me with a smile: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her. She\u2019s not there. Couldn\u2019t wait any longer; was afraid of getting it like my colleague who was \u2018missed from the hotel\u201d (for the lift-boy, who used the word \u2018rejoin\u2019 of a profession which one joined for the first time, \u201cI should like to rejoin the post-office,\u201d to make up for this, or to mitigate the calamity, were his own career at stake, or to insinuate it more delicately and treacherously were the victim some one else, elided the prefix and said: \u201cI know he\u2019s been \u2018missed\u201d). It was not with any evil intent that he smiled, but from sheer timidity. He thought that he was diminishing the magnitude of his crime by making a joke of it. In the same way, if he had said to me: \u201cYou know, I couldn\u2019t find her,\u201d this did not mean that he really thought that I knew it already. On the contrary, he was all too certain that I did not know it, and, what was more, was afraid to tell me. And so he said \u2018you know\u2019 to ward off the terror which menaced him as he uttered the words that were to bring me the knowledge. We ought never to lose our tempers with people who, when we find fault with them, begin to titter. They do so not because they are laughing at us, but because they are trembling lest we should be angry. Let us shew all pity and tenderness to those who laugh. For all the world like a stroke, the lift-boy\u2019s anxiety had wrought in him not merely an apoplectic flush but an alteration in his speech which had suddenly become familiar. He wound up by telling me that Albertine was not at Egreville, that she would not be coming back there before nine o\u2019clock, and that if betimes (which meant, by chance) she came back earlier, my message would be given her, and in any case she would be with me before one o\u2019clock in the morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Translator\u2019s note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume I ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not this evening, however, that my cruel mistrust began to take solid form. No, to make no mystery about it, although the incident did not occur until some weeks later, it arose out of a remark made by Cottard. Albertine and her friends had insisted that day upon dragging me to the casino at Incarville where, as luck would have it, I should not have joined them (having intended to go and see Mme. Verdurin who had invited me again and again), had I not been held up at Incarville itself by a breakdown of the tram which it would take a considerable time to repair. As I strolled up and down waiting for the men to finish working at it, I found myself all of a sudden face to face with Doctor Cottard, who had come to Incarville to see a patient. I almost hesitated to greet him as he had not answered any of my letters. But friendship does not express itself in the same way in different people. Not having been brought up to observe the same fixed rules of behaviour as well-bred people, Cottard was full of good intentions of which one knew nothing, even denying their existence, until the day when he had an opportunity of displaying them. He apologised, had indeed received my letters, had reported my whereabouts to the Verdurins who were most anxious to see me and whom he urged me to go and see. He even proposed to take me to them there and then, for he was waiting for the little local train to take him back there for dinner. As I hesitated and he had still some time before his train ( for there was bound to be still a considerable delay), I made him come with me to the little casino, one of those that had struck me as being so gloomy on the evening of my first arrival, now filled with the tumult of the girls, who, in the absence of male partners, were dancing together. Andr\u00e9e came sliding along the floor towards me; I was meaning to go off with Cottard in a moment to the Verdurins\u2019, when I definitely declined his offer, seized by an irresistible desire to stay with Albertine. The fact was, I had just heard her laugh. And her laugh at once suggested the rosy flesh, the fragrant portals between which it had just made its way, seeming also, as strong, sensual and revealing as the scent of geraniums, to carry with it some microscopic particles of their substance, irritant and secret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the girls, a stranger to me, sat down at the piano, and Andr\u00e9e invited Albertine to waltz with her. Happy in the thought that I was going to remain in this little casino with these girls, I remarked to Cottard how well they danced together. But he, taking the professional point of view of a doctor and with an ill-breeding which overlooked the fact that they were my friends, although he must have seen me shaking hands with them, replied: \u201cYes, but parents are very rash to allow their daughters to form such habits. I should certainly never let mine come here. Are they nice-looking, though? I can\u2019t see their faces. There now, look,\u201d he went on, pointing to Albertine and Andr\u00e9e who were waltzing slowly, tightly clasped together, \u201cI have left my glasses behind and I don\u2019t see very well, but they are certainly keenly roused. It is not sufficiently known that women derive most excitement from their breasts. And theirs, as you see, are completely touching.\u201d And indeed the contact had been unbroken between the breasts of Andr\u00e9e and of Albertine. I do not know whether they heard or guessed Cottard\u2019s observation, but they gently broke the contact while continuing to waltz. At that moment Andr\u00e9e said something to Albertine, who laughed, the same deep and penetrating laugh that I had heard before. But all that it wafted to me this time was a feeling of pain; Albertine appeared to be revealing by it, to be making Andr\u00e9e share some exquisite, secret thrill. It rang out like the first or the last strains of a ball to which one has not been invited. I left the place with Cottard, distracted by his conversation, thinking only at odd moments of the scene I had just witnessed. This does not mean that Cottard\u2019s conversation was interesting. It had indeed, at that moment, become bitter, for we had just seen Doctor du Boulbon go past without noticing us. He had come down to spend some time on the other side of Balbec bay, where he was greatly in demand. Now, albeit Cottard was in the habit of declaring that he did no professional work during the holidays, he had hoped to build up a select practice along the coast, a hope which du Boulbon\u2019s presence there doomed to disappointment. Certainly, the Balbec doctor could not stand in Cottard\u2019s way. He was merely a thoroughly conscientious doctor who knew everything, and to whom you could not mention the slightest irritation of the skin without his immediately prescribing, in a complicated formula, the ointment, lotion or liniment that would put you right. As Marie Gineste used to say, in her charming speech, he knew how to \u2018charm\u2019 cuts and sores. But he was in no way eminent. He had indeed caused Cottard some slight annoyance. The latter, now that he was anxious to exchange his Chair for that of Therapeutics, had begun to specialise in toxic actions. These, a perilous innovation in medicine, give an excuse for changing the labels in the chemists\u2019 shops, where every preparation is declared to be in no way toxic, unlike its substitutes, and indeed to be disintoxicant. It is the fashionable cry; at the most there may survive below in illegible lettering, like the faint trace of an older fashion, the assurance that the preparation has been carefully disinfected. Toxic actions serve also to reassure the patient, who learns with joy that his paralysis is merely a toxic disturbance. Now, a Grand Duke who had come for a few days to Balbec and whose eye was extremely swollen had sent for Cottard who, in return for a wad of hundred-franc notes (the Professor refused to see anyone for less), had put down the inflammation to a toxic condition and prescribed a disintoxicant treatment. As the swelling did not go down, the Grand Duke fell back upon the general practitioner of Balbec, who in five minutes had removed a speck of dust. The following day, the swelling had gone. A celebrated specialist in nervous diseases was, however, a more dangerous rival. He was a rubicund, jovial person, since, for one thing, the constant society of nervous wrecks did not prevent him from enjoying excellent health, but also so as to reassure his patients by the hearty merriment of his \u2018Good morning\u2019 and \u2018Good-bye,\u2019 while quite ready to lend the strength of his muscular arms to fastening them in strait-waistcoats later on. Nevertheless, whenever you spoke to him at a party, whether of politics or of literature, he would listen to you with a kindly attention, as though he were saying: \u201cWhat is it all about?\u201d without at once giving an opinion, as though it were a matter for consultation. But anyhow he, whatever his talent might be, was a specialist. And so the whole of Cottard\u2019s rage was heaped upon du Boulbon. But I soon bade good-bye to the Verdurins\u2019 professional friend, and returned to Balbec, after promising him that I would pay them a visit before long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mischief that his remarks about Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had done me was extreme, but its worst effects were not immediately felt by me, as happens with those forms of poisoning which begin to act only after a certain time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine, on the night after the lift-boy had gone in search of her, did not appear, notwithstanding his assurances. Certainly, personal charm is a less frequent cause of love than a speech such as: \u201cNo, this evening I shall not be free.\u201d We barely notice this speech if we are with friends; we are gay all the evening, a certain image never enters our mind; during those hours it remains dipped in the necessary solution; when we return home we find the plate developed and perfectly clear. We become aware that life is no longer the life which we would have surrendered for a trifle the day before, because, even if we continue not to fear death, we no longer dare think of a parting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From, however, not one o\u2019clock in the morning (the limit fixed by the lift-boy), but three o\u2019clock, I no longer felt as in former times the anguish of seeing the chance of her coming diminish. The certainty that she would not now come brought me a complete, refreshing calm; this night was simply a night like all the rest during which I did not see her, such was the idea from which I started. After which, the thought that I should see her in the morning, or some other day, outlining itself upon the blank which I submissively accepted, became pleasant. Sometimes, during these nights of waiting, our anguish is due to a drug which we have taken. The sufferer, misinterpreting his own symptoms, thinks that he is anxious about the woman who fails to appear. Love is engendered in these cases, as are certain nervous maladies, by the inaccurate explanation of a state of discomfort. An explanation which it is useless to correct, at any rate so far as love is concerned, a sentiment which (whatever its cause) is invariably in error\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next day, when Albertine wrote to me that she had only just got back to Epreville, and so had not received my note in time, and was coming, if she might, to see me that evening, behind the words of her letter, as behind those that she had said to me once over the telephone, I thought I could detect the presence of pleasures, of people whom she had preferred to me. Once again, I was stirred from head to foot by the painful longing to know what she could have been doing, by the latent love which we always carry within us; I almost thought for a moment that it was going to attach me to Albertine, but it confined itself to a stationary throbbing, the last echo of which died away without the machine\u2019s having been set in motion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had failed during my first visit to Balbec \u2014 and perhaps, for that matter, Andr\u00e9e had failed equally \u2014 to understand Albertine\u2019s character. I had put it down as frivolous, but had not known whether our combined supplications might not succeed in keeping her with us and making her forego a garden-party, a donkey ride, a picnic. During my second visit to Balbec, I began to suspect that this frivolity was only for show, the garden-party a mere screen, if not an invention. She shewed herself in various colours in the following incident (by which I mean the incident as seen by me, from my side of the glass which was by no means transparent, and without my having any means of determining what reality there was on the other side). Albertine was making me the most passionate protestations of affection. She looked at the time because she had to go and call upon a lady who was at home, it appeared, every afternoon at five o\u2019clock, at Infreville. Tormented by suspicion, and feeling at the same time far from well, I asked Albertine, I implored her to remain with me. It was impossible (and indeed she could wait only five minutes longer) because it would annoy the lady who was far from hospitable, highly susceptible and, said Albertine, a perfect nuisance. \u201cBut one can easily cut a call.\u201d \u201cNo, my aunt has always told me that the chief thing is politeness.\u201d \u201cBut I have so often seen you being impolite.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing, the lady would be angry with me and would say nasty things about me to my aunt. I\u2019m pretty well in her bad books already. She expects me to go and see her.\u201d \u201cBut if she\u2019s at home every day?\u201d Here Albertine, feeling that she was caught, changed her line of argument. \u201cSo she is at home every day. But to-day I\u2019ve made arrangements to meet some other girls there. It will be less boring that way.\u201d \u201cSo then, Albertine, you prefer this lady and your friends to me, since, rather than miss paying an admittedly boring call, you prefer to leave me here alone, sick and wretched?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care if it is boring. I\u2019m going for their sake. I shall bring them home in my trap. Otherwise they won\u2019t have any way of getting back.\u201d I pointed out to Albertine that there were trains from Infreville up to ten o\u2019clock at night. \u201cQuite true, but don\u2019t you see, it is possible that we may be asked to stay to dinner. She is very hospitable.\u201d \u201cVery well then, you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI should only make my aunt angry.\u201d \u201cBesides, you can dine with her and catch the ten o\u2019clock train.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s cutting it rather fine.\u201d \u201cThen I can never go and dine in town and come back by train. But listen, Albertine. We are going to do something quite simple, I feel that^the fresh air will do me good; since you can\u2019t give up your lady, I am going to come with you to Infreville. Don\u2019t be alarmed, I shan\u2019t go as far as the Tour Elisabeth\u201d (the lady\u2019s villa), \u201cI shall see neither the lady nor your friends.\u201d Albertine started as though she had received a violent blow. For a moment, she was unable to speak. She explained that the sea bathing was not doing her any good. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to come with you?\u201d \u201cHow can you say such a thing, you know there\u2019s nothing I enjoy more than going out with you.\u201d A sudden change of tactics had occurred. \u201cSince we are going for a drive together,\u201d she said to me, \u201cwhy not go out in the other direction, we might dine together. It would be so nice. After all, that side of Balbec is much the prettier. I\u2019m getting sick of Infreville and all those little spinach-bed places.\u201d \u201cBut your aunt\u2019s friend will be annoyed if you don\u2019t go and see her.\u201d \u201cVery well, let her be.\u201d \u201cNo, it is wrong to annoy people.\u201d \u201cBut she won\u2019t even notice that I\u2019m not there, she has people every day; I can go to-morrow, the next day, next week, the week after, it\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d \u201cAnd what about your friends?\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ve cut me often enough. It\u2019s my turn now.\u201d \u201cBut from the side you suggest there\u2019s no train back after nine.\u201d \u201cWell, what\u2019s the matter with that? Nine will do perfectly. Besides, one need never think about getting back. We can always find a cart, a bike, if the worse comes to the worst, we have legs.\u201d \u201cWe can always find, Albertine, how you go on! Out Infreville way, where the villages run into one another, well and good. But the other way, it\u2019s a very different matter.\u201d \u201cThat way too. I promise to bring you back safe and sound.\u201d I felt that Albertine was giving up for my sake some plan arranged beforehand of which she refused to tell me, and that there was some one else who would be as unhappy as I was. Seeing that what she had intended to do was out of the question, since I insisted upon accompanying her, she gave it up altogether. She knew that the loss was not irremediable. For, like all women who have a number of irons in the fire, she had one resource that never failed: suspicion and jealousy. Of course she did not seek to arouse them, quite the contrary. But lovers are so suspicious that they instantly scent out falsehood. With the result that Albertine, being no better than anyone else, knew by experience (without for a moment imagining that she owed her experience to jealousy) that she could always be certain of meeting people again after she had failed to keep an appointment. The stranger whom she was deserting for me would be hurt, would love her all the more for that (though Albertine did not know that this was the reason), and, so as not to prolong the agony, would return to her of his own accord, as I should have done. But I had no desire either to give pain to another, or to tire myself, or to enter upon the terrible course of investigation, of multiform, unending vigilance. \u201cNo, Albertine, I do not wish to spoil your pleasure, go to your lady at Infreville, or rather to the person you really mean to see, it is all the same to me. The real reason why I am not coming with you is that you do not wish it, the outing you would be taking with me is not the one you meant to take, which is proved by your having contradicted yourself at least five times without noticing it.\u201d Poor Albertine was afraid that her contradictions, which she had not noticed, had been more serious than they were. Not knowing exactly what fibs she had told me: \u201cIt is quite on the cards that I did contradict myself. The sea air makes me lose my head altogether. I\u2019m always calling things by the wrong names.\u201d And (what proved to me that she would not, now, require many tender affirmations to make me believe her) I felt a stab in my heart as I listened to this admission of what I had but faintly imagined. \u201cVery well, that\u2019s settled, I\u2019m off,\u201d she said in a tragic tone, not without looking at the time to see whether she was making herself late for the other person, now that I had provided her with an excuse for not spending the evening with myself. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad of you. I alter all my plans to spend a nice, long evening with you, and it\u2019s you that won\u2019t have it, and you accuse me of telling lies. I\u2019ve never known you to be so cruel. The sea shall be my tomb. I will never see you any more.\u201d (My heart leaped at these words, albeit I was certain that she would come again next day, as she did.) \u201cI shall drown myself, I shall throw myself into the water.\u201d \u201cLike Sappho.\u201d \u201cThere you go, insulting me again. You suspect not only what I say but what I do.\u201d \u201cBut, my lamb, I didn\u2019t mean anything, I swear to you, you know Sappho flung herself into the sea.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, you have no faith in me.\u201d She saw that it was twenty minutes to the hour by the clock; she was afraid of missing her appointment, and choosing the shortest form of farewell (for which as it happened she apologised by coming to see me again next day, the other person presumably not being free then), she dashed from the room, crying: \u201cGood-bye for ever,\u201d in a heartbroken tone. And perhaps she was heartbroken. For knowing what she was about at that moment better than I, being at the same time more strict and more indulgent towards herself than I was towards her, she may all the same have had a fear that I might refuse to see her again after the way in which she had left me. And I believe that she was attached to me, so much so that the other person was more jealous than I was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some days later, at Balbec, while we were in the ballroom of the casino, there entered Bloch\u2019s sister and cousin, who had both turned out quite pretty, but whom I refrained from greeting on account of my girl friends, because the younger one, the cousin, was notoriously living with the actress whose acquaintance she had made during my first visit. Andr\u00e9e, at a murmured allusion to this scandal, said to me: \u201cOh! About that sort of thing I\u2019m like Albertine; there\u2019s nothing we both loathe so much as that sort of thing.\u201d As for Albertine, on sitting down to talk to me upon the sofa, she had turned her back on the disreputable pair. I had noticed, however, that, before she changed her position, at the moment when Mlle. Bloch and her cousin appeared, my friend\u2019s eyes had flashed with that sudden, close attention which now and again imparted to the face of this frivolous girl a serious, indeed a grave air, and left her pensive afterwards. But Albertine had at once turned towards myself a gaze which nevertheless remained singularly fixed and meditative. Mlle. Bloch and her cousin having finally left the room after laughing and shouting in a loud and vulgar manner, I asked Albertine whether the little fair one (the one who was so intimate with the actress) was not the girl who had won the prize the day before in the procession of flowers. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cis one of them fair? I must confess they don\u2019t interest me particularly, I have never looked at them. Is one of them fair?\u201d she asked her three girl friends with a detached air of inquiry. When applied to people whom Albertine passed every day on the front, this ignorance seemed to me too profound to be genuine. \u201cThey didn\u2019t appear to be looking at us much either,\u201d I said to Albertine, perhaps (on the assumption, which I did not however consciously form, that Albertine loved her own sex), to free her from any regret by pointing out to her that she had not attracted the attention of these girls and that, generally speaking, it is not customary even for the most vicious of women to take an interest in girls whom they do not know. \u201cThey weren\u2019t looking at us!\u201d was Albertine\u2019s astonished reply. \u201cWhy, they did nothing else the whole time.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t possibly tell,\u201d I said to her, \u201cyou had your back to them.\u201d \u201cVery well, and what about that?\u201d she replied, pointing out to me, set in the wall in front of us, a large mirror which I had not noticed and upon which I now realised that my friend, while talking to me, had never ceased to fix her troubled, preoccupied eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ever since the day when Cottard had accompanied me into the little casino at Incarville, albeit I did not share the opinion that he had expressed, Albertine had seemed to me different; the sight of her made me lose my temper. I myself had changed, quite as much as she had changed in my eyes. I had ceased to bear her any good will; to her face, behind her back when there was a chance of my words being repeated to her, I spoke of her in the most insulting language. There were, however, intervals of calmer feeling. One day I learned that Albertine and Andr\u00e9e had both accepted an invitation to Elstir\u2019s. Feeling certain that this was in order that they might, on the return journey, amuse themselves like schoolgirls on holiday by imitating the manners of fast young women, and in so doing find an unmaidenly pleasure the thought of which wrung my heart, without announcing my intention, to embarrass them and to deprive Albertine of the pleasure on which she was reckoning, I paid an unexpected call at his studio. But I found only Andr\u00e9e there. Albertine had chosen another day when her aunt was to go there with her. Then I said to myself that Cottard must have been mistaken; the favourable impression that I received from Andr\u00e9e\u2019s presence there without her friend remained with me and made me feel more kindly disposed towards Albertine. But this feeling lasted no longer than the healthy moments of delicate people subject to passing maladies, who are prostrated again by the merest trifle. Albertine incited Andr\u00e9e to actions which, without going very far, were perhaps not altogether innocent; pained by this suspicion, I managed in the end to repel it. No sooner was I healed of it than it revived under another form. I had just seen Andr\u00e9e, with one of those graceful gestures that came naturally to her, lay her head coaxingly on Albertine\u2019s shoulder, kiss her on the throat, half shutting her eyes; or else they had exchanged a glance; a remark had been made by somebody who had seen them going down together to bathe: little trifles such as habitually float in the surrounding atmosphere where the majority of people absorb them all day long without injury to their health or alteration of their mood, but which have a morbid effect and breed fresh sufferings in a nature predisposed to receive them. Sometimes even without my having seen Albertine again, without anyone\u2019s having spoken to me about her, there would flash from my memory some vision of her with Gis\u00e8le in an attitude which had seemed to me innocent at the time; it was enough now to destroy the peace of mind that I had managed to recover, I had no longer any need to go and breathe dangerous germs outside, I had, as Cottard would have said, supplied my own toxin. I thought then of all that I had been told about Swann\u2019s love for Odette, of the way in which Swann had been tricked all his life. Indeed, when I come to think of it, the hypothesis that made me gradually build up the whole of Albertine\u2019s character and give a painful interpretation to every moment of a life that I could not control in its entirety, was the memory, the rooted idea of Mme. Swann\u2019s character, as it had been described to me. These accounts helped my imagination, in after years, to take the line of supposing that Albertine might, instead of being a good girl, have had the same immorality, the same faculty of deception as a reformed prostitute, and I thought of all the sufferings that would in that case have been in store for me had I ever really been her lover\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, outside the Grand Hotel, where we were gathered on the front, I had just been addressing Albertine in the harshest, most humiliating language, and Rosemonde was saying: \u201cOh, how you have changed your mind about her; why, she used to be everything, it was she who ruled the roost, and now she isn\u2019t even fit to be thrown to the dogs.\u201d I was beginning, in order to make my attitude towards Albertine still more marked, to say all the nicest things I could think of to Andr\u00e9e, who, if she was tainted with the same vice, seemed to me to have more excuse for it since she was sickly and neurasthenic, when we saw emerging at the steady trot of its pair of horses into the street at right angles to the front, at the corner of which we were standing, Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s barouche. The chief magistrate who, at that moment, was advancing towards us, sprang back upon recognising the carriage, in order not to be seen in our company; then, when he thought that the Marquise\u2019s eye might catch his, bowed to her with an immense sweep of his hat. But the carriage, instead of continuing, as might have been expected, along the Rue de la Mer, disappeared through the gate of the hotel. It was quite ten minutes later when the lift-boy, out of breath, came to announce to me: \u201cIt\u2019s the Marquise de Camembert, she\u2019s come here to see Monsieur. I\u2019ve been up to the room, I looked in the reading-room, I couldn\u2019t find Monsieur anywhere. Luckily I thought of looking on the beach.\u201d He had barely ended this speech when, followed by her daughter-in-law and by an extremely ceremonious gentleman, the Marquise advanced towards me, coming on probably from some afternoon tea-party in the neighbourhood, and bowed down not so much by age as by the mass of costly trinkets with which she felt it more sociable and more befitting her rank to cover herself, in order to appear as \u2018well dressed\u2019 as possible to the people whom she went to visit. It was in fact that \u2018landing\u2019 of the Cambremers at the hotel which my grandmother had so greatly dreaded long ago when she wanted us not to let Legrandin know that we might perhaps be going to Balbec. Then Mamma used to laugh at these fears inspired by an event which she considered impossible. And here it was actually happening, but by different channels and without Legrandin\u2019s having had any part in it. \u201cDo you mind my staying here, if I shan\u2019t be in your way?\u201d asked Albertine (in whose eyes there lingered, brought there by the cruel things I had just been saying to her, a pair of tears which I observed without seeming to see them, but not without rejoicing inwardly at the sight), \u201cthere is something I want to say to you.\u201d A hat with feathers, itself surmounted by a sapphire pin, was perched haphazard upon Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s wig, like a badge the display of which was necessary but sufficient, its place immaterial, its elegance conventional and its stability superfluous. Notwithstanding the heat, the good lady had put on a jet cloak, like a dalmatic, over which hung an ermine stole the wearing of which seemed to depend not upon the temperature and season, but upon the nature of the ceremony. And on Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s bosom a baronial torse, fastened to a chain, dangled like a pectoral cross. The gentleman was an eminent lawyer from Paris, of noble family, who had come down to spend a few days with the Cambremers. He was one of those men whom their vast professional experience inclines to look down upon their profession, and who say, for instance: \u201cI know that I am a good pleader, so it no longer amuses me to plead,\u201d or: \u201cI\u2019m no longer interested in operating, I know that I\u2019m a good operator.\u201d Men of intelligence, artists, they see themselves in their maturity, richly endowed by success, shining with that intellect, that artistic nature which their professional brethren recognise in them and which confer upon them a kind of taste and discernment. They form a passion for the paintings not of a great artist, but of an artist who nevertheless is highly distinguished, and spend upon the purchase of his work the large sums that their career procures for them. Le Sidaner was the artist chosen by the Cambremers\u2019 friend, who incidentally was a delightful person. He talked well about books, but not about the books of the true masters, those who have mastered themselves. The only irritating habit that this amateur displayed was his constant use of certain ready made expressions, such as \u2018for the most part,\u2019 which gave an air of importance and incompleteness to the matter of which he was speaking. Madame de Cambremer had taken the opportunity, she told me, of a party which some friends of hers had been giving that afternoon in the Balbec direction to come and call upon me, as she had promised Robert de Saint-Loup. \u201cYou know he\u2019s coming down to these parts quite soon for a few days: His uncle Charlus is staying near here with his sister-in-law, the Duchesse de Luxembourg, and M. de Saint-Loup means to take the opportunity of paying his aunt a visit and going to see his old regiment, where he is very popular, highly respected. We often have visits from officers who are never tired of singing his praises. How nice it would be if you and he would give us the pleasure of coming together to F\u00e9terne.\u201d I presented Albertine and her friends. Mme. de Cambremer introduced us all to her daughter-in-law. The latter, so frigid towards the petty nobility with whom her seclusion at F\u00e9terne forced her to associate, so reserved, so afraid of compromising herself, held out her hand to me with a radiant smile, safe as she felt herself and delighted at seeing a friend of Robert de Saint-Loup, whom he, possessing a sharper social intuition than he allowed to appear, had mentioned to her as being a great friend of the Guermantes. So, unlike her mother-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer employed two vastly different forms of politeness. It was at the most the former kind, dry, insupportable, that she would have conceded me had I met her through her brother Legrandin. But for a friend of the Guermantes she had not smiles enough. The most convenient room in the hotel for entertaining visitors was the reading-room, that place once so terrible into which I now went a dozen times every day, emerging freely, my own master, like those mildly afflicted lunatics who have so long been inmates of an asylum that the superintendent trusts them with a latchkey. And so I offered to take Mme. de Cambremer there. And as this room no longer filled me with shyness and no longer held any charm for me, since the faces of things change for us like the faces of people, it was without the slightest emotion that I made this suggestion. But she declined it, preferring to remain out of doors, and we sat down in the open air, on the terrace of the hotel. I found there and rescued a volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 which Mamma had not had time to carry off in her precipitate flight, when she heard that visitors had called for me. No less than my grandmother, she dreaded these invasions of strangers, and, in her fear of being too late to escape if she let herself be seen, would fly from the room with a rapidity which always made my father and me laugh at her. Madame de Cambremer carried in her hand, with the handle of a sunshade, a number of embroidered bags, a hold-all, a gold purse from which there dangled strings of garnets, and a lace handkerchief. I could not help thinking that it would be more convenient for her to deposit them on a chair; but I felt that it would be unbecoming and useless to ask her to lay aside the ornaments of her pastoral visitation and her social priesthood. We gazed at the calm sea upon which, here and there, a few gulls floated like white petals. Because of the \u2018mean level\u2019 to which social conversation reduces us and also of our desire to attract not by means of those qualities of which we are ourselves unaware but of those which, we suppose, ought to be appreciated by the people who are with us, I began instinctively to talk to Mme. de Cambremer n\u00e9e Legrandin in the strain in which her brother might have talked. \u201cThey appear,\u201d I said, referring to the gulls, \u201cas motionless and as white as water-lilies.\u201d And indeed they did appear to be offering a lifeless object to the little waves which tossed them about, so much so that the waves, by contrast, seemed in their pursuit of them to be animated by a deliberate intention, to have acquired life. The dowager Marquise could not find words enough to do justice to the superb view of the sea that we had from Balbec, or to say how she envied it, she who from la Raspeli\u00e8re (where for that matter she was not living that year) had only such a distant glimpse of the waves. She had two remarkable habits, due at once to her exalted passion for the arts (especially for the art of music), and to her want of teeth. Whenever she talked of aesthetic subjects her salivary glands \u2014 like those of certain animals when in rut \u2014 became so overcharged that the old lady\u2019s edentulous mouth allowed to escape from the corners of her faintly moustached lips a trickle of moisture for which that was not the proper place. Immediately she drew it in again with a deep sigh, like a person recovering his breath. Secondly, if her subject were some piece of music of surpassing beauty, in her enthusiasm she would raise her arms and utter a few decisive opinions, vigorously chewed and at a pinch issuing from her nose. Now it had never occurred to me that the vulgar beach at Balbec could indeed offer a \u2018seascape,\u2019 and Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s simple words changed my ideas in that respect. On the other hand, as I told her, I had always heard people praise the matchless view from la Raspeli\u00e8re, perched on the summit of the hill, where, in a great drawing-room with two fireplaces, one whole row of windows swept the gardens, and, through the branches of the trees, the sea as far as Balbec and beyond it, and the other row the valley. \u201cHow nice of you to say so, and how well you put it: the sea through the branches. It is exquisite, one would say . . . a painted fan.\u201d And I gathered from a deep breath intended to catch the falling spittle and dry the moustaches, that the compliment was sincere. But the Marquise n\u00e9e Legrandin remained cold, to shew her contempt not for my words but for those of her mother-in-law. Besides, she not only despised the other\u2019s intellect but deplored her affability, being always afraid that people might not form a sufficiently high idea of the Cambremers. \u201cAnd how charming the name is,\u201d said I. \u201cOne would like to know the origin of all those names.\u201d \u201cThat one I can tell you,\u201d the old lady answered modestly. \u201cIt is a family place, it came from my grandmother Arrachepel, not an illustrious family, but a decent and very old country stock.\u201d \u201cWhat! Not illustrious!\u201d her daughter-in-law tartly interrupted her. \u201cA whole window in Bayeux cathedral is filled with their arms, and the principal church at Avranches has their tombs. If these old names interest you,\u201d she added, \u201cyou\u2019ve come a year too late. We managed to appoint to the living of Criquetot, in spite of all the difficulties about changing from one diocese to another, the parish priest of a place where I myself have some land, a long way from here, Combray, where the worthy cleric felt that he was becoming neurasthenic. Unfortunately, the sea air was no good to him at his age; his neurasthenia grew worse and he has returned to Combray. But he amused himself while he was our neighbour in going about looking up all the old charters, and he compiled quite an interesting little pamphlet on the place names of the district. It has given him a fresh interest, too, for it seems he is spending his last years in writing a great work upon Combray and its surroundings. I shall send you his pamphlet on the surroundings of F\u00e9terne. It is worthy of a Benedictine. You will find the most interesting things in it about our old Raspeli\u00e8re, of which my mother-in-law speaks far too modestly.\u201d \u201cIn any case, this year,\u201d replied the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cla Raspeli\u00e8re is no longer ours and does not belong to me. But I can see that you have a painter\u2019s instincts; I am sure you sketch, and I should so like to shew you F\u00e9terne, which is far finer than la Raspeli\u00e8re.\u201d For as soon as the Cambremers had let this latter residence to the Verdurins, its commanding situation had at once ceased to appear to them as it had appeared for so many years past, that is to say to offer the advantage, without parallel in the neighbourhood, of looking out over both sea and valley, and had on the other hand, suddenly and retrospectively, presented the drawback that one had always to go up or down hill to get to or from it. In short, one might have supposed that if Mme. de Cambremer had let it, it was not so much to add to her income as to spare her horses. And she proclaimed herself delighted at being able at last to have the sea always so close at hand, at F\u00e9terne, she who for so many years (forgetting the two months that she spent there) had seen it only from up above and as though in a panorama. \u201cI am discovering it at my age,\u201d she said, \u201cand how I enjoy it! It does me a world of good. I would let la Raspeli\u00e8re for nothing so as to be obliged to live at F\u00e9terne.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo return to more interesting topics,\u201d went on Legrandin\u2019s sister, who addressed the old Marquise as \u2018Mother,\u2019 but with the passage of years had come to treat her with insolence, \u201cyou mentioned water-lilies: I suppose you know Claude Monet\u2019s pictures of them. What a genius! They interest me particularly because near Combray, that place where I told you I had some land. . . . \u201d But she preferred not to talk too much about Combray. \u201cWhy! That must be the series that Elstir told us about, the greatest painter of this generation,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, who had said nothing so far. \u201cAh! I can see that this young lady loves the arts,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer and, drawing a long breath, recaptured a trail of spittle. \u201cYou will allow me to put Le Sidaner before him, Mademoiselle,\u201d said the lawyer, smiling with the air of an expert. And, as he had enjoyed, or seen people enjoy, years ago, certain \u2018daring\u2019 work by Elstir, he added: \u201cElstir was gifted, indeed he was one of the advance guard, but for some reason or other he never kept up, he has wasted his life.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer disagreed with the lawyer, so far as Elstir was concerned, but, greatly to the annoyance of her guest, bracketed Monet with Le Sidaner. It would be untrue to say that she was a fool; she was overflowing with a kind of intelligence that meant nothing to me. As the sun was beginning to set, the seagulls were now yellow, like the water-lilies on another canvas of that series by Monet. I said that I knew it, and (continuing to copy the diction of her brother, whom I had not yet dared to name) added that it was a pity that she had not thought of coming a day earlier, for, at the same hour, there would have been a Poussin light for her to admire. Had some Norman squireen, unknown to the Guermantes, told her that she ought to have come a day earlier, Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin would doubtless have drawn herself up with an offended air. But I might have been far more familiar still, and she would have been all smiles and sweetness; I might in the warmth of that fine afternoon devour my fill of that rich honey cake which Mme. de Cambremer so rarely was and which took the place of the dish of pastry that it had not occurred to me to offer my guests. But the name of Poussin, without altering the amenity of the society lady, called forth the protests of the connoisseur. On hearing that name, she produced six times in almost continuous succession that little smack of the tongue against the lips which serves to convey to a child who is misbehaving at once a reproach for having begun and a warning not to continue. \u201cIn heaven\u2019s name, after a painter like Monet, who is an absolute genius, don\u2019t go and mention an old hack without a vestige of talent, like Poussin. I don\u2019t mind telling you frankly that I find him the deadliest bore. I mean to say, you can\u2019t really call that sort of thing painting. Monet, Degas, Manet, yes, there are painters if you like! It is a curious thing,\u201d she went on, fixing a scrutinous and ecstatic gaze upon a vague point in space where she could see what was in her mind, \u201cit is a curious thing, I used at one time to prefer Manet. Nowadays, I still admire Manet, of course, but I believe I like Monet even more. Oh! The Cathedrals!\u201d She was as scrupulous as she was condescending in informing me of the evolution of her taste. And one felt that the phases through which that taste had evolved were not, in her eyes, any less important than the different manners of Monet himself. Not that I had any reason to feel flattered by her taking me into her confidence as to her preferences, for even in the presence of the narrowest of provincial ladies she could not remain for five minutes without feeling the need to confess them. When a noble dame of Avranches, who would have been incapable of distinguishing between Mozart and Wagner, said in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s hearing: \u201cWe saw nothing of any interest while we were in Paris, we went once to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, they were doing Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, it\u2019s dreadful stuff,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer not only boiled with rage but felt obliged to exclaim: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d and to \u2018argue the point.\u2019 It was perhaps a Combray habit which she had picked up from my grandmother\u2019s sisters, who called it \u2018fighting in the good cause,\u2019 and loved the dinner-parties at which they knew all through the week that they would have to defend their idols against the Philistines. Similarly, Mme. de Cambremer liked to \u2018fly into a passion\u2019 and wrangle about art, as other people do about politics. She stood up for Debussy as she would have stood up for a woman friend whose conduct had been criticised. She must however have known very well that when she said: \u201cNot at all, it\u2019s a little gem,\u201d she could not improvise in the other lady, whom she was putting in her place, the whole progressive development of artistic culture on the completion of which they would come naturally to an agreement without any need of discussion. \u201cI must ask Le Sidaner what he thinks of Poussin,\u201d the lawyer remarked to me. \u201cHe\u2019s a regular recluse, never opens his mouth, but I know how to get things out of him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnyhow,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer went on, \u201cI have a horror of sunsets, they\u2019re so romantic, so operatic. That is why I can\u2019t abide my mother-in-law\u2019s house, with its tropical plants. You will see it, it\u2019s just like a public garden at Monte-Carlo. That\u2019s why I prefer your coast, here. It is more sombre, more sincere; there\u2019s a little lane from which one doesn\u2019t see the sea. On rainy days, there\u2019s nothing but mud, it\u2019s a little world apart. It\u2019s just the same at Venice, I detest the Grand Canal and I don\u2019t know anything so touching as the little alleys. But it\u2019s all a question of one\u2019s surroundings.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d I remarked to her, feeling that the only way to rehabilitate Poussin in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s eyes was to inform her that he was once more in fashion, \u201cM. Degas assures us that he knows nothing more beautiful than the Poussins at Chantilly.\u201d \u201cIndeed? I don\u2019t know the ones at Chantilly,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer who had no wish to differ from Degas, \u201cbut I can speak about the ones in the Louvre, which are appalling.\u201d \u201cHe admires them immensely too.\u201d \u201cI must look at them again. My impressions of them are rather distant,\u201d she replied after a moment\u2019s silence, and as though the favourable opinion which she was certain, before very long, to form of Poussin would depend, not upon the information that I had just communicated to her, but upon the supplementary and, this time, final examination that she intended to make of the Poussins in the Louvre in order to be in a position to change her mind. Contenting myself with what was a first step towards retraction since, if she did not yet admire the Poussins, she was adjourning the matter for further consideration, in order not to keep her on tenterhooks any longer, I told her mother-in-law how much I had heard of the wonderful flowers at F\u00e9terne. In modest terms she spoke of the little presbytery garden that she had behind the house, into which in the mornings, by simply pushing open a door, she went in her wrapper to feed her peacocks, hunt for new-laid eggs, and gather the zinnias or roses which, on the sideboard, framing the creamed eggs or fried fish in a border of flowers, reminded her of her garden paths. \u201cIt is true, we have a great many roses,\u201d she told me, \u201cour rose garden is almost too near the house, there are days when it makes my head ache. It is nicer on the terrace at la Raspeli\u00e8re where the breeze carries the scent of the roses, but it is not so heady.\u201d I turned to her daughter-in-law. \u201cIt is just like Pell\u00e9as,\u201d I said to her, to gratify her taste for the modern, \u201cthat scent of roses wafted up to the terraces. It is so strong in the score that, as I suffer from hay-fever and rose-fever, it sets me sneezing every time I listen to that scene.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a marvellous thing Pell\u00e9as is,\u201d cried Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cI\u2019m mad about it;\u201d and, drawing closer to me with the gestures of a savage woman seeking to captivate me, using her fingers to pick out imaginary notes, she began to hum something which, I supposed, represented to her the farewells of Pell\u00e9as, and continued with a vehement persistence as though it had been important that Mme. de Cambremer should at that moment remind me of that scene or rather should prove to me that she herself remembered it. \u201cI think it is even finer than Parsifal,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause in Parsifal the most beautiful things are surrounded with a sort of halo of melodious phrases, which are bad simply because they are melodious.\u201d \u201cI know, you are a great musician, Madame,\u201d I said to the dowager. \u201cI should so much like to hear you play.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin gazed at the sea so as not to be drawn into the conversation. Being of the opinion that what her mother-in-law liked was not music at all, she regarded the talent, a sham talent according to her, though in reality of the very highest order that the other was admitted to possess as a technical accomplishment devoid of interest. It was true that Chopin\u2019s only surviving pupil declared, and with justice, that the Master\u2019s style of playing, his \u2018feeling\u2019 had been transmitted, through herself, to Mme. de Cambremer alone, but to play like Chopin was far from being a recommendation in the eyes of Legran-din\u2019s sister, who despised nobody so much as the Polish composer. \u201cOh! They are flying away,\u201d exclaimed Albertine, pointing to the gulls which, casting aside for a moment their flowery incognito, were rising in a body towards the sun. \u201cTheir giant wings from walking hinder them,\u201d quoted Mme. de Cambremer, confusing the seagull with the albatross. \u201cI do love them; I used to see them at Amsterdam,\u201d said Albertine. \u201cThey smell of the sea, they come and breathe the salt air through the paving stones even.\u201d \u201cOh! So you have been in Holland, you know the Vermeers?\u201d Mme. de Cambremer asked imperiously, in the tone in which she would have said: \u201cYou know the Guermantes?\u201d for snobbishness in changing its subject does not change its accent. Albertine replied in the negative, thinking that they were living people. But her mistake was not apparent. \u201cI should be delighted to play to you,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me. \u201cBut you know I only play things that no longer appeal to your generation. I was brought up in the worship of Chopin,\u201d she said in a lowered tone, for she was afraid of her daughter-in-law, and knew that to the latter, who considered that Chopin was not music, playing him well or badly were meaningless terms. She admitted that her mother-in-law had technique, was a finished pianist. \u201cNothing will ever make me say that she is a musician,\u201d was Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin\u2019s conclusion. Because she considered herself \u2018advanced,\u2019 because (hi matters of art only) \u201cone could never move far enough to the Left,\u201d she said, she maintained not merely that music progressed, but that it progressed along one straight line, and that Debussy was in a sense a super-Wagner, slightly more advanced again than Wagner. She did not take into account the fact that if Debussy was not as independent of Wagner as she herself was to suppose in a few years\u2019 time, because we must always make use of the weapons that we have captured to free ourselves finally from the foe whom we have for the moment overpowered, he was seeking nevertheless, after the feeling of satiety that people were beginning to derive from work that was too complete, in which everything was expressed, to satisfy an opposite demand. There were theories of course, to support this reaction for the time being, like those theories which, in politics, come to the support of the laws against religious communities, of wars in the East (unnatural teaching, the Yellow Peril, etc., etc.). People said that an age of speed required rapidity in art, precisely as they might have said that the next war could not last longer than a fortnight, or that the coming of railways would kill the little places beloved of the coaches, which the motor-car, for all that, was to restore to favour. Composers were warned not to strain the attention of their audience, as though we had not at our disposal different degrees of attention, among which it rests precisely with the artist himself to arouse the highest. For the people who yawn with boredom after ten lines of a mediocre article have journeyed year after year to Bayreuth to listen to the Ring. Besides, the day was to come when, for a season, Debussy would be pronounced as trivial as Massenet, and the trills of M\u00e9lisande degraded to the level of Manon\u2019s. For theories and schools, like microbes and corpuscles, devour one another and by their warfare ensure the continuity of existence. But that time was still to come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As on the Stock Exchange, when a rise occurs, a whole group of securities benefit by it, so a certain number of despised composers were gaining by the reaction, either because they did not deserve such scorn, or simply \u2014 which enabled one to be original when one sang their praises \u2014 because they had incurred it. And people even went the length of seeking out, in an isolated past, men of independent talent upon whose reputation the present movement did not seem calculated to have any influence, but of whom one of the new masters was understood to have spoken favourably. Often it was because a master, whoever he may be, however exclusive his school, judges in the light of his own untutored instincts, does justice to talent wherever it be found, or rather not so much to talent as to some agreeable inspiration which he has enjoyed in the past, which reminds him of a precious moment in his adolescence. Or, it may be, because certain artists of an earlier generation have in some fragment of their work realised something that resembles what the master has gradually become aware that he himself meant at one time to create. Then he sees the old master as a sort of precursor; he values in him, under a wholly different form, an effort that is momentarily, partially fraternal. There are bits of Turner in the work of Poussin, we find a phrase of Flaubert in Montesquieu. Sometimes, again, this rumoured predilection of the Master was due to an error, starting heaven knows where and circulated through the school. But in that case the name mentioned profited by the auspices under which it was introduced in the nick of time, for if there is an element of free will, some genuine taste expressed in the master\u2019s choice, the schools themselves go only by theory. Thus it is that the mind, following its habitual course which advances by digression, inclining first in one direction, then in the other, had brought back into the light of day a number of works to which the need for justice, or for a renewal of standards, or the taste of Debussy, or his caprice, or some remark that he had perhaps never made had added the works of Chopin. Commended by the judges in whom one had entire confidence, profiting by the admiration that was aroused by Pell\u00e9as, they had acquired a fresh lustre, and even the people who had not heard them again were so anxious to admire them that they did so in spite of themselves, albeit preserving the illusion of free will. But Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin spent part of the year in the country. Even in Paris, being an invalid, she was largely confined to her own room. It is true that the drawbacks of this mode of existence were noticeable chiefly in her choice of expressions which she supposed to be fashionable and which would have been more appropriate to the written language, a distinction that she did not perceive, for she derived them more from reading than from conversation. The latter is not so necessary for an exact knowledge of current opinion as of the latest expressions. Unfortunately this revival of the Nocturnes had not yet been announced by the critics. The news of it had been transmitted only by word of mouth among the \u2018younger\u2019 people. It remained unknown to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. I gave myself the pleasure of informing her, but by addressing my remark to her mother-in-law, as when at billiards in order to hit a ball one aims at the cushion, that Chopin, so far from being out of date, was Debussy\u2019s favourite composer. \u201cIndeed, that\u2019s quaint,\u201d said the daughter-in-law with a subtle smile as though it had been merely a deliberate paradox on the part of the composer of Pell\u00e9as. Nevertheless it was now quite certain that in future she would always listen to Chopin with respect and even pleasure. Moreover my words which had sounded the hour of deliverance for the dowager produced on her face an expression of gratitude to myself and above all of joy. Her eyes shone like the eyes of Latude in the play entitled Latude, or Thirty-five Years in Captivity, and her bosom inhaled the sea air with that dilatation which Beethoven has so well described in Fidelio, at the point where his prisoners at last breathe again \u2018this life-giving air.\u2019 As for the dowager, I thought that she was going to press her hirsute lips to my cheek. \u201cWhat, you like Chopin? He likes Chopin, he likes Chopin,\u201d she cried with a nasal trumpet-tone of passion; she might have been saying: \u201cWhat, you know Mme. de Franquetot too?\u201d with this difference, that my relations with Mme. de Franquetot would have left her completely indifferent, whereas my knowledge of Chopin plunged her in a sort of artistic delirium. Her salivary super-secretion no longer sufficed. Not having attempted even to understand the part played by Debussy in the rediscovery of Chopin, she felt only that my judgment of him was favourable. Her musical enthusiasm overpowered her. \u201cElodie! Elodie! He likes Chopin!\u201d her bosom rose and she beat the air with her arms. \u201cAh! I knew at once that you were a musician,\u201d she cried. \u201cI can quite understand an artist such as you are liking him. He\u2019s so lovely!\u201d And her voice was as pebbly as if, to express her ardour for Chopin, she had copied Demosthenes and filled her mouth with all the shingle on the beach. Then came the turn of the tide, reaching as far as her veil which she had not time to lift out of harm\u2019s way and which was flooded; and lastly the Marquise wiped away with her embroidered handkerchief the tidemark of foam in which the memory of Chopin had steeped her moustaches\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood heavens,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin remarked to me, \u201cI\u2019m afraid my mother-in-law\u2019s cutting it rather fine, she\u2019s forgotten that we\u2019ve got my Uncle de Ch\u2019nouville dining. Besides, Cancan doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d The word \u2018Cancan\u2019 was beyond me, and I supposed that she might perhaps be referring to a dog. But as for the Ch\u2019nouville relatives, the explanation was as follows. With the lapse of time the young Marquise had outgrown the pleasure that she had once found in pronouncing their name in this manner. And yet it was the prospect of enjoying that pleasure that had decided her choice of a husband. In other social circles, when one referred to the Chenouville family, the custom was (whenever, that is to say, the particle was preceded by a word ending in a vowel sound, for otherwise you were obliged to lay stress upon the de, the tongue refusing to utter Madam\u2019 d\u2019Ch\u2019nonceaux) that it was the mute e of the particle that was sacrificed. One said: \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Chenouville.\u201d The Cambremer tradition was different, but no less imperious. It was the mute e of Chenouville that was suppressed. Whether the name was preceded by mon cousin or by ma cousine, it was always de Chenouvilleand never de Chenouville. (Of the father of these Chenouvilles, one said \u2018our Uncle\u2019 for they were not sufficiently \u2018smart set\u2019 at F\u00e9terne to pronounce the word \u2018Unk\u2019 like the Guermantes, whose deliberate jargon, suppressing consonants and naturalising foreign words, was as difficult to understand as Old French or a modern dialect.) Every newcomer into the family circle at once received, in the matter of the Ch\u2019nouvilles, a lesson which Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin had not required. When, paying a call one day, she had heard a girl say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d \u201cMy Unk de Rouan,\u201d she had not at first recognised the illustrious names which she was in the habit of pronouncing: Uz\u00e8s, and Rol\u00eean, she had felt the astonishment, embarrassment and shame of a person who sees before him on the table a recently invented implement of which he does not know the proper use and with which he dares not begin to eat. But during that night and the next day she had rapturously repeated: \u201cMy Aunt Uzai,\u201d with that suppression of the final s, a suppression that had stupefied her the day before, but which it now seemed to her so vulgar not to know that, one of her friends having spoken to her of a bust of the Duchesse d\u2019Uz\u00e8s, Mlle. Legrandin had answered her crossly, and in an arrogant tone: \u201cYou might at least pronounce her name properly: Mme. d\u2019Uzai.\u201d From that moment she had realised that, by virtue of the transmutation of solid bodies into more and more subtle elements, the considerable and so honourably acquired fortune that she had inherited from her father, the finished education that she had received, her regular attendance at the Sorbonne, whether at Caro\u2019s lectures or at Brunetiere\u2019s, and at the Lamoureux concerts, all this was to be rendered volatile, to find its utmost sublimation in the pleasure of being able one day to say: \u201cMy Aunt d\u2019Uzai.\u201d This did not exclude the thought that she would continue to associate, in the earlier days, at least, of her married life, not indeed with certain women friends whom she liked and had resigned herself to sacrificing, but with certain others whom she did not like and to whom she looked forward to being able to say (since that, after all, was why she was marrying): \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt d\u2019Uzai,\u201d and, when she saw that such an alliance was beyond her reach, \u201cI must introduce you to my Aunt de Ch\u2019nouville,\u201d and \u201cI shall ask you to dine to meet the Uzai.\u201d Her marriage to M. de Cambremer had procured for Mlle. Legrandin the opportunity to use the former of these phrases but not the latter, the circle in which her parents-in-law moved not being that which she had supposed and of which she continued to dream. After saying to me of Saint-Loup (adopting for the occasion one of his expressions, for if in talking to her I used those expressions of Legrandin, she by a reverse suggestion answered me in Robert\u2019s dialect which she did not know to be borrowed from Rachel), bringing her thumb and forefinger together and half-shutting her eyes as though she were gazing at something infinitely delicate which she had succeeded in capturing: \u201cHe has a charming quality of mind,\u201d she began to extol him with such warmth that one might have supposed that she was in love with him (it had indeed been alleged that, some time back, when he was at Don-ci\u00e8res, Robert had been her lover), in reality simply that I might repeat her words to him, and ended up with: \u201cYou are a great friend of the Duchesse de Guermantes. I am an invalid, I never go anywhere, and I know that she sticks to a close circle of chosen friends, which I do think so wise of her, and so I know her very slightly, but I know she is a really remarkable woman.\u201d Aware that Mme. de Carnbremer barely knew her, and anxious to reduce myself to her level, I avoided the subject and answered the Marquise that the person whom I did know well was her brother, M. Legrandin. At the sound of his name she assumed the same evasive air as myself over the name of Mme. de Guermantes, but combined with it an expression of annoyance, for she supposed that I had said this with the object of humiliating not myself but her. Was she gnawed by despair at having been born a Legrandin? So at least her husband\u2019s sisters and sisters-in-law asserted, ladies of the provincial nobility who knew nobody and nothing, and were jealous of Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s intelligence, her education, her fortune, the physical attractions that she had possessed before her illness. \u201cShe can think of nothing else, that is what is killing her,\u201d these slanderers would say whenever they spoke of Mme. de Cambremer to no matter whom, but preferably to a plebeian, whether, were he conceited and stupid, to enhance, by this affirmation of the shamefulness of a plebeian origin, the value of the affability that they were shewing him, of, if he were shy and clever and applied the remark to himself, to give themselves the pleasure, while receiving him hospitably, of insulting him indirectly. But if these ladies thought that they were speaking the truth about their sister-in-law, they were mistaken. She suffered not at all from having been born Legrandin, for she had forgotten the fact altogether. She was annoyed at my reminding her of it, and remained silent as though she had not understood, not thinking it necessary to enlarge upon or even to confirm my statement\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur cousins are not the chief reason for our cutting short our visit,\u201d said the dowager Mme. de Cambremer, who was probably more satiated than her daughter-in-law with the pleasure to be derived from saying \u2018Ch\u2019nouville.\u2019 \u201cBut, so as not to bother you with too many people, Monsieur,\u201d she went on, indicating the lawyer, \u201cwas afraid to bring his wife and son to the hotel. They are waiting for us on the beach, and they will be growing impatient.\u201d I asked for an exact description of them and hastened in search of them. The wife had a round face like certain flowers of the ranunculus family, and a large vegetable growth at the corner of her eye. And as the generations of mankind preserve their characteristic like a family of plants, just as on the blemished face of his mother, an identical mole, which might have helped one in classifying a variety of the species, protruded below the eye of the son. The lawyer was touched by my civility to his wife and son. He shewed an interest in the subject of my stay at Balbec. \u201cYou must find yourself rather out of your element, for the people here are for the most part foreigners.\u201d And he kept his eye on me as he spoke, for, not caring for foreigners, albeit he had many foreign clients, he wished to make sure that I was not hostile to his xenophobia, in which case he would have beaten a retreat saying: \u201cOf course, Mme. X\u2014\u2014-may be a charming woman. It\u2019s a question of principle.\u201d As at that time I had no definite opinion about foreigners, I shewed no sign of disapproval; he felt himself to be on safe ground. He went so far as to invite me to come one day, in Paris, to see his collection of Le Sidaner, and to bring with me the Cambremers, with whom he evidently supposed me to be on intimate terms. \u201cI shall invite you to meet Le Sidaner,\u201d he said to me, confident that from that moment I would live only in expectation of that happy day. \u201cYou shall see what a delightful man he is. And his pictures will enchant you. Of course, I can\u2019t compete with the great collectors, but I do believe that I am the one that possesses the greatest number of his favourite canvases. They will interest you all the more, coming from Balbec, since they are marine subjects, for the most part, at least.\u201d The wife and son, blessed with a vegetable nature, listened composedly. One felt that their house in Paris was a sort of temple of Le Sidaner. Temples of this sort are not without their use. When the god has doubts as to his own merits, he can easily stop the cracks in his opinion of himself with the irrefutable testimony of people who have devoted their lives to his work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a signal from her daughter-in-law, Mme. de Cambremer prepared to depart, and said to me: \u201cSince you won\u2019t come and stay at F\u00e9terne, won\u2019t you at least come to luncheon, one day this week, to-morrow for instance?\u201d And in her bounty, to make the invitation irresistible, she added: \u201cYou will find the Comte de Crisenoy,\u201d whom I had never lost, for the simple reason that I did not know him. She was beginning to dazzle me with yet further temptations, but stopped short. The chief magistrate who, on returning to the hotel, had been told that she was on the premises had crept about searching for her everywhere, then waited his opportunity, and pretending to have caught sight of her by chance, came up now to greet her. I gathered that Mme. de Cambremer did not mean to extend to him the invitation to luncheon that she had just addressed to me. And yet he had known her far longer than I, having for years past been one of the regular guests at the afternoon parties at F\u00e9terne whom I used so to envy during my former visit to Balbec. But old acquaintance is not the only thing that counts in society. And hostesses are more inclined to reserve their luncheons for new acquaintances who still whet their curiosity, especially when they arrive preceded by a glowing and irresistible recommendation like Saint-Loup\u2019s of me. Mme. de Cambremer decided that the chief magistrate could not have heard what she was saying to me, but, to calm her guilty conscience, began addressing him in the kindest tone. In the sunlight that flooded, on the horizon, the golden coastline, invisible as a rule, of Rivebelle, we could just make out, barely distinguishable from the luminous azure, rising from the water, rosy, silvery, faint, the little bells that were sounding the ang\u00e9lus round about F\u00e9terne. \u201cThat is ratherPell\u00e9as, too,\u201d I suggested to Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin. \u201cYou know the scene I mean.\u201d \u201cOf course I do!\u201d was what she said; but \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea\u201d was the message proclaimed by her voice and features which did not mould themselves to the shape of any recollection and by a smile that floated without support in the air. The dowager could not get over her astonishment that the sound of the bells should carry so far, and rose, reminded of the time. \u201cBut, as a rule,\u201d I said, \u201cwe never see that part of the coast from Balbec, nor hear it either. The weather must have changed and enlarged the horizon in more ways than one. Unless, that is to say, the bells have come to look for you, since I see that they are making you leave; to you they are a dinner bell.\u201d The chief magistrate, little interested in the bells, glanced furtively along the front, on which he was sorry to see so few people that evening. \u201cYou are a true poet,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to me. \u201cOne feels you are so responsive, so artistic, come, I will play you Chopin,\u201d she went on, raising her arms with an air of ecstasy and pronouncing the words in a raucous voice like the shifting of shingle on the beach. Then came the deglutition of spittle, and the old lady instinctively wiped the stubble of her moustaches with her handkerchief. The chief magistrate did me, unconsciously, a great service by offering the Marquise his arm to escort her to her carriage, a certain blend of vulgarity, boldness and love of ostentation prompting him to actions which other people would have hesitated to risk, and which are by no means unsuccessful in society. He was, moreover, and had been for years past far more in the habit of these actions than myself. While blessing him for what he did I did not venture to copy him, and walked by the side of Mme. de Cambremer-Legrandin who insisted upon seeing the book that I had in my hand. The name of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 drew a grimace from her; and using a word which she had seen in certain newspapers, but which, used in speech and given a feminine form, and applied to a seventeenth century writer, had an odd effect, she asked me: \u201cDo you think her really masterly?\u201d The Marquise gave her footman the address of a pastry-cook where she had to call before taking the road, rosy with the evening haze, through which loomed one beyond another the dusky walls of cliff. She asked her old coachman whether one of the horses which was apt to catch cold had been kept warm enough, whether the other\u2019s shoe were not hurting him. \u201cI shall write to you and make a definite engagement,\u201d she murmured to me. \u201cI heard you talking about literature to my daughter-in-law, she\u2019s a darling,\u201d she went on, not that she really thought so, but she had acquired the habit \u2014 and kept it up in her kindness of heart \u2014 of saying so, in order that her son might not appear to have married for money. \u201cBesides,\u201d she added with a final enthusiastic gnashing of her teeth, \u201cshe\u2019s so harttissttick!\u201d With this she stepped into her carriage, nodding her head, holding the crook of her sunshade aloft like a crozier, and set off through the streets of Balbec, overloaded with the ornaments of her priesthood, like an old Bishop on a confirmation tour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe has asked you to luncheon,\u201d the chief magistrate said to me sternly when the carriage had passed out of sight and I came indoors with the girls. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the best of terms just now. She feels that I neglect her. Gad, I\u2019m easy enough to get on with. If anybody needs me, I\u2019m always there to say: Adsum! But they tried to force my hand. That, now,\u201d he went on with an air of subtlety, holding up his finger as though making and arguing a distinction, \u201cthat is a thing I do not allow. It is a threat to the liberty of my holidays. I was obliged to say: Stopl You seem to be in her good books. When you reach my age you will see that society is a very trumpery thing, and you will be sorry you attached so much importance to these trifles. Well, I am going to take a turn before dinner. Good-bye, children,\u201d he shouted back at us, as though he were already fifty yards away\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had said good-bye to Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, they saw with astonishment that Albertine was staying behind instead of accompanying them. \u201cWhy, Albertine, what are you doing, don\u2019t you know what time it is?\u201d \u201cGo home,\u201d she replied in a tone of authority. \u201cI want to talk to him,\u201d she added, indicating myself with a submissive air. Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le stared at me, filled with a new and strange respect. I enjoyed the feeling that, for a moment at least, in the eyes even of Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, I was to Albertine something more important than the time, than her friends, and might indeed share solemn secrets with her into which it was impossible for them to be admitted. \u201cShan\u2019t we see you again this evening?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, it will depend on this person. Anyhow, to-morrow.\u201d \u201cLet us go up to my room,\u201d I said to her, when her friends had gone. We took the lift; she remained silent in the boy\u2019s presence. The habit of being obliged to resort to personal observation and deduction in order to find out the business of their masters, those strange beings who converse among themselves and do not speak to them, develops in \u2018employees\u2019 (as the lift-boy styled servants), a stronger power of divination than the \u2018employer\u2019 possesses. Our organs become atrophied or grow stronger or more subtle, accordingly as our need of them increases or diminishes. Since railways came into existence, the necessity of not missing the train has taught us to take account of minutes whereas among the ancient Romans, who not only had a more cursory science of astronomy but led less hurried lives, the notion not of minutes but even of fixed hours barely existed. And so the lift-boy had gathered and meant to inform his comrades that Albertine and I were preoccupied. But he talked to us without ceasing because he had no tact. And yet I could see upon his face, in place of the customary expression of friendliness and joy at taking me up in his lift, an air of extraordinary depression and uneasiness. As I knew nothing of the cause of this, in an attempt to distract his thoughts, and albeit I was more preoccupied than Albertine, I told him that the lady who had just left was called the Marquise de Cambremer and not de Camembert. On the landing at which we were pausing at the moment, I saw, carrying a pair of pails, a hideous chambermaid who greeted me with respect, hoping for a tip when I left. I should have liked to know if she were the one whom I had so ardently desired on the evening of my first arrival at Balbec, but I could never arrive at any certainty. The lift-boy swore to me with the sincerity of most false witnesses, but without shedding his expression of despair, that it was indeed by the name of Camembert that the Marquise had told him to announce her. And as a matter of fact it was quite natural that he should have heard her say a name which he already knew. Besides, having those very vague ideas of nobility, and of the names of which titles are composed, which are shared by many people who are not lift-boys, the name Camembert had seemed to him all the more probable inasmuch as, that cheese being universally known, it was not in the least surprising that people should have acquired a marquisate from so glorious a distinction, unless it were the marquisate that had bestowed its renown upon the cheese. Nevertheless as he saw that I refused to admit that I might be mistaken, and as he knew that masters like to see their most futile whims obeyed and their most obvious lies accepted, he promised me like a good servant that in future he would say Cambremer. It is true that none of the shopkeepers in the town, none of the peasants in the district, where the name and persons of the Cambremers were perfectly familiar, could ever have made the lift-boy\u2019s mistake. But the staff of the \u2018Grand Hotel of Balbec\u2019 were none of them natives. They came direct, with the furniture and stock, from Biarritz, Nice and Monte-Carlo, one division having been transferred to Deauville, another to Dinard and the third reserved for Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the lift-boy\u2019s pained anxiety continued to grow. That he should thus forget to shew his devotion to me by the customary smiles, some misfortune must have befallen him. Perhaps he had been \u2018\u2018missed.\u2019 I made up my mind in that case to try to secure his reinstatement, the manager having promised to ratify all my wishes with regard to his staff. \u201cYou can always do just what you like, I rectify everything in advance.\u201d Suddenly, as I stepped out of the lift, I guessed the meaning of the boy\u2019s distress, his panic-stricken air. Because Albertine was with me, I had not given him the five francs which I was in the habit of slipping into his hand when I went up. And the idiot, instead of understanding that I did not wish to make a display of generosity in front of a third person, had begun to tremble, supposing that it was all finished, that I would never give him anything again. He imagined that I was \u2018on the rocks\u2019 (as the Duc de Guermantes would have said), and the supposition inspired him with no pity for myself but with a terrible selfish disappointment. I told myself that I was less unreasonable than my mother thought when I dared not, one day, refrain from giving the extravagant but feverishly awaited sum that I had given the day before. But at the same time the meaning that I had until then, and without a shadow of doubt, ascribed to his habitual expression of joy, in which I had no hesitation in seeing a sign of devotion, seemed to me to have become less certain. Seeing the lift-boy ready, in his despair, to fling himself down from the fifth floor of the hotel, I asked myself whether, if our respective social stations were to be altered, in consequence let us say of a revolution, instead of politely working his lift for me, the boy, grown independent, would not have flung me down the well, and whether there was not, in certain of the lower orders, more duplicity than in society, where, no doubt, people reserve their offensive remarks until we are out of earshot, but where their attitude towards us would not be insulting if we were reduced to poverty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One cannot however say that, in the Balbec hotel, the lift-boy was the most commercially minded. From this point of view the staff might be divided into two categories; on the one hand, those who drew distinctions between the visitors, and were more grateful for the modest tip of an old nobleman (who, moreover, was in a position to relieve them from 28 days of military service by saying a word for them to General de Beautreillis) than for the thoughtless liberalities of a cad who by his very profusion revealed a want of practice which only to his face did they call generosity. On the other hand, those to whom nobility, intellect, fame, position, manners were nonexistent, concealed under a cash valuation. For these there was but a single standard, the money one has, or rather the money one bestows. Possibly Aim\u00e9 himself, albeit pretending, in view of the great number of hotels in which he had served, to a great knowledge of the world, belonged to this latter category. At the most he would give a social turn, shewing that he knew who was who, to this sort of appreciation, as when he said of the Princesse de Luxembourg: \u201cThere\u2019s a pile of money among that lot?\u201d (the question mark at the end being to ascertain the facts or to check such information as he had already ascertained, before supplying a client with a \u2018chef for Paris, or promising him a table on the left, by the door, with a view of the sea, at Balbec). In spite of this, and albeit not free from sordid considerations, he would not have displayed them with the fatuous despair of the lift-boy. And yet, the latter\u2019s artlessness helped perhaps to simplify things. It is the convenience of a big hotel, of a house such as Rachel used at one time to frequent, that, without any intermediary, the face, frozen stiff until that moment, of a servant or a woman, at the sight of a hundred-franc note, still more of one of a thousand, even although it is being given to some one else, will melt in smiles and offers of service. Whereas in the dealings, in the relations between lover and mistress, there are too many things interposed between money and docility. So many things that the very people upon whose faces money finally evokes a smile are often incapable of following the internal process that links them together, believe themselves to be, and indeed are more refined. Besides, it rids polite conversation of such speeches as: \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing left for me to do, you will find me to-morrow in the mortuary.\u201d And so one meets in polite society few novelists, or poets, few of all those sublime creatures who speak of the things that are not to be mentioned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as we were alone and had moved along the corridor, Albertine began: \u201cWhat is it, you have got against me?\u201d Had my harsh treatment of her been painful to myself? Had it been merely an unconscious ruse on my part, with the object of bringing my mistress to that attitude of fear and supplication which would enable me to interrogate her, and perhaps to find out which of the alternative hypotheses that I had long since formed about her was correct? However that may be, when I heard her question, I suddenly felt the joy of one who attains to a long desired goal. Before answering her, I escorted her to the door of my room. Opening it, I scattered the roseate light that was flooding the room and turning the white muslin of the curtains drawn for the night to golden damask. I went across to the window; the gulls had settled again upon the waves; but this time they were pink. I drew Albertine\u2019s attention to them. \u201cDon\u2019t change the subject,\u201d she said, \u201cbe frank with me.\u201d I lied. I declared to her that she must first listen to a confession, that of my passionate admiration, for some time past, of Andr\u00e9e, and I made her this confession with a simplicity and frankness worthy of the stage, but seldom employed in real life except for a love which people do not feel. Harking back to the fiction I had employed with Gilberte before my first visit to Balbec, but adapting its terms, I went so far (in order to make her more ready to believe me when I told her now that I was not in love with her) as to let fall the admission that at one time I had been on the point of falling in love with her, but that too long an interval had elapsed, that she could be nothing more to me now than a good friend and comrade, and that even if I wished to feel once again a more ardent sentiment for her it would be quite beyond my power. As it happened, in taking my stand thus before Albertine on these protestations of coldness towards her, I was merely \u2014 because of a particular circumstance and with a particular object in view \u2014 making more perceptible, accentuating more markedly, that dual rhythm which love adopts in all those who have too little confidence in themselves to believe that a woman can ever fall in love with them, and also that they themselves can genuinely fall in love with her. They know themselves well enough to have observed that in the presence of the most divergent types of woman they felt the same hopes, the same agonies, invented the same romances, uttered the same words, to have deduced therefore that their sentiments, their actions bear no close and necessary relation to the woman they love, but pass by her, spatter her, surround her, like the waves that break round upon the rocks, and their sense of their own instability increases still further their misgivings that this woman, by whom they would so fain be loved, is not in love with them. Why should chance have brought it about, when she is simply an accident placed so as to catch the ebullience of our desire, that we should ourselves be the object of the desire that is animating her? And so, while we feel the need to pour out before her all those sentiments, so different from the merely human sentiments that our neighbour inspires in us, those so highly specialised sentiments which are a lover\u2019s, after we have taken a step forward, in avowing to her whom we love our affection for her, our hopes, overcome at once by the fear of offending her, ashamed too that the speech we have addressed to her was not composed expressly for her, that it has served us already, will serve us again for others, that if she does not love us she cannot understand us and we have spoken in that case with the want of taste, of modesty shewn by the pedant who addresses an ignorant audience in subtle phrases which are not for them, this fear, this shame bring into play the counter-rhythm, the reflux, the need, even by first drawing back, hotly denying the affection we have already confessed, to resume the offensive, and to recapture her esteem, to dominate her; the double rhythm is perceptible in the various periods of a single love affair, in all the corresponding periods of similar love affairs, in all those people whose self-analysis outweighs their self-esteem. If it was however somewhat more vigorously accentuated than usual in this speech which I was now preparing to make to Albertine, that was simply to allow me to pass more speedily and more emphatically to the alternate rhythm which should sound my affection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As though it must be painful to Albertine to believe what I was saying to her as to the impossibility of my loving her again, after so long an interval, I justified what I called an eccentricity of my nature by examples taken from people with whom I had, by their fault or my own, allowed the time for loving them to pass, and been unable, however keenly I might have desired it, to recapture it. I thus appeared at one and the same time to be apologising to her, as for a want of courtesy, for this inability to begin loving her again, and to be seeking to make her understand the psychological reasons for that incapacity as though they had been peculiar to myself. But by explaining myself in this fashion, by dwelling upon the case of Gilberte, in regard to whom the argument had indeed been strictly true which was becoming so far from true when applied to Albertine, all that I did was to render my assertions as plausible as I pretended to believe that they were not. Feeling that Albertine appreciated what she called my \u2018frank speech\u2019 and recognising in my deductions the clarity of the evidence, I apologised for the former by telling her that I knew that the truth was always unpleasant and in this instance must seem to her incomprehensible. She, on the contrary, thanked me for my sincerity and added that so far from being puzzled she understood perfectly a state of mind so frequent and so natural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This avowal to Albertine of an imaginary sentiment for Andr\u00e9e, and, towards herself, an indifference which, that it might appear altogether sincere and without exaggeration, I assured her incidentally, as though by a scruple of politeness, must not be taken too literally, enabled me at length, without any fear of Albertine\u2019s suspecting me of loving her, to speak to her with a tenderness which I had so long denied myself and which seemed to me exquisite. I almost caressed my confidant; as I spoke to her of her friend whom I loved, tears came to my eyes. But, coming at last to the point, I said to her that she knew what love meant, its susceptibilities, its sufferings, and that perhaps, as the old friend that she now was, she might feel it in her heart to put a stop to the bitter grief that she was causing me, not directly, since it was not herself that I loved, if I might venture to repeat that without offending her, but indirectly by wounding me in my love for Andr\u00e9e. I broke off to admire and point out to Albertine a great bird, solitary and hastening, which far out in front of us, lashing the air with the regular beat of its wings, was passing at full speed over the beach stained here and there with reflexions like little torn scraps of red paper, and crossing it from end to end without slackening its pace, without diverting its attention, without deviating from its path, like an envoy carrying far afield an urgent and vital message. \u201cHe at least goes straight to the point!\u201d said Albertine in a tone of reproach. \u201cYou say that because you don\u2019t know what it is I was going to tell you. But it is so difficult that I prefer to give it up; I am certain that I should make you angry; and then all that will have happened will be this: I shall be in no way better off with the girl I really love and I shall have lost a good friend.\u201d \u201cBut when I swear to you that I will not be angry.\u201d She had so sweet, so wistfully docile an air, as though her whole happiness depended on me, that I could barely restrain myself from kissing \u2014 with almost the same kind of pleasure that I should have taken in kissing my mother \u2014 this novel face which no longer presented the startled, blushing expression of a rebellious and perverse kitten with its little pink, tip-tilted nose, but seemed, in the fulness of its crushing sorrow, moulded in broad, flattened, drooping slabs of pure goodness. Making an abstraction of my love as of a chronic mania that had no connexion with her, putting myself in her place, I let my heart be melted before this honest girl, accustomed to being treated in a friendly and loyal fashion, whom the good comrade that she might have supposed me had been pursuing for weeks past with persecutions which had at last arrived at their culminating point. It was because I placed myself at a standpoint that was purely human, external to both of us, at which my jealous love dissolved, that I felt for Albertine that profound pity, which would have been less profound if I had not loved her. However, in that rhythmical oscillation which leads from a declaration to a quarrel (the surest, the most certainly perilous way of forming by opposite and successive movements a knot which will not be loosed and attaches us firmly to a person by the strain of the movement of withdrawal which constitutes one of the two elements of the rhythm), of what use is it to analyse farther the refluences of human pity, which, the opposite of love, though springing perhaps unconsciously from the same cause, produces in every case the same effects? When we count up afterwards the total amount of all that we have done for a woman, we often discover that the actions prompted by the desire to shew that we love her, to make her love us, to win her favours, bulk little if any greater than those due to the human need to repair the wrongs that we have done to the creature whom we love, from a mere sense of moral duty, as though we were not in love with her. \u201cBut tell me, what on earth have I done?\u201d Albertine asked me. There was a knock at the door; it was the lift-boy; Albertine\u2019s aunt, who was passing the hotel in a carriage, had stopped on the chance of finding her there, to take her home. Albertine sent word that she could not come, that they were to begin dinner without her, that she could not say at what time she would return. \u201cBut won\u2019t your aunt be angry?\u201d \u201cWhat do you suppose? She will understand all right.\u201d And so, at this moment at least, a moment such as might never occur again \u2014 a conversation with myself was proved by this incident to be in Albertine\u2019s eyes a thing of such self-evident importance that it must be given precedence over everything, a thing to which, referring no doubt instinctively to a family code, enumerating certain crises in which, when the career of M. Bontemps was at stake, a journey had been made without a thought, my friend never doubted that her aunt would think it quite natural to see her sacrifice the dinner-hour. That remote hour which she passed without my company, among her own people, Albertine, having brought it to me, bestowed it on me; I might make what use of it I chose. I ended by making bold to tell her what had been reported to me about her way of living, and that notwithstanding the profound disgust that I felt for women tainted with that vice, I had not given it a thought until I had been told the name of her accomplice, and that she could readily understand, loving Andr\u00e9e as I did, the grief that, the news had caused me. It would have been more tactful perhaps to say that I had been given the names of other women as well, in whom I was not interested. But the sudden and terrible revelation that Cottard had made to me had entered my heart to lacerate it, complete in itself but without accretions. And just as, before that moment, it would never have occurred to me that Albertine was in love with Andr\u00e9e, or at any rate could find pleasure in caressing her, if Cottard had not drawn my attention to their attitude as they waltzed together, so I had been incapable of passing from that idea to the idea, so different for me, that Albertine might have, with other women than Andr\u00e9e, relations for which affection could not be pleaded in excuse. Albertine, before even swearing to me that it was not true, shewed, like everyone upon learning that such things are being said about him, anger, concern, and, with regard to the unknown slanderer, a fierce curiosity to know who he was and a desire to be confronted with him so as to be able to confound him. But she assured me that she bore me, at least, no resentment. \u201cIf it had been true, I should have told you. But Andr\u00e9e and I both loathe that sort of thing. We have not lived all these years without seeing women with cropped hair who behave like men and do the things you mean, and nothing revolts us more.\u201d Albertine gave me merely her word, a peremptory word unsupported by proof. But this was just what was best calculated to calm me, jealousy belonging to that family of sickly doubts which are better purged by the energy than by the probability of an affirmation. It is moreover the property of love to make us at once more distrustful and more credulous, to make us suspect, more readily than we should suspect anyone else, her whom we love, and be convinced more easily by her denials. We must be in love before we can care that all women are not virtuous, which is to say before we can be aware of the fact, and we must be in love too before we can hope, that is to say assure ourselves that some are. It is human to seek out what hurts us and then at once to seek to get rid of it. The statements that are capable of so relieving us seem quite naturally true, we are not inclined to cavil at a sedative that acts. Besides, however multiform may be the person with whom we are in love, she can in any case offer us two essential personalities accordingly as she appears to us as ours, or as turning her desires in another direction. The former of these personalities possesses the peculiar power which prevents us from believing in the reality of the other, the secret remedy to heal the sufferings that this latter has caused us. The beloved object is successively the malady and the remedy that suspends and aggravates it. No doubt, I had long since been prepared, by the strong impression made on my imagination and my faculty for emotion by the example of Swann, to believe in the truth of what I feared rather than of what I should have wished. And so the comfort brought me by Albertine\u2019s affirmations came near to being jeopardised for a moment, because I was reminded of the story of Odette. But I told myself that, if it was only right to allow for the worst, not only when, in order to understand Swann\u2019s sufferings, I had tried to put myself in his place, but now, when I myself was concerned, in seeking the truth as though it referred to some one else, still I must not, out of cruelty to myself, a soldier who chooses the post not where he can be of most use but where he is most exposed, end in the mistake of regarding one supposition as more true than the rest, simply because it was more painful. Was there not a vast gulf between Albertine, a girl of good, middle-class parentage, and Odette, a courtesan bartered by her mother in her childhood? There could be no comparison of their respective credibility. Besides, Albertine had in no respect the same interest in lying to me that Odette had had in lying to Swann. Moreover to him Odette had admitted what Albertine had just denied. I should therefore be guilty of an error in reasoning as serious \u2014 though in the opposite direction \u2014 as that which had inclined me towards a certain hypothesis because it had caused me less pain than the rest, were I not to take into account these material differences in their positions, but to reconstruct the real life of my mistress solely from what I had been told about the life of Odette. I had before me a new Albertine, of whom I had already, it was true, caught more than one glimpse towards the end of my previous visit to Balbec, frank and honest, an Albertine who had, out of affection for myself, forgiven me my suspicions and tried to dispel them. She made me sit down by her side upon my bed. I thanked her for what she had said to me, assured her that our reconciliation was complete, and that I would never be horrid to her again. I suggested to her that she ought, at the same time, to go home to dinner. She asked me whether I was not glad to have her with me. Drawing my head towards her for a caress which she had never before given me and which I owed perhaps to the healing of our rupture, she passed her tongue lightly over my lips which she attempted to force apart. At first I kept them tight shut. \u201cYou are a great bear!\u201d she informed me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ought to have left the place that evening and never set eyes on her again. I felt even then that in a love which is not reciprocated \u2014 I might as well say, in love, for there are people for whom there is no such thing as reciprocated love \u2014 we can enjoy only that simulacrum of happiness which had been given me at one of those unique moments in which a woman\u2019s good nature, or her caprice, or mere chance, bring to our desires, in perfect coincidence, the same words, the same actions as if we were really loved. The wiser course would have been to consider with curiosity, to possess with delight that little parcel of happiness failing which I should have died without ever suspecting what it could mean to hearts less difficult to please or more highly favoured; to suppose that it formed part of a vast and enduring happiness of which this fragment only was visible to me, and \u2014 lest the next day should expose this fiction \u2014 not to attempt to ask for any fresh favour after this, which had been due only to the artifice of an exceptional moment. I ought to have left Balbec, to have shut myself up in solitude, to have remained so in harmony with the last vibrations of the voice which I had contrived to render amorous for an instant, and of which I should have asked nothing more than that it might never address another word to me; for fear lest, by an additional word which now could only be different, it might shatter with a discord the sensitive silence in which, as though by the pressure of a pedal, there might long have survived in me the throbbing chord of happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soothed by my explanation with Albertine, I began once again to live in closer intimacy with my mother. She loved to talk to me gently about the days in which my grandmother had been younger. Fearing that I might reproach myself with the sorrows with which I had perhaps darkened the close of my grandmother\u2019s life, she preferred to turn back to the years when the first signs of my dawning intelligence had given my grandmother a satisfaction which until now had always been kept from me. We talked of the old days at Combray. My mother reminded me that there at least I used to read, and that at Balbec I might well do the same, if I was not going to work. I replied that, to surround myself with memories of Combray and of the charming coloured plates, I should like to read again the Thousand and One Nights. As, long ago at Combray, when she gave me books for my birthday, so it was in secret, as a surprise for me, that my mother now sent for both the Thousand and One Nights of Galland and the Thousand Nights and a Night of Mardrus. But, after casting her eye over the two translations, my mother would have preferred that I should stick to Galland\u2019s, albeit hesitating to influence me because of the respect that she felt for intellectual liberty, her dread of interfering with my intellectual life and the feeling that, being a woman, on the one hand she lacked, or so she thought, the necessary literary equipment, and on the other hand ought not to condemn because she herself was shocked by it the reading of a young man. Happening upon certain of the tales, she had been revolted by the immorality of the subject and the crudity of the expression. But above all, preserving, like precious relics, not only the brooch, the sunshade, the cloak, the volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, but also the habits of thought and speech of her mother, seeking on every occasion the opinion that she would have expressed, my mother could have no doubt of the horror with which my grandmother would have condemned Mardrus\u2019s book. She remembered that at Combray while before setting out for a walk, M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I was reading Augustin Thierry, my grandmother, glad that I should be reading, and taking walks, was indignant nevertheless at seeing him whose name remained enshrined in the hemistich: \u2018Then reign\u00e8d M\u00e9rov\u00e9e\u2019 called Merowig, refused to say \u2018Carolingians\u2019 for the \u2018Carlovingians\u2019 to which she remained loyal. And then I told her what my grandmother had thought of the Greek names which Bloch, following Leconte de Lisle, gave to the gods of Homer, going so far, in the simplest matters, as to make it a religious duty, in which he supposed literary talent to consist, to adopt a Greek system of spelling. Having occasion, for instance, to mention in a letter that the wine which they drank at his home was real nectar, he would write \u2018real nektar,\u2019 with a k, which enabled him to titter at the mention of Lamartine. And if an Odyssey from which the names of Ulysses and Minerva were missing was no longer the Odyssey to her, what would she have said upon seeing corrupted even upon the cover the title of her Thousand and One Nights, upon no longer finding, exactly transcribed as she had all her life been in the habit of pronouncing them, the immortally familiar names of Scheherazade, of Dinarzade, in which, debaptised themselves (if one may use the expression of Musulman tales), the charming Caliph and the powerful Genies were barely recognisable, being renamed, he the \u2018Khalifat\u2019 and they the \u2018Gennis.\u2019 Still, my mother handed over both books to me, and I told her that I would read them on the days when I. felt too tired to go out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These days were not very frequent, however. We used to go out picnicking as before in a band, Albertine, her friends and myself, on the cliff or to the farm called Marie-Antoinette. But there were times when Albertine bestowed on me this great pleasure. She would say to me: \u201cTo-day I want to be alone with you for a little, it will be nicer if we are just by ourselves.\u201d Then she would give out that she was busy, not that she need furnish any explanation, and so that the others, if they went all the same, without us, for an excursion and picnic, might not be able to find us, we would steal away like a pair of lovers, all by ourselves to Bagatelle or the Cross of Heulan, while the band, who would never think of looking for us there and never went there, waited indefinitely, in the hope of seeing us appear, at Marie-Antoinette. I recall the hot weather that we had then, when from the brow of each of the farm-labourers toiling in the sun a drop of sweat would fall, vertical, regular, intermittent, like the drop of water from a cistern, and alternate with the fall of the ripe fruit dropping from the tree in the adjoining \u2018closes\u2019; they have remained, to this day, with that mystery of a woman\u2019s secret, the most substantial part of every love that offers itself to me. A woman who has been mentioned to me and to whom I would not give a moment\u2019s thought \u2014 I upset all my week\u2019s engagements to make her acquaintance, if it is a week of similar weather, and I am to meet her in some isolated farmhouse. It is no good my knowing that this kind of weather, this kind of assignation are not part of her, they are still the bait, which I know all too well, by which I allow myself to be tempted and which is sufficient to hook me. I know that this woman, in cold weather, in a town, I might perhaps have desired, but without the accompaniment of a romantic sentiment, without becoming amorous; my love for her is none the less keen as soon as, by force of circumstances, it has enthralled me \u2014 it is only the more melancholy, as in the course of life our sentiments for other people become, in proportion as we become more clearly aware of the ever smaller part that they play in our life and that the new love which we would like to be so permanent, cut short in the same moment as life itself, will be the last\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were still but a few people at Balbec, hardly any girls. Sometimes I saw some girl resting upon the beach, devoid of charm, and yet apparently identified by various features as one whom I had been in despair at not being able to approach at the moment when she emerged with her friends from the riding school or gymnasium. If it was the same (and I took care not to mention the matter to Albertine), then the girl that I had thought so exciting did not exist. But I could not arrive at any certainty, for the face of any one of these girls did not fill any space upon the beach, did not offer a permanent form, contracted, dilated, transformed as it was by my own observation, the uneasiness of my desire or a sense of comfort that was self-sufficient, by the different clothes that she was wearing, the rapidity of her movements or her immobility. All the same, two or three of them seemed to me adorable. Whenever I saw one of these, I longed to take her away along the Avenue des Tamaris, or among the sandhills, better still upon the cliff. But, albeit into desire, as opposed to indifference, there enters already that audacity which is a first stage, if only unilateral, towards realisation, all the same, between my desire and the action that my request to be allowed to kiss her would have been, there was all the indefinite blank of hesitation, of timidity. Then I went into the pastrycook\u2019s bar, I drank, one after another, seven or eight glasses of port wine. At once, instead of the impassable gulf between my desire and action, the effect of the alcohol traced a line that joined them together. No longer was there any room for hesitation or fear. It seemed to me that the girl was about to fly into my arms. I went up to her, the words came spontaneously to my lips: \u201cI should like to go for a walk with you. You wouldn\u2019t care to go along the cliff, we shan\u2019t be disturbed behind the little wood that keeps the wind off the wooden bungalow that is empty just now?\u201d All the difficulties of life were smoothed away, there was no longer any obstacle to the conjunction of our two bodies. No obstacle for me, at least. For they had not been volatilised for her, who had not been drinking port wine. Had she done so, had the outer world lost some of its reality in her eyes, the long cherished dream that would then have appeared to her to be suddenly realisable might perhaps have been not at all that of falling into my arms\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only were the girls few in number but at this season which was not yet \u2018the season\u2019 they stayed but a short time. There is one I remember with a reddish skin, green eyes and a pair of ruddy cheeks, whose slight symmetrical face resembled the winged seeds of certain trees. I cannot say what breeze wafted her to Balbec or what other bore her away. So sudden was her removal that for some days afterwards I was haunted by a grief which I made bold to confess to Albertine when I realised that the girl had gone for ever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should add that several of them were either girls whom I did not know at all or whom I had not seen for years. Often, before addressing them, I wrote to them. If their answer allowed me to believe in the possibility of love, what joy! We cannot, at the outset of our friendship with a woman, even if that friendship is destined to come to nothing, bear to part from those first letters that we have received from her. We like to have them beside us all the time, like a present of rare flowers, still quite fresh, at which we cease to gaze only to draw them closer to us and smell them. The sentence that we know by heart, it is pleasant to read again, and in those that we have committed less accurately to memory we like to verify the degree of affection in some expression. Did she write: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019? A slight marring of our bliss, which must be ascribed either to our having read too quickly, or to the illegible handwriting of our correspondent; she did not say: \u2018Your dear letter\u2019 but \u2018From your letter.\u2019 But the rest is so tender. Oh, that more such flowers may come to-morrow. Then that is no longer enough, we must with the written words compare the writer\u2019s eyes, her face. We make an appointment, and \u2014 without her having altered, perhaps \u2014 whereas we expected, from the description given us or our personal memory, to meet the fairy Viviane, we encounter Puss-in-Boots. We make an appointment, nevertheless, for the following day, for it is, after all, she, and the person we desired is she. And these desires for a woman of whom we have been dreaming do not make beauty of form and feature essential. These desires are only the desire for a certain person; vague as perfumes, as styrax was the desire of Prothyraia, saffron the ethereal desire, aromatic scents the desire of Hera, myrrh the perfume of the Magi, manna the desire of Nike, incense the perfume of the sea. But these perfumes that are sung in the Orphic hymns are far fewer in number than the deities they worship. Myrrh is the perfume of the Magi, but also of Protogonos, Neptune, Nereus, Leto; incense is the perfume of the sea, but also of the fair Dike, of Themis, of Circe, of the Nine Muses, of Eos, of Mnemosyne, of the Day, of Dikaiosyne. As for styrax, manna and aromatic scents, it would be impossible to name all the deities that inhale them, so many are they. Amphietes has all the perfumes except incense, and Gaia rejects only beans and aromatic scents. So was it with these desires for different girls that I felt. Fewer in number than the girls themselves, they changed into disappointments and regrets closely similar one to another. I never wished for myrrh. I reserved it for Jupien and for the Prince de Guermantes, for it is the desire of Protogonos \u201cof twofold sex, who roars like a bull, of countless orgies, memorable, unspeakable, descending, joyous, to the sacrifices of the Orgiophants.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But presently the season was in full swing; every day there was some fresh arrival, and for the sudden increase in the frequency of my outings, which took the place of the charmed perusal of the Thousand and One Nights, there was a reason devoid of pleasure which poisoned them all. The beach was now peopled with girls, and, since the idea suggested to me by Cottard had not indeed furnished me with fresh suspicions but had rendered me sensitive and weak in that quarter and careful not to let any suspicion take shape in my mind, as soon as a young woman arrived at Balbec, I began to feel ill at ease, I proposed to Albertine the most distant excursions, in order that she might not make the newcomer\u2019s acquaintance, and indeed, if possible, might not set eyes on her. I dreaded naturally even more those women whose dubious ways were remarked or their bad reputation already known; I tried to persuade my mistress that this bad reputation had no foundation, was a slander, perhaps, without admitting it to myself, from a fear, still unconscious, that she might seek to make friends with the depraved woman or regret her inability to do so, because of me, or might conclude from the number of examples that a vice so widespread was not to be condemned. In denying the guilt of each of them, my intention was nothing less than to pretend that sapphism did not exist. Albertine adopted my incredulity as to the viciousness of this one or that. \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s just a pose, she wants to look the part.\u201d But then, I regretted almost that I had pleaded the other\u2019s innocence, for it distressed me that Albertine, formerly so severe, could believe that this \u2018part\u2019 was a thing so flattering, so advantageous, that a woman innocent of such tastes could seek to \u2018look it.\u2019 I would have liked to be sure that no more women were coming to Balbec; I trembled when I thought that, as it was almost time for Mme. Putbus to arrive at the Verdurins\u2019, her maid, whose tastes Saint-Loup had not concealed from me, might take it into her head to come down to the beach, and, if it were a day on which I was not with Albertine, might seek to corrupt her. I went the length of asking myself whether, as Cottard had made no secret of the fact that the Verdurins thought highly of me and, while not wishing to appear, as he put it, to be running after me, would give a great deal to have me come to their house, I might not, on the strength of promises to bring all the Guermantes in existence to call on them in Paris, induce Mme. Verdurin, upon some pretext or other, to inform Mme. Putbus that it was impossible to keep her there any longer and make her leave the place at once. Notwithstanding these thoughts, and as it was chiefly the presence of Andr\u00e9e that was disturbing me, the soothing effect that Albertine\u2019s words had had upon me still to some extent persisted \u2014 I knew moreover that presently I should have less need of it, as Andr\u00e9e would be leaving the place with Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le just about the time when the crowd began to arrive and would be spending only a few weeks more with Albertine. During these weeks, moreover, Albertine seemed to have planned everything that she did, everything that she said, with a view to destroying my suspicions if any remained, or to prevent them from reviving. She contrived never to be left alone with Andr\u00e9e, and insisted, when we came back from an excursion, upon my accompanying her to her door, upon my coming to fetch her when we were going anywhere. Andr\u00e9e meanwhile took just as much trouble on her side, seemed to avoid meeting Albertine. And this apparent understanding between them was not the only indication that Albertine must have informed her friend of our conversation and have asked her to be so kind as to calm my absurd suspicions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About this time there occurred at the Grand Hotel a scandal which was not calculated to modify the intensity of my torment. Bloch\u2019s cousin had for some time past been indulging, with a retired actress, in secret relations which presently ceased to satisfy them. That they should be seen seemed to them to add perversity to their pleasure, they chose to flaunt their perilous sport before the eyes of all the world. They began with caresses, which might, after all, be set down to a friendly intimacy, in the card-room, by the baccarat-table. Then they grew more bold. And finally, one evening, in a corner that was not even dark of the big ball-room, on a sofa, they made no more attempt to conceal what they were doing than if they had been in bed. Two officers who happened to be near, with their wives, complained to the manager. It was thought for a moment that their protest would be effective. But they had this against them that, having come over for the evening from Netteholme, where they were staying, they could not be of any use to the manager. Whereas, without her knowing it even, and whatever remarks the manager may have made to her, there hovered over Mlle. Bloch the protection of M. Nissim Bernard. I must explain why. M. Nissim Bernard carried to their highest pitch the family virtues. Every year he took a magnificent villa at Balbec for his nephew, and no invitation would have dissuaded him from going home to dine at his own table, which was in reality theirs. But he never took his luncheon at home. Every day at noon he was at the Grand Hotel. The fact of the matter was that he was keeping, as other men keep a chorus-girl from the opera, an embryo waiter of much the same type as the pages of whom we have spoken, and who made us think of the young Israelites inEsther and Athalie. It is true that the forty years\u2019 difference in age between M. Nis-sim Bernard and the young waiter ought to have preserved the latter from a contact that was scarcely pleasant. But, as Racine so wisely observes in those same choruses:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Great God, with what uncertain tread\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A budding virtue \u2018mid such perils goes!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What stumbling-blocks do lie before a soul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That seeks Thee and would fain be innocent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The young waiter might indeed have been brought up \u2018remote from the world\u2019 in the Temple-Caravanserai of Balbec, he had not followed the advice of Joad:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In riches and in gold put not thy trust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had perhaps justified himself by saying: \u201cThe wicked cover the earth.\u201d However that might be, and albeit M. Nissim Bernard had not expected so rapid a conquest, on the very first day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were\u2019t in alarm, or anxious to caress\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt those childish arms about him thrown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And by the second day, M. Nissim Bernard having taken the young waiter out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dire assault his innocence destroyed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that moment the boy\u2019s life was altered. He might indeed carry bread and salt, as his superior bade him, his whole face sang:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From flowers to flowers, from joys to keener joys\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let our desires now range\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uncertain is our tale of fleeting years\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Haste we then to enjoy this life!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honours and fame are the reward\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of blind and meek obedience\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For moping innocence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who now would raise his voice!\n\nSince that day, M. Nissim Bernard had never failed to come and occupy his seat at the luncheon-table (as a man would occupy his in the stalls who was keeping a dancer, a dancer in this case of a distinct and special type, which still awaits its Degas). It was M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s delight to follow over the floor of the restaurant and down the remote vista to where beneath her palm the cashier sat enthroned, the evolutions of the adolescent hurrying in service, in the service of everyone, and, less than anyone, of M. Nissim Bernard, now that the latter was keeping him, whether because the young chorister did not think it necessary to display the same friendliness to a person by whom he supposed himself to be sufficiently well loved, or because that love annoyed him or he feared lest, if discovered, it might make him lose other opportunities. But this very coldness pleased M. Nissim Bernard, because of all that it concealed; whether from Hebraic atavism or from profanation of the Christian spirit, he took a singular pleasure, were it Jewish or Catholic, in the Racinian ceremony. Had it been a real performance of Esther or Athalie, M. Bernard would have regretted that the gulf of centuries must prevent him from making the acquaintance of the author, Jean Racine, so that he might obtain for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 a more substantial part. But as the luncheon ceremony came from no author\u2019s pen, he contented himself with being on good terms with the manager and Aim\u00e9, so that the \u2018young Israelite\u2019 might be promoted to the coveted post of under-waiter, or even full waiter to a row of tables. The post of wine waiter had been offered him. But M. Bernard made him decline it, for he would no longer have been able to come every day to watch him race about the green dining-room and to be waited upon by him like a stranger. Now this pleasure was so keen that every year M. Bernard returned to Balbec and took his luncheon away from home, habits in which M. Bloch saw, in the former a poetical fancy for the bright sunshine, the sunsets of this coast favoured above all others, in the latter the inveterate mania of an old bachelor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, the mistake made by M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s relatives, who never suspected the true reason for his annual return to Balbec and for what the pedantic Mme. Bloch called his absentee palate, was really a more profound and secondary truth. For M. Nissim Bernard himself was unaware how much there was of love for the beach at Balbec, for the view one enjoyed from the restaurant over the sea, and of maniacal habits in the fancy that he had for keeping, like a dancing girl of another kind which still lacks a Degas, one of his servants the rest of whom were still girls. And so M. Nissim Bernard maintained, with the director of this theatre which was the hotel at Balbec, and with the stage-manager and producer Aim\u00e9\u2014 whose part in all this affair was anything but simple \u2014 excellent relations. One day they would intrigue to procure an important part, a place perhaps as headwaiter. In the meantime M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s pleasure, poetical and calmly contemplative as it might be, reminded one a little of those women-loving men who always know \u2014 Swann, for example, in the past \u2014 that if they go out to a party they will meet their mistress. No sooner had M. Nissim Bernard taken his seat than he would see the object of his affections appear on the scene, bearing in his hand fruit or cigars upon a tray. And so every morning, after kissing his niece, bothering my friend Bloch about his work and feeding his horses with lumps of sugar from the palm of his outstretched hand, he would betray a feverish haste to arrive in time for luncheon at the Grand Hotel. Had the house been on fire, had his niece had a stroke, he would doubtless have started off just the same. So that he dreaded like the plague a cold that would confine him to his bed \u2014 for he was a hypochondriac \u2014 and would oblige him to ask Aim\u00e9 to send his young friend across to visit him at home, between luncheon and tea-time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He loved moreover all the labyrinth of corridors, private offices, reception-rooms, cloakrooms, larders, galleries which composed the hotel at Balbec. With a strain of oriental atavism he loved a seraglio, and when he went out at night might be seen furtively exploring its passages. While, venturing down to the basement and endeavouring at the same time to escape notice and to avoid a scandal, M. Nissim Bernard, in his quest of the young L\u00e9vites, put one in mind of those lines in La Juive:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O God of our Fathers, come down to us again\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our mysteries veil from the eyes of wicked men!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I on the contrary would go up to the room of two sisters who had come to Balbec, as her maids, with an old lady, a foreigner. They were what the language of hotels called \u2018couriers,\u2019 and that of Fran\u00e7oise, who imagined that a courier was a person who was there to run his course, two \u2018coursers.\u2019 The hotels have remained, more nobly, in the period when people sang: \u201cC\u2019est un courrier de cabinet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Difficult as it was for a visitor to penetrate to the servants\u2019 quarters, I had very soon formed a mutual bond of friendship, as strong as it was pure, with these two young persons, Mademoiselle Marie Gineste and Madame C\u00e9leste Albaret. Born at the foot of the high mountains in the centre of France, on the banks of rivulets and torrents (the water passed actually under their old home, turning a millwheel, and the house had often been damaged by floods), they seemed to embody the features of that region. Marie Gineste was more regularly rapid and abrupt, C\u00e9leste Albaret softer and more languishing, spread out like a lake, but with terrible boiling rages in which her fury suggested the peril of spates and gales that sweep everything before them. They often came in the morning to see me when I was still in bed. I have never known people so deliberately ignorant, who had learned absolutely nothing at school, and yet whose language was somehow so literary that, but for the almost savage naturalness of their tone, one would have thought their speech affected. With a familiarity which I reproduce verbatim, notwithstanding the praises (which I set down here in praise not of myself but of the strange genius of C\u00e9leste) and the criticisms, equally unfounded, in which her remarks seem to involve me, while I dipped crescent rolls in my milk, C\u00e9leste would say to me: \u201cOh! Little black devil with hair of jet, O profound wickedness! I don\u2019t know what your mother was thinking of when she made you, for you are just like a bird. Look, Marie, wouldn\u2019t you say he was preening his feathers, and turning his head right round, so light he looks, you would say he was just learning to fly. Ah! It\u2019s fortunate for you that those who bred you brought you into the world to rank and riches; what would ever have become of you, so wasteful as you are. Look at him throwing away his crescent because it touched the bed. There he goes, now, look, he\u2019s spilling his milk, wait till I tie a napkin round you, for you could never do it for yourself, never in my life have I seen anyone so helpless and so clumsy as you.\u201d I would then hear the more regular sound of the torrent of Marie Gineste who was furiously reprimanding her sister: \u201cWill you hold your tongue, now, C\u00e9leste. Are you mad, talking to Monsieur like that?\u201d C\u00e9leste merely smiled; and as I detested having a napkin tied round my neck: \u201cNo, Marie, look at him, bang, he\u2019s shot straight up on end like a serpent. A proper serpent, I tell you.\u201d These were but a few of her zoological similes, for, according to her, it was impossible to tell when I slept, I fluttered about all night like a butterfly, and in the day time I was as swift as the squirrels. \u201cYou know, Marie, the way we see them at home, so nimble that even with your eyes you can\u2019t follow them.\u201d \u201cBut, C\u00e9leste, you know he doesn\u2019t like having a napkin when he\u2019s eating.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s so that he can say nobody can make him do anything against his will. He\u2019s a grand gentleman and he wants to shew that he is. They can change the sheets ten times over, if they must, but he won\u2019t give way. Yesterday\u2019s had served their time, but to-day they have only just been put on the bed and they\u2019ll have to be changed already. Oh, I was right when I said that he was never meant to be born among the poor. Look, his hair\u2019s standing on end, swelling with rage like a bird\u2019s feathers. Poor ploumissou!\u201d Here it was not only Marie that protested, but myself, for I did not feel in the least like a grand gentleman. But C\u00e9leste would never believe in the sincerity of my modesty and cut me short. \u201cOh! The story-teller! Oh! The flatterer! Oh! The false one! The cunning rogue! Oh! Moli\u00e8re!\u201d (This was the only writer\u2019s name that she knew, but she applied it to me, meaning thereby a person who was capable both of writing plays and of acting them.) \u201cC\u00e9leste!\u201d came the imperious cry from Marie, who, not knowing the name of Moli\u00e8re, was afraid that it might be some fresh insult. C\u00e9leste continued to smile: \u201cThen you haven\u2019t seen the photograph of him in his drawer, when he was little. He tried to make us believe that he was always dressed quite simply. And there, with his little cane, he\u2019s all furs and laces, such as no Prince ever wore. But that\u2019s nothing compared with his tremendous majesty and kindness which is even more profound.\u201d \u201cSo then,\u201d scolded the torrent Marie, \u201cyou go rummaging in his drawers now, do you?\u201d To calm Marie\u2019s fears I asked her what she thought of M. Nissim Bernard\u2019s behaviour. . . . \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are things I wouldn\u2019t have believed could exist. One has to come here to learn.\u201d And, for once outrivalling C\u00e9leste by an even more profound observation: \u201cAh! You see, Monsieur, one can never tell what there may be in a person\u2019s life.\u201d To change the subject, I spoke to her of the life led by my father, who toiled night and day. \u201cAh! Monsieur, there are people who keep nothing of their life for themselves, not one minute, not one pleasure, the whole thing is a sacrifice for others, they are lives that are given away.\u201d \u201cLook, Marie, he has only to put his hand on the counterpane and take his crescent, what distinction. He can do the most insignificant things, you would say that the whole nobility of France, from here to the Pyrenees, was stirring in each of his movements.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overpowered by this portrait so far from lifelike, I remained silent; C\u00e9leste interpreted my silence as a further instance of guile: \u201cOh! Brow that looks so pure, and hides so many things, nice, cool cheeks like the inside of an almond, little hands of satin all velvety, nails like claws,\u201d and so forth. \u201cThere, Marie, look at him sipping his milk with a devoutness that makes me want to say my prayers. What a serious air! They ought really to take his portrait as he is just now. He\u2019s just like a child. Is it drinking milk, like them, that has kept you their bright colour? Oh! Youth! Oh! Lovely skin. You will never grow old. You are a lucky one, you will never need to raise your hand against anyone, for you have a pair of eyes that can make their will be done. Look at him now, he\u2019s angry. He shoots up, straight as a sign-post.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise did not at all approve of what she called the two \u2018tricksters\u2019 coming to talk to me like this. The manager, who made his staff keep watch over everything that went on, even gave me a serious warning that it was not proper for a visitor to talk to servants. I, who found the \u2018tricksters\u2019 far better than any visitor in the hotel, merely laughed in his face, convinced that he would not understand my explanations. And the sisters returned. \u201cLook, Marie, at his delicate lines. Oh, perfect miniature, finer than the most precious you could see in a glass case, for he can move, and utters words you could listen to for days and nights.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a miracle that a foreign lady could have brought them there, for, without knowing anything of history or geography, they heartily detested the English, the Germans, the Russians, the Italians, all foreign vermin, and cared, with certain exceptions, for French people alone. Their faces had so far preserved the moisture of the pliable clay of their native river beds, that, as soon as one mentioned a foreigner who was staying in the hotel, in order to repeat what he had said, C\u00e9leste and Marie imposed upon their faces his face, their mouths became his mouth, their eyes his eyes, one would have liked to preserve these admirable comic masks. C\u00e9leste indeed, while pretending merely to be repeating what the manager had said, or one of my friends, would insert in her little narrative fictitious remarks in which were maliciously portrayed all the defects of Bloch, the chief magistrate, etc., while apparently unconscious of doing so. It was, under the form of the delivery of a simple message which she had obligingly undertaken to convey, an inimitable portrait. They never read anything, not even a newspaper. One day, however, they found lying on my bed a book. It was a volume of the admirable but obscure poems of Saint-L\u00e9ger L\u00e9ger. C\u00e9leste read a few pages and said to me: \u201cBut are you quite sure that these are poetry, wouldn\u2019t they just be riddles?\u201d Obviously, to a person who had learned in her childhood a single poem: \u201cDown here the lilacs die,\u201d there was a gap in evolution. I fancy that their obstinate refusal to learn anything was due in part to the unhealthy climate of their early home. They had nevertheless all the gifts of a poet with more modesty than poets generally shew. For if C\u00e9leste had said something noteworthy and, unable to remember it correctly, I asked her to repeat it, she would assure me that she had forgotten. They will never read any books, but neither will they ever write any\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was considerably impressed when she learned that the two brothers of these humble women had married, one the niece of the Archbishop of Tours, the other a relative of the Bishop of Rodez. To the manager, this would have conveyed nothing. C\u00e9leste would sometimes reproach her husband with his failure to understand her, and as for me, I was astonished that he could endure her. For at certain moments, raging, furious, destroying everything, she was detestable. It is said that the salt liquid which is our blood is only an internal survival of the primitive marine element. Similarly, I believe that C\u00e9leste, not only in her bursts of fury, but also in her hours of depression preserved the rhythm of her native streams. When she was exhausted, it was after their fashion; she had literally run dry. Nothing could then have revived her. Then all of a sudden the circulation was restored in her large body, splendid and light. The water flowed in the opaline transparence of her bluish skin. She smiled at the sun and became bluer still. At such moments she was truly celestial\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s family might never have suspected the reason which made their uncle never take his luncheon at home and have accepted it from the first as the mania of an elderly bachelor, due perhaps to the demands of his intimacy with some actress; everything that concerned M. Nissim Bernard was tabu to the manager of the Balbec hotel. And that was why, without even referring to the uncle, he had finally not ventured to find fault with the niece, albeit recommending her to be a little more circumspect. And so the girl and her friend who, for some days, had pictured themselves as excluded from the casino and the Grand Hotel, seeing that everything was settled, were delighted to shew those fathers of families who held aloof from them that they might with impunity take the utmost liberties. No doubt they did not go so far as to repeat the public exhibition which had revolted everybody. But gradually they returned to their old ways. And one evening as I came out of the casino which was half in darkness with Albertine and Bloch whom we had met there, they came towards us, linked together, kissing each other incessantly, and, as they passed us, crowed and laughed, uttering indecent cries. Bloch lowered his eyes, so as to seem not to have recognised his cousin, and as for myself I was tortured by the thought that this occult, appalling language was addressed perhaps to Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another incident turned my thoughts even more in the direction of Gomorrah. I had noticed upon the beach a handsome young woman, erect and pale, whose eyes, round their centre, scattered rays so geometrically luminous that one was reminded, on meeting her gaze, of some constellation. I thought how much more beautiful this girl was than Albertine, and that it would be wiser to give up the other. Only, the face of this beautiful young woman had been smoothed by the invisible plane of an utterly low life, of the constant acceptance of vulgar expedients, so much so that her eyes, more noble however than the rest of her face, could radiate nothing but appetites and desires. Well, on the following day, this young woman being seated a long way away from us in the casino, I saw that she never ceased to fasten upon Albertine the alternate, circling fires of her gaze. One would have said that she was making signals to her from a lighthouse. I dreaded my friend\u2019s seeing that she was being so closely observed, I was afraid that these incessantly rekindled glances might have the conventional meaning of an amorous assignation for the morrow. For all I knew, this assignation might not be the first. The young woman with the radiant eyes might have come another year to Balbec. It was perhaps because Albertine had already yielded to her desires, or to those of a friend, that this woman allowed herself to address to her those flashing signals. If so, they did more than demand something for the present, they found a justification in pleasant hours in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This assignation, in that case, must be not the first, but the sequel to adventures shared in past years. And indeed her glance did not say: \u201cWill you?\u201d As soon as the young woman had caught sight of Albertine, she had turned her head and beamed upon her glances charged with recollection, as though she were terribly afraid that my friend might not remember. Albertine, who could see her plainly, remained phlegmatically motionless, with the result that the other, with the same sort of discretion as a man who sees his old mistress with a new lover, ceased to look at her and paid no more attention to her than if she had not existed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, a day or two later, I received a proof of this young woman\u2019s tendencies, and also of the probability of her having known Albertine in the past. Often, in the hall of the casino, when two girls were smitten with mutual desire, a luminous phenomenon occurred, a sort of phosphorescent train passing from one to the other. Let us note in passing that it is by the aid of such materialisations, even if they be imponderable, by these astral signs that set fire to a whole section of the atmosphere, that the scattered Gomorrah tends, in every town, in every village, to reunite its separated members, to reform the biblical city while everywhere the same efforts are being made, be it in view of but a momentary reconstruction, by the nostalgic, the hypocritical, sometimes by the courageous exiles from Sodom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once I saw the stranger whom Albertine had appeared not to recognise, just at the moment when Bloch\u2019s cousin was approaching her. The young woman\u2019s eyes flashed, but it was quite evident that she did not know the Israelite maiden. She beheld her for the first time, felt a desire, a shadow of doubt, by no means the same certainty as in the case of Albertine, Albertine upon whose comradeship she must so far have reckoned that, in the face of her coldness, she had felt the surprise of a foreigner familiar with Paris but not resident there, who, having returned to spend a few weeks there, on the site of the little theatre where he was in the habit of spending pleasant evenings, sees that they have now built a bank\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch\u2019s cousin went and sat down at a table where she turned the pages of a magazine. Presently the young woman came and sat down, with an abstracted air, by her side. But under the table one could presently see their feet wriggling, then their legs and hands, in a confused heap. Words followed, a conversation began, and the young woman\u2019s innocent husband, who had been looking everywhere for her, was astonished to find her making plans for that very evening with a girl whom he did not know. His wife introduced Bloch\u2019s cousin to him as a friend of her childhood, by an inaudible name, for she had forgotten to ask her what her name was. But the husband\u2019s presence made their intimacy advance a stage farther, for they addressed each other as tu, having known each other at their convent, an incident at which they laughed heartily later on, as well as at the hoodwinked husband, with a gaiety which afforded them an excuse for more caresses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Albertine, I cannot say that anywhere in the casino or on the beach was her behaviour with any girl unduly free. I found in it indeed an excess of coldness and indifference which seemed to be more than good breeding, to be a ruse planned to avert suspicion. When questioned by some girl, she had a quick, icy, decent way of replying in a very loud voice: \u201cYes, I shall be going to the tennis court about five. I shall bathe to-morrow morning about eight,\u201d and of at once turning away from the person to whom she had said this \u2014 all of which had a horrible appearance of being meant to put people off the scent, and either to make an assignation, or, the assignation already made in a whisper, to utter this speech, harmless enough in itself, aloud, so as not to attract attention. And when later on I saw her mount her bicycle and scorch away into the distance, I could not help thinking that she was hurrying to overtake the girl to whom she had barely spoken\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only, when some handsome young woman stepped out of a motor-car at the end of the beach, Albertine could not help turning round. And she at once explained: \u201cI was looking at the new flag they\u2019ve put up over the bathing place. The old one was pretty moth-eaten. But I really think this one is mouldier still.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On one occasion Albertine was not content with cold indifference, and this made me all the more wretched. She knew that I was annoyed by the possibility of her sometimes meeting a friend of her aunt, who had a \u2018bad style\u2019 and came now and again to spend a few days with Mme. Bontemps. Albertine had pleased me by telling me that she would not speak to her again. And when this woman came to Incarville, Albertine said: \u201cBy the way, you know she\u2019s here. Have they told you?\u201d as though to shew me that she was not seeing her in secret. One day, when she told me this, she added: \u201cYes, I ran into her on the beach, and knocked against her as I passed, on purpose, to be rude to her.\u201d When Albertine told me this, there came back to my mind a remark made by Mme. Bontemps, to which I had never given a second thought, when she had said to Mme. Swann in my presence how brazen her niece Albertine was, as though that were a merit, and told her how Albertine had reminded some official\u2019s wife that her father had been employed in a kitchen. But a thing said by her whom we love does not long retain its purity; it withers, it decays. An evening or two later, I thought again of Albertine\u2019s remark, and it was no longer the ill breeding of which she was so proud \u2014 and which could only make me smile \u2014 that it seemed to me to signify, it was something else, to wit that Albertine, perhaps even without any definite object, to irritate this woman\u2019s senses, or wantonly to remind her of former proposals, accepted perhaps in the past, had swiftly brushed against her, thought that I had perhaps heard of this as it had been done in public, and had wished to forestall an unfavourable interpretation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the jealousy that was caused me by the women whom Albertine perhaps loved was abruptly to cease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were waiting, Albertine and I, at the Balbec station of the little local railway. We had driven there in the hotel omnibus, because it was raining. Not far away from us was M. Nissim Bernard, with a black eye. He had recently forsaken the chorister from Athalie for the waiter at a much frequented farmhouse in the neighbourhood, known as the \u2018Cherry Orchard.\u2019 This rubicund youth, with his blunt features, appeared for all the world to have a tomato instead of a head. A tomato exactly similar served as head to his twin brother. To the detached observer there is this attraction about these perfect resemblances between pairs of twins, that nature, becoming for the moment industrialised, seems to be offering a pattern for sale. Unfortunately M. Nissim Bernard looked at it from another point of view, and this resemblance was only external. Tomato II shewed a frenzied zeal in furnishing the pleasures exclusively of ladies, Tomato I did not mind condescending to meet the wishes of certain gentlemen. Now on each occasion when, stirred, as though by a reflex action, by the memory of pleasant hours spent with Tomato I, M. Bernard presented himself at the Cherry Orchard, being short-sighted (not that one need be short-sighted to mistake them), the old Israelite, unconsciously playing Amphitryon, would accost the twin brother with: \u201cWill you meet me somewhere this evening?\u201d He at once received a resounding smack in the face. It might even be repeated in the course of a single meal, when he continued with the second brother the conversation he had begun with the first. In the end this treatment so disgusted him, by association of ideas, with tomatoes, even of the edible variety, that whenever he heard a newcomer order that vegetable, at the next table to his own, in the Grand Hotel, he would murmur to him: \u201cYou must excuse me, Sir, for addressing you, without an introduction. But I heard you order tomatoes. They are stale to-day. I tell you in your own interest, for it makes no difference to me, I never touch them myself.\u201d The stranger would reply with effusive thanks to this philanthropic and disinterested neighbour, call back the waiter, pretend to have changed his mind: \u201cNo, on second thoughts, certainly not, no tomatoes.\u201d Aim\u00e9, who had seen it all before, would laugh to himself, and think: \u201cHe\u2019s an old rascal, that Monsieur Bernard, he\u2019s gone and made another of them change his order.\u201d M. Bernard, as he waited for the already overdue tram, shewed no eagerness to speak to Albertine and myself, because of his black eye. We were even less eager to speak to him. It would however have been almost inevitable if, at that moment, a bicycle had not come dashing towards us; the lift-boy sprang from its saddle, breathless. Madame Verdurin had telephoned shortly after we left the hotel, to know whether I would dine with her two days later; we shall see presently why. Then, having given me the message in detail, the lift-boy left us, and, being one of these democratic \u2018employees\u2019 who affect independence with regard to the middle classes, and among themselves restore the principle of authority, explained: \u201cI must be off, because of my chiefs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine\u2019s girl friends had gone, and would be away for some time. I was anxious to provide her with distractions. Even supposing that she might have found some happiness in spending the afternoons with no company but my own, at Balbec, I knew that such happiness is never complete, and that Albertine, being still at the age (which some of us never outgrow) when we have not yet discovered that this imperfection resides in the person who receives the happiness and not in the person who gives it, might have been tempted to put her disappointment down to myself. I preferred that she should impute it to circumstances which, arranged by myself, would not give us an opportunity of being alone together, while at the same time preventing her from remaining in the casino and on the beach without me. And so I had asked her that day to come with me to Donci\u00e8res, where I was going to meet Saint-Loup. With a similar hope of occupying her mind, I advised her to take up painting, in which she had had lessons in the past. While working she would not ask herself whether she was happy or unhappy. I would gladly have taken her also to dine now and again with the Verdurins and the Cambremers, who certainly would have been delighted to see any friend introduced by myself, but I must first make certain that Mme. Putbus was not yet at la Raspeli\u00e8re. It was only by going there in person that I could make sure of this, and, as I knew beforehand that on the next day but one Albertine would be going on a visit with her aunt, I had seized this opportunity to send Mme. Verdurin a telegram asking her whether she would be at home upon Wednesday. If Mme. Putbus was there, I would manage to see her maid, ascertain whether there was any danger of her coming to Balbec, and if so find out when, so as to take Albertine out of reach on the day. The little local railway, making a loop which did not exist at the time when I had taken it with my grandmother, now extended to Donci\u00e8res-la-Goupil, a big station at which important trains stopped, among them the express by which I had come down to visit Saint-Loup, from Paris, and the corresponding express by which I had returned. And, because of the bad weather, the omnibus from the Grand Hotel took Albertine and myself to the station of the little tram, Balbec-Plage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The little train had not yet arrived, but one could see, lazy and slow, the plume of smoke that it had left in its wake, which, confined now to its own power of locomotion as an almost stationary cloud, was slowly mounting the green slope of the cliff of Criquetot. Finally the little tram, which it had preceded by taking a vertical course, arrived in its turn, at a leisurely crawl. The passengers who were waiting to board it stepped back to make way for it, but without hurrying, knowing that they were dealing with a good-natured, almost human traveller, who, guided like the bicycle of a beginner, by the obliging signals of the station-master, in the strong hands of the engine-driver, was in no danger of running over anybody, and would come to a halt at the proper place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My telegram explained the Verdurins\u2019 telephone message and had been all the more opportune since Wednesday (the day I had fixed happened to be a Wednesday) was the day set apart for dinner-parties by Mme. Verdurin, at la Raspeli\u00e8re, as in Paris, a fact of which I was unaware. Mme. Verdurin did not give \u2018dinners,\u2019 but she had \u2018Wednesdays.\u2019 These Wednesdays were works of art. While fully conscious that they had not their match anywhere, Mme. Verdurin introduced shades of distinction between them. \u201cLast Wednesday was not as good as the one before,\u201d she would say. \u201cBut I believe the next will be one of the best I have ever given.\u201d Sometimes she went so far as to admit: \u201cThis Wednesday was not worthy of the others. But I have a big surprise for you next week.\u201d In the closing weeks of the Paris season, before leaving for the country, the Mistress would announce the end of the Wednesdays. It gave her an opportunity to stimulate the faithful. \u201cThere are only three more Wednesdays left, there are only two more,\u201d she would say, in the same tone as though the world were coming to an end. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to miss next Wednesday, for the finale.\u201d But this finale was a sham, for she would announce: \u201cOfficially, there will be no more Wednesdays. To-day was the last for this year. But I shall be at home all the same on Wednesday. We shall have a little Wednesday to ourselves; I dare say these little private Wednesdays will be the nicest of all.\u201d At la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Wednesdays were of necessity restricted, and since, if they had discovered a friend who was passing that way, they would invite him for one or another evening, almost every day of the week became a Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t remember all the guests, but I know there\u2019s Madame la Marquise de Camembert,\u201d the liftboy had told me; his memory of our discussion of the name Cambremer had not succeeded in definitely supplanting that of the old world, whose syllables, familiar and full of meaning, came to the young employee\u2019s rescue when he was embarrassed by this difficult name, and were immediately preferred and readopted by him, not by any means from laziness or as an old and ineradicable usage, but because of the need for logic and clarity which they satisfied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hastened in search of an empty carriage in which I could hold Alber-tine in my arms throughout the journey. Having failed to find one, we got into a compartment in which there was already installed a lady with a massive face, old and ugly, with a masculine expression, very much in her Sunday best, who was reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. Notwithstanding her commonness, she was eclectic in her tastes, and I found amusement in asking myself to what social category she could belong; I at once concluded that she must be the manager of some large brothel, a procuress on holiday. Her face, her manner, proclaimed the fact aloud. Only, I had never yet supposed that such ladies read the Revue des Deux Mondes. Albertine drew my attention to her with a wink and a smile. The lady wore an air of extreme dignity; and as I, for my part, bore within me the consciousness that I was invited, two days later, to the terminal point of the little railway, by the famous Mme. Verdurin, that at an intermediate station I was awaited by Robert de Saint-Loup, and that a little farther on I had it in my power to give great pleasure to Mme. de Cambremer, by going to stay at F\u00e9terne, my eyes sparkled with irony as I studied this self-important lady who seemed to think that, because of her elaborate attire, the feathers in her hat, her Revue des Deux Mondes, she was a more considerable personage than myself. I hoped that the lady would not remain in the train much longer than M. Nissim Bernard, and that she would alight at least at Toutainville, but no. The train stopped at Evreville, she remained seated. Similarly at Montmartin-sur-Mer, at Parville-la-Bingard, at Incarville, so that in despair, when the train had left Saint-Frichoux, which was the last station before Donci\u00e8res, I began to embrace Albertine without bothering about the lady. At Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Loup had come to meet me at the station, with the greatest difficulty, he told me, for, as he was staying with his aunt, my telegram had only just reached him and he could not, having been unable to make any arrangements beforehand, spare me more than an hour of his time. This hour seemed to me, alas, far too long, for as soon as we had left the train Albertine devoted her whole attention to Saint-Loup. She never talked to me, barely answered me if I addressed her, repulsed me when I approached her. With Robert, on the other hand, she laughed her provoking laugh, talked to him volubly, played with the dog he had brought with him, and, as she excited the animal, deliberately rubbed against its master. I remembered that, on the day when Albertine had allowed me to kiss her for the first time, I had had a smile of gratitude for the unknown seducer who had wrought so profound a change in her and had so far simplified my task. I thought of him now with horror. Robert must have noticed that I was not unconcerned about Albertine, for he offered no response to her provocations, which made her extremely annoyed with myself; then he spoke to me as though I had been alone, which, when she realised it, raised me again in her esteem. Robert asked me if I would not like to meet those of his friends with whom he used to make me dine every evening at Donci\u00e8res, when I was staying there, who were still in the garrison. And as he himself adopted that irritating manner which he rebuked in others: \u201cWhat is the good of your having worked so hard to charm them if you don\u2019t want to see them again?\u201d I declined his offer, for I did not wish to run any risk of being parted from Albertine, but also because now I was detached from them. From them, which is to say from myself. We passionately long that there may be another life in which we shall be similar to what we are here below. But we do not pause to reflect that, even without waiting for that other life, in this life, after a few years we are unfaithful to what we have been, to what we wished to remain immortally. Even without supposing that death is to alter us more completely than the changes that occur in the course of a lifetime, if in that other life we were to encounter the self that we have been, we should turn away from ourselves as from those people with whom we were once on friendly terms but whom we have not seen for years \u2014 such as Saint-Loup\u2019s friends whom I used so much to enjoy meeting again every evening at the Faisan Dor\u00e9, and whose conversation would now have seemed to me merely a boring importunity. In this respect, and because I preferred not to go there in search of what had pleased me there in the past, a stroll through Donci\u00e8res. might have seemed to me a pr\u00e9figuration of an arrival in Paradise. We dream much of Paradise, or rather of a number of successive Paradises, but each of them is, long before we die, a Paradise lost, in which we should feel ourselves lost also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He left us at the station. \u201cBut you may have about an hour to wait,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf you spend it here, you will probably see my uncle Charlus, who is going by the train to Paris, ten minutes before yours. I have said good-bye to him already, because I have to go back before his train starts. I didn\u2019t tell him about you, because I hadn\u2019t got your telegram.\u201d To the reproaches which I heaped upon Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us, she replied that she had intended, by her coldness towards me, to destroy any idea that he might have formed if, at the moment when the train stopped, he had seen me leaning against her with my arm round her waist. He had indeed noticed this attitude (I had not caught sight of him, otherwise I should have adopted one that was more correct), and had had time to murmur in my ear: \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is, one of those priggish little girls you told me about, who wouldn\u2019t go near Mlle. de Stermaria because they thought her fast?\u201d I had indeed mentioned to Robert, and in all sincerity, when I went down from Paris to visit him at Donci\u00e8res, and when we were talking about our time at Balbec, that there was nothing to be had from Albertine, that she was the embodiment of virtue. And now that I had long since discovered for myself that this was false, I was even more anxious that Robert should believe it to be true. It would have been sufficient for me to tell Robert that I was in love with Albertine. He was one of those people who are capable of denying themselves a pleasure to spare their friend sufferings which they would feel even more keenly if they themselves were the victims. \u201cYes, she is still rather childish. But you don\u2019t know anything against her?\u201d I added anxiously. \u201cNothing, except that I saw you clinging together like a pair of lovers.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYour attitude destroyed absolutely nothing,\u201d I told Albertine when Saint-Loup had left us. \u201cQuite true,\u201d she said to me, \u201cit was stupid of me, I hurt your feelings, I\u2019m far more unhappy about it than you are. You\u2019ll see, I shall never be like that again; forgive me,\u201d she pleaded, holding out her hand with a sorrowful air. At that moment, from the entrance to the waiting-room in which we were sitting, I saw advance slowly, followed at a respectful distance by a porter loaded with his baggage, M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Paris, where I encountered him only in evening dress, immobile, straitlaced in a black coat, maintained in a vertical posture by his proud aloofness, his thirst for admiration, the soar of his conversation, I had never realised how far he had aged. Now, in a light travelling suit which made him appear stouter, as he swaggered through the room, balancing a pursy stomach and an almost symbolical behind, the cruel light of day broke up into paint, upon his lips, rice-powder fixed by cold cream, on the tip of his nose, black upon his dyed moustaches whose ebon tint formed a contrast to his grizzled hair, all that by artificial light had seemed the animated colouring of a man who was still young\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I stood talking to him, though briefly, because of his train, I kept my eye on Albertine\u2019s carriage to shew her that I was coming. When I turned my head towards M. de Charlus, he asked nie to be so kind as to summon a soldier, a relative of his, who was standing on the other side of the platform, as though he were waiting to take our train, but in the opposite direction, away from Balbec. \u201cHe is in his regimental band,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cAs you are so fortunate as to be still young enough, and I unfortunately am old enough for you to save me the trouble of going across to him.\u201d I took it upon myself to go across to the soldier he pointed out to me, and saw from the lyres embroidered on his collar that he was a bandsman. But, just as I was preparing to execute my commission, what was my surprise, and, I may say, my pleasure, on recognising Morel, the son of my uncle\u2019s valet, who recalled to me so many memories. They made me forget to convey M. de Charlus\u2019s message. \u201cWhat, you are at Donci\u00e8res?\u201d \u201cYes, and they\u2019ve put me in the band attached to the batteries.\u201d But he made this answer in a dry and haughty tone. He had become an intense \u2018poseur,\u2019 and evidently the sight of myself, reminding him of his father\u2019s profession, was not pleasing to him. Suddenly I saw M. de Charlus descending upon us. My delay had evidently taxed his patience. \u201cI should like to listen to a little music this evening,\u201d he said to Morel without any preliminaries, \u201cI pay five hundred francs for the evening, which may perhaps be of interest to one of your friends, if you have any in the band.\u201d Knowing as I did the insolence of M. de Charlus, I was astonished at his not even saying how d\u2019ye do to his young friend. The Baron did not however give me time to think. Holding out his hand in the friendliest manner: \u201cGood-bye, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, as a hint that I might now leave them. I had, as it happened, left my dear Albertine too long alone. \u201cD\u2019you know,\u201d I said to her as I climbed into the carriage, \u201clife by the sea-side and travelling make me realise that the theatre of the world is stocked with fewer settings than actors, and with fewer actors than situations.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d \u201cBecause M. de Charlus asked me just now to fetch one of his friends, whom, this instant, on the platform of this station, I have just discovered to be one of my own.\u201d But as I uttered these words, I began to wonder how the Baron could have bridged the social gulf to which I had not given a thought. It occurred to me first of all that it might be through Jupien, whose niece, as the reader may remember, had seemed to shew a preference for the violinist. What did baffle me completely was that, when due to leave for Paris in five minutes, the Baron should have asked for a musical evening. But, visualising Jupien\u2019s niece again in my memory, I was beginning to find that \u2018recognitions\u2019 did indeed play an important part in life, when all of a sudden the truth flashed across my mind and I realised that I had been absurdly innocent. M. de Charlus had never in his life set eyes upon Morel, nor Morel upon M. de Charlus, who, dazzled but also terrified by a warrior, albeit he bore no weapon but a lyre, had called upon me in his emotion to bring him the person whom he never suspected that I already knew. In any case, the offer of five hundred francs must have made up to Morel for the absence of any previous relations, for I saw that they continued to talk, without reflecting that they were standing close beside our tram. As I recalled the manner in which M. de Charlus had come up to Morel and myself, I saw at once the resemblance to certain of his relatives, when they picked up a woman in the street. Only the desired object had changed its sex. After a certain age, and even if different evolutions are occurring in us, the more we become ourselves, the more our characteristic features are accentuated. For Nature, while harmoniously contributing the design of her tapestry, breaks the monotony of the composition thanks to the variety of the intercepted forms. Besides, the arrogance with which M. de Charlus had accosted the violinist is relative, and depends upon the point of view one adopts. It would have been recognised by three out of four of the men in society who nodded their heads to him, not by the prefect of police who, a few years later, was to keep him under observation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Paris train is signalled, Sir,\u201d said the porter who was carrying his luggage. \u201cBut I am not going by the train, put it in the cloakroom, damn you!\u201d said M. de Charlus, as he gave twenty francs to the porter, astonished by the change of plan and charmed by the tip. This generosity at once attracted a flower-seller. \u201cBuy these carnations, look, this lovely rose, kind gentlemen, it will bring you luck.\u201d M. de Charlus, out of patience, handed her a couple of francs, in exchange for which the woman gave him her blessing, and her flowers as well. \u201cGood God, why can\u2019t she leave us alone,\u201d said M. de Charlus, addressing himself in an ironical and complaining tone, as of a man distraught, to Morel, to whom he found a certain comfort in appealing. \u201cWe\u2019ve quite enough to talk about as it is.\u201d Perhaps the porter was not yet out of earshot, perhaps M. de Charlus did not care to have too numerous an audience, perhaps these incidental remarks enabled his lofty timidity not to approach too directly the request for an assignation. The musician, turning with a frank, imperative and decided air to the flower-seller, raised a hand which repulsed her and indicated to her that they did not want her flowers and that she was to get out of their way as quickly as possible. M. de Charlus observed with ecstasy this authoritative, virile gesture, made by the graceful hand for which it ought still to have been too weighty, too massively brutal, with a precocious firmness and suppleness which gave to this still beardless adolescent the air of a young David capable of waging war against Goliath. The Baron\u2019s admiration was unconsciously blended with the smile with which we observe in a child an expression of gravity beyond his years. \u201cThis is a person whom I should like to accompany me on my travels and help me in my business. How he would simplify my life,\u201d M. de Charlus said to himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The train for Paris (which M. de Charlus did not take) started. Then we took our seats in our own train, Albertine and I, without my knowing what had become of M. de Charlus and Morel. \u201cWe must never quarrel any more, I beg your pardon again,\u201d Albertine repeated, alluding to the Saint-Loup incident. \u201cWe must always be nice to each other,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201cAs for your friend Saint-Loup, if you think that I am the least bit interested in him, you are quite mistaken. All that I like about him is that he seems so very fond of you.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a very good fellow,\u201d I said, taking care not to supply Robert with those imaginary excellences which I should not have failed to invent, out of friendship for himself, had I been with anybody but Albertine. \u201cHe\u2019s an excellent creature, frank, devoted, loyal, a person you can rely on to do anything.\u201d In saying this I confined myself, held in check by my jealousy, to telling the truth about Saint-Loup, but what I said was literally true. It found expression in precisely the same terms that Mme. de Villeparisis had employed in speaking to me of him, when I did not yet know him, imagined him to be so different, so proud, and said to myself: \u201cPeople think him good because he is a great gentleman.\u201d Just as when she had said to me: \u201cHe would be so pleased,\u201d I imagined, after seeing him outside the hotel, preparing to drive away, that his aunt\u2019s speech had been a mere social banality, intended to natter me. And I had realised afterwards that she had said what she did sincerely, thinking of the things that interested me, of my reading, and because she knew that that was what Saint-Loup liked, as it was to be my turn to say sincerely to somebody who was writing a history of his ancestor La Rochefoucauld, the author of the Maximes, who wished to consult Robert about him: \u201cHe will be so pleased.\u201d It was simply that I had learned to know him. But, when I set eyes on him for the first time, I had not supposed that an intelligence akin to my own could be enveloped in so much outward elegance of dress and attitude. By his feathers I had judged him to be a bird of another species. It was Albertine now who, perhaps a little because Saint-Loup, in his kindness to myself, had been so cold to her, said to me what I had already thought: \u201cAh! He is as devoted as all that! I notice that people always find all the virtues in other people, when they belong to the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\u201d Now that Saint-Loup belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a thing of which I had never once thought in the course of all these years in which, stripping himself of his prestige, he had displayed to me his virtues. A change in our perspective in looking at other people, more striking already in friendship than in merely social relations, but how much more striking still in love, where desire on so vast a scale increases to such proportions the slightest signs of coolness, that far less than the coolness Saint-Loup had shewn me in the beginning had been enough to make me suppose at first that Albertine scorned me, imagine her friends to be creatures marvellously inhuman, and ascribe merely to the indulgence that people feel for beauty and for a certain elegance, Elstir\u2019s judgment when he said to me of the little band, with just the same sentiment as Mme. de Villeparisis speaking of Saint-Loup: \u201cThey are good girls.\u201d But this was not the opinion that I would instinctively have formed when I heard Albertine say: \u201cIn any case, whether he\u2019s devoted or not, I sincerely hope I shall never see him again, since he\u2019s made us quarrel. We must never quarrel again. It isn\u2019t nice.\u201d I felt, since she had seemed to desire Saint-Loup, almost cured for the time being of the idea that she cared for women, which I had supposed to be incurable. And, faced by Albertine\u2019s mackintosh in which she seemed to have become another person, the tireless vagrant of rainy days, and which, close-fitting, malleable and grey, seemed at that moment not so much intended to protect her garments from the rain as to have been soaked by her and to be clinging to my mistress\u2019s body as though to take the imprint of her form for a sculptor, I tore apart that tunic which jealously espoused a longed-for bosom and, drawing Albertine towards me: \u201cBut won\u2019t you, indolent traveller, dream upon my shoulder, resting your brow upon it?\u201d I said, taking her head in my hands, and shewing her the wide meadows, flooded and silent, which extended in the gathering dusk to the horizon closed by the parallel openings of valleys far and blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two days later, on the famous Wednesday, in that same little train, which I had again taken, at Balbec, to go and dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, I was taking care not to miss Cottard at Graincourt-Saint-Vast, where a second telephone message from Mme. Verdurin had told me that I should find him. He was to join my train and would tell me where we had to get out to pick up the carriages that would be sent from la Raspeli\u00e8re to the station. And so, as the little train barely stopped for a moment at Graincourt, the first station after Donci\u00e8res, I was standing in readiness at the open window, so afraid was I of not seeing Cottard or of his not seeing me. Vain fears! I had not realised to what an extent the little clan had moulded all its regular members after the same type, so that they, being moreover in full evening dress, as they stood waiting upon the platform, let themselves be recognised immediately by a certain air of assurance, fashion and familiarity, by a look in their eyes which seemed to sweep, like an empty space in which there was nothing to arrest their attention, the serried ranks of the common herd, watched for the arrival of some fellow-member who had taken the train at an earlier station, and sparkled in anticipation of the talk that was to come. This sign of election, with which the habit of dining together had marked the members of the little group, was not all that distinguished them; when numerous, in full strength, they were massed together, forming a more brilliant patch in the midst of the troop of passengers \u2014 what Brichot called the pecus \u2014 upon whose dull countenances could be read no conception of what was meant by the name Verdurin, no hope of ever dining at la Raspeli\u00e8re. To be sure, these common travellers would have been less interested than myself had anyone quoted in their hearing \u2014 notwithstanding the notoriety that several of them had achieved \u2014 the names of those of the faithful whom I was astonished to see continuing to dine out, when many of them had already been doing so, according to the stories that I had heard, before my birth, at a period at once so distant and so vague that I was inclined to exaggerate its remoteness. The contrast between the continuance not only of their existence, but of the fulness of their powers, and the annihilation of so many friends whom I had already seen, in one place or another, pass away, gave me the same sentiment that we feel when in the stop-press column of the newspapers we read the very announcement that we least expected, for instance that of an untimely death, which seems to us fortuitous because the causes that have led up to it have remained outside our knowledge. This is the feeling that death does not descend upon all men alike, but that a more oncoming wave of its tragic tide carries off a life placed at the same level as others which the waves that follow will long continue to spare. We shall see later on that the diversity of the forms of death that circulate invisibly is the cause of the peculiar unexpectedness presented, in the newspapers, by their obituary notices. Then I saw that, with the passage of time, not only do the real talents that may coexist with the most commonplace conversation reveal and impose themselves, but furthermore that mediocre persons arrive at those exalted positions, attached in the imagination of our childhood to certain famous elders, when it never occurred to us that, after a certain number of years, their disciples, become masters, would be famous also, and would inspire the respect and awe that once they felt. But if the names of the faithful were unknown to the pecus, their aspect still singled them out in its eyes. Indeed in the train (when the coincidence of what one or another of them might have been doing during the day, assembled them all together), having to collect at a subsequent station only an isolated member, the carriage in which they were gathered, ticketed with the elbow of the sculptor Ski, flagged with Cottard\u2019s Temps, stood out in the distance like a special saloon, and rallied at the appointed station the tardy comrade. The only one who might, because of his semi-blindness, have missed these welcoming signals, was Brichot. But one of the party would always volunteer to keep a look-out for the blind man, and, as soon as his straw hat, his green umbrella and blue spectacles caught the eye, he would be gently but hastily guided towards the chosen compartment. So that it was inconceivable that one of the faithful, without exciting the gravest suspicions of his being \u2018on the loose,\u2019 or even of his not having come \u2018by the train,\u2019 should not pick up the others in the course of the journey. Sometimes the opposite process occurred: one of the faithful had been obliged to go some distance down the line during the afternoon and was obliged in consequence to make part of the journey alone before being joined by the group; but even when thus isolated, alone of his kind, he did not fail as a rule to produce a certain effect. The Future towards which he was travelling marked him out to the person on the seat opposite, who would say to himself: \u201cThat must be somebody,\u201d would discern, round the soft hat of Cottard or of the sculptor Ski, a vague aureole and would be only half-astonished when at the next station an elegant crowd, if it were their terminal point, greeted the faithful one at the carriage door and escorted him to one of the waiting carriages, all of them reverently saluted by the factotum of Douville station, or, if it were an intermediate station, invaded the compartment. This was what was done, and with precipitation, for some of them had arrived late, just as the train which was already in the station was about to start, by the troop which Cottard led at a run towards the carriage in the window of which he had seen me signalling. Brichot, who was among these faithful, had become more faithful than ever in the course of these years which had diminished the assiduity of others. As his sight became steadily weaker, he had been obliged, even in Paris, to reduce more and more his working hours after dark. Besides he was out of sympathy with the modern Sorbonne, where ideas of scientific exactitude, after the German model, were beginning to prevail over humanism. He now confined himself exclusively to his lectures and to his duties as an examiner; and so had a great deal more time to devote to social pursuits. That is to say, to evenings at the Verdurins\u2019, or to those parties that now and again were offered to the Verdurins by one of the faithful, tremulous with emotion. It is true that on two occasions love had almost succeeded in achieving what his work could no longer do, in detaching Brichot from the little clan. But Mme. Verdurin, who kept her eyes open, and moreover, having acquired the habit in the interests of her salon, had come to take a disinterested pleasure in this sort of drama and execution, had immediately brought about a coolness between him and the dangerous person, being skilled in (as she expressed it) \u2018putting things in order\u2019 and \u2018applying the red hot iron to the wound.\u2019 This she had found all the more easy in the case of one of the dangerous persons, who was simply Brichot\u2019s laundress, and Mme. Verdurin, having the right of entry into the Professor\u2019s fifth floor rooms, crimson with rage, when she deigned to climb his stairs, had only had to shut the door in the wretched woman\u2019s face. \u201cWhat!\u201d the Mistress had said to Brichot, \u201ca woman like myself does you the honour of calling upon you, and you receive a creature like that?\u201d Brichot had never forgotten the service that Mme. Verdurin had rendered him by preventing his old age from foundering in the mire, and became more and more strongly attached to her, whereas, in contrast to this revival of affection and possibly because of it, the Mistress was beginning to be tired of a too docile follower, and of an obedience of which she could be certain beforehand. But Brichot derived from his intimacy with the Verdurins a distinction which set him apart from all his colleagues at the Sorbonne. They were dazzled by the accounts that he gave them of dinner-parties to which they would never be invited, by the mention made of him in the reviews, the exhibition of his portrait in the Salon, by some writer or painter of repute whose talent the occupants of the other chairs in the Faculty of Arts esteemed, but without any prospect of attracting his attention, not to mention the elegance of the mundane philosopher\u2019s attire, an elegance which they had mistaken at first for slackness until their colleague kindly explained to them that a tall hat is naturally laid on the floor, when one is paying a call, and is not the right thing for dinners in the country, however smart, where it should be replaced by a soft hat, which goes quite well with a dinner-jacket. For the first few moments after the little group had plunged into the carriage, I could not even speak to Cottard, for he was suffocated, not so much by having run in order not to miss the train as by his astonishment at having caught it so exactly. He felt more than the joy inherent in success, almost the hilarity of an excellent joke. \u201cAh! That was a good one!\u201d he said when he had recovered himself. \u201cA minute later! \u2018Pon my soul, that\u2019s what they call arriving in the nick of time!\u201d he added, with a wink intended not so much to inquire whether the expression were apt, for he was now overflowing with assurance, but to express his satisfaction. At length he was able to introduce me to the other members of the little clan. I was annoyed to see that they were almost all in the dress which in Paris is called smoking. I had forgotten that the Verdurins were beginning a timid evolution towards fashionable ways, retarded by the Dreyfus case, accelerated by the \u2018new\u2019 music, an evolution which for that matter they denied, and continued to deny until it was complete, like those military objectives which a general does not announce until he has reached them, so as not to appear defeated if he fails. In addition to which, Society was quite prepared to go half way to meet them. It went so far as to regard them as people to whose house nobody in Society went but who were not in the least perturbed by the fact. The Verdurin salon was understood to be a Temple of Music. It was there, people assured you, that Vinteuil had found inspiration, encouragement. Now, even if Vinteuil\u2019s sonata remained wholly unappreciated, and almost unknown, his name, quoted as that of the greatest of modern composers, had an extraordinary effect. Moreover, certain young men of the Faubourg having decided that they ought to be more intellectual than the middle classes, there were three of them who had studied music, and among these Vinteuil\u2019s sonata enjoyed an enormous vogue. They would speak of it, on returning to their homes, to the intelligent mothers who had incited them to acquire culture. And, taking an interest in what interested their sons, at a concert these mothers would gaze with a certain respect at Mme. Verdurin in her front box, following the music in the printed score. So far, this social success latent in the Verdurins was revealed by two facts only. In the first place, Mme. Verdurin would say of the Principessa di Caprarola: \u201cAh! She is intelligent, she is a charming woman. What I cannot endure, are the imbeciles, the people who bore me, they drive me mad.\u201d Which would have made anybody at all perspicacious realise that the Principessa di Caprarola, a woman who moved in the highest society, had called upon Mme. Verdurin. She had even mentioned her name in the course of a visit of condolence which she had paid to Mme. Swann after the death of her husband, and had asked whether she knew them. \u201cWhat name did you say?\u201d Odette had asked, with a sudden wistfulness. \u201cVerdurin? Oh, yes, of course,\u201d she had continued in a plaintive tone, \u201cI don\u2019t know them, or rather, I know them without really knowing them, they are people I used to meet at people\u2019s houses, years ago, they are quite nice.\u201d When the Principessa di Caprarola had gone, Odette would fain have spoken the bare truth. But the immediate falsehood was not the fruit of her calculations, but the revelation of her fears, of her desires. She denied not what it would have been adroit to deny, but what she would have liked not to have happened, even if the other person was bound to hear an hour later that it was a fact. A little later she had recovered her assurance, and would indeed anticipate questions by saying, so as not to appear to be afraid of them: \u201cMme. Verdurin, why, I used to know her terribly well!\u201d with an affectation of humility, like a great lady who tells you that she has taken the tram. \u201cThere has been a great deal of talk about the Verdurins lately,\u201d said Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. Odette, with the smiling disdain of a Duchess, replied: \u201cYes, I do seem to have heard a lot about them lately. Every now and then there are new people who arrive like that in society,\u201d without reflecting that she herself was among the newest. \u201cThe Principessa di Caprarola has dined there,\u201d Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 went on. \u201cAh!\u201d replied Odette, accentuating her smile, \u201cthat does not surprise me. That sort of thing always begins with the Principessa di Caprarola, and then some one else follows suit, like Comtesse Mole.\u201d Odette, in saying this, appeared to be filled with a profound contempt for the two great ladies who made a habit of \u2018house-warming\u2019 in recently established drawing-rooms. One felt from her tone that the implication was that she, Odette, was, like Mme. de Souvr\u00e9, not the sort of person to let herself in for that sort of thing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the admission that Mme. Verdurin had made of the Principessa di Caprarola\u2019s intelligence, the second indication that the Verdurins were conscious of their future destiny was that (without, of course, their having formally requested it) they became most anxious that people should now come to dine with them in evening dress. M. Verdurin could now have been greeted without shame by his nephew, the one who was \u2018in the cart.\u2019 Among those who entered my carriage at Graincourt was Saniette, who long ago had been expelled from the Verdurins\u2019 by his cousin Forcheville, but had since returned. His faults, from the social point of view, had originally been \u2014 notwithstanding his superior qualities \u2014 something like Cottard\u2019s, shyness, anxiety to please, fruitless attempts to succeed in doing so. But if the course of life, by making Cottard assume, if not at the Verdurins\u2019, where he had, because of the influence that past associations exert over us when we find ourselves in familiar surroundings, remained more or less the same, at least in his practice, in his hospital ward, at the Academy of Medicine, a shell of coldness, disdain, gravity, that became more accentuated while he rewarded his appreciative students with puns, had made a clean cut between the old Cottard and the new, the same defects had on the contrary become exaggerated in Saniette, the more he sought to correct them. Conscious that he was frequently boring, that people did not listen to him, instead of then slackening his pace as Cottard would have done, of forcing their attention by an air of authority, not only did he try by adopting a humorous tone to make them forgive the unduly serious turn of his conversation, he increased his pace, cleared the ground, used abbreviations in order to appear less long-winded, more familiar with the matters of which he spoke, and succeeded only, by making them unintelligible, in seeming interminable. His self-assurance was not like that of Cottard, freezing his patients, who, when other people praised his social graces, would reply: \u201cHe is a different man when he receives you in his consulting room, you with your face to the light, and he with his back to it, and those piercing eyes.\u201d It failed to create an effect, one felt that it was cloaking an excessive shyness, that the merest trifle would be enough to dispel it. Saniette, whose friends had always told him that he was wanting in self-confidence, and who had indeed seen men whom he rightly considered greatly inferior to himself, attain with ease to the success that was denied to him, never began telling a story without smiling at its drollery, fearing lest a serious air might make his hearers underestimate the value of his wares. Sometimes, giving him credit for the comic element which he himself appeared to find in what he was about to say, people would do him the honour of a general silence. But the story would fall flat. A fellow-guest who was endowed with a kind heart would sometimes convey to Saniette the private, almost secret encouragement of a smile of approbation, making it reach him furtively, without attracting attention, as one passes a note from hand to hand. But nobody went so far as to assume the responsibility, to risk the glaring publicity of an honest laugh. Long after the story was ended and had fallen flat, Saniette, crestfallen, would remain smiling to himself, as though relishing in it and for himself the delectation which he pretended to find adequate and which the others had not felt. As for the sculptor Ski, so styled on account of the difficulty they found in pronouncing his Polish surname, and because he himself made an affectation, since he had begun to move in a certain social sphere, of not wishing to be confused with certain relatives, perfectly respectable but slightly boring and very numerous, he had, at forty-four and with no pretension to good looks, a sort of boyishness, a dreamy wistfulness which was the result of his having been, until the age of ten, the most charming prodigal imaginable, the darling of all the ladies. Mme. Verdurin maintained that he was more of an artist than Elstir. Any resemblance that there may have been between them was, however, purely external. It was enough to make Elstir, who had met Ski once, feel for him the profound repulsion that is inspired in us less by the people who are our exact opposite than by those who r\u00e9semble us in what is least good, in whom are displayed our worst qualities, the faults of which we have cured ourselves, who irritate by reminding us of how we may have appeared to certain other people before we became what we now are. But Mme. Verdurin thought that Ski had more temperament than Elstir because there was no art in which he had not a facility of expression, and she was convinced that he would have developed that facility into talent if he had not been so lazy. This seemed to the Mistress to be actually an additional gift, being the opposite of hard work which she regarded as the lot of people devoid of genius. Ski would paint anything you asked, on cuff-links or on the panels over doors. He sang with the voice of a composer, played from memory, giving the piano the effect of an orchestra, less by his virtuosity than by his vamped basses, which suggested the inability of the fingers to indicate that at a certain point the cornet entered, which, for that matter, he would imitate with his lips. Choosing his words when he spoke so as to convey an odd impression, just as he would pause before banging out a chord to say \u2018Ping!\u2019 so as to let the brasses be heard, he was regarded as marvellously intelligent, but as a matter of fact his ideas could be boiled down to two or three, extremely limited. Bored with his reputation for whimsicality, he had set himself to shew that he was a practical, matter-of-fact person, whence a triumphant affectation of false precision, of false common sense, aggravated by his having no memory and a fund of information that was always inaccurate. The movements of his head, neck, limbs, would have been graceful if he had been still nine years old, with golden curls, a wide lace collar and little boots of red leather. Having reached Graincourt station with Cottard and Brichot, with time to spare, he and Cottard had left Brichot in the waiting-room and had gone for a stroll. When Cottard proposed to turn back, Ski had replied: \u201cBut there is no hurry. It isn\u2019t the local train to-day, it\u2019s the departmental train.\u201d Delighted by the effect that this refinement of accuracy produced upon Cottard, he added, with reference to himself: \u201cYes, because Ski loves the arts, because he models in clay, people think he\u2019s not practical. Nobody knows this line better than I do.\u201d Nevertheless they had turned back towards the station when, all of a sudden, catching sight of the smoke of the approaching train, Cottard, with a wild shout, had exclaimed: \u201cWe shall have to put our best foot foremost.\u201d They did as a matter of fact arrive with not a moment to spare, the distinction between local and departmental trains having never existed save in the mind of Ski. \u201cBut isn\u2019t the Princess on the train?\u201d came in ringing tones from Brichot, whose huge spectacles, resplendent as the reflectors that laryngologists attach to their foreheads to throw a light into the throats of their patients, seemed to have taken their life from the Professor\u2019s eyes, and possibly because of the effort that he was making to adjust his sight to them, seemed themselves, even at the most trivial moments, to be gazing at themselves with a sustained attention and an extraordinary fixity. Brichot\u2019s malady, as it gradually deprived him of his sight, had revealed to him the beauties of that sense, just as, frequently, we have to have made up our minds to part with some object, to make a present of it for instance, before we can study it, regret it, admire it. \u201cNo, no, the Princess went over to Maineville with some of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s guests who were taking the Paris train. It is within the bounds of possibility that Mme. Verdurin, who had some business at Saint-Mars, may be with her! In that case, she will be coming with us, and we shall all travel together, which will be delightful. We shall have to keep our eyes skinned at Maineville and see what we shall see! Oh, but that\u2019s nothing, you may say that we came very near to missing the bus. When I saw the train I was dumbfoundered. That\u2019s what is called arriving at the psychological moment. Can\u2019t you picture us missing the train, Mme. Verdurin seeing the carriages come back without us: Tableau!\u201d added the doctor, who had not yet recovered from his emotion. \u201cThat would be a pretty good joke, wouldn\u2019t it? Now then, Brichot, what have you to say about our little escapade?\u201d inquired the doctor with a note of pride. \u201cUpon my soul,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cwhy, yes, if you had found the train gone, that would have been what the late Villemain used to call a wipe in the eye!\u201d But I, distracted at first by these people who were strangers to me, was suddenly reminded of what Cottard had said to me in the ball-room of the little casino, and, just as though there were an invisible link uniting an organ to our visual memory, the vision of Albertine leaning her breasts against Andr\u00e9e\u2019s caused my heart a terrible pain. This pain did not last: the idea of Albertine\u2019s having relations with women seemed no longer possible since the occasion, forty-eight hours earlier, when the advances that my mistress had made to Saint-Loup had excited in me a fresh jealousy which had made me forget the old. I was simple enough to suppose that one taste of necessity excludes another. At Harambouville, as the tram was full, a farmer in a blue blouse who had only a third class ticket got into our compartment. The doctor, feeling that the Princess must not be allowed to travel with such a person, called a porter, shewed his card, describing him as medical officer to one of the big railway companies, and obliged the station-master to make the farmer get out. This incident so pained and alarmed Saniette\u2019s timid spirit that, as soon as he saw it beginning, fearing already lest, in view of the crowd of peasants on the platform, it should assume the proportions of a rising, he pretended to be suffering from a stomach-ache, and, so that he might not be accused of any share in the responsibility for the doctor\u2019s violence, wandered down the corridor, pretending to be looking for what Cottard called the \u2018water.\u2019 Failing to find one, he stood and gazed at the scenery from the other end of the \u2018twister.\u2019 \u201cIf this is your first appearance at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Sir,\u201d I was addressed by Brichot, anxious to shew off his talents before a newcomer, \u201cyou will find that there is no place where one feels more the \u2018amenities of life,\u2019 to quote one of the inventors of dilettantism, of pococurantism, of all sorts of words in \u2014 ism that are in fashion among our little snobbesses, I refer to M. le Prince de Talleyrand.\u201d For, when he spoke of these great noblemen of the past, he thought it clever and \u2018in the period\u2019 to prefix a \u2018M.\u2019 to their titles, and said \u2018M. le Duc de La Rochefoucauld,\u2019 \u2018M. le Cardinal de Retz,\u2019 referring to these also as \u2018That struggle-for-lifer de Gondi,\u2019 \u2018that Boulangist de Marcillac.\u2019 And he never failed to call Montesquieu, with a smile, when he referred to him: \u201cMonsieur le Pr\u00e9sident Second\u00e2t de Montesquieu.\u201d An intelligent man of the world would have been irritated by a pedantry which reeked so of the lecture-room. But in the perfect manners of the man of the world when speaking of a Prince, there is a pedantry also, which betrays a different caste, that in which one prefixes \u2018the Emperor\u2019 to the name \u2018William\u2019 and addresses a Royal Highness in the third person. \u201cAh, now that is a man,\u201d Brichot continued, still referring to \u2018Monsieur le Prince de Talleyrand\u2019\u2014\u201cto whom we take off our hats. He is an ancestor.\u201d \u201cIt is a charming house,\u201d Cottard told me, \u201cyou will find a little of everything, for Mme. Verdurin is not exclusive, great scholars like Brichot, the high nobility, such as the Princess Sherbatoff, a great Russian lady, a friend of the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, who even sees her alone at hours when no one else is admitted.\u201d As a matter of fact the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, not wishing Princess Sherbatoff, who for years past had been cut by everyone, to come to her house when there might be other people, allowed her to come only in the early morning, when Her Imperial Highness was not at home to any of those friends to whom it would have been as unpleasant to meet the Princess as it would have been awkward for the Princess to meet them. As, for the last three years, as soon as she came away, like a manicurist, from the Grand Duchess, Mme. Sherbatoff would go on to Mme. Verdurin, who had just awoken, and stuck to her for the rest of the day, one might say that the Princess\u2019s loyalty surpassed even that of Brichot, constant as he was at those Wednesdays, both in Paris, where he had the pleasure of fancying himself a sort of Chateaubriand at l\u2019Abbaye-aux-Bois, and in the country, where he saw himself becoming the equivalent of what might have been in the salon of Mme. de Ch\u00e2telet the man whom he always named (with an erudite sarcasm and satisfaction): \u201cM. de Voltaire.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her want of friends had enabled Princess Sherbatoff to shew for some years past to the Verdurins a fidelity which made her more than an ordinary member of the \u2018faithful,\u2019 the type of faithfulness, the ideal which Mme. Verdurin had long thought unattainable and which now, in her later years, she at length found incarnate in this new feminine recruit. However keenly the Mistress might feel the pangs of jealousy, it was without precedent that the most assiduous of her faithful should not have \u2018failed\u2019 her at least once. The most stay-at-home yielded to the temptation to travel; the most continent fell from virtue; the most robust might catch influenza, the idlest be caught for his month\u2019s soldiering, the most indifferent go to close the eyes of a dying mother. And it was in vain that Mme. Verdurin told them then, like the Roman Empress, that she was the sole general whom her legion must obey, like the Christ or the Kaiser that he who loved his father or mother more than her and was not prepared to leave them and follow her was not worthy of her, that instead of slacking in bed or letting themselves be made fools of by bad women they would do better to remain in her company, by her, their sole remedy and sole delight. But destiny which is sometimes pleased to brighten the closing years of a life that has passed the mortal span had made Mme. Verdurin meet the Princess Sherbatoff. Out of touch with her family, an exile from her native land, knowing nobody but the Baroness Putbus and the Grand Duchess Eudoxie, to whose houses, because she herself had no desire to meet the friends of the former, and the latter no desire that her friends should meet the Princess, she went only in the early morning hours when Mme. Verdurin was still asleep, never once, so far as she could remember, having been confined to her room since she was twelve years old, when she had had the measles, having on the 3lst of December replied to Mme. Verdurin who, afraid of being left alone, had asked her whether she would not \u2018shake down\u2019 there for the night, in spite of its being New Year\u2019s Eve: \u201cWhy, what is there to prevent me, any day of the year? Besides, to-morrow is a day when one stays at home, and this is my home,\u201d living in a boarding-house, and moving from it whenever the Verdurins moved, accompanying them upon their holidays, the Princess had so completely exemplified to Mme. Verdurin the line of Vigny:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou only didst appear that which one seeks always\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that the Lady President of the little circle, anxious to make sure of one of her \u2018faithful\u2019 even after death, had made her promise that whichever of them survived the other should be buried by her side. Before strangers \u2014 among whom we must always reckon him to whom we lie most barefacedly because he is the person whose scorn we should most dread: ourself \u2014 Princess Sherbatoff took care to represent her only three friendships \u2014 with the Grand Duchess, the Verdurins, and the Baroness Putbus \u2014 as the only ones, not which cataclysms beyond her control had allowed to emerge from the destruction of all the rest, but which a free choice had made her elect in preference to any other, and to which a certain love of solitude and simplicity had made her confine herself. \u201cI see nobody else,\u201d she would say, insisting upon the inflexible character of what appeared to be rather a rule that one imposes upon oneself than a necessity to which one submits. She would add: \u201cI visit only three houses,\u201d as a dramatist who fears that it may not run to a fourth announces that there will be only three performances of his play. Whether or not M. and Mme. Verdurin believed in the truth of this fiction, they had helped the Princess to instil it into the minds of the faithful. And they in turn were persuaded both that the Princess, among the thousands of invitations that were offered her, had chosen the Verdurins alone, and that the Verdurins, courted in vain by all the higher aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of the Princess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In their eyes, the Princess, too far superior to her native element not to find it boring, among all the people whose society she might have enjoyed, found the Verdurins alone entertaining, while they, in return, deaf to the overtures with which they were bombarded by the entire aristocracy, had consented to make but a single exception, in favour of a great lady of more intelligence than the rest of her kind, the Princess Sherbatoff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princess was very rich; she engaged for every first night a large box, to which, with the assent of Mme. Verdurin, she invited the faithful and nobody else. People would point to this pale and enigmatic person who had grown old without turning white, turning red rather like certain sere and shrivelled hedgerow fruits. They admired both her influence and her humility, for, having always with her an Academician, Brichot, a famous scientist, Cottard, the leading pianist of the day, at a later date M. de Charlus, she nevertheless made a point of securing the least prominent box in the theatre, remained in the background, paid no attention to the rest of the house, lived exclusively for the little group, who, shortly before the end of the performance, would withdraw in the wake of this strange sovereign, who was not without a certain timid, fascinating, faded beauty. But if Mme. Sherbatoff did not look at the audience, remained in shadow, it was to try to forget that there existed a living world which she passionately desired and was unable to know: the coterie in a box was to her what is to certain animals their almost corpselike immobility in the presence of danger. Nevertheless the thirst for novelty and for the curious which possesses people in society made them pay even more attention perhaps to this mysterious stranger than to the celebrities in the front boxes to whom everybody paid a visit. They imagined that she must be different from the people whom they knew, that a marvellous intellect combined with a discerning bounty retained round about her that little circle of eminent men. The Princess was compelled, if you spoke to her about anyone, or introduced anyone to her, to feign an intense coldness, in order to keep up the fiction of her horror of society. Nevertheless, with the support of Cottard or Mme. Verdurin, several newcomers succeeded in making her acquaintance and such was her excitement at making a fresh acquaintance that she forgot the fable of her deliberate isolation, and went to the wildest extremes to please the newcomer. If he was entirely unimportant, the rest would be astonished. \u201cHow strange that the Princess, who refuses to know anyone, should make an exception of such an uninteresting person.\u201d But these fertilising acquaintances were rare, and the Princess lived narrowly confined in the midst of the faithful\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cottard said far more often: \u201cI shall see him on Wednesday at the Verdurins\u2019,\u201d than: \u201cI shall see him on Tuesday at the Academy.\u201d He spoke, too, of the Wednesdays as of an engagement equally important and inevitable. But Cottard was one of those people, little sought after, who make it as imperious a duty to respond to an invitation as if such invitations were orders, like a military or judicial summons. It required a call from a very important patient to make him \u201cfail\u201d the Verdurins on a Wednesday, the importance depending moreover rather upon the rank of the patient than upon the gravity of his complaint. For Cottard, excellent fellow as he was, would forego the delights of a Wednesday not for a workman who had had a stroke, but for a Minister\u2019s cold. Even then he would say to his wife: \u201cMake my apologies to Mme. Verdurin. Tell her that I shall be coming later on. His Excellency might really have chosen some other day to catch cold.\u201d One Wednesday their old cook having opened a vein in her arm, Cottard, already in his dinner-jacket to go to the Verdurins\u2019, had shrugged his shoulders when his wife had timidly inquired whether he could not bandage the cut: \u201cOf course I can\u2019t, L\u00e9ontine,\u201d he had groaned; \u201ccan\u2019t you see I\u2019ve got my white waistcoat on?\u201d So as not to annoy her husband, Mme. Cottard had sent post haste for his chief dresser. He, to save time, had taken a cab, with the result that, his carriage entering the courtyard just as Cottard\u2019s was emerging to take him to the Verdurins\u2019, five minutes had been wasted in backing to let one another pass. Mme. Cottard was worried that the dresser should see his master in evening dress. Cottard sat cursing the delay, from remorse perhaps, and started off in a villainous temper which it took all the Wednesday\u2019s pleasures to dispel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If one of Cottard\u2019s patients were to ask him: \u201cDo you ever see the Guermantes?\u201d it was with the utmost sincerity that the Professor would reply: \u201cPerhaps not actually the Guermantes, I can\u2019t be certain. But I meet all those people at the house of some friends of mine. You must, of course, have heard of the Verdurins. They know everybody. Besides, they certainly are not people who\u2019ve come down in the world. They\u2019ve got the goods, all right. It is generally estimated that Mme. Verdurin is worth thirty-five million. Gad, thirty-five million, that\u2019s a pretty figure. And so she doesn\u2019t make two bites at a cherry. You mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes. Let me explain the difference. Mme. Verdurin is a great lady, the Duchesse de Guermantes is probably a nobody. You see the distinction, of course. In any case, whether the Guermantes go to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s or not, she entertains all the very best people, the d\u2019Sherbat\u00f4ffs, the d\u2019Forchevilles, e tutti quanti, people of the highest flight, all the nobility of France and Navarre, with whom you would see me conversing as man to man. Of course, those sort of people are only too glad to meet the princes of science,\u201d he added, with a smile of fatuous conceit, brought to his lips by his proud satisfaction not so much that the expression formerly reserved for men like Potain and Charcot should now be applicable to himself, as that he knew at last how to employ all these expressions that were authorised by custom, and, after a long course of study, had learned them by heart. And so, after mentioning to me Princess Sherbatoff as one of the people who went to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Cottard added with a wink: \u201cThat gives you an idea of the style of the house, if you see what I mean?\u201d He meant that it was the very height of fashion. Now, to entertain a Russian lady who knew nobody but the Grand Duchess Eudoxie was not fashionable at all. But Princess Sherbatoff might not have known even her, it would in no way have diminished Cottard\u2019s estimate of the supreme elegance of the Verdurin salon or his joy at being invited there. The splendour that seems to us to invest the people whose houses we visit is no more intrinsic than that of kings and queens on the stage, in dressing whom it is useless for a producer to spend hundreds and thousands of francs in purchasing authentic costumes and real jewels, when a great designer will procure a far more sumptuous impression by focussing a ray of light on a doublet of coarse cloth studded with lumps of glass and on a cloak of paper. A man may have spent his life among the great ones of the earth, who to him have been merely boring relatives or tiresome acquaintances, because a familiarity engendered in the cradle had stripped them of all distinction in his eyes. The same man, on the other hand, need only have been led by some chance to mix with the most obscure people, for innumerable Cottards to be permanently dazzled by the ladies of title whose drawing-rooms they imagined as the centres of aristocratic elegance, ladies who were not even what Mme. de Villeparisis and her friends were (great ladies fallen from their greatness, whom the aristocracy that had been brought up with them no longer visited); no, those whose friendship has been the pride of so many men, if these men were to publish their memoirs and to give the names of those women and of the other women who came to their parties, Mme. de Cambremer would be no more able than Mme. de Guermantes to identify them. But what of that! A Cottard has thus his Marquise, who is to him \u201cthe Baronne,\u201d as in Marivaux, the Baronne whose name is never mentioned, so much so that nobody supposes that she ever had a name. Cottard is all the more convinced that she embodies the aristocracy \u2014 which has never heard of the lady \u2014 in that, the more dubious titles are, the more prominently coronets are displayed upon wineglasses, silver, notepaper, luggage. Many Cottards who have supposed that they were living in the heart of the Faubourg Saint-Germain have had their imagination perhaps more enchanted by feudal dreams than the men who did really live among Princes, just as with the small shopkeeper who, on Sundays, goes sometimes to look at \u201cold time\u201d buildings, it is sometimes from those buildings every stone of which is of our own time, the vaults of which have been, by the pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, painted blue and sprinkled with golden stars, that they derive the strongest sensation of the middle ages. \u201cThe Princess will be at Maineville. She will be coming with us. But I shall not introduce you to her at once. It will be better to leave that to Mme. Verdurin. Unless I find a loophole. Then you can rely on me to take the bull by the horns.\u201d \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d asked Saniette, as he rejoined us, pretending to have gone out to take the air. \u201cI was quoting to this gentleman,\u201d said Brichot, \u201ca saying, which you will remember, of the man who, to my mind, is the first of the fins-de-si\u00e8cle (of the eighteenth century, that is), by name Charles Maurice, Abb\u00e9 de Perigord. He began by promising to be an excellent journalist. But he made a bad end, by which I mean that he became a Minister! Life has these tragedies. A far from serapulous politician to boot who, with the lofty contempt of a thoroughbred nobleman, did not hesitate to work in his time for the King of Prussia, there are no two ways about it, and died in the skin of a \u2018Left Centre.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs we were joined by a glorious girl who, unfortunately, was not one of the little group. I could not tear my eyes from her magnolia skin, her dark eyes, her bold and admirable outlines. A moment later she wanted to open a window, for it was hot in the compartment, and not wishing to ask leave of everybody, as I alone was without a greatcoat, she said to me in a quick, cool, jocular voice: \u201cDo you mind a little fresh air, Sir?\u201d I would have liked to say to her: \u201cCome with us to the Verdurins\u2019?\u201d or \u201cGive me your name and address.\u201d I answered: \u201cNo, fresh air doesn\u2019t bother me, Mademoiselle.\u201d Whereupon, without stirring from her seat: \u201cDo your friends object to smoke?\u201d and she lit a cigarette. At the third station she sprang from the carriage. Next day, I inquired of Albertine, who could she be. For, stupidly thinking that people could have but one sort of love, in my jealousy of Albertine\u2019s attitude towards Robert, I was reassured so far as other women were concerned. Albertine told me, I believe quite sincerely, that she did not know. \u201cI should so much like to see her again,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, one always sees people again,\u201d replied Albertine. In this particular instance, she was wrong; I never saw again, nor did I ever identify, the pretty girl with the cigarette. We shall see, moreover, why, for a long time, I ceased to look for her. But I have not forgotten her. I find myself at times, when I think of her, seized by a wild longing. But these recurrences of desire oblige us to reflect that if we wish to rediscover these girls with the same pleasure we must also return to the year which has since been followed by ten others in the course of which her bloom has faded. We can sometimes find a person again, but we cannot abolish time. And so on until the unforeseen day, gloomy as a winter night, when we no longer seek for that girl, or for any other, when to find her would actually frighten us. For we no longer feel that we have sufficient attraction to appeal to her, or strength to love her. Not, of course, that we are, in the strict sense of the word, impotent. And as for loving, we should love her more than ever. But we feel that it is too big an undertaking for the little strength that we have left. Eternal rest has already fixed intervals which we can neither cross nor make our voice be heard across them. To set our foot on the right step is an achievement like not missing the perilous leap. To be seen in such a state by a girl we love, even if we have kept the features and all the golden locks of our youth! We can no longer undertake the strain of keeping pace with youth. All the worse if our carnal desire increases instead of failing! We procure for it a woman whom we need make no effort to attract, who will share our couch for one night only and whom we shall never see again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill no news, I suppose, of the violinist,\u201d said Cottard. The event of the day in the little clan was, in fact, the failure of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite violinist. Employed on military service near Donci\u00e8res, he came three times a week to dine at la Raspeli\u00e8re, having a midnight pass. But two days ago, for the first time, the faithful had been unable to discover him on the tram. It was supposed that he had missed it. But albeit Mme. Verdurin had sent to meet the next tram, and so on until the last had arrived, the carriage had returned empty. \u201cHe\u2019s certain to have been shoved into the guard-room, there\u2019s no other explanation of his desertion. Gad! In soldiering, you know, with those fellows, it only needs a bad-tempered serjeant.\u201d \u201cIt will be all the more mortifying for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cif he fails again this evening, because our kind hostess has invited to dinner for the first time the neighbours from whom she has taken la Raspeli\u00e8re, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d \u201cThis evening, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer!\u201d exclaimed Cottard. \u201cBut I knew absolutely nothing about it. Naturally, I knew like everybody else that they would be coming one day, but I had no idea that it was to be so soon. Sapristi!\u201d he went on, turning to myself, \u201cwhat did I tell you? The Princess Sherbatoff, the Marquis and Marquise de Cambremer.\u201d And, after repeating these names, lulling himself with their melody: \u201cYou see that we move in good company,\u201d he said to me. \u201cHowever, as it\u2019s your first appearance, you\u2019ll be one of the crowd. It is going to be an exceptionally brilliant gathering.\u201d And, turning to Brichot, he went on: \u201cThe Mistress will be furious. It is time we appeared to lend her a hand.\u201d Ever since Mme. Verdurin had been at la Raspeli\u00e8re she had pretended for the benefit of the faithful to be at once feeling and regretting the necessity of inviting her landlords for one evening. By so doing she would obtain better terms next year, she explained, and was inviting them for business reasons only. But she pretended to regard with such terror, to make such a bugbear of the idea of dining with people who did not belong to the little group that she kept putting off the evil day. The prospect did for that matter alarm her slightly for the reasons which she professed, albeit exaggerating them, if at the same time it enchanted her for reasons of snobbishness which she preferred to keep to herself. She was therefore partly sincere, she believed the little clan to be something so matchless throughout the world, one of those perfect wholes which it takes centuries of time to produce, that she trembled at the thought of seeing introduced into its midst these provincials, people ignorant of the Ring and the Meistersinger, who would be unable to play their part in the concert of conversation and were capable, by coming to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, of ruining one of those famous Wednesdays, masterpieces of art incomparable and frail, like those Venetian glasses which one false note is enough to shatter. \u201cBesides, they are bound to be absolutely anti, and militarists,\u201d M. Verdurin had said. \u201cOh, as for that, I don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ve heard quite enough about all that business,\u201d had replied Mme. Verdurin, who, a sincere Dreyfusard, would nevertheless have been glad to discover a social counterpoise to the preponderant Dreyfusism of her salon. For Dreyfusism was triumphant politically, but not socially. Labori, Reinach, Picquart, Zola were still, to people in society, more or less traitors, who could only keep them aloof from the little nucleus. And so, after this incursion into politics, Mme. Verdurin was determined to return to the world of art. Besides were not Indy, Debussy, on the \u2018wrong\u2019 side in the Case? \u201cSo far as the Case goes, we need only remember Brichot,\u201d she said (the Don being the only one of the faithful who had sided with the General Staff, which had greatly lowered him in the esteem of Madame Verdurin). \u201cThere is no need to be eternally discussing the Dreyfus case. No, the fact of the matter is that the Cambremers bore me.\u201d As for the faithful, no less excited by their unconfessed desire to make the Cambremers\u2019 acquaintance than dupes of the affected reluctance which Mme. Verdurin said she felt to invite them, they returned, day after day, in conversation with her, to the base arguments with which she herself supported the invitation, tried to make them irresistible. \u201cMake up your mind to it once and for all,\u201d Cottard repeated, \u201cand you will have better terms for next year, they will pay the gardener, you will have the use of the meadow. That will be well worth a boring evening. I am thinking only of yourselves,\u201d he added, albeit his heart had leaped on one occasion, when, in Mme. Verdurin\u2019s carriage, he had met the carriage of the old Mme. de Cambremer and, what was more, he had been abased in the sight of the railwaymen when, at the station, he had found himself standing beside the Marquis. For their part, the Cambremers, living far too remote from the social movement ever to suspect that certain ladies of fashion were speaking with a certain consideration of Mme. Verdurin, imagined that she was a person who could know none but Bohemians, was perhaps not even legally married, and so far as people of birth were concerned would never meet any but themselves. They had resigned themselves to the thought of dining with her only to be on good terms with a tenant who, they hoped, would return again for many seasons, especially after they had, in the previous month, learned that she had recently inherited all those millions. It was in silence and without any vulgar pleasantries that they prepared themselves for the fatal day. The faithful had given up hope of its ever coming, so often had Mme. Verdurin already fixed in their hearing a date that was invariably postponed. These false decisions were intended not merely to make a display of the boredom that she felt at the thought of this dinner-party, but to keep in suspense those members of the little group who were staying in the neighbourhood and were sometimes inclined to fail. Not that the Mistress guessed that the \u201cgreat day\u201d was as delightful a prospect to them as to herself, but in order that, having persuaded them that this dinner-party was to her the most terrible of social duties, she might make an appeal to their devotion. \u201cYou are not going to leave me all alone with those Chinese mandarins! We must assemble in full force to support the boredom. Naturally, we shan\u2019t be able to talk about any of the things in which we are interested. It will be a Wednesday spoiled, but what is one to do!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d Brichot explained to me, \u201cI fancy that Mme. Verdurin, who is highly intelligent and takes infinite pains in the elaboration of her Wednesdays, was by no means anxious to see these bumpkins of ancient lineage but scanty brains. She could not bring herself to invite the dowager Marquise, but has resigned herself to having the son and daughter-in-law.\u201d \u201cAh! We are to see the Marquise de Cambremer?\u201d said Cottard with a smile into which he saw fit to introduce a leer of sentimentality, albeit he had no idea whether Mme. de Cambremer were good-looking or not. But the title Marquise suggested to him fantastic thoughts of gallantry. \u201cAh! I know her,\u201d said Ski, who had met her once when he was out with Mme. Verdurin. \u201cNot in the biblical sense of the word, I trust,\u201d said the doctor, darting a sly glance through his eyeglass; this was one of his favourite pleasantries. \u201cShe is intelligent,\u201d Ski informed me. \u201cNaturally,\u201d he went on, seeing that I said nothing, and dwelling with a smile upon each word, \u201cshe is intelligent and at the same time she is not, she lacks education, she is frivolous, but she has an instinct for beautiful things. She may say nothing, but she will never say anything silly. And besides, her colouring is charming. She would be an amusing person to paint,\u201d he added, half shutting his eyes, as though he saw her posing in front of him. As my opinion of her was quite the opposite of what Ski was expressing with so many fine shades, I observed merely that she was the sister of an extremely distinguished engineer, M. Legrandin. \u201cThere, you see, you are going to be introduced to a pretty woman,\u201d Brichot said to me, \u201cand one never knows what may come of that. Cleopatra was not even a great lady, she was a little woman, the unconscious, terrible little woman of our Meilhac, and just think of the consequences, not only to that idiot Antony, but to the whole of the ancient world.\u201d \u201cI have already been introduced to Mme. de Cambremer,\u201d I replied. \u201cAh! In that case, you will find yourself on familiar ground.\u201d \u201cI shall be all the more delighted to meet her,\u201d I answered him, \u201cbecause she has promised me a book by the former cur\u00e9 of Com-bray about the place-names of this district, and I shall be able to remind her of her promise. I am interested in that priest, and also in etymologies.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t put any faith in the ones he gives,\u201d replied Brichot, \u201cthere is a copy of the book at la Raspeli\u00e8re, which I have glanced through, but without finding anything of any value; it is a mass of error. Let me give you an example. The word Bricq is found in a number of place-names in this neighbourhood. The worthy cleric had the distinctly odd idea that it comes from Briga, a height, a fortified place. He finds it already in the Celtic tribes, Latobriges, Nemetobriges, and so forth, and traces it down to such names as Briand, Brion, and so forth. To confine ourselves to the region in which we have the pleasure of your company at this moment, Bricquebose means the wood on the height, Bricqueville the habitation on the height, Bricquebec, where we shall be stopping presently before coming to Maineville, the height by the stream. Now there is not a word of truth in all this, for the simple reason that bricq is the old Norse word which means simply a bridge. Just as fleur, which Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 takes infinite pains to connect, in one place with the Scandinavian words floi, flo, in another with the Irish word ae or aer, is, beyond any doubt, the fjord of the Danes, and means harbour. So too, the excellent priest thinks that the station of Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, which adjoins la Raspeli\u00e8re, means Saint-Martin-le-Vieux (vetus). It is unquestionable that the word vieux has played a great part in the toponymy of this region. Vieux comes as a rule from vadum, and means a passage, as at the place called les Vieux. It is what the English call ford (Oxford, Hereford). But, in this particular instance, V\u00eatu is derived not from vetus, but from vas-tatus, a place that is devastated and bare. You have, round about here, Sottevast, the vast of Setold, Brillevast, the vast of Berold. I am all the more certain of the cure\u2019s mistake, in that Saint-Mars-le-Vetu was formerly called Saint-Mars du Cast and even Saint-Mars-de-Terregate. Now the v and the g in these words are the same letter. We say d\u00e9vaster, but also g\u00e2cher. J\u00e2ch\u00e8res andgatines (from the High German wastinna) have the same meaning: Terregate is therefore terra vasta. As for Saint-Mars, formerly (save the mark) Saint-Merd, it is Saint-Medardus, which appears variously as Saint-M\u00e9dard, Saint-Mard, Saint-Marc, Cinq-Mars, and even Dammas. Nor must we forget that quite close to here, places bearing the name of Mars are proof simply of a pagan origin (the god Mars) which has remained alive in this country but which the holy man refuses to see. The high places dedicated to the gods are especially frequent, such as the mount of Jupiter (Jeumont). Your cur\u00e9 declines to admit this, but, on the other hand, wherever Christianity has left traces, they escape his notice. He has gone so far afield as to Loctudy, a barbarian name, according to him, whereas it is simply Locus Sancti Tudeni, nor has he in Sammarcoles divined Sanctus Martialis. Your cur\u00e9,\u201d Brichot continued, seeing that I was interested, \u201cderives the terminations hon, home, holm, from the word holl (hullus), a hill, whereas it cornes from the Norse holm, an island, with which you are familiar in Stockholm, and which is so widespread throughout this district, la Houlme, Engohomme, Tahoume, Robehomme, N\u00e9homme, Quettehon, and so forth.\u201d These names made me think of the day when Albertine had wished to go to Amfreville-la-Bigot (from the name of two successive lords of the manor, Brichot told me), and had then suggested that we should dine together at Robehomme. As for Maineville, we were just coming to it. \u201cIsn\u2019t N\u00e9homme,\u201d I asked, \u201csomewhere near Carquethuit and Clitourps?\u201d \u201cPrecisely; N\u00e9homme is the holm, the island or peninsula of the famous Viscount Nigel, whose name has survived also in Neville. The Carquethuit and Clitourps that you mention furnish Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with an occasion for further blunders. No doubt he has seen that carque is a church, the Kirche of the Germans. You will remember Querqueville, not to mention Dun-kerque. For there we should do better to stop and consider the famous word Dun, which to the Celts meant high ground. And that you will find over the whole of France. Your abb\u00e9 was hypnotised by Duneville, which recurs in the Eure-et-Loir; he would have found Ch\u00e2teaudun, Dun-le-Roi in the Cher, Duneau in the Sarthe, Dun in the Ari\u00e8ge, Dune-les-Places in the Ni\u00e8vre, and many others. This word Dun leads him into a curious error with regard to Douville where we shall be alighting, and shall find Mme. Verdurin\u2019s comfortable carriages awaiting us. Douville, in Latin donvilla, says he. As a matter of fact, Douville does lie at the foot of high hills. Your cur\u00e9, who knows everything, feels all the same that he has made a blunder. He has, indeed, found in an old cartulary, the name Domvilla. Whereupon he retracts; Douville, according to him, is a fief belonging to the Abbot, Domino Abbati, of Mont Saint-Michel. He is delighted with the discovery, which is distinctly odd when one thinks of the scandalous life that, according to the Capitulary of Sainte-Claire sur Epte, was led at Mont Saint-Michel, though no more extraordinary than to picture the King of Denmark as suzerain of all this coast, where he encouraged the worship of Odin far more than that of Christ. On the other hand, the supposition that the n has been changed to m does not shock me, and requires less alteration than the perfectly correct Lyon, which also is derived from Dun (Lugdunum). But the fact is, the abb\u00e9 is mistaken. Douville was never Donville, but Doville, Eudonis villa, the village of Eudes. Douville was formerly called Escalecliff, the steps up the cliff. About the year 1233, Eudes le Bouteiller, Lord of Escalecliff, set out for the Holy Land; on the eve of his departure he made over the church to the Abbey of Blanche-lande. By an exchange of courtesies, the village took his name, whence we have Douville to-day. But I must add that toponymy, of which moreover I know little or nothing, is not an exact science; had we not this historical evidence, Douville might quite well come from Ouville, that is to say the Waters. The forms in ai (Aigu\u00ebs-Mortes), from aqua, are constantly changed to eu or ou. Now there were, quite close to Douville, certain famous springs, Carquethuit. You might suppose that the cur\u00e9 was only too ready to detect there a Christian origin, especially as this district seems to have been pretty hard to convert, since successive attempts were made by Saint Ursal, Saint Gofroi, Saint Barsanore, Saint Laurent of Br\u00e8vedent, who finally handed over the task to the monks of Beaubec. But as regards thuit the writer is mistaken, he sees in it a form of toft, a building, as in Cricquetot, Ectot, Yvetot, whereas it is the thveit, the clearing, the reclaimed land, as in Braquetuit, le Thuit, Regnetuit, and so forth. Similarly, if he recognises in Clitourps the Norman thorp which means village, he insists that the first syllable of the word must come fromclivus, a slope, whereas it comes from cliff, a precipice. But his biggest blunders are due not so much to his ignorance as to his prejudices. However loyal a Frenchman one is, there is no need to fly in the face of the evidence and take Saint-Laurent en Bray to be the Roman priest, so famous at one time, when he is actually Saint Lawrence \u2018Toot, Archbishop of Dublin. But even more than his patriotic sentiments, your friend\u2019s religious bigotry leads him into strange errors. Thus you have not far from our hosts at la Raspeli\u00e8re two places called Montmartin, Montmartin-sur-Mer and Mont-martin-en-Graignes. In the case of Craignes, the good cur\u00e9 has been quite right, he has seen that Craignes, in Latin Crania, in GreekKrene, means ponds, marshes; how many instances of Cresmays, Croen, Gremeville, Lengronne, might we not adduce? But, when he comes to Montmartin, your self-styled linguist positively insists that these must be parishes dedicated to Saint Martin. He bases his opinion upon the fact that the Saint is their patron, but does not realise that he was only adopted subsequently; or rather he is blinded by his hatred of paganism; he refuses to see that we should say Mont-Saint-Martin as we say Mont-Saint-Michel, if it were a question of Saint Martin, whereas the name Montmartin refers in a far more pagan fashion to temples consecrated to the god Mars, temples of which, it is true, no other vestige remains, but which the undisputed existence in the neighbourhood of vast Roman camps would render highly probable even without the name Montmartin, which removes all doubt. You see that the little pamphlet which you will find at la Raspeli\u00e8re is far from perfect.\u201d I protested that at Combray the cur\u00e9 had often told us interesting etymologies. \u201cHe was probably better on his own ground, the move to Normandy must have made him lose his bearings.\u201d \u201cNor did it do him any good,\u201d I added, \u201cfor he came here with neurasthenia and went away again with rheumatism.\u201d \u201cAh, his neurasthenia is to blame. He has lapsed from neurasthenia to philology, as my worthy master Pocquelin would have said. Tell us, Cottard, do you suppose that neurasthenia can have a disturbing effect on philology, philology a soothing effect on neurasthenia and the relief from neurasthenia lead to rheumatism?\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly, rheumatism and neurasthenia are subordinate forms of neuro-arthritism. You may pass from one to the other by metastasis.\u201d \u201cThe eminent Professor,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cexpresses himself in a French as highly infused with Latin and Greek as M. Purgon himself, of Moli\u00e8resque memory! My uncle, I refer to our national Sarcey. . . . \u201d But he was prevented from finishing his sentence. The Professor had leaped from his seat with a wild shout: \u201cThe devil!\u201d he exclaimed on regaining his power of articulate speech, \u201cwe have passed Maineville (d\u2019you hear?) and Renneville too.\u201d He had just noticed that the train was stopping at Saint-Mars-le-Vetu, where most of the passengers alighted. \u201cThey can\u2019t have run through without stopping. We must have failed to notice it while we were talking about the Cambremers. Listen to me, Ski, pay attention, I am going to tell you \u2018a good one,\u2019\u201d said Cottard, who had taken a fancy to this expression, in common use in certain medical circles. \u201cThe Princess must be on the train, she can\u2019t have seen us, and will have got into another compartment. Come along and find her. Let\u2019s hope this won\u2019t land us in trouble!\u201d And he led us all off in search of Princess Sherbatoff. He found her in the corner of an empty compartment, reading the Revue des Deux Mondes. She had long ago, from fear of rebuffs, acquired the habit of keeping in her place, or remaining in her corner, in life as on the train, and of not offering her hand until the other person had greeted her. She went on reading as the faithful trooped into her carriage. I recognised her immediately; this woman who might have forfeited her position but was nevertheless of exalted birth, who in any event was the pearl of a salon such as the Verdurins\u2019, was the lady whom, on the same train, I had put down, two days earlier, as possibly the keeper of a brothel. Her social personality, which had been so vague, became clear to me as soon as I learned her name, just as when, after racking our brains over a puzzle, we at length hit upon the word which clears up all the obscurity, and which, in the case of a person, is his name. To discover two days later who the person is with whom one has travelled in the train is a far more amusing surprise than to read in the next number of a magazine the clue to the problem set in the previous number. Big restaurants, casinos, local trains, are the family portrait galleries of these social enigmas. \u201cPrincess, we must have missed you at Maineville! May we come and sit in your compartment?\u201d \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d said the Princess who, upon hearing Cottard address her, but only then, raised from her magazine a pair of eyes which, like the eyes of M. de Charlus, although gentler, saw perfectly well the people of whose presence she pretended to be unaware. Cottard, coming to the conclusion that the fact of my having been invited to meet the Cambremers was a sufficient recommendation, decided, after a momentary hesitation, to intro-duce me to the Princess, who bowed with great courtesy but appeared to be hearing my name for the first time. \u201cCr\u00e9 nom!\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cmy wife has forgotten to make them change the buttons on my white waist-coat. Ah! Those women, they never remember anything. Don\u2019t you ever marry, my boy,\u201d he said to me. And as this was one of the pleasantries which he considered appropriate when he had nothing else to say, he peeped out of the corner of his eye at the Princess and the rest of the faithful, who, because he was a Professor and an Academician, smiled back, admiring his good temper and freedom from pride. The Princess informed us that the young violinist had been found. He had been confined to bed the evening before by a sick headache, but was coming that evening and bringing with him a friend of his father whom he had met at Donci\u00e8res. She had learned this from Mme. Verdurin with whom she had taken luncheon that morning, she told us in a rapid voice, rolling her r_s, with her Russian accent, softly at the back of her throat, as though they were not r_s but l_s. \u201cAh! You had luncheon with her this morning,\u201d Cottard said to the Princess; but turned his eyes to myself, the purport of this remark being to shew me on what intimate terms the Princess was with the Mistress. \u201cYou are indeed a faithful adherent!\u201d \u201cYes, I love the little cirlcle, so intelligent, so agleeable, neverl spiteful, quite simple, not at all snobbish, and clevel to theirl fingle-tips.\u201d \u201cNom d\u2019une pipe! I must have lost my ticket, I can\u2019t find it anywhere,\u201d cried Cottard, with an agitation that was, in the circumstances, quite unjustified. He knew that at Douville, where a couple of landaus would be awaiting us, the collector would let him pass without a ticket, and would only bare his head all the more humbly, so that the salute might furnish an explanation of his indulgence, to wit that he had of course recognised Cottard as one of the Verdurins\u2019 regular guests. \u201cThey won\u2019t shove me in the lock-up for that,\u201d the doctor concluded. \u201cYou were saying, Sir,\u201d I inquired of Brichot, \u201cthat there used to be some famous waters near here; how do we know that?\u201d \u201cThe name of the next station is one of a multitude of proofs. It is called Fervaches.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t undlestand what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d mumbled the Princess, as though she were saying to me out of politeness: \u201cHe\u2019s rather a bore, ain\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cWhy, Princess, Fervaches means hot springs. Fervidae aquae. But to return to the young violinist,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cI was quite forgetting, Cottard, to tell you the great news. Had you heard that our poor friend Dechambre, who used to be Mme. Verdurin\u2019s favourite pianist, has just died? It is terribly sad.\u201d \u201cHe was quite young,\u201d replied Cottard, \u201cbut he must have had some trouble with his liver, there must have been something sadly wrong in that quarter, he had been looking very queer indeed for a long time past.\u201d \u201cBut he was not so young as all that,\u201d said Brichot; \u201cin the days when Elstir and Swann used to come to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, Dechambre had already made himself a reputation in Paris, and, what is remarkable, without having first received the baptism of success abroad. Ah! He was no follower of the Gospel according to Saint Barnum, that fellow.\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken, he could not have been going to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, at that time, he was still in the nursery.\u201d \u201cBut, unless my old memory plays me false, I was under the impression that Dechambre used to play Vinteuil\u2019s sonata for Swann, when that clubman, who had broken with the aristocracy, had still no idea that he was one day to become the embourgeoised Prince Consort of our national Odette.\u201d \u201cIt is impossible, Vinteuil\u2019s sonata was played at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s long after Swann ceased to come there,\u201d said the doctor, who, like all people who work hard and think that they remember many things which they imagine to be of use to them, forget many others, a condition which enables them to go into ecstasies over the memories of people who have nothing else to do. \u201cYou are hopelessly muddled, though your brain is as sound as ever,\u201d said the doctor with a smile. Brichot admitted that he was mistaken. The train stopped. We were at la Sogne. The name stirred my curiosity. \u201cHow I should like to know what all these names mean,\u201d I said to Cottard. \u201cYou must ask M. Brichot, he may know, perhaps.\u201d \u201cWhy, la Sogne is la Cicogne, Siconia,\u201d replied Brichot, whom I was burning to interrogate about many other names\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting her attachment to her \u2018corner,\u2019 Mme. Sherbatoff kindly offered to change places with me, so that I might talk more easily with Brichot, whom I wanted to ask about other etymologies that interested me, and assured me that she did not mind in the least whether she travelled with her face or her back to the engine, standing, or seated, or anyhow. She remained on the defensive until she had discovered a newcomer\u2019s intentions, but as soon as she had realised that these were friendly, she would do everything in her power to oblige. At length the train stopped at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, which being more or less equidistant from the villages of F\u00e9terne and Douville, bore for this reason their hyphenated name. \u201cSaperlipopette!\u201d exclaimed Doctor Cottard, when we came to the barrier where the tickets were collected, and, pretending to have only just discovered his loss, \u201cI can\u2019t find my ticket, I must have lost it.\u201d But the collector, taking off his cap, assured him that it did not matter and smiled respectfully. The Princess (giving instructions to the coachman, as though she were a sort of lady in waiting to Mme. Verdurin, who, because of the Cambremers, had not been able to come to the station, as, for that matter, she rarely did) took me, and also Brichot, with herself in one of the carriages. The doctor, Saniette and Ski got into the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The driver, although quite young, was the Verdurins\u2019 first coachman, the only one who had any right to the title; he took them, in the daytime, on all their excursions, for he knew all the roads, and in the evening went down to meet the faithful and took them back to the station later on. He was accompanied by extra helpers (whom he selected if necessary). He was an excellent fellow, sober and capable, but with one of those melancholy faces on which a fixed stare indicates that the merest trifle will make the person fly into a passion, not to say nourish dark thoughts. But at the moment he was quite happy, for he had managed to secure a place for his brother, another excellent type of fellow, with the Verdurins. We began by driving through Douville. Grassy knolls ran down from the village to the sea, in wide slopes to which their saturation in moisture and salt gave a richness, a softness, a vivacity of extreme tones. The islands and indentations of Rivebelle, far nearer now than at Balbec, gave this part of the coast the appearance, novel to me, of a relief map. We passed by some little bungalows, almost all of which were let to painters; turned into a track upon which some loose cattle, as frightened as were our horses, barred our way for ten minutes, and emerged upon the cliff road. \u201cBut, by the immortal gods,\u201d Brichot suddenly asked, \u201clet us return to that poor Dechambre; do you suppose Mme. Verdurin knows? Has anyone toldher?\u201d Mme. Verdurin, like most people who move in society, simply because she needed the society of other people, never thought of them again for a single day, as soon as, being dead, they could no longer come to the Wednesdays, nor to the Saturdays, nor dine without dressing. And one could not say of the little clan, a type in this respect of all salons, that it was composed of more dead than living members, seeing that, as soon as one was dead, it was as though one had never existed. But, to escape the nuisance of having to speak of the deceased, in other words to postpone one of the dinners \u2014 a thing impossible to the mistress \u2014 as a token of mourning, M. Verdurin used to pretend that the death of the faithful had such an effect on his wife that, in the interest of her health, it must never be mentioned to her. Moreover, and perhaps just because the death of other people seemed to him so conclusive, so vulgar an accident, the thought of his own death filled him with horror and he shunned any consideration that might lead to it. As for Brichot, since he was the soul of honesty and completely taken in by what M. Verdurin said about his wife, he dreaded for his friend\u2019s sake the emotions that such a bereavement must cause her. \u201cYes, she knew the worst this morning,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cit was impossible to keep it from her.\u201d \u201cAh! Thousand thunders of Zeus!\u201d cried Brichot. \u201cAh! it must have been a terrible blow, a friend of twenty-five years\u2019 standing. There was a man who was one of us.\u201d \u201cOf course, of course, what can you expect? Such incidents are bound to be painful; but Madame Verdurin is a brave woman, she is even more cerebral than emotive.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t altogether agree with the Doctor,\u201d said the Princess, whose rapid speech, her murmured accents, certainly made her appear both sullen and rebellious. \u201cMme. Verdurin, beneath a cold exterior, conceals treasures of sensibility. M. Verdurin told me that he had had great difficulty in preventing her from going to Paris for the funeral; he was obliged to let her think that it was all to be held in the country.\u201d \u201cThe devil! She wanted to go to Paris, did she? Of course, I know that she has a heart, too much heart perhaps. Poor Dechambre! As Madame Verdurin remarked not two months ago: \u2018Compared with him, Plant\u00e9, Paderewski, Risler himself are nowhere!\u2019 Ah, he could say with better reason than that limelighter Nero, who has managed to take in even German scholarship:Qualis artifex pereo! But he at least, Dechambre, must have died in the fulfilment of his priesthood, in the odour of Beethovenian devotion; and gallantly, I have no doubt; he had every right, that interpreter of German music, to pass away while celebrating the Mass in D. But he was, when all is said, the man to greet the unseen with a cheer, for that inspired performer would produce at times from the Parisianised Champagne stock of which he came, the swagger and smartness of a guardsman.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the height we had now reached, the sea suggested no longer, as at Balbec, the undulations of swelling mountains, but on the contrary the view, beheld from a mountain-top or from a road winding round its flank, of a blue-green glacier or a glittering plain, situated at a lower level. The lines of the currents seemed to be fixed upon its surface, and to have traced there for ever their concentric circles; the enamelled face of the sea which changed imperceptibly in colour, assumed towards the head of the bay, where an estuary opened, the blue whiteness of milk, in which little black boats that did not move seemed entangled like flies. I felt that from nowhere could one discover a vaster prospect. But at each turn in the road a fresh expanse was added to it and when we arrived at the Douville toll-house, the spur of the cliff which until then had concealed from us half the bay, withdrew, and all of a sudden I descried upon my left a gulf as profound as that which I had already had before me, but one that changed the proportions of the other and doubled its beauty. The air at this lofty point acquired a keenness and purity that intoxicated me. I adored the Verdurins; that they should have sent a carriage for us seemed to me a touching act of kindness. I should have liked to kiss the Princess. I told her that I had never seen anything so beautiful. She professed that she too loved this spot more than any other. But I could see that to her as to the Verdurins the thing that really mattered was not to gaze at the view like tourists, but to partake of good meals there, to entertain people whom they liked, to write letters, to read books, in short to live in these surroundings, passively allowing the beauty of the scene to soak into them rather than making it the object of their attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the toll-house, where the carriage had stopped for a moment at such a height above the sea that, as from a mountain-top, the sight of the blue gulf beneath almost made one dizzy, I opened the window; the sound, distinctly caught, of each wave that broke in turn had something sublime in its softness and precision. Was it not like an index of measurement which, upsetting all our ordinary impressions, shews us that vertical distances may be coordinated with horizontal, in contradiction of the idea that our mind generally forms of them; and that, though they bring the sky nearer to us in this way, they are not great; that they are indeed less great for a sound which traverses them as did the sound of those little waves, the medium through which it has to pass being purer. And in fact if one went back but a couple of yards below the toll-house, one could no longer distinguish that sound of waves, which six hundred feet of cliff had not robbed of its delicate, minute and soft precision. I said to myself that my grandmother would have listened to it with the delight that she felt in all manifestations of nature or art, in the simplicity of which one discerns grandeur. I was now at the highest pitch of exaltation, which raised everything round about me accordingly. It melted my heart that the Verdurins should have sent to meet us at the station. I said as much to the Princess, who seemed to think that I was greatly exaggerating so simple an act of courtesy. I know that she admitted subsequently to Cottard that she found me very enthusiastic; he replied that I was too emotional, required sedatives and ought to take to knitting. I pointed out to the Princess every tree, every little house smothered in its mantle of roses, I made her admire everything, I would have liked to take her in my arms and press her to my heart. She told me that she could see that I had a gift for painting, that of course I must sketch, that she was surprised that nobody had told her about it. And she confessed that the country was indeed pic-I turesque. We drove through, where it perched upon its height, the little I village of Englesqueville (Engleberti villa, Brichot informed us). \u201cBut are you quite sure that there will be a party this evening, in spite of Dechambre\u2019s death, Princess?\u201d he went on, without stopping to think that the presence at the station of the carriage in which we were sitting was in itself an answer to his question. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cM. Verldulin insisted that it should not be put off, simply to keep his wife from thinking. And besides, after never failing for all these years to entertain on Wednesdays, such a change in her habits would have been bound to upset her. Her nerves are velly bad just now. M. Verdurin was particularly pleased that you were coming to dine this evening, because he knew that it would be a great distraction for Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said the Princess, forgetting her pretence of having never heard my name before. \u201cI think that it will be as well not to sayanything in front of Mme. Verdurin,\u201d the Princess added. \u201cAh! I am glad you warned me,\u201d Brichot artlessly replied. \u201cI shall pass on your suggestion to Cottard.\u201d The carriage stopped for a moment. It moved on again, but the sound that the wheels had been making in the village street had ceased. We had turned into the main avenue of la Raspeli\u00e8re where M. Verdurin stood waiting for us upon the steps. \u201cI did well to put on a dinner-jacket,\u201d he said, observing with pleasure that the faithful had put on theirs, \u201csince I have such smart gentlemen in my party.\u201d And as I apologised for not having changed: \u201cWhy, that\u2019s quite all right. We\u2019re all friends here. I should be delighted to offer you one of my own dinner-jackets, but it wouldn\u2019t fit you.\u201d The handclasp throbbing with emotion which, as he entered the hall of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and by way of condolence at the death of the pianist, Brichot gave our host elicited no response from the latter. I told him how greatly I admired the scenery. \u201cAh! All the better, and you\u2019ve seen nothing, we must take you round. Why not come and spend a week or two here, the air is excellent.\u201d Brichot was afraid that his handclasp had not been understood. \u201cAh! Poor Dechambre!\u201d he said, but in an undertone, in case Mme. Verdurin was within earshot. \u201cIt is terrible,\u201d replied M. Verdurin lightly. \u201cSo young,\u201d Brichot pursued the point. Annoyed at being detained over these futilities, M. Verdurin replied in a hasty tone and with an embittered groan, not of grief but of irritated impatience: \u201cWhy yes, of course, but what\u2019s to be done about it, it\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk, talking about him won\u2019t bring him back to life, will it?\u201d And, his civility returning with his joviality: \u201cCome along, my good Brichot, get your things off quickly. We have a bouillabaisse which mustn\u2019t be kept waiting. But, in heaven\u2019s name, don\u2019t start talking about Dechambre to Madame Verdurin. You know that she always hides her feelings, but she is quite morbidly sensitive. I give you my word, when she heard that Dechambre was dead, she almost cried,\u201d said M. Verdurin in a tone of profound irony. One might have concluded, from hearing him speak, that it implied a form of insanity to regret the death of a friend of thirty years\u2019 standing, and on the other hand one gathered that the perpetual union of M. Verdurin and his wife did not preclude his constantly criticising her and her frequently irritating him. \u201cIf you mention it to her, she will go and make herself ill again. It is deplorable, three weeks after her bronchitis. When that happens, it is I who have to be sick-nurse. You can understand that I have had more than enough of it. Grieve for Dechambre\u2019s fate in your heart as much as you like. Think of him, but do not speak about him. I was very fond of Dechambre, but you cannot blame me for being fonder still of my wife. Here\u2019s Cottard, now, you can ask him.\u201d And indeed, he knew that a family doctor can do many little services, such as prescribing that one must not give way to grief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The docile Cottard had said to the Mistress: \u201cUpset yourself like that, and to-morrow you will give me a temperature of 102,\u201d as he might have said to the cook: \u201cTo-morrow you will give me a riz de veau.\u201d Medicine, when it fails to cure the sick, busies itself with changing the sense of verbs and pronouns\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin was glad to find that Saniette, notwithstanding the snubs that he had had to endure two days earlier, had not deserted the little nucleus. And indeed Mme. Verdurin and her husband had acquired, in their idleness, cruel instincts for which the great occasions, occurring too rarely, no longer sufficed. They had succeeded in effecting a breach between Odette and Swann, between Brichot and his mistress. They would try it again with some one else, that was understood. But the opportunity did not present itself every day. Whereas, thanks to his shuddering sensibility, his timorous and quickly aroused shyness, Saniette provided them with a whipping-block for every day in the year. And so, for fear of his failing them, they took care always to invite him with friendly and persuasive words, such as the bigger boys at school, the old soldiers in a regiment, address to a recruit whom they are anxious to beguile so that they may get him into their clutches, with the sole object of flattering him for the moment and bullying him when he can no longer escape. \u201cWhatever you do,\u201d Brichot reminded Cottard, who had not heard what M. Verdurin was saying, \u201cmum\u2019s the word before Mme. Verdurin. Have no fear, O Cottard, you are dealing with a sage, as Theocritus says. Besides, M. Verdurin is right, what is the use of lamentations,\u201d he went on, for, being capable of assimilating forms of speech and the ideas which they suggested to him, but having no finer perception, he had admired in M. Verdurin\u2019s remarks the most courageous stoicism. \u201cAll the same, it is a great talent that has gone from the world.\u201d \u201cWhat, are you still talking about Dechambre,\u201d said M. Verdurin, who had gone on ahead of us, and, seeing that we were not following him, had turned back. \u201cListen,\u201d he said to Brichot, \u201cnothing is gained by exaggeration. The fact of his being dead is no excuse for making him out a genius, which he was not. He played well, I admit, and what is more, he was in his proper element here; transplanted, he ceased to exist. My wife was infatuated with him and made his reputation. You know what she is. I will go farther, in the interest of his own reputation he has died at the right moment, he is done to a turn, as the demoiselles de Caen, grilled according to the incomparable recipe of Pampilles, are going to be, I hope (unless you keep us standing here all night with your jeremiads in this Kasbah exposed to all the winds of heaven). You don\u2019t seriously expect us all to die of hunger because Dechambre is dead, when for the last year he was obliged to practise scales before giving a concert; to recover for the moment, and for the moment only, the suppleness of his wrists. Besides, you are going to hear this evening, or at any rate to meet, for the rascal is too fond of deserting his art, after dinner, for the card-table, somebody who is a far greater artist than Dechambre, a youngster whom my wife has discovered\u201d (as she had discovered Dechambre, and Paderewski, and everybody else): \u201cMorel. He has not arrived yet, the devil. He is coming with an old friend of his family whom he has picked up, and who bores him to tears, but otherwise, not to get into trouble with his father, he would have been obliged to stay down at Donci\u00e8res and keep him company: the Baron de Charlus.\u201d The faithful entered the drawing-room. M. Verdurin, who had remained behind with me while I took off my things, took my arm by way of a joke, as one\u2019s host does at a dinner-party when there is no lady for one to take in. \u201cDid you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cYes, M. Brichot told me things which interested me greatly,\u201d said I, thinking of the etymologies, and because I had heard that the Verdurins greatly admired Brichot. \u201cI am surprised to hear that he told you anything,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201che is such a retiring man, and talks so little about the things he knows.\u201d This compliment did not strike me as being very apt. \u201cHe seems charming,\u201d I remarked. \u201cExquisite, delicious, not the sort of man you meet every day, such a light, fantastic touch, my wife adores him, and so do I!\u201d replied M. Verdurin in an exaggerated tone, as though repeating a lesson. Only then did I grasp that what he had said to me about Brichot was ironical. And I asked myself whether M. Verdurin, since those far-off days of which I had heard reports, had not shaken off the yoke of his wife\u2019s tutelage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sculptor was greatly astonished to learn that the Verdurins were willing to have M. de Charlus in their house. Whereas in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where M. de Charlus was so well known, nobody ever referred to his morals (of which most people had no suspicion, others remained doubtful, crediting him rather with intense but Platonic friendships, with behaving imprudently, while the enlightened few strenuously denied, shrugging their shoulders, any insinuation upon which some malicious Gallardon might venture), those morals, the nature of which was known perhaps to a few intimate friends, were, on the other hand, being denounced daily far from the circle in which he moved, just as, at times, the sound of artillery fire is audible only beyond a zone of silence. Moreover, in those professional and artistic circles where he was regarded as the typical instance of inversion, his great position in society, his noble origin were completely unknown, by a process analogous to that which, among the people of Rumania, has brought it about that the name of Ron-sard is known as that of a great nobleman, while his poetical work is unknown there. Not only that, the Rumanian estimate of Ronsard\u2019s nobility is founded upon an error. Similarly, if in the world of painters and actors M. de Charlus had such an evil reputation, that was due to their confusing him with a certain Comte Leblois de Charlus who was not even related to him (or, if so, the connexion was extremely remote), and who had been arrested, possibly by mistake, in the course of a police raid which had become historic. In short, all the stories related of our M. de Charlus referred to the other. Many professionals swore that they had had relations with M. de Charlus, and did so in good faith, believing that the false M. de Charlus was the true one, the false one possibly encouraging, partly from an affectation of nobility, partly to conceal his vice, a confusion which to the true one (the Baron whom we already know) was for a long time damaging, and afterwards, when he had begun to go down the hill, became a convenience, for it enabled him likewise to say: \u201cThat is not myself.\u201d And in the present instance it was not he to whom the rumours referred. Finally, what enhanced the falsehood of the reports of an actual fact (the Baron\u2019s tendencies), he had had an intimate and perfectly pure friendship with an author who, in the theatrical world, had for some reason acquired a similar reputation which he in no way deserved. When they were seen together at a first night, people would say: \u201cYou see,\u201d just as it was supposed that the Duchesse de Guermantes had immoral relations with the Princesse de Parme; an indestructible legend, for it would be disproved only in the presence of those two great ladies themselves, to which the people who repeated it would presumably never come any nearer than by staring at them through their glasses in the theatre and slandering them to the occupant of the next stall. Given M. de Charlus\u2019s morals, the sculptor concluded all the more readily that the Baron\u2019s social position must be equally low, since he had no sort of information whatever as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged, his title or his name. Just as Cottard imagined that everybody knew that the degree of Doctor of Medicine implied nothing, the title of Consultant to a Hospital meant something, so people in society are mistaken when they suppose that everybody has the same idea of the social importance of their name as they themselves and the other people of their set\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Prince d\u2019Agrigente was regarded as a swindler by a club servant to whom he owed twenty-five louis, and regained his importance only in the Faubourg Saint-Germain where he had three sisters who were Duchesses, for it is not among the humble people in whose eyes he is of small account, but among the smart people who know what is what, that the great nobleman creates an effect. M. de Charlus, for that matter, was to learn in the course of the evening that his host had the vaguest ideas about the most illustrious ducal families\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain that the Verdurins were making a grave mistake in allowing an individual of tarnished reputation to be admitted to so \u2018select\u2019 a household as theirs, the sculptor felt it his duty to take the Mistress aside. \u201cYou are entirely mistaken, besides I never pay any attention to those tales, and even if it were true, I may be allowed to point out that it could hardly compromise me!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, furious, for Morel being the principal feature of the Wednesdays, the chief thing for her was not to give any offence to him. As for Cottard, he could not express an opinion, for he had asked leave to go upstairs for a moment to \u2018do a little job\u2019 in thebuen retiro, and after that, in M. Verdurin\u2019s bedroom, to write an extremely urgent letter for a patient\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A great publisher from Paris who had come to call, expecting to be invited to stay to dinner, withdrew abruptly, quickly, realising that he was not smart enough for the little clan. He was a tall, stout man, very dark, with a studious and somewhat cutting air. He reminded one of an ebony paper-knife\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin who, to welcome us in her immense drawing-room, in which displays of grasses, poppies, field-flowers, plucked only that morning, alternated with a similar theme painted on the walls, two centuries earlier, by an artist of exquisite taste, had risen for a moment from a game of cards which she was playing with an old friend, begged us to excuse her for just one minute while she finished her game, talking to us the while. What I told her about my impressions did not, however, seem altogether to please her. For one thing I was shocked to observe that she and her husband came indoors every day long before the hour of those sunsets which were considered so fine when seen from that cliff, and finer still from the terrace of la Raspeli\u00e8re, and which I would have travelled miles to see. \u201cYes, it\u2019s incomparable,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin carelessly, with a glance at the huge windows which gave the room a wall of glass. \u201cEven though we have it always in front of us, we never grow tired of it,\u201d and she turned her attention back to her cards. Now my very enthusiasm made me exacting. I expressed my regret that I could not see from the drawing-room the rocks of Darnetal, which, Elstir had told me, were quite lovely at that hour, when they reflected so many colours. \u201cAh! You can\u2019t see them from here, you would have to go to the end of the park, to the \u2018view of the bay.\u2019 From the seat there, you can take in the whole panorama. But you can\u2019t go there by yourself, you will lose your way. I can take you there, if you like,\u201d she added kindly. \u201cNo, no, you are not satisfied with the illness you had the other day, you want to make yourself ill again. He will come back, he can see the view of the bay another time.\u201d I did not insist, and understood that it was enough for the Verdurins to know that this sunset made its way into their drawing-room or dining-room, like a magnificent painting, like a priceless Japanese enamel, justifying the high rent that they were paying for la Raspeli\u00e8re, with plate and linen, but a thing to which they rarely raised their eyes; the important thing, here, for them was to live comfortably, to take drives, to feed well, to talk, to entertain agreeable friends whom they provided with amusing games of billiards, good meals, merry tea-parties. I noticed, however, later on, how intelligently they had learned to know the district, taking their guests for excursions as \u2018novel\u2019 as the music to which they made them listen. The part which the flowers of la Raspeli\u00e8re, the roads by the sea\u2019s edge, the old houses, the undiscovered churches, played in the life of M. Verdurin was so great that those people who saw him only in Paris and who, themselves, substituted for the life by the seaside and in the country the refinements of life in town could barely understand the idea that he himself formed of his own life, or the importance that his pleasures gave him in his own eyes. This importance was further enhanced by the fact that the Verdurins were convinced that la Raspeli\u00e8re, which they hoped to purchase, was a property without its match in the world. This superiority which their self-esteem made them attribute to la Raspeli\u00e8re justified in their eyes my enthusiasm which, but for that, would have annoyed them slightly, because of the disappointments which it involved (like my disappointment when long ago I had first listened to Berma) and which I frankly admitted to them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear the carriage coming back,\u201d the Mistress suddenly murmured. Let us state briefly that Mme. Verdurin, quite apart from the inevitable changes due to increasing years, no longer resembled what she had been at the time when Swann and Odette used to listen to the little phrase in her house. Even when she heard it played, she was no longer obliged to assume the air of attenuated admiration which she used to assume then, for that had become her normal expression. Under the influence of the countless neuralgias which the music of Bach, Wagner, Vinteuil, Debussy had given her, Mme. Verdurin\u2019s brow had assumed enormous proportions, like limbs that are finally crippled by rheumatism. Her temples, suggestive of a pair of beautiful, pain-stricken, milk-white spheres, in which Harmony rolled endlessly, flung back upon either side her silvered tresses, and proclaimed, on the Mistress\u2019s behalf, without any need for her to say a word: \u201cI know what is in store for me to-night.\u201d Her features no longer took the trouble to formulate successively aesthetic impressions of undue violence, for they had themselves become their permanent expression on a countenance ravaged and superb. This attitude of resignation to the ever impending sufferings inflicted by Beauty, and of the courage that was required to make her dress for dinner when she had barely recovered from the effects of the last sonata, had the result that Mme. Verdurin, even when listening to the most heartrending music, preserved a disdainfully impassive countenance, and actually withdrew into retirement to swallow her two spoonfuls of aspirin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes, here they are!\u201d M. Verdurin cried with relief when he saw the door open to admit Morel, followed by M. de Charlus. The latter, to whom dining with the Verdurins meant not so much going into society as going into questionable surroundings, was as frightened as a schoolboy making his way for the first time into a brothel with the utmost deference towards its mistress. Moreover the persistent desire that M. de Charlus felt to appear virile and frigid was overcome (when he appeared in the open doorway) by those traditional ideas of politeness which are awakened as soon as shyness destroys an artificial attitude and makes an appeal to the resources of the subconscious. When it is a Charlus, whether he be noble or plebeian, that is stirred by such a sentiment of instinctive and atavistic politeness to strangers, it is always the spirit of a relative of the female sex, attendant like a goddess, or incarnate as a double, that undertakes to introduce him into a strange drawing-room and to mould his attitude until he comes face to face with his hostess. Thus a young painter, brought up by a godly, Protestant, female cousin, will enter a room, his head aslant and quivering, his eyes raised to the ceiling, his hands gripping an invisible muff, the remembered shape of which and its real and tutelary presence will help the frightened artist to cross without agoraphobia the yawning abyss between the hall and the inner drawing-room. Thus it was that the pious relative, whose memory is helping him to-day, used to enter a room years ago, and with so plaintive an air that one was asking oneself what calamity she had come to announce, when from her first words one realised, as now in the case of the painter, that she had come to pay an after-dinner call. By virtue of the same law, which requires that life, in the interests of the still unfulfilled act, shall bring into play, utilise, adulterate, in a perpetual prostitution, the most respectable, it may be the most sacred, sometimes only the most innocent legacies from the past, and albeit in this instance it engendered a different aspect, the one of Mme. Cottard\u2019s nephews who distressed his family by his effeminate ways and the company he kept would always make a joyous entry as though he had a surprise in store for you or were going to inform you that he had been left a fortune, radiant with a happiness which it would have been futile to ask him to explain, it being due to his unconscious heredity and his misplaced sex. He walked upon tiptoe, was no doubt himself astonished that he was not holding a cardcase, offered you his hand parting his lips as he had seen his aunt part hers, and his uneasy glance was directed at the mirror in which he seemed to wish to make certain, albeit he was bare-headed, whether his hat, as Mme. Cottard had once inquired of Swann, was not askew. As for M. de Charlus, whom the society in which he had lived furnished, at this critical moment, with different examples, with other patterns of affability, and above all with the maxim that one must, in certain cases, when dealing with people of humble rank, bring into play and make use of one\u2019s rarest graces, which one normally holds in reserve, it was with a flutter, archly, and with the same sweep with which a skirt would have enlarged and impeded his waddling motion that he advanced upon Mme. Verdurin with so flattered and honoured an air that one would have said that to be taken to her house was for him a supreme favour. One would have thought that it was Mme. de Marsantes who was entering the room, so prominent at that moment was the woman whom a mistake on the part of Nature had enshrined in the body of M. de Charlus. It was true that the Baron had made every effort to obliterate this mistake and to assume a masculine appearance. But no sooner had he succeeded than, he having in the meantime kept the same tastes, this habit of looking at things through a woman\u2019s eyes gave him a fresh feminine appearance, due this time not to heredity but to his own way of living. And as he had gradually come to regard even social questions from the feminine point of view, and without noticing it, for it is not only by dint of lying to other people, but also by lying to oneself that one ceases to be aware that one is lying, albeit he had called upon his body to manifest (at the moment of his entering the Verdurins\u2019 drawing-room) all the courtesy of a great nobleman, that body which had fully understood what M. de Charlus had ceased to apprehend, displayed, to such an extent that the Baron would have deserved the epithet \u2018ladylike,\u2019 all the attractions of a great lady. Not that there need be any connexion between the appearance of M. de Charlus and the fact that sons, who do not always take after their fathers, even without being inverts, and though they go after women, may consummate upon their faces the profanation of their mothers. But we need not consider here a subject that deserves a chapter to itself: the Profanation of the Mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albeit other reasons dictated this transformation of M. de Charlus, and purely physical ferments set his material substance \u2018working\u2019 and made his body pass gradually into the category of women\u2019s bodies, nevertheless the change that we record here was of spiritual origin. By dint of supposing yourself to be ill you become ill, grow thin, are too weak to rise from your bed, suffer from nervous enteritis. By dint of thinking tenderly of men you become a woman, and an imaginary spirit hampers your movements. The obsession, just as in the other instance it affects your health, may in this instance alter your sex. Morel, who accompanied him, came to shake hands with me. From that first moment, owing to a twofold change that occurred in him I formed (alas, I was not warned in time to act upon it!) a bad impression of him. I have said that Morel, having risen above his father\u2019s menial status, was generally pleased to indulge in a contemptuous familiarity. He had talked to me on the day when he brought me the photographs without once addressing me as Monsieur, treating me as an inferior. What was my surprise at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s to see him bow very low before me, and before me alone, and to hear, before he had even uttered a syllable to anyone else, words of respect, most respectful \u2014 such words as I thought could not possibly flow from his pen or fall from his lips \u2014 addressed to myself. I at once suspected that he had some favour to ask of me. Taking me aside a minute later: \u201cMonsieur would be doing me a very great service,\u201d he said to me, going so far this time as to address me in the third person, \u201cby keeping from Mme. Verdurin and her guests the nature of the profession that my father practised with his uncle. It would be best to say that he was, in your family, the agent for estates so considerable as to put him almost on a level with your parents,\u201d Morel\u2019s request annoyed me intensely because it obliged me to magnify not his father\u2019s position, in which I took not the slightest interest, but the wealth \u2014 the apparent wealth of my own, which I felt to be absurd. But he appeared so unhappy, so pressing, that I could not refuse him. \u201cNo, before dinner,\u201d he said in an imploring tone, \u201cMonsieur can easily find some excuse for taking Mme. Verdurin aside.\u201d This was what, in the end, I did, trying to enhance to the best of my ability the distinction of Morel\u2019s father, without unduly exaggerating the \u2018style,\u2019 the \u2018worldly goods\u2019 of my own family. It went like a letter through the post, notwithstanding the astonishment of Mme. Verdurin, who had had a nodding acquaintance with my grandfather. And as she had no tact, hated family life (that dissolvent of the little nucleus), after telling me that she remembered, long ago, seeing my great-grandfather, and after speaking of him as of somebody who was almost an idiot, who would have been incapable of understanding the little group, and who, to use her expression, \u201cwas not one of us,\u201d she said to me: \u201cFamilies are such a bore, the only thing is to get right away from them;\u201d and at once proceeded to tell me of a trait in my great-grandfather\u2019s character of which I was unaware, although I might have suspected it at home (I had never seen him, but they frequently spoke of him), his remarkable stinginess (in contrast to the somewhat excessive generosity of my great-uncle, the friend of the lady in pink and Morel\u2019s father\u2019s employer): \u201cWhy, of course, if your grandparents had such a grand agent, that only shews that there are all sorts of people in a family. Your grandfather\u2019s father was so stingy that, at the end of his life, when he was almost half-witted \u2014 between you and me, he was never anything very special, you are worth the whole lot of them \u2014 he could not bring himself to pay a penny for his ride on the omnibus. So that they were obliged to have him followed by somebody who paid his fare for him, and to let the old miser think that his friend M. de Persigny, the Cabinet Minister, had given him a permit to travel free on the omnibuses. But I am delighted to hear that our Morel\u2019s father held such a good position. I was under the impression that he had been a schoolmaster, but that\u2019s nothing, I must have misunderstood. In any case, it makes not the slightest difference, for I must tell you that here we appreciate only true worth, the personal contribution, what I call the participation. Provided that a person is artistic, provided in a word that he is one of the brotherhood, nothing else matters.\u201d The way in which Morel was one of the brotherhood was \u2014 so far as I have been able to discover \u2014 that he was sufficiently fond of both women and men to satisfy either sex with the fruits of his experience of the other. But what it is essential to note here is that as soon as I had given him my word that I would speak on his behalf to Mme. Verdurin, as soon, moreover, as I had actually done so, and without any possibility of subsequent retractation, Morel\u2019s \u2018respect\u2019 for myself vanished as though by magic, the formal language of respect melted away, and indeed for some time he avoided me, contriving to appear contemptuous of me, so that if Mme. Verdurin wanted me to give him a message, to ask him to play something, he would continue to talk to one of the faithful, then move on to another, changing his seat if I approached him. The others were obliged to tell him three or four times that I had spoken to him, after which he would reply, with an air of constraint, briefly, that is to say unless we were by ourselves. When that happened, he was expansive, friendly, for there was a charming side to him. I concluded all the same from this first evening that his must be a vile nature, that he would not, at a pinch, shrink from any act of meanness, was incapable of gratitude. In which he resembled the majority of mankind. But inasmuch as I had inherited a strain of my grandmother\u2019s nature, and enjoyed the diversity of other people without expecting anything of them or resenting anything that they did, I overlooked his baseness, rejoiced in his gaiety when it was in evidence, and indeed in what I believe to have been a genuine affection on his part when, having gone the whole circuit of his false ideas of human nature, he realised (with a jerk, for he shewed strange reversions to a blind and primitive savagery) that my kindness to him was disinterested, that my indulgence arose not from a want of perception but from what he called goodness; and, more important still, I was enraptured by his art which indeed was little more than an admirable virtuosity, but which made me (without his being in the intellectual sense of the word a real musician) hear again or for the first time so much good music. Moreover a manager \u2014 M. de Charlus (whom I had not suspected of such talents, albeit Mme. de Guermantes, who had known him a very different person in their younger days, asserted that he had composed a sonata for her, painted a fan, and so forth), modest in regard to his true merits, but possessing talents of the first order, contrived to place this virtuosity at the service of a versatile artistic sense which increased it tenfold. Imagine a merely skilful performer in the Russian ballet, formed, educated, developed in all directions by M. Diaghileff\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had just given Mme. Verdurin the message with which Morel had charged me and was talking to M. de Charlus about Saint-Loup, when Cottard burst into the room announcing, as though the house were on fire, that the Cambremers had arrived. Mme. Verdurin, not wishing to appear before strangers such as M. de Charlus (whom Cottard had not seen) and myself to attach any great importance to the arrival of the Cambremers, did not move, made no response to the announcement of these tidings, and merely said to the doctor, fanning herself gracefully, and adopting the tone of a Marquise in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais: \u201cThe Baron has just been telling us. . . . \u201d This was too much for Cottard! Less abruptly than he would have done in the old days, for learning and high positions had added weight to his utterance, but with the emotion, nevertheless, which he recaptured at the Verdurins\u2019, he exclaimed: \u201cA Baron! What Baron? Where\u2019s the Baron?\u201d staring around the room with an astonishment that bordered on incredulity. Mme. Verdurin, with the affected indifference of a hostess when a servant has, in front of her guests, broken a valuable glass, and with the artificial, highfalutin tone of a conservatoire prize-winner acting in a play by the younger Dumas, replied, pointing with her fan to Morel\u2019s patron: \u201cWhy, the Baron de Charlus, to whom let me introduce you, M. le Professeur Cottard.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was, for that matter, by no means sorry to have an opportunity of playing the leading lady. M. de Charlus proffered two fingers which the Professor clasped with the kindly smile of a \u2018Prince of Science.\u2019 But he stopped short upon seeing the Cambremers enter the room, while M. de Charlus led me into a corner to tell me something, not without feeling my muscles, which is a German habit. M. de Cambremer bore no resemblance to the old Marquise. To anyone who had only heard of him, or of letters written by him, well and forcibly expressed, his personal appearance was startling. No doubt, one would grow accustomed to it. But his nose had chosen to place itself aslant above his mouth, perhaps the only crooked line, among so many, which one would never have thought of tracing upon his face, and one that indicated a vulgar stupidity, aggravated still further by the proximity of a Norman complexion on cheeks that were like two ripe apples. It is possible that the eyes of M. de Cambremer retained behind their eyelids a trace of the sky of the Cotentin, so soft upon sunny days when the wayfarer amuses himself in watching, drawn up by the roadside, and counting in their hundreds the shadows of the poplars, but those eyelids, heavy, bleared and drooping, would have prevented the least flash of intelligence from escaping. And so, discouraged by the meagreness of that azure glance, one returned to the big crooked nose. By a transposition of the senses, M. de Cambremer looked at you with his nose. This nose of his was not ugly, it was if anything too handsome, too bold, too proud of its own importance. Arched, polished, gleaming, brand new, it was amply prepared to atone for the inadequacy of his eyes. Unfortunately, if the eyes are sometimes the organ through which our intelligence is revealed, the nose (to leave out of account the intimate solidarity and the unsuspected repercussion of one feature upon the rest), the nose is generally the organ in which stupidity is most readily displayed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The propriety of the dark clothes which M. de Cambremer invariably wore, even in the morning, might well reassure those who were dazzled and exasperated by the insolent brightness of the seaside attire of people whom they did not know; still it was impossible to understand why the chief magistrate\u2019s wife should have declared with an air of discernment and authority, as a person who knows far more than you about the high society of Alen\u00e7on, that on seeing M. de Cambremer one immediately felt oneself, even before one knew who he was, in the presence of a man of supreme distinction, of a man of perfect breeding, a change from the sort of person one saw at Balbec, a man in short in whose company one could breathe freely. He was to her, stifled by all those Balbec tourists who did not know her world, like a bottle of smelling salts. It seemed to me on the contrary that he was one of the people whom my grandmother would at once have set down as \u2018all wrong,\u2019 and that, as she had no conception of snobbishness, she would no doubt have been stupefied that he could have succeeded in winning the hand of Mlle. Legrandin, who must surely be difficult to please, having a brother who was \u2018so refined.\u2019 At best one might have said of M. de Cambremer\u2019s plebeian ugliness that it was redolent of the soil and preserved a very ancient local tradition; one was reminded, on examining his faulty features, which one would have liked to correct, of those names of little Norman towns as to the etymology of which my friend the cur\u00e9 was mistaken because the peasants, mispronouncing the names, or having misunderstood the Latin or Norman words that underlay them, have finally fixed in a barbarism to be found already in the cartularies, as Brichot would have said, a wrong meaning and a fault of pronunciation. Life in these old towns may, for all that, be pleasant enough, and M. de Cambremer must have had his good points, for if it was in a mother\u2019s nature that the old Marquise should prefer her son to her daughter-in-law, on the other hand, she, who had other children, of whom two at least were not devoid of merit, was often heard to declare that the Marquis was, in her opinion, the best of the family. During the short time he had spent in the army, his messmates, finding Cambremer too long a name to pronounce, had given him the nickname Cancan, implying a flow of chatter, which he in no way merited. He knew how to brighten a dinner-party to which he was invited by saying when the fish (even if it were stale) or the entr\u00e9e came in: \u201cI say, that looks a fine animal.\u201d And his wife, who had adopted upon entering the family everything that she supposed to form part of their customs, put herself on the level of her husband\u2019s friends and perhaps sought to please him, like a mistress, and as though she had been involved in his bachelor existence, by saying in a careless tone when she was speaking of him to officers: \u201cYou shall see Cancan presently. Cancan has gone to Balbec, but he will be back this evening.\u201d She was furious at having compromised herself by coming to the Verdurins\u2019 and had done so only upon the entreaties of her mother-in-law and husband, in the hope of renewing the lease. But, being less well-bred than they, she made no secret of the ulterior motive and for the last fortnight had been making fun of this dinner-party to her women friends. \u201cYou know we are going to dine with our tenants. That will be well worth an increased rent. As a matter of fact, I am rather curious to see what they have done to our poor old la Raspeli\u00e8re\u201d (as though she had been born in the house, and would find there all her old family associations). \u201cOur old keeper told me only yesterday that you wouldn\u2019t know the place. I can\u2019t bear to think of all that must be going on there. I am sure we shall have to have the whole place disinfected before we move in again.\u201d She arrived haughty and morose, with the air of a great lady whose castle, owing to a state of war, is occupied by the enemy, but who nevertheless feels herself at home and makes a point of shewing the conquerors that they are intruding. Mme. de Cambremer could not see me at first for I was in a bay at the side of the room with M. de Charlus, who was telling me that he had heard from Morel that Morel\u2019s father had been an \u2018agent\u2019 in my family, and that he, Charlus, credited me with sufficient intelligence and magnanimity (a term common to himself and Swann) to forego the mean and ignoble pleasure which vulgar little idiots (I was warned) would not have failed, in my place, to give themselves by revealing to our hosts details which they might regard as derogatory. \u201cThe mere fact that I take an interest in him and extend my protection over him, gives him a pre-eminence and wipes out the past,\u201d the Baron concluded. As I listened to him and promised the silence which I would have kept even without any hope of being considered in return intelligent and magnanimous, I was looking at Mme. de Cambremer. And I had difficulty in recognising the melting, savoury morsel which I had had beside me the other afternoon at teatime, on the terrace at Balbec, in the Norman rock-cake that I now saw, hard as a rock, in which the faithful would in vain have tried to set their teeth. Irritated in anticipation by the knowledge that her husband inherited his mother\u2019s simple kindliness, which would make him assume a flattered expression whenever one of the faithful was presented to him, anxious however to perform her duty as a leader of society, when Brichot had been named to her she decided to make him and her husband acquainted, as she had seen her more fashionable friends do, but, anger or pride prevailing over the desire to shew her knowledge of the world, she said, not, as she ought to have said: \u201cAllow me to introduce my husband,\u201d but: \u201cI introduce you to my husband,\u201d holding aloft thus the banner of the Cambremers, without avail, for her husband bowed as low before Brichot as she had expected. But all Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s ill humour vanished in an instant when her eye fell on M. de Charlus, whom she knew by sight. Never had she succeeded in obtaining an introduction, even at the time of her intimacy with Swann. For as M. de Charlus always sided with the woman, with his sister-in-law against M. de Guermantes\u2019s mistresses, with Odette, at that time still unmarried, but an old flame of Swann\u2019s, against the new, he had, as a stern defender of morals and faithful protector of homes, given Odette \u2014 and kept \u2014 the promise that he would never allow himself to be presented to Mme. de Cambremer. She had certainly never guessed that it was at the Verdurins\u2019 that she was at length to meet this unapproachable person. M. de Cambremer knew that this was a great joy to her, so great that he himself was moved by it and looked at his wife with an air that implied: \u201cYou are glad now you decided to come, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He spoke very little, knowing that he had married a superior woman. \u201cI, all unworthy,\u201d he would say at every moment, and spontaneously quoted a fable of La Fontaine and one of Florian which seemed to him to apply to his ignorance, and at the same time enable him, beneath the outward form of a contemptuous flattery, to shew the men of science who were not members of the Jockey that one might be a sportsman and yet have read fables. The unfortunate thing was that he knew only two of them. And so they kept cropping up. Mme. de Cambremer was no fool, but she had a number of extremely irritating habits. With her the corruption of names bore absolutely no trace of aristocratic disdain. She was not the person to say, like the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom the mere fact of her birth ought to have preserved even more than Mme. de Cambremer from such an absurdity), with a pretence of not remembering the unfashionable name (albeit it is now that of one of the women whom it is most difficult to approach) of Julien de Monch\u00e2teau: \u201ca little Madame . . . Pica della Mirandola.\u201d No, when Mme. de Cambremer said a name wrong it was out of kindness of heart, so as not to appear to know some damaging fact, and when, in her sincerity, she admitted it, she tried to conceal it by altering it. If, for instance, she was defending a woman, she would try to conceal the fact, while determined not to lie to the person who had asked her to tell the truth, that Madame So-and-so was at the moment the mistress of M. Sylvain Levy, and would say: \u201cNo . . . I know absolutely nothing about her, I fancy that people used to charge her with having inspired a passion in a gentleman whose name I don\u2019t know, something like Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn; anyhow, I believe the gentleman has been dead for years and that there was never anything between them.\u201d This is an analogous, but contrary process to that adopted by liars who think that if they alter their statement of what they have been doing when they make it to a mistress or merely to another man, their listener will not immediately see that the expression (like her Cahn, Kohn, Kuhn) is interpolated, is of a different texture from the rest of the conversation, has a double meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin whispered in her husband\u2019s ear: \u201cShall I offer my arm to the Baron de Charlus? As you will have Mme. de Cambremer on your right, we might divide the honours.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201csince the other is higher in rank\u201d (meaning that M. de Cambremer was a Marquis), \u201cM. de Charlus is, strictly speaking, his inferior.\u201d \u201cVery well, I shall put him beside the Princess.\u201d And Mme. Verdurin introduced Mme. Sherbatoff to M. de Charlus; each of them bowed in silence, with an air of knowing all about the other and of promising a mutual secrecy. M. Verdurin introduced me to M. de Cambremer. Before he had even begun to speak in his loud and slightly stammering voice, his tall figure and high complexion displayed in their oscillation the martial hesitation of a commanding officer who tries to put you at your ease and says: \u201cI have heard about you, I shall see what can be done; your punishment shall be remitted; we don\u2019t thirst for blood here; it will be all right.\u201d Then, as he shook my hand: \u201cI think you know my mother,\u201d he said to me. The word \u2018think\u2019 seemed to him appropriate to the discretion of a first meeting, but not to imply any uncertainty, for he went on: \u201cI have a note for you from her.\u201d M. de Cambremer took a childish pleasure in revisiting a place where he had lived for so long. \u201cI am at home again,\u201d he said to Mme. Verdurin, while his eyes marvelled at recognising the flowers painted on panels over the doors, and the marble busts on their high pedestals. He might, all the same, have felt himself at sea, for Mme. Verdurin had brought with her a quantity of fine old things of her own. In this respect, Mme. Verdurin, while regarded by the Cambremers as having turned everything upside down, was not revolutionary but intelligently conservative in a sense which they did not understand. They were thus wrong in accusing her of hating the old house and of degrading it by hanging plain cloth curtains instead of their rich plush, like an ignorant parish priest reproaching a diocesan architect with putting back in its place the old carved wood which the cleric had thrown on the rubbish heap, and had seen fit to replace with ornaments purchased in the Place Saint-Sulpice. Furthermore, a herb garden was beginning to take the place, in front of the mansion, of the borders that were the pride not merely of the Cambremers but of their gardener. The latter, who regarded the Cambremers as his sole masters, and groaned beneath the yoke of the Verdurins, as though the place were under occupation for the moment by an invading army, went in secret to unburden his griefs to its dispossessed mistress, grew irate at the scorn that was heaped upon his araucarias, begonias, house-leeks, double dahlias, and at anyone\u2019s daring in so grand a place to grow such common plants as camomile and maidenhair. Mme. Verdurin felt this silent opposition and had made up her mind, if she took a long lease of la Raspeli\u00e8re or even bought the place, to make one of her conditions the dismissal of the gardener, by whom his old mistress, on the contrary, set great store. He had worked for her without payment, when times were bad, he adored her; but by that odd multiformity of opinion which we find in the lower orders, among whom the most profound moral scorn is embedded in the most passionate admiration, which in turn overlaps old and undying grudges, he used often to say of Mme. de Cambremer who, in \u201870, in a house that she owned in the East of France, surprised by the invasion, had been obliged to endure for a month the contact of the Germans: \u201cWhat many people can\u2019t forgive Mme. la Marquise is that during the war she took the side of the Prussians and even had them to stay in her house. At any other time, I could understand it; but in war time, she ought not to have done it. It is not right.\u201d So that he was faithful to her unto death, venerated her for her goodness, and firmly believed that she had been guilty of treason. Mme. Verdurin was annoyed that M. de Cambremer should pretend to feel so much at home at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cYou must notice a good many changes, all the same,\u201d she replied. \u201cFor one thing there were those big bronze Barbedienne devils and some horrid little plush chairs which I packed off at once to the attic, though even that is too good a place for them.\u201d After this bitter retort to M. de Cambremer, she offered him her arm to go in to dinner. He hesitated for a moment, saying to himself: \u201cI can\u2019t, really, go in before M. de Charlus.\u201d But supposing the other to be an old friend of the house, seeing that he was not set in the post of honour, he decided to take the arm that was offered him and told Mme. Verdurin how proud he felt to be admitted into the symposium (so it was that he styled the little nucleus, not without a smile of satisfaction at his knowledge of the term). Cottard, who was seated next to M. de Charlus, beamed at him through his glass, to make his acquaintance and to break the ice, with a series of winks far more insistent than they would have been in the old days, and not interrupted by fits of shyness. And these engaging glances, enhanced by the smile that accompanied them, were no longer dammed by the glass but overflowed on all sides. The Baron, who readily imagined people of his own kind everywhere, had no doubt that Cottard was one, and was making eyes at him. At once he turned on the Professor the cold shoulder of the invert, as contemptuous of those whom he attracts as he is ardent in pursuit of such as attract him. No doubt, albeit each one of us speaks mendaciously of the pleasure, always refused him by destiny, of being loved, it is a general law, the application of which is by no means confined to the Charlus type, that the person whom we do not love and who does love us seems to us quite intolerable. To such a person, to a woman of whom we say not that she loves us but that she bores us, we prefer the society of any other, who has neither her charm, nor her looks, nor her brains. She will recover these, in our estimation, only when she has ceased to love us. In this light, we might see only the transposition, into odd terms, of this universal rule in the irritation aroused in an invert by a man who displeases him and runs after him. And so, whereas the ordinary man seeks to conceal what he feels, the invert is implacable in making it felt by the man who provokes it, as he would certainly not make it felt by a woman, M. de Charlus for instance by the Princesse de Guermantes, whose passion for him bored him, but flattered him. But when they see another man shew a peculiar liking for them, then, whether because they fail to realise that this liking is the same as their own, or because it annoys them to be reminded that this liking, which they glorify so long as it is they themselves that feel it, is regarded as a vice, or from a desire to rehabilitate themselves by a sensational display in circumstances in which it costs them nothing, or from a fear of being unmasked which they at once recover as soon as desire no longer leads them blindfold from one imprudence to another, or from rage at being subjected, by the equivocal attitude of another person, to the injury which, by their own attitude, if that other person attracted them, they would not be afraid to inflict on him, the men who do not in the least mind following a young man for miles, never taking their eyes off him in the theatre, even if he is with friends, and there is therefore a danger of their compromising him with them, may be heard, if a man who does not attract them merely looks at them, to say: \u201cSir, for what do you take me?\u201d (simply because he takes them for what they are) \u201cI don\u2019t understand, no, don\u2019t attempt to explain, you are quite mistaken,\u201d pass if need be from words to blows, and, to a person who knows the imprudent stranger, wax indignant: \u201cWhat, you know that loathsome creature. He stares at one so! . . . A fine way to behave!\u201d M. de Charlus did not go quite as far as this, but assumed the offended, glacial air adopted, when one appears to be suspecting them, by women who are not of easy virtue, even more by women who are. Furthermore, the invert brought face to face with an invert sees not merely an unpleasing image of himself which, being purely inanimate, could at the worst only injure his self-esteem, but a second self, living, acting in the same sphere, capable therefore of injuring him in his loves. And so it is from an instinct of self-preservation that he will speak evil of the possible rival, whether to people who are able to do him some injury (nor does invert the first mind being thought a liar when he thus denounces invert the second before people who may know all about his own case), or to the young man whom he has \u2018picked up,\u2019 who is perhaps going to be snatched away from him and whom it is important to persuade that the very things which it is to his advantage to do with the speaker would be the bane of his life if he allowed himself to do them with the other person. To M. de Charlus, who was thinking perhaps of the \u2014 wholly imaginary \u2014 dangers in which the presence of this Cottard whose smile he misinterpreted might involve Morel, an invert who did not attract him was not merely a caricature of himself, but was a deliberate rival. A tradesman, practising an uncommon trade, who, on his arrival in the provincial town where he intends to settle for life discovers that, in the same square, directly opposite, the same trade is being carried on by a competitor, is no more discomfited than a Charlus who goes down to a quiet spot to make love unobserved and, on the day of his arrival, catches sight of the local squire or the barber, whose aspect and manner leave no room for doubt. The tradesman often comes to regard his competitor with hatred; this hatred degenerates at times into melancholy, and, if there be but a sufficient strain of heredity, one has seen in small towns the tradesman begin to shew signs of insanity which is cured only by his deciding to sell his stock and goodwill and remove to another place. The invert\u2019s rage is even more agonising. He has realised that from the first moment the squire and the barber have desired his young companion. Even though he repeat to him a hundred times daily that the barber and the squire are scoundrels whose contact would dishonour him, he is obliged, like Harpagon, to watch over his treasure, and rises in the night to make sure that it is not being stolen. And it is this no doubt that, even more than desire, or the convenience of habits shared in common, and almost as much as that experience of oneself which is the only true experience, makes one invert detect another with a rapidity and certainty that are almost infallible. He may be mistaken for a moment, but a rapid divination brings him back to the truth. And so M. de Charlus\u2019s error was brief. His divine discernment shewed him after the first minute that Cottard was not of his kind, and that he need not fear his advances either for himself, which would merely have annoyed him, or for Morel, which would have seemed to him a more serious matter. He recovered his calm, and as he was still beneath the influence of the transit of Venus Androgyne, now and again, he smiled a faint smile at the Verdurins without taking the trouble to open his mouth, merely curving his lips at one corner, and for an instant kindled a coquettish light in his eyes, he so obsessed with virility, exactly as his sister-in-law the Duchesse de Guermantes might have done. \u201cDo you shoot much, Sir?\u201d said M. Verdurin with a note of contempt to M. de Cambremer. \u201cHas Ski told you of the near shave we had to-day?\u201d Cottard inquired of the mistress. \u201cI shoot mostly in the forest of Chantepie,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cNo, I have told her nothing,\u201d said Ski. \u201cDoes it deserve its name?\u201d Brichot asked M. de Cambremer, after a glance at me from the corner of his eye, for he had promised me that he would introduce the topic of derivations, begging me at the same time not to let the Cambremers know the scorn that he felt for those furnished by the Combray cur\u00e9. \u201cI am afraid I must be very stupid, but I don\u2019t grasp your question,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cI mean to say: do many pies sing in it?\u201d replied Brichot. Cottard meanwhile could not bear Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing that they had nearly missed the train. \u201cOut with it,\u201d Mme. Cottard said to her husband encouragingly, \u201ctell us your odyssey.\u201d \u201cWell, really, it is quite out of the Ordinary,\u201d said the doctor, and repeated his narrative from the beginning. \u201cWhen I saw that the train was in the station, I stood thunderstruck. It was all Ski\u2019s fault. You are somewhat wide of the mark in your information, my dear fellow! And there was Brichot waiting for us at the station!\u201d \u201cI assumed,\u201d said the scholar, casting around him what he could still muster of a glance and smiling with his thin lips, \u201cthat if you had been detained at Graincourt, it would mean that you had encountered some peripatetic siren.\u201d \u201cWill you hold your tongue, if my wife were to hear you!\u201d said the Professor. \u201cThis wife of mine, it is jealous.\u201d \u201cAh! That Brichot,\u201d cried Ski, moved to traditional merriment by Brichot\u2019s spicy witticism, \u201che is always the same;\u201d albeit he had no reason to suppose that the university don had ever indulged in obscenity. And, to embellish this consecrated utterance with the ritual gesture, he made as though he could not resist the desire to pinch Brichot\u2019s leg. \u201cHe never changes, the rascal,\u201d Ski went on, and without stopping to think of the effect, at once tragic and comic, that the don\u2019s semi-blindness gave to his words: \u201cAlways a sharp look-out for the ladies.\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, \u201cwhat it is to meet with a scholar. Here have I been shooting for fifteen years in the forest of Chantepie, and I\u2019ve never even thought of what the name meant.\u201d Mme. de Cambremer cast a stern glance at her husband; she did not like him to humble himself thus before Brichot. She was even more annoyed when, at every \u2018ready-made\u2019 expression that Cancan employed, Cottard, who knew the ins and outs of them all, having himself laboriously acquired them, pointed out to the Marquis, who admitted his stupidity, that they meant nothing. \u201cWhy \u2018stupid as a cabbage?\u2019 Do you suppose cabbages are stupider than anything else? You say:\u2018repeat the same thing thirty-six times.\u2019 Why thirty-six? Why do you say:\u2018sleep like a top?\u2019 Why \u2018Thunder of Brest?\u2019 Why \u2018play four hundred tricks?\u2019\u201d But at this, the defence of M. de Cambremer was taken up by Brichot who explained the origin of each of these expressions. But Mme. de Cambremer was occupied principally in examining the changes that the Verdurins had introduced at la Raspeli\u00e8re, in order that she might be able to criticise some, and import others, or possibly the same ones, to F\u00e9terne. \u201cI keep wondering what that lustre is that\u2019s hanging all crooked. I can hardly recognise my old Raspeli\u00e8re,\u201d she went on, with a familiarly aristocratic air, as she might have spoken of an old servant meaning not so much to indicate his age as to say that she had seen him in his cradle. And, as she was a trifle bookish in her speech: \u201cAll the same,\u201d she added in an undertone, \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that if I were inhabiting another person\u2019s house, I should feel some compunction about altering everything like this.\u201d \u201cIt is a pity you didn\u2019t come with them,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to M. de Charlus and Morel, hoping that M. de Charlus was now \u2018enrolled\u2019 and would submit to the rule that they must all arrive by the same train. \u201cYou are sure that Chantepie means the singing magpie, Chochotte?\u201d she went on, to shew that, like the great hostess that she was, she could join in every conversation at the same time. \u201cTell me something about this violinist,\u201d Mme. de Cambremer said to me, \u201che interests me; I adore music, and it seems to me that I have heard of him before, complete my education.\u201d She had heard that Morel had come with M. de Charlus and hoped, by getting the former to come to her house, to make friends with the latter. She added, however, so that I might not guess her reason for asking, \u201cM. Brichot, too, interests me.\u201d For, even if she was highly cultivated, just as certain persons inclined to obesity eat hardly anything, and take exercise all day long without ceasing to grow visibly fatter, so Mme. de Cambremer might in vain master, and especially at F\u00e9terne, a philosophy that became ever more esoteric, music that became ever more subtle, she emerged from these studies only to weave plots that would enable her to cut the middle-class friends of her girlhood and to form the connexions which she had originally supposed to be part of the social life of her \u2018in laws,\u2019 and had then discovered to be far more exalted and remote. A philosopher who was not modern enough for her, Leibnitz, has said that the way is long from the intellect to the heart. This way Mme. de Cambremer had been no more capable than her brother of traversing. Abandoning the study of John Stuart Mill only for that of Lachelier, the less she believed in the reality of the external world, the more desperately she sought to establish herself, before she died, in a good position in it. In her passion for realism in art, no object seemed to her humble enough to serve as a model to painter or writer. A fashionable picture or novel would have made her feel sick; Tolstoi\u2019s mujiks, or Millet\u2019s peasants, were the extreme social boundary beyond which she did not allow the artist to pass. But to cross the boundary that limited her own social relations, to raise herself to an intimate acquaintance with Duchesses, this was the goal of all her efforts, so ineffective had the spiritual treatment to which she subjected herself, by the study of great masterpieces, proved in overcoming the congenital and morbid snobbishness that had developed in her. This snobbishness had even succeeded in curing certain tendencies to avarice and adultery to which in her younger days she had been inclined, just as certain peculiar and permanent pathological conditions seem to render those who are subject to them immune to other maladies. I could not, all the same, refrain, as I listened to her, from giving her credit, without deriving any pleasure from them, for the refinement of her expressions. They were those that are used, at a given date, by all the people of the same intellectual breadth, so that the refined expression provides us at once, like the arc of a circle, with the means to describe and limit the entire circumference. And so the effect of these expressions is that the people who employ them bore me immediately, because I feel that I already know them, but are generally regarded as superior persons, and have often been offered me as delightful and unappreciated companions. \u201cYou cannot fail to be aware, Madame, that many forest regions take their name from the animals that inhabit them. Next to the forest of Chantepie, you have the wood Chantereine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know who the queen may be, but you are not very polite to her,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cOne for you, Chochotte,\u201d said Mme. de Verdurin. \u201cAnd apart from that, did you have a pleasant journey?\u201d \u201cWe encountered only vague human beings who thronged the train. But I must answer M. de Cambremer\u2019s question; reine, in this instance, is not the wife of a king, but a frog. It is the name that the frog has long retained in this district, as is shewn by the station, Renneville, which ought to be spelt Reineville.\u201d \u201cI say, that seems a fine animal,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin, pointing to a fish. (It was one of the compliments by means of which he considered that he paid his scot at a dinner-party, and gave an immediate return of hospitality. \u201cThere is no need to invite them,\u201d he would often say, in speaking of one or other couple of their friends to his wife. \u201cThey were delighted to have us. It was they that thanked me for coming.\u201d) \u201cI must tell you, all the same, that I have been going every day for years to Renneville, and I have never seen any more frogs there than anywhere else. Madame de Cambremer brought the cur\u00e9 here from a parish where she owns a considerable property, who has very much the same turn of mind as yourself, it seems to me. He has written a book.\u201d \u201cI know, I have read it with immense interest,\u201d Brichot replied hypocritically. The satisfaction that his pride received indirectly from this answer made M. de Cambremer laugh long and loud. \u201cAh! well, the author of, what shall I say, this geography, this glossary, dwells at great length upon the name of a little place of which we were formerly, if I may say so, the Lords, and which is called Pont-a-Couleuvre. Of course I am only an ignorant rustic compared with such a fountain of learning, but I have been to Pont-\u00e0-Couleuvre a thousand times if he\u2019s been there once, and devil take me if I ever saw one of his beastly serpents there, I say beastly, in spite of the tribute the worthy La Fontaine pays them.\u201d (The Man and the Serpent was one of his two fables.) \u201cYou have not seen any, and you have been quite right,\u201d replied Brichot. \u201cUndoubtedly, the writer you mention knows his subject through and through, he has written a remarkable book.\u201d \u201cThere!\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Cambremer, \u201cthat book, there\u2019s no other word for it, is a regular Benedictine opus.\u201d \u201cNo doubt he has consulted various polyptychs (by which we mean the lists of benefices and cures of each diocese), which may have furnished him with the names of lay patrons and ecclesiastical collators. But there are other sources. One of the most learned of my friends has delved into them. He found that the place in question was named Pont-a-Quileuvre. This odd name encouraged him to carry his researches farther, to a Latin text in which the bridge that your friend supposes to be infested with serpents is styled Pons cui aperit: A closed bridge that was opened only upon due payment.\u201d \u201cYou were speaking of frogs. I, when I find myself among such learned folk, feel like the frog before the areopagus,\u201d (this being his other fable) said Cancan who often indulged, with a hearty laugh, in this pleasantry thanks to which he imagined himself to be making, at one and the same time, out of humility and with aptness, a profession of ignorance and a display of learning. As for Cottard, blocked upon one side by M. de Charlus\u2019s silence, and driven to seek an outlet elsewhere, he turned to me with one of those questions which so impressed his patients when it hit the mark and shewed them that he could put himself so to speak inside their bodies; if on the other hand it missed the mark, it enabled him to check certain theories, to widen his previous point of view. \u201cWhen you come to a relatively high altitude, such as this where we now are, do you find that the change increases your tendency to choking fits?\u201d he asked me with the certainty of either arousing admiration or enlarging his own knowledge. M. de Cambremer heard the question and smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how amused I am to hear that you have choking fits,\u201d he flung at me across the table. He did not mean that it made him happy, though as a matter of fact it did. For this worthy man could not hear any reference to another person\u2019s sufferings without a feeling of satisfaction and a spasm of hilarity which speedily gave place to the instinctive pity of a kind heart. But his words had another meaning which was indicated more precisely by the clause that followed. \u201cIt amuses me,\u201d he explained, \u201cbecause my sister has them too.\u201d And indeed it did amuse him, as it would have amused him to hear me mention as one of my friends a person who was constantly coming to their house. \u201cHow small the world is,\u201d was the reflexion which he formed mentally and which I saw written upon his smiling face when Cottard spoke to me of my choking fits. And these began to establish themselves, from the evening of this dinner-party, as a sort of interest in common, after which M. de Cambremer never failed to inquire, if only to hand on a report to his sister. As I answered the questions with which his wife kept plying me about Morel, my thoughts returned to a conversation I had had with my mother that afternoon. Having, without any attempt to dissuade me from going to the Verdurins\u2019 if there was a chance of my being amused there, suggested that it was a house of which my grandfather would not have approved, which would have made him exclaim: \u201cOn guard!\u201d my mother had gone on to say: \u201cListen, Judge Toureuil and his wife told me they had been to luncheon with Mme. Bon-temps. They asked me no questions. But I seemed to gather from what was said that your marriage to Albertine would be the joy of her aunt\u2019s life. I think the real reason is that they are all extremely fond of you. At the same time the style in which they suppose that you would be able to keep her, the sort of friends they more or less know that we have, all that is not, I fancy, left out of account, although it may be a minor consideration. I should not have mentioned it to you myself, because I attach no importance to it, but as I imagine that people will mention it to you, I prefer to get a word in first.\u201d \u201cBut you yourself, what do you think of her?\u201d I asked my mother. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not I that am going to marry her. You might certainly do a thousand times better. But I feel that your grandmother would not have liked me to influence you. As a matter of fact, I cannot tell you what I think of Albertine; I don\u2019t think of her. I shall say to you, like Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u2018She has good qualities, at least I suppose so. But at this first stage I can praise her only by negatives. One thing she is not, she has not the Rennes accent. In time, I shall perhaps say, she is something else. And I shall always think well of her if she can make you happy.\u2019\u201d But by these very words which left it to myself to decide my own happiness, my mother had plunged me in that state of doubt in which I had been plunged long ago when, my father having allowed me to go to Ph\u00e8dre and, what was more, to take to writing, I had suddenly felt myself burdened with too great a responsibility, the fear of distressing him, and that melancholy which we feel when we cease to obey orders which, from one day to another, keep the future hidden, and realise that we have at last begun to live in real earnest, as a grown-up person, the life, the only life that any of us has at his disposal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the best thing would be to wait a little longer, to begin by regarding Albertine as in the past, so as to find out whether I really loved her. I might take her, as a distraction, to see the Verdurins, and this thought reminded me that I had come there myself that evening only to learn whether Mme. Putbus was staying there or was expected. In any case, she was not dining with them. \u201cSpeaking of your friend Saint-Loup,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, using an expression which shewed a closer sequence in her ideas than her remarks might have led one to suppose, for if she spoke to me about music she was thinking about the Guermantes; \u201cyou know that everybody is talking about his marriage to the niece of the Princesse de Guermantes. I may tell you that, so far as I am concerned, all that society gossip leaves me cold.\u201d I was seized by a fear that I might have spoken unfeelingly to Robert about the girl in question, a girl full of sham originality, whose mind was as mediocre as her actions were violent. Hardly ever do we hear anything that does \u2018not make us regret something that we have said. I replied to Mme. de Cambremer, truthfully as it happened, that I knew nothing about it, and that anyhow I thought that the girl was still too young to be engaged. \u201cThat is perhaps why it is not yet official, anyhow there is a lot of talk about it.\u201d \u201cI ought to warn you,\u201d Mme. Verdurin observed dryly to Mme. de Cambremer, having heard her talking to me about Morel and supposing, when Mme. de Cambremer lowered her voice to speak of Saint-Loup\u2019s engagement, that Morel was still under discussion. \u201cYou needn\u2019t expect any light music here. In matters of art, you know, the faithful who come to my Wednesdays, my children as I call them, are all fearfully advanced,\u201d she added with an air of proud terror. \u201cI say to them sometimes: My dear people, you move too fast for your Mistress, not that she has ever been said to be afraid of anything daring. Every year it goes a little farther; I can see the day coming when they will have no more use for Wagner or Indy.\u201d \u201cBut it is splendid to be advanced, one can never be advanced enough,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer, scrutinising as she spoke every corner of the dining-room, trying to identify the things that her mother-in-law had left there, those that Mme. Verdurin had brought with her, and to convict the latter red-handed of want of taste. At the same time, she tried to get me to talk of the subject that interested her most, M. de Charlus. She thought it touching that he should be looking after a violinist. \u201cHe seems intelligent.\u201d \u201cWhy, his mind is extremely active for a man of his age,\u201d said I. \u201cAge? But he doesn\u2019t seem at all old, look, the hair is still young.\u201d (For, during the last three or four years, the word hair had been used with the article by one of those unknown persons who launch the literary fashions, and everybody at the same radius from the centre as Mme. de Cambremer would say \u2018the hair,\u2019 not without an affected smile. At the present day, people still say \u2018the hair\u2019 but, from an excessive use of the article, the pronoun will be born again.) \u201cWhat interests me most about M. de Charlus,\u201d she went on, \u201cis that one can feel that he has the gift. I may tell you that I attach little importance to knowledge. Things that can be learned do not interest me.\u201d This speech was not incompatible with Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s own distinction which was, in the fullest sense, imitated and acquired. But it so happened that one of the things which one had to know at that moment was that knowledge is nothing, and is not worth a straw when compared with originality. Mme. de Cambremer had learned, with everything else, that one ought not to learn anything. \u201cThat is why,\u201d she explained to me, \u201cBrichot, who has an interesting side to him, for I am not one to despise a certain spicy erudition, interests me far less.\u201d But Brichot, at that moment, was occupied with one thing only; hearing people talk about music, he trembled lest the subject should remind Mme. Verdurin of the death of Dechambre. He decided to say something that would avert that harrowing memory. M. de Cambremer provided him with an opportunity with the question: \u201cYou mean to say that wooded places always take their names from animals?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Brichot, proud to display his learning before so many strangers, among whom, I had told him, he would be certain to interest one at least. \u201cWe have only to consider how often, even in the names of people, a tree is preserved, like a fern in a piece of coal. One of our Conscript Fathers is called M. de Saulces de Freycinet, which means, if I be not mistaken, a spot planted with willows and ashes, salix et fraxinetum; his nephew M. de Selves combines more trees still, since he is named de Selves, de sylvis.\u201d Saniette was delighted to see the conversation take so animated a turn. He could, since Brichot was talking all the time, preserve a silence which would save him from being the butt of M. and Mme. Verdurin\u2019s wit. And growing even more sensitive in his joy at being set free, he had been touched when he heard M. Verdurin, notwithstanding the formality of so grand a dinner-party, tell the butler to put a decanter of water in front of M. Saniette who never drank anything else. (The generals responsible for the death of most soldiers insist upon their being well fed.) Moreover, Mme. Verdurin had actually smiled once at Saniette. Decidedly, they were kind people. He was not going to be tortured any more. At this moment the meal was interrupted by one of the party whom I have forgotten to mention, an eminent Norwegian philosopher who spoke French very well but very slowly, for the twofold reason that, in the first place, having learned the language only recently and not wishing to make mistakes (he did, nevertheless, make some), he referred each word to a sort of mental dictionary, and secondly, being a metaphysician, he always thought of what he intended to say while he was saying it, which, even in a Frenchman, causes slowness of utterance. He was, otherwise, a charming person, although similar in appearance to many other people, save in one respect. This man so slow in his diction (there was an interval of silence after every word) acquired a startling rapidity in escaping from the room as soon as he had said good-bye. His haste made one suppose, the first time one saw him, that he was suffering from colic or some even more urgent need\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear \u2014 colleague,\u201d he said to Brichot, after deliberating in his mind whether colleague was the correct term, \u201cI have a sort of \u2014 desire to know whether there are other trees in the \u2014 nomenclature of your beautiful French \u2014 Latin \u2014 Norman tongue. Madame\u201d (lie meant Madame Verdurin, although he dared not look at her) \u201chas told me that you know everything. Is not this precisely the moment?\u201d \u201cNo, it is the moment for eating,\u201d interrupted Mme. Verdurin, who saw the dinner becoming interminable. \u201cVery well,\u201d the Scandinavian replied, bowing his head over his plate with a resigned and sorrowful smile. \u201cBut I must point out to Madame that if I have permitted myself this questionnaire \u2014 pardon me, this questation \u2014 it is because I have to return to-morrow to Paris to dine at the Tour d\u2019Argent or at the H\u00f4tel Meurice, My French \u2014 brother \u2014 M. Boutroux is to address us there about certain seances of spiritualism \u2014 pardon me, certain spirituous evocations which he has controlled.\u201d \u201cThe Tour d\u2019Argent is not nearly as good as they make out,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin sourly. \u201cIn fact, I have had some disgusting dinners there.\u201d \u201cBut am I mistaken, is not the food that one consumes at Madame\u2019s table an example of the finest French cookery?\u201d \u201cWell, it is not positively bad,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, sweetening. \u201cAnd if you come next Wednesday, it will be better.\u201d \u201cBut I am leaving on Monday for Algiers, and from there I am going to the Cape. And when I am at the Cape of Good Hope, I shall no longer be able to meet my illustrious colleague \u2014 pardon me, I shall no longer be able to meet my brother.\u201d And he set to work obediently, after offering these retrospective apologies, to devour his food at a headlong pace. But Brichot was only too delighted to be able to furnish other vegetable etymologies, and replied, so greatly interesting the Norwegian that he again stopped eating, but with a sign to the servants that they might remove his plate and help him to the next course. \u201cOne of the Forty,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cis named Houssaye, or a place planted with hollies; in the name of a brilliant diplomat, d\u2019Ormesson, you will find the elm, theulmus beloved of Virgil, which has given its name to the town of Ulm; in the names of his colleagues, M. de la Boulaye, the birch (bouleau), M. d\u2019Aunay, the alder (aune), M. de Buissi\u00e8re, the box (buis), M. Albaret, the sapwood (aubier)\u201d (I made a mental note that I must tell this to C\u00e9leste), \u201cM. de Cholet, the cabbage (chou), and the apple-tree (pommier) in the name of M. de la Pommeraye, whose lectures we used to attend, do you remember, Saniette, in the days when the worthy Porel had been sent to the farthest ends of the earth, as Proconsul in Odeonia?\u201d \u201cYou said that Cholet was derived from chou,\u201d I remarked to Brichot. \u201cAm I to suppose that the name of a station I passed before reaching Donci\u00e8res, Saint-Frichoux, comes from chou also?\u201d \u201cNo, Saint-Frichoux is Sanctus Fruc-tuosus, asSanctus Ferreolus gave rise to Saint-Fargeau, but that is not Norman in the least.\u201d \u201cHe knows too much, he\u2019s boring us,\u201d the Princess muttered softly. \u201cThere are so many other names that interest me, but I can\u2019t ask you everything at once.\u201d And, turning to Cottard, \u201cIs Madame Putbus here?\u201d I asked him. On hearing Brichot utter the name of Saniette, M. Verdurin cast at his wife and at Cottard an ironical glance which confounded their timid guest. \u201cNo, thank heaven,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, who had overheard my question, \u201cI have managed to turn her thoughts in the direction of Venice, we are rid of her for this year.\u201d \u201cI shall myself be entitled presently to two trees,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cfor I have more or less taken a little house between Saint-Martin-du-Chene and Saint-Pierre-des-Ifs.\u201d \u201cBut that is quite close to here, I hope that you will come over often with Charlie Morel. You have only to come to an arrangement with our little group about the trains, you are only a step from Donci\u00e8res,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who hated people\u2019s not coming by the same train and not arriving at the hours when she sent carriages to meet them. She knew how stiff the climb was to la Raspeli\u00e8re, even if you took the zigzag path, behind F\u00e9terne, which was half-an-hour longer; she was afraid that those of her guests who kept to themselves might not find carriages to take them, or even, having in reality stayed away, might plead the excuse that they had not found a carriage at Douville-F\u00e9terne, and had not felt strong enough to make so stiff a climb on foot. To this invitation M. de Charlus responded with a silent bow. \u201cHe\u2019s not the sort of person you can talk to any day of the week, he seems a tough customer,\u201d the doctor whispered to Ski, for having remained quite simple, notwithstanding a surface-dressing of pride, he made no attempt to conceal the fact that Charlus had snubbed him. \u201cHe is doubtless unaware that at all the watering-places, and even in Paris in the wards, the physicians, who naturally regard me as their \u2018chief,\u2019 make it a point of honour to introduce me to all the noblemen present, not that they need to be asked twice. It makes my stay at the spas quite enjoyable,\u201d he added carelessly. \u201cIndeed at Donci\u00e8res the medical officer of the regiment, who is the doctor who attends the Colonel, invited me to luncheon to meet him, saying that I was fully entitled to dine with the General. And that General is a Monsieur de something. I don\u2019t know whether his title-deeds are more or less ancient than those of this Baron.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about him, his is a very humble coronet,\u201d replied Ski in an undertone, and added some vague statement including a word of which I caught only the last syllable, -ast, being engaged in listening to what Brichot was saying to M. de Charlus. \u201cNo, as for that, I am sorry to say, you have probably one tree only, for if Saint-Martin-du-Ch\u00eane is obviouslySanctus Martinus juxta quercum, on the other hand, the word if may be simply the root ave, eve, which means moist, as in Aveyron, Lod\u00e8ve, Yvette, and which you see survive in our kitchen-sinks (\u00e9viers). It is the word eau which in Breton is represented by ster, Ster-maria, Sterlaer, Sterbouest, Ster-en-Dreuchen.\u201d I heard no more, for whatever the pleasure I might feel on hearing again the name Stermaria, I could not help listening to Cottard, next to whom I was seated, as he murmured to Ski: \u201cIndeed! I was not aware of it. So he is a gentleman who has learned to look behind! He is one of the happy band, is he? He hasn\u2019t got rings of fat round his eyes, all the same. I shall have to keep my feet well under me, or he may start squeezing them. But I\u2019m not at all surprised. I am used to seeing noblemen in the bath, in their birthday suits, they are all more or less degenerates. I don\u2019t talk to them, because after all I am in an official position and it might do me harm. But they know quite well who I am.\u201d Saniette, whom Brichot\u2019s appeal had frightened, was beginning to breathe again, like a man who is afraid of the storm when he finds that the lightning has not been followed by any sound of thunder, when he heard M. Verdurin interrogate him, fastening upon him a stare which did not spare the wretch until he had finished speaking, so as to put him at once out of countenance and prevent him from recovering his composure. \u201cBut you never told us that you went to those matin\u00e9es at the Od\u00e9on, Saniette?\u201d Trembling like a recruit before a bullying serjeant, Saniette replied, making his speech as diminutive as possible, so that it might have a better chance of escaping the blow: \u201cOnly once, to the Chercheuse.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that he says?\u201d shouted M. Verdurin, with an air of disgust and fury combined, knitting his brows as though it was all he could do to grasp something unintelligible. \u201cIt is impossible to understand what you say, what have you got in your mouth?\u201d inquired M. Verdurin, growing more and more furious, and alluding to Saniette\u2019s defective speech. \u201cPoor Saniette, I won\u2019t have him made unhappy,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin in a tone of false pity, so as to leave no one in doubt as to her husband\u2019s insolent intention. \u201cI was at the Ch . . . Che..\u201d \u201cChe, che, try to speak distinctly,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201cI can\u2019t understand a word you say.\u201d Almost without exception, the faithful burst out laughing and they suggested a band of cannibals in whom the sight of a wound on a white man\u2019s skin has aroused the thirst for blood. For the instinct of imitation and absence of courage govern society and the mob alike. And we all of us laugh at a person whom we see being made fun of, which does not prevent us from venerating him ten years later in a circle where he is admired. It is in like manner that the populace banishes or acclaims its kings. \u201cCome, now, it is not his fault,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIt is not mine either, people ought not to dine out if they can\u2019t speak properly.\u201d \u201cI was at the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit by Favart.\u201d \u201cWhat! It\u2019s theChercheuse d\u2019Esprit that you call the Chercheuse? Why, that\u2019s marvellous! I might have tried for a hundred years without guessing it,\u201d cried M. Verdurin, who all the same would have decided immediately that you were not literary, were not artistic, were not \u2018one of us,\u2019 if he had heard you quote the full title of certain works. For instance, one was expected to say the Malade, the Bourgeois; and whoso would have added imaginaire orgentilhomme would have shewn that he did not understand \u2018shop,\u2019 just as in a drawing-room a person proves that he is not in society by saying \u2018M. de Montesquiou-F\u00e9zensac\u2019 instead of \u2018M. de Montesquieu.\u2019 \u201cBut it is not so extraordinary,\u201d said Saniette, breathless with emotion but smiling, albeit he was in no smiling mood. Mme. Verdurin could not contain herself. \u201cYes, indeed!\u201d she cried with a titter. \u201cYou may be quite sure that nobody would ever have guessed that you meant the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d M. Verdurin went on in a gentler tone, addressing both Saniette and Brichot: \u201cIt is quite a pretty piece, all the same, the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit.\u201d Uttered in a serious tone, this simple phrase, in which one could detect no trace of malice, did Saniette as much good and aroused in him as much gratitude as a deliberate compliment. He was unable to utter a single word and preserved a happy silence. Brichot was more loquacious. \u201cIt is true,\u201d he replied to M. Verdurin, \u201cand if it could be passed off as the work of some Sarmatian or Scandinavian author, we might put forward the Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit as a candidate for the vacant post of masterpiece. But, be it said without any disrespect to the shade of the gentle Favart, he had not the Ibsenian temperament.\u201d (Immediately he blushed to the roots of his hair, remembering the Norwegian philosopher who appeared troubled because he was seeking in vain to discover what vegetable the buis might be that Brichot had cited a little earlier in connexion with the name Bussi\u00e8re.) \u201cHowever, now that Porel\u2019s satrapy is filled by a functionary who is a Tolstoist of rigorous observance, it may come to pass that we shall witnessAnna Karenina or Resurrection beneath the Od\u00e9onian architrave.\u201d \u201cI know the portrait of Favart to which you allude,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cI have seen a very fine print of it at Comtesse Mol\u00e9\u2018s.\u201d The name of Comtesse Mol\u00e9 made a great impression upon Mme. Verdurin. \u201cOh! So you go to Mme. de Mol\u00e9\u2018s!\u201d she exclaimed. She supposed that people said Comtesse Mol\u00e9, Madame Mol\u00e9, simply as an abbreviation, as she heard people say \u2018the Rohans\u2019 or in contempt, as she herself said: \u2018Madame la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u2019 She had no doubt that Comtesse Mol\u00e9, who knew the Queen of Greece and the Principessa di Caprarola, had as much right as anybody to the particle, and for once in a way had decided to bestow it upon so brilliant a personage, and one who had been extremely civil to herself. And so, to make it clear that she had spoken thus on purpose and did not grudge the Comtesse her \u2018de,\u2019 she went on: \u201cBut I had no idea that you knew Madame de Mol\u00e9!\u201d as though it had been doubly extraordinary, both that M. de Charlus should know the lady, and that Mme. Verdurin should not know that he knew her. Now society, or at least the people to whom M. de Charlus gave that name, forms a relatively homogeneous and compact whole. And so it is comprehensible that, in the incongruous vastness of the middle classes, a barrister may say to somebody who knows one of his school friends: \u201cBut how in the world do you come to know him?\u201d whereas to be surprised at a Frenchman\u2019s knowing the meaning of the word templeor forest would be hardly more extraordinary than to wonder at the hazards that might have brought together M. de Charlus and the Comtesse Mol\u00e9. What is more, even if such an acquaintance had not been derived quite naturally from the laws that govern society, how could there be anything strange in the fact of Mme. Verdurin\u2019s not knowing of it, since she was meeting M. de Charlus for the first time, and his relations with Mme. Mol\u00e9 were far from being the only thing that she did not know with regard to him, about whom, to tell the truth, she knew nothing. \u201cWho was it that played this Chercheuse d\u2019Esprit, my good Saniette?\u201d asked M. Verdurin. Albeit he felt that the storm had passed, the old antiquarian hesitated before answering. \u201cThere you go,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou frighten him, you make fun of everything that he says, and then you expect him to answer. Come along, tell us who played the part, and you shall have some galantine to take home,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, making a cruel allusion to the penury into which Saniette had plunged himself by trying to rescue the family of a friend. \u201cI can remember only that it was Mme. Samary who played the Zerbine,\u201d said Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine? What in the world is that,\u201d M. Verdurin shouted, as though the house were on fire. \u201cIt is one of the parts in the old repertory, like Captain Fracasse, as who should say the Fire-eater, the Pedant.\u201d \u201cAh, the pedant, that\u2019s yourself. The Zerbine! No, really the man\u2019s mad,\u201d exclaimed M. Verdurin. Mme. Verdurin looked at her guests and laughed as though to apologise for Saniette. \u201cThe Zerbine, he imagines that everybody will know at once what it means. You are like M. de Longepierre, the stupidest man I know, who said to us quite calmly the other day \u2018the Banat.\u2019 Nobody had any idea what he meant. Finally we were informed that it was a province in Serbia.\u201d To put an end to Saniette\u2019s torture, which hurt me \u2018more than it hurt him, I asked Brichot if he knew what the word Balbec meant. \u201cBalbec is probably a corruption of Dalbec,\u201d he told me. \u201cOne would have to consult the charters of the Kings of England, Overlords of Normandy, for Balbec was held of the Barony of Dover, for which reason it was often styled Balbec d\u2019Outre-Mer, Balbec-en-Terre. But the Barony of Dover was itself held of the Bishopric of Bayeux, and, notwithstanding the rights that were temporarily enjoyed in the abbey by the Templars, from the time of Louis d\u2019Harcourt, Patriarch of Jerusalem and Bishop of Bayeux; it was the Bishops of that diocese who collated to the benefice of Balbec. So it was explained to me by the incumbent of Douville, a bald person, eloquent, fantastic, and a devotee of the table, who lives by the Rule of Brillat-Savarin, and who expounded to me in slightly sibylline language a loose pedagogy, while he fed me upon some admirable fried potatoes.\u201d While Brichot smiled to shew how witty it was to combine matters so dissimilar and to employ an ironically lofty diction in treating of commonplace things, Saniette was trying to find a loophole for some clever remark which would raise him from the abyss into which he had fallen. The witty remark was what was known as a \u2018comparison,\u2019 but had changed its form, for there is an evolution in wit as in literary styles, an epidemic that disappears has its place taken by another, and so forth. . . . At one time the typical \u2018comparison\u2019 was the \u2018height of. . . . \u2019 But this was out of date, no one used it any more, there was only Cottard left to say still, on occasion, in the middle of a game of piquet: \u201cDo you know what is the height of absent-mindedness, it is to think that the Edict (l\u2019edit) of Nantes was an Englishwoman.\u201d These \u2018heights\u2019 had been replaced by nicknames. In reality it was still the old \u2018comparison,\u2019 but, as the nickname was in fashion, people did not observe the survival. Unfortunately for Saniette, when these \u2018comparisons\u2019 were not his own, and as a rule were unknown to the little nucleus, he produced them so timidly that, notwithstanding the laugh with which he followed them up to indicate their humorous nature, nobody saw the point. And if on the other hand the joke was his own, as he had generally hit upon it in conversation with one of the faithful, and the latter had repeated it, appropriating the authorship, the joke was in that case known, but not as being Saniette\u2019s. And so when he slipped in one of these it was recognised, but, because he was its author, he was accused of plagiarism. \u201cVery well, then,\u201d Brichot continued, \u201cBee, in Norman, is a stream; there is the Abbey of Bee, Mobec, the stream from the marsh (Mor or Mer meant a marsh, as in Morville, or in Bricquemar, Alvimare, Cambremer), Bricquebac the stream from the high ground coming from Briga, a fortified place, as in Bricqueville, Bricquebose, le Bric, Briand, or indeed Brice, bridge, which is the same asbruck in German (Innsbruck), and as the English  which ends so many place-names (Cambridge, for instance). You have moreover in Normandy many other instances of bec: Caudebec, Bolbec, le Robec, le Bec-Hellouin, Becquerel. It is the Norman form of the German bach Offenbach, Anspach. Varaguebec, from the old word varaigne, equivalent to warren, preserved woods or ponds. As for Dal,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cit is a form of thal, a valley: Darnetal, Rosendal, and indeed, close to Louviers, Becdal. The river that has given its name to Balbec, is, by the way, charming. Seen from a falaise (fels in German, you have indeed, not far from here, standing on a height, the picturesque town of Falaise), it runs close under the spires of the church, which is actually a long way from it, and seems to be reflecting them.\u201d \u201cI should think,\u201d said I, \u201cthat is an effect that Elstir admires greatly. I have seen several sketches of it in his studio.\u201d \u201cElstir! You know Tiche,\u201d cried Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut do you know that we used to be the dearest friends? Thank heaven, I never see him now. No, but ask Cottard, Brichot, he used to have his place laid at my table, he came every day. Now, there\u2019s a man of whom you can say that it has done him no good to leave our little nucleus. I shall shew you presently some flowers he painted for me; you shall see the difference from the things he is doing now, which I don\u2019t care for at all, not at all! Why! I made him do me a portrait of Cottard, not to mention all the sketches he has made of me.\u201d \u201cAnd he gave the Professor purple hair,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, forgetting that at the time her husband had not been even a Fellow of the College. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Sir, whether you find that my husband has purple hair.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, raising her chin with an air of contempt for Mme. Cottard and of admiration for the man of whom she was speaking, \u201che was a brave colourist, a fine painter. Whereas,\u201d she added, turning again to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you call it painting, all those huge she-devils of composition, those vast structures he exhibits now that he has given up coming to me. For my part, I call it daubing, it\u2019s all so hackneyed, and besides, it lacks relief, personality. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cHe revives the grace of the eighteenth century, but in a modern form,\u201d Saniette broke out, fortified and reassured by my affability. \u201cBut I prefer Helleu.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not in the least like Helleu,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cYes, he has the fever of the eighteenth century. He\u2019s a steam Watteau,\u201d and he began to laugh. \u201cOld, old as the hills, I\u2019ve had that served up to me for years,\u201d said M. Verdurin, to whom indeed Ski had once repeated the remark, but as his own invention. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that when once in a way you say something quite amusing and make it intelligible, it is not your own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on, \u201cbecause he was really gifted, he has wasted a charming temperament for painting. Ah! if he had stayed with us! Why, he would have become the greatest landscape painter of our day. And it is a woman that has dragged him down so low! Not that that surprises me, for he was a pleasant enough man, but common. At bottom, he was a mediocrity. I may tell you that I felt it at once. Really, he never interested me. I was very fond of him, that was all. For one thing, he was so dirty. Tell me, do you, now, really like people who never wash?\u201d \u201cWhat is this charmingly coloured thing that we are eating?\u201d asked Ski. \u201cIt is called strawberry mousse,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cBut it is ex-qui-site. You ought to open bottles of Ch\u00e2teau-Margaux, Ch\u00e2teau-Lafite, port wine.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how he amuses me, he never drinks anything but water,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, seeking to cloak with her delight at such a flight of fancy her alarm at the thought of so prodigal an outlay. \u201cBut not to drink,\u201d Ski went on, \u201cyou shall fill all our glasses, they will bring in marvelous peaches, huge nectarines, there against the sunset; it will be as gorgeous as a fine Veronese.\u201d \u201cIt would cost almost as much,\u201d M. Verdurin murmured. \u201cBut take away those cheeses with their hideous colour,\u201d said Ski, trying to snatch the plate from before his host, who defended his gruy\u00e8re with his might and main. \u201cYou can realise that I don\u2019t regret Elstir,\u201d Mme. Verdurin said to me, \u201cthat one is far more gifted. Elstir is simply hard work, the man who can\u2019t make himself give up painting when he would like to. He is the good student, the slavish competitor. Ski, now, only follows his own fancy. You will see him light a cigarette in the middle of dinner.\u201d \u201cAfter all, I can\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t invite his wife,\u201d said Cottard, \u201che would be with us still.\u201d \u201cWill you mind what you\u2019re saying, please, I don\u2019t open my doors to street-walkers, Monsieur le Professeur,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who had, on the contrary, done everything in her power to make Elstir return, even with his wife. But before they were married she had tried to make them quarrel, had told Elstir that the woman he loved was stupid, dirty, immoral, a thief. For once in a way she had failed to effect a breach. It was with the Verdurin salon that Elstir had broken; and he was glad of it, as converts bless the illness or misfortune that has withdrawn them from the world and has made them learn the way of salvation. \u201cHe really is magnificent, the Professor,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not declare outright that I keep a disorderly house? Anyone would think you didn\u2019t know what Madame Elstir was like. I would sooner have the lowest street-walker at my table! Oh no, I don\u2019t stand for that sort of thing. Besides I may tell you that it would have been stupid of me to overlook the wife, when the husband no longer interests me, he is out of date, he can\u2019t even draw.\u201d \u201cThat is extraordinary in a man of his intelligence,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cOh, no!\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, \u201ceven at the time when he had talent, for he had it, the wretch, and to spare, what was tiresome about him was that he had not a spark of intelligence.\u201d Mme. Verdurin, in passing this judgment upon Elstir, had not waited for their quarrel, or until she had ceased to care for his painting. The fact was that, even at the time when he formed part of the little group, it would happen that Elstir spent the whole day in the company of some woman whom, rightly or wrongly, Mme. Verdurin considered a goose, which, in her opinion, was not the conduct of an intelligent man. \u201cNo,\u201d she observed with an air of finality, \u201cI consider that his wife and he are made for one another. Heaven knows, there isn\u2019t a more boring creature on the face of the earth, and I should go mad if I had to spend a couple of hours with her. But people say that he finds her very intelligent. There\u2019s no use denying it, our Tiche was extremely stupid. I have seen him bowled over by people you can\u2019t conceive, worthy idiots we should never have allowed into our little clan. Well! He wrote to them, he argued with them, he, Elstir! That doesn\u2019t prevent his having charming qualities, oh, charming and deliciously absurd, naturally.\u201d For Mme. Verdurin was convinced that men who are truly remarkable are capable of all sorts of follies. A false idea in which there is nevertheless a grain of truth. Certainly, people\u2019s follies are insupportable. But a want of balance which we discover only in course of time is the consequence of the entering into a human brain of delicacies for which it is not regularly adapted. So that the oddities of charming people exasperate us, but there are few if any charming people who are not, at the same time, odd. \u201cLook, I shall be able to shew you his flowers now,\u201d she said to me, seeing that her husband was making signals to her to rise. And she took M. de Cambremer\u2019s arm again. M. Verdurin tried to apologise for this to M. de Charlus, as soon as he had got rid of Mme. de Cambremer, and to give him his reasons, chiefly for the pleasure of discussing these social refinements with a gentleman of title, momentarily the inferior of those who assigned to him the place to which they considered him entitled. But first of all he was anxious to make it clear to M. de Charlus that intellectually he esteemed him too highly to suppose that he could pay any attention to these trivialities. \u201cExcuse my mentioning so small a point,\u201d he began, \u201cfor I can understand how little such things mean to you. Middle-class minds pay attention to them, but the others, the artists, the people who are really of our sort, don\u2019t give a rap for them. Now, from the first words we exchanged, I realised that you were one of us!\u201d M. de Charlus, who gave a widely different meaning to this expression, drew himself erect. After the doctor\u2019s oglings, he found his host\u2019s insulting frankness suffocating. \u201cDon\u2019t protest, my dear Sir, you are one of us, it is plain as daylight,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. \u201cObserve that I have no idea whether you practise any of the arts, but that is not necessary. It is not always sufficient. Dechambre, who has just died, played exquisitely, with the most vigorous execution, but he was not one of us, you felt at once that he was not one of us. Brichot is not one of us. Morel is, my wife is, I can feel that you are. . . . \u201d \u201cWhat were you going to tell me?\u201d interrupted M. de Charlus, who was beginning to feel reassured as to M. Verdurin\u2019s meaning, but preferred that he should not utter these misleading remarks quite so loud. \u201cOnly that we put you on the left,\u201d replied M. Verdurin. M. de Charlus, with a comprehending, genial, insolent smile, replied: \u201cWhy! That is not of the slightest importance,here!\u201d And he gave a little laugh that was all his own \u2014 a laugh that came to him probably from some Bavarian or Lorraine grandmother, who herself had inherited it, in identical form, from an ancestress, so that it had been sounding now, without change, for not a few centuries in little old-fashioned European courts, and one could relish its precious quality like that of certain old musical instruments that have now grown rare. There are times when, to paint a complete portrait of some one, we should have to add a phonetic imitation to our verbal description, and our portrait of the figure that M. de Charlus presented is liable to remain incomplete in the absence of that little laugh, so delicate, so light, just as certain compositions are never accurately rendered because our orchestras lack those \u2018small trumpets,\u2019 with a sound so entirely their own, for which the composer wrote this or that part. \u201cBut,\u201d M. Verdurin explained, stung by his laugh, \u201cwe did it on purpose. I attach no importance whatever to title of nobility,\u201d he went on, with that contemptuous smile which I have seen so many people whom I have known, unlike my grandmother and my mother, assume when they spoke of anything that they did not possess, before others who thus, they supposed, would be prevented from using that particular advantage to crow over them. \u201cBut, don\u2019t you see, since we happened to have M. de Cambremer here, and he is a Marquis, while you are only a Baron. . . . \u201d \u201cPardon me,\u201d M. de Charlus replied with an arrogant air to the astonished Verdurin, \u201cI am also Duc de Brabant, Damoiseau de Montargis, Prince d\u2019Oloron, de Carency, de Viareggio and des Dunes. However, it is not of the slightest importance. Please do not distress yourself,\u201d he concluded, resuming his subtle smile which spread itself over these final words: \u201cI could see at a glance that you were not accustomed to society.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin came across to me to shew me Elstir\u2019s flowers. If this action, to which I had grown so indifferent, of going out to dinner, had on the contrary, taking the form that made it entirely novel, of a journey along the coast, followed by an ascent in a carriage to a point six hundred feet above the sea, produced in me a sort of intoxication, this feeling had not been dispelled at la Raspeli\u00e8re. \u201cJust look at this, now,\u201d said the Mistress, shewing me some huge and splendid roses by Elstir, whose unctuous scarlet and rich white stood out, however, with almost too creamy a relief from the flower-stand upon which they were arranged. \u201cDo you suppose he would still have to touch to get that? Don\u2019t you call that striking? And besides, it\u2019s fine as matter, it would be amusing to handle. I can\u2019t tell you how amusing it was to watch him painting them. One could feel that he was interested in trying to get just that effect.\u201d And the Mistress\u2019s gaze rested musingly on this present from the artist in which were combined not merely his great talent but their long friendship which survived only in these mementoes of it which he had bequeathed to her; behind the flowers which long agcr he had picked for her, she seemed to see the shapely hand that had painted them, in the course of a morning, in their freshness, so that, they on the table, it leaning against the back of a chair, had been able to meet face to face at the Mistress\u2019s luncheon party, the roses still alive and their almost lifelike portrait. Almost only, for Elstir was unable to look at a flower without first transplanting it to that inner garden in which we are obliged always to remain. He had shewn in this water-colour the appearance of the roses which he had seen, and which, but for him, no one would ever have known; so that one might say that they were a new variety with which this painter, like a skilful gardener, had enriched the family of the Roses. \u201cFrom the day he left the little nucleus, he was finished. It seems, my dinners made him waste his time, that I hindered the development of his genius,\u201d she said in a tone of irony. \u201cAs if the society of a woman like myself could fail to be beneficial to an artist,\u201d she exclaimed with a burst of pride. Close beside us, M. de Cambremer, who was already seated, seeing that M. de Charlus was standing, made as though to rise and offer him his chair. This offer may have arisen, in the Marquis\u2019s mind, from nothing more than a vague wish to be polite. M. de Charlus preferred to attach to it the sense of a duty which the plain gentleman knew that he owed to a Prince, and felt that he could not establish his right to this precedence better than by declining it. And so he exclaimed: \u201cWhat are you doing? I beg of you! The idea!\u201d The astutely vehement tone of this protest had in itself something typically \u2018Guermantes\u2019 which became even more evident in the imperative, superfluous and familiar gesture with which he brought both his hands down, as though to force him to remain seated, upon the shoulders of M. de Cambremer who had not risen. \u201cCome, come, my dear fellow,\u201d the Baron insisted, \u201cthis is too much. There is no reason for it! In these days we keep that for Princes of the Blood.\u201d I made no more effect on the Cambremers than on Mme. Verdurin by my enthusiasm for their house. For I remained cold to the beauties which they pointed out to me and grew excited over confused reminiscences; at times I even confessed my disappointment at not finding something correspond to what its name had made me imagine. I enraged Mme. de Cambremer by telling her that I had supposed the place to be more in the country. On the other hand I broke off in an ecstasy to sniff the fragrance of a breeze that crept in through the chink of the door. \u201cI see you like draughts,\u201d they said to me. My praise of the patch of green lining-cloth that had been pasted over a broken pane met with no greater success: \u201cHow frightful!\u201d cried the Marquise. The climax came when I said: \u201cMy greatest joy was when I arrived. When I heard my step echoing along the gallery, I felt that I had come into some village council-office, with a map of the district on the wall.\u201d This time, Mme. de Cambremer resolutely turned her back on me. \u201cYou don\u2019t think the arrangement too bad?\u201d her husband asked her with the same compassionate anxiety with which he would have inquired how his wife had stood some painful ceremony. \u201cThey have some fine things.\u201d But, inasmuch as malice, when the hard and fast rules of sure taste do not confine it within fixed limits, finds fault with everything, in the persons or in the houses, of the people who have supplanted the critic: \u201cYes, but they are not in the right places. Besides, are they really as fine as all that?\u201d \u201cYou noticed,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, with a melancholy that was controlled by a note of firmness, \u201cthere are some Jouy hangings that are worn away, some quite threadbare things in this drawing-room!\u201d \u201cAnd that piece of stuff with its huge roses, like a peasant woman\u2019s quilt,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer whose purely artificial culture was confined exclusively to idealist philosophy, impressionist painting and Debussy\u2019s music. And, so as not to criticise merely in the name of smartness but in that of good taste: \u201cAnd they have put up windscreens! Such bad style! What can you expect of such people, they don\u2019t know, where could they have learned? They must be retired tradespeople. It\u2019s really not bad for them.\u201d \u201cI thought the chandeliers good,\u201d said the Marquis, though it was not evident why he should make an exception of the chandeliers, just as inevitably, whenever anyone spoke of a church, whether it was the Cathedral of Chartres, or of Rheims, or of Amiens, or the church at Balbec, what he would always make a point of mentioning as admirable would be: \u201cthe organ-loft, the pulpit and the misericords.\u201d \u201cAs for the garden, don\u2019t speak about it,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cIt\u2019s a massacre. Those paths running all crooked.\u201d I seized the opportunity while Mme. Verdurin was pouring out coffee to go and glance over the letter which M. de Cambremer had brought me, and in which his mother invited me to dinner. With that faint trace of ink, the handwriting revealed an individuality which in the future I should be able to recognise among a thousand, without any more need to have recourse to the hypothesis of special pens, than to suppose that rare and mysteriously blended colours are necessary to enable a painter to express his original vision. Indeed a paralytic, stricken with agraphia after a seizure, and compelled to look at the script as at a drawing without being able to read it, would have gathered that Mme. de Cambremer belonged to an old family in which the zealous cultivation of literature and the arts had supplied a margin to its artistocratic traditions. He would have guessed also the period in which the Marquise had learned simultaneously to write and to play Chopin\u2019s music. It was the time when well-bred people observed the rule of affability and what was called the rule of the three adjectives. Mme. de Cambremer combined the two rules in one. A laudatory adjective was not enough for her, she followed it (after a little stroke of the pen) with a second, then (after another stroke), with a third. But, what was peculiar to herself was that, in defiance of the literary and social object at which she aimed, the sequence of the three epithets assumed in Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s notes the aspect not of a progression but of a diminuendo. Mme. de Cambremer told me in this first letter that she had seen Saint-Loup and had appreciated more than ever his \u2018unique \u2014 rare \u2014 real\u2019 qualities, that he was coming to them again with one of his friends (the one who was in love with her daughter-in-law), and that if I cared to come, with or without them, to dine at F\u00e9terne she would be \u2018delighted \u2014 happy \u2014 pleased.\u2019 Perhaps it was because her desire to be friendly outran the fertility of her imagination and the riches of her vocabulary that the lady, while determined to utter three exclamations, was incapable of making the second and third anything more than feeble echoes of the first. Add but a fourth adjective, and, of her initial friendliness, there would be nothing left. Moreover, with a certain refined simplicity which cannot have failed to produce a considerable impression upon her family and indeed in her circle of acquaintance, Mme. de Cambremer had acquired the habit of substituting for the word (which might in time begin to ring false) \u2018sincere,\u2019 the word \u2018true.\u2019 And to shew that it was indeed by sincerity that she was impelled, she broke the conventional rule that would have placed the adjective \u2018true\u2019 before its noun, and planted it boldly after. Her letters ended with: \u201cCroyez \u00e0 mon amiti\u00e9 vraie.\u201d \u201cCroyez \u00e0 ma sympathie vraie.\u201d Unfortunately, this had become so stereotyped a formula that the affectation of frankness was more suggestive of a polite fiction than the time-honoured formulas, of the meaning of which people have ceased to think. I was, however, hindered from reading her letter by the confused sound of conversation over which rang out the louder accents of M. de Charlus, who, still on the same topic, was saying to M. de Cambremer: \u201cYou reminded me, when you offered me your chair, of a gentleman from whom I received a letter this morning, addressed: \u2018To His Highness, the Baron de Charlus,\u2019 and beginning \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019\u201d \u201cTo be sure, your correspondent was slightly exaggerating,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer, giving way to a discreet show of mirth. M. de Charlus had provoked this; he did not partake in it. \u201cWell, if it comes to that, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cI may observe that, heraldically speaking, he was entirely in the right. I am not regarding it as a personal matter, you understand. I should say the same of anyone else. But one has to face the facts, history is history, we can\u2019t alter it and it is not in our power to rewrite it. I need not cite the case of the Emperor William, who at Kiel never ceased to address me as \u2018Monseigneur.\u2019 I have heard it said that he gave the same title to all the Dukes of France, which was an abuse of the privilege, but was perhaps simply a delicate attention aimed over our heads at France herself.\u201d \u201cMore delicate, perhaps, than sincere,\u201d said M. de Cambremer. \u201cAh! There I must differ from you. Observe that, personally, a gentleman of the lowest rank such as that Hohenzollern, a Protestant to boot, and one who has usurped the throne of my cousin the King of Hanover, can be no favourite of mine,\u201d added M. de Charlus, with whom the annexation of Hanover seemed to rankle more than that of Alsace-Lorraine. \u201cBut I believe the feeling that turns the Emperor in our direction to be profoundly sincere. Fools will tell you that he is a stage emperor. He is on the contrary marvellously intelligent; it is true that he knows nothing about painting, and has forced Herr Tschudi to withdraw the Elstirs from the public galleries. But Louis XIV did not appreciate the Dutch Masters, he had the same fondness for display, and yet he was, when all is said, a great Monarch. Besides, William II has armed his country from the military and naval point of view in a way that Louis XIV failed to do, and I hope that his reign will never know the reverses that darkened the closing days of him who is fatuously styled the Roi Soleil. The Republic made a great mistake, to my mind, in rejecting the overtures of the Hohenzollern, or responding to them only in driblets. He is very well aware of it himself and says, with that gift that he has for the right expression: \u2018What I want is a clasped hand, not a raised hat.\u2019 As a man, he is vile; he has abandoned, surrendered, denied his best friends, in circumstances in which his silence was as deplorable as theirs was grand,\u201d continued M. de Charlus, who was irresistibly drawn by his own tendencies to the Eulenburg affair, and remembered what one of the most highly placed of the culprits had said to him: \u201cThe Emperor must have relied upon our delicacy to have dared to allow such a trial. But he was not mistaken in trusting to our discretion. We would have gone to the scaffold with our lips sealed.\u201d \u201cAll that, however, has nothing to do with what I was trying to explain, which is that, in Germany, mediatised Princes like ourselves are Durchlaucht, and in France our rank of Highness was publicly recognised. Saint-Simon tries to make out that this was an abuse on our part, in which he is entirely mistaken. The reason that he gives, namely that Louis XIV forbade us to style him the Most Christian King and ordered us to call him simply the King, proves merely that we held our title from him, and not that we had not the rank of Prince. Otherwise, it would have to be withheld from the Duc de Lorraine and ever so many others. Besides, several of our titles come from the House of Lorraine through Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d\u2019Espinay, my great-grandmother, who was the daughter of the Damoiseau de Commercy.\u201d Observing that Morel was listening, M. de Charlus proceeded to develop the reasons for his claim. \u201cI have pointed out to my brother that it is not in the third part of Gotha, but in the second, not to say the first, that the account of our family ought to be included,\u201d he said, without stopping to think that Morel did not know what \u2018Gotha\u2019 was. \u201cBut that is his affair, he is the Head of my House, and so long as he raises no objection and allows the matter to pass, I have only to shut my eyes.\u201d \u201cM. Brichot interests me greatly,\u201d I said to Mme. Verdurin as she joined me, and I slipped Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s letter into my pocket. \u201cHe has a cultured mind and is an excellent man,\u201d she replied coldly. \u201cOf course what he lacks is originality and taste, he has a terrible memory. They used to say of the \u2018forebears\u2019 of the people we have here this evening, the \u00e9migr\u00e9s, that they had forgotten nothing. But they had at least the excuse,\u201d she said, borrowing one of Swann\u2019s epigrams, \u201cthat they had learned nothing. Whereas Brichot knows everything, and hurls chunks of dictionary at our heads during dinner. I\u2019m sure you know everything now about the names of all the towns and villages.\u201d While Mme. Verdurin was speaking, it occurred to me that I had determined to ask her something, but I could not remember what it was. I could not at this moment say what Mme. Verdurin was wearing that evening. Perhaps even then I was no more able to say, for I have not an observant mind. But feeling that her dress was not unambitious I said to her something polite and even admiring. She was like almost all women, who imagine that a compliment that is paid to them is a literal statement of the truth, and is a judgment impartially, irresistibly pronounced, as though it referred to a work of art that has no connexion with a person. And so it was with an earnestness which made me blush for my own hypocrisy that she replied with the proud and artless question, habitual in the circumstances: \u201cYou like it?\u201d \u201cI know you\u2019re talking about Brichot. Eh, Chantepie, Freycinet, he spared you nothing. I had my eye on you, my little Mistress!\u201d \u201cI saw you, it was all I could do not to laugh.\u201d \u201cYou are talking about Chantepie, I am certain,\u201d said M. Verdurin, as he came towards us. I had been alone, as I thought of my strip of green cloth and of a scent of wood, in failing to notice that, while he discussed etymologies, Brichot had been provoking derision. And inasmuch as the expressions which, for me, gave their value to things were of the sort which other people either do not feel or reject without thinking of them, as unimportant, they were entirely useless to me and had the additional drawback of making me appear stupid in the eyes of Mme. Verdurin who saw that I had \u2018swallowed\u2019 Brichot, as before I had appeared stupid to Mme. de Guermantes, because I enjoyed going to see Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. With Brichot, however, there was another reason. I was not one of the little clan. And in every clan, whether it be social, political, literary, one contracts a perverse facility in discovering in a conversation, in an official speech, in a story, in a sonnet, everything that the honest reader would never have dreamed of finding there. How many times have I found myself, after reading with a certain emotion a tale skilfully told by a learned and slightly old-fashioned Academician, on the point of saying to Bloch or to Mme. de Guermantes: \u201cHow charming this is!\u201d when before I had opened my mouth they exclaimed, each in a different language: \u201cIf you want to be really amused, read a tale by So-and-so. Human stupidity has never sunk to greater depths.\u201d Bloch\u2019s scorn was aroused principally by the discovery that certain effects of style, pleasant enough in themselves, were slightly faded; that of Mme. de Guermantes because the tale seemed to prove the direct opposite of what the author meant, for reasons of fact which she had the ingenuity to deduce but which would never have occurred to me. I was no less surprised to discover the irony that underlay the Verdurins\u2019 apparent friendliness for Brichot than to hear, some days later, at F\u00e9terne, the Cambremers say to me, on hearing my enthusiastic praise of la Raspeli\u00e8re: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that you can be sincere, after all they\u2019ve done to it.\u201d It is true that they admitted that the china was good. Like the shocking windscreens, it had escaped my notice. \u201cAnyhow, when you go back to Balbec, you will know what Balbec means,\u201d said M. Verdurin ironically. It was precisely the things Brichot had told me that interested me. As for what they called his mind, it was exactly the same mind that had at one time been so highly appreciated by the little clan. He talked with the same irritating fluency, but his words no longer carried, having to overcome a hostile silence or disagreeable echoes; what had altered was not the things that he said but the acoustics of the room and the attitude of his audience. \u201cTake care,\u201d Mme. Verdurin murmured, pointing to Brichot. The latter, whose hearing remained keener than his vision, darted at the mistress the hastily withdrawn gaze of a short-sighted philosopher. If his bodily eyes were less good, his mind\u2019s eye on the contrary had begun to take a larger view of things. He saw how little was to be expected of human affection, and resigned himself to it. Undoubtedly the discovery pained him. It may happen that even the man who on one evening only, in a circle where he is usually greeted with joy, realises that the others have found him too frivolous or too pedantic or too loud, or too forward, or whatever it may be, returns home miserable. Often it is a difference of opinion, or of system, that has made him appear to other people absurd or old-fashioned. Often he is perfectly well aware that those others are inferior to himself. He could easily dissect the sophistries with which he has been tacitly condemned, he is tempted to pay a call, to write a letter: on second thoughts, he does nothing, awaits the invitation for the following week. Sometimes, too, these discomfitures, instead of ending with the evening, last for months. Arising from the instability of social judgments, they increase that instability further. For the man who knows that Mme. X despises him, feeling that he is respected at Mme. Y\u2019s, pronounces her far superior to the other and emigrates to her house. This however is not the proper place to describe those men, superior to the life of society but lacking the capacity to realise their own worth outside it, glad to be invited, embittered by being disparaged, discovering annually the faults of the hostess to whom they have been offering incense and the genius of her whom they have never properly appreciated, ready to return to the old love when they shall have felt the drawbacks to be found equally in the new, and when they have begun to forget those of the old. We may judge by these temporary discomfitures the grief that Brichot felt at one which he knew to be final. He was not unaware that Mme. Verdurin sometimes laughed at him publicly, even at his infirmities, and knowing how little was to be expected of human affection, submitting himself to the facts, he continued nevertheless to regard the Mistress as his best friend. But, from the blush that swept over the scholar\u2019s face, Mme. Verdurin saw that he had heard her, and made up her mind to be kind to him for the rest of the evening. I could not help remarking to her that she had not been very kind to Saniette. \u201cWhat! Not kind to him! Why, he adores us, you can\u2019t imagine what we are to him. My husband is sometimes a little irritated by his stupidity, and you must admit that he has every reason, but when that happens why doesn\u2019t he rise in revolt, instead of cringing like a whipped dog? It is not honest. I don\u2019t like it. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t always try to calm my husband, because if he went too far, all that would happen would be that Saniette would stay away; and I don\u2019t want that because I may tell you that he hasn\u2019t a penny in the world, he needs his dinners. But after all, if he does mind, he can stay away, it has nothing to do with me, when a person depends on other people he should try not to be such an idiot.\u201d \u201cThe Duchy of Aumale was in our family for years before passing to the House of France,\u201d M. de Charlus was explaining to M. de Cambremer, before a speechless Morel, for whom, as a matter of fact, the whole of this dissertation was, if not actually addressed to him, intended. \u201cWe took precedence over all foreign Princes; I could give you a hundred examples. The Princesse de Croy having attempted, at the burial of Monsieur, to fall on her knees after my great-great-grandmother, that lady reminded her sharply that she had not the privilege of the hassock, made the officer on duty remove it, and reported the matter to the King, who ordered Mme. de Croy to call upon Mme. de Guermantes and offer her apologies. The Duc de Bourgogne having come to us with ushers with raised wands, we obtained the King\u2019s authority to have them lowered. I know it is not good form to speak of the merits of one\u2019s own family. But it is well known that our people were always to the fore in the hour of danger. Our battle-cry, after we abandoned that of the Dukes of Brabant, was Passavant! So that it is fair enough after all that this right to be everywhere the first, which we had established for so many centuries in war, should afterwards have been confirmed to us at Court. And, egad, it has always been admitted there. I may give you a further instance, that of the Princess of Baden. As she had so far forgotten herself as to attempt to challenge the precedence of that same Duchesse de Guermantes of whom I was speaking just now, and had attempted to go in first to the King\u2019s presence, taking advantage of a momentary hesitation which my relative may perhaps have shewn (although there could be no reason for it), the King called out: \u2018Come in, cousin, come in; Mme. de Baden knows very well what her duty is to you.\u2019 And it was as Duchesse de Guermantes that she held this rank, albeit she was of no mean family herself, since she was through her mother niece to the Queen of Poland, the Queen of Hungary, the Elector Palatine, the Prince of Savoy-Carignano and the Elector of Hanover, afterwards King of England.\u201d \u201cMaecenas atavis \u00e9dite regibus!\u201d said Brichot, addressing M. de Charlus, who acknowledged the compliment with a slight inclination of his head. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked Brichot, anxious to make amends to him for her previous speech. \u201cI was referring, Heaven forgive me, to a dandy who was the pick of the basket\u201d (Mme. Verdurin winced) \u201cabout the time of Augustus\u201d (Mme. Verdurin, reassured by the remoteness in time of this basket, assumed a more serene expression), \u201cof a friend of Virgil and Horace who carried their sycophancy to the extent of proclaiming to his face his more than aristocratic, his royal descent, in a word I was referring to Maecenas, a bookworm who was the friend of Horace, Virgil, Augustus. I am sure that M. de Charlus knows all about Maecenas.\u201d With a gracious, sidelong glance at Mme. Verdurin, because he had heard her make an appointment with Morel for the day after next and was afraid that she might not invite him also, \u201cI should say,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cthat Maecenas was more or less the Verdurin of antiquity.\u201d Mme. Verdurin could not altogether suppress a smile of satisfaction. She went over to Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s nice, your father\u2019s friend,\u201d she said to him. \u201cOne can see that he\u2019s an educated man, and well bred. He will get on well in our little nucleus. What is his address in Paris?\u201d Morel preserved a haughty silence and merely proposed a game of cards. Mme. Verdurin insisted upon a little violin music first. To the general astonishment, M. de Charlus, who never referred to his own considerable gifts, accompanied, in the purest style, the closing passage (uneasy, tormented, Schumannesque, but, for all that, earlier than Franck\u2019s Sonata) of the Sonata for piano and violin by Faur\u00e9. I felt that he would furnish Morel, marvellously endowed as to tone and virtuosity, with just those qualities that he lacked, culture and style. But I thought with curiosity of this combination in a single person of a physical blemish and a spiritual gift. M. de Charlus was not very different from his brother, the Duc de Guermantes. Indeed, a moment ago (though this was rare), he had spoken as bad French as his brother. He having reproached me (doubtless in order that I might speak in glowing terms of Morel to Mme. Verdurin) with never coming to see him, and I having pleaded discretion, he had replied: \u201cBut, since it is I that asks you, there is no one but I who am in a position to take offence.\u201d This might have been said by the Duc de Guermantes. M. de Charlus was only a Guermantes when all was said. But it had been enough that nature should upset the balance of his nervous system sufficiently to make him prefer to the woman that his brother the Duke would have chosen one of Virgil\u2019s shepherds or Plato\u2019s disciples, and at once qualities unknown to the Duc de Guermantes and often combined with this want of balance had made M. de Charlus an exquisite pianist, an amateur painter who was not devoid of taste, an eloquent talker. Who would ever have detected that the rapid, eager, charming style with which M. de Charlus played the Schumannesque passage of Faur\u00e9\u2018s Sonata had its equivalent \u2014 one dares not say its cause \u2014 in elements entirely physical, in the nervous defects of M. de Charlus? We shall explain later on what we mean by nervous defects, and why it is that a Greek of the time of Socrates, a Roman of the time of Augustus might be what we know them to have been and yet remain absolutely normal men, and not men-women such as we see around us to-day. Just as he had genuine artistic tendencies, which had never come to fruition, so M. de Charlus had, far more than the Duke, loved their mother, loved his own wife, and indeed, years after her death, if anyone spoke of her to him would shed tears, but superficial tears, like the perspiration of an over-stout man, whose brow will glisten with sweat at the slightest exertion. With this difference, that to the latter we say: \u201cHow hot you are,\u201d whereas we pretend not to notice other people\u2019s tears. We, that is to say, people in society; for the humbler sort are as distressed by the sight of tears as if a sob were more serious than a hemorrhage. His sorrow after the death of his wife, thanks to the habit of falsehood, did not debar M. de Charlus from a life which was not in harmony \u2022with it. Indeed later on, he sank so low as to let it be known that, during the funeral rites, he had found an opportunity of asking the acolyte for his name and address. And it may have been true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the piece eame to an end, I ventured to ask for some Franck, which appeared to cause Mme. de Cambremer such acute pain that I did not insist. \u201cYou can\u2019t admire that sort of thing,\u201d she said to me. Instead she asked for Debussy\u2019s F\u00eates, which made her exclaim: \u201cAh! How sublime!\u201d from the first note. But Morel discovered that he remembered the opening bars only, and in a spirit of mischief, without any intention to deceive, began a March by Meyerbeer. Unfortunately, as he left little interval and made no announcement, everybody supposed that he was still playing Debussy, and continued to exclaim \u2018Sublime!\u2019 Morel, by revealing that the composer was that not of Pell\u00e9as but of Robert le Diable created a certain chill. Mme. de Cambremer had scarcely time to feel it, for she had just discovered a volume of Scarlatti, and had flung herself upon it with an hysterical impulse. \u201cOh! Play this, look, this piece, it\u2019s divine,\u201d she cried. And yet, of this composer long despised, recently ^promoted to the highest honours, what she had selected in her feverish impatience was one of those infernal pieces which have so often kept us from sleeping, while a merciless pupil repeats them indefinitely on the next floor. But Morel had had enough music, and as he insisted upon cards, M. de Charlus, to be able to join in, proposed a game of whist. \u201cHe was telling the Master just now that he is a Prince,\u201d said Ski to Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut it\u2019s not true, they\u2019re quite a humble family of architects.\u201d \u201cI want to know what it was you were saying about Maecenas. It interests me, don\u2019t you know!\u201d Mme. Verdurin repeated to Brichot, with an affability that carried him off his feet. And so, in order to shine in the Mistress\u2019s eyes, and possibly in mine: \u201cWhy, to tell you the truth, Madame, Maecenas interests me chiefly because he is the earliest apostle of note of that Chinese god who numbers more followers in France to-day than Brahma, than Christ himself, the all-powerful God Ubedamd.\u201d Mme. Verdurin was no longer content, upon these occasions, with burying her head in her hands. She would descend with the suddenness of the insects called ephemeral upon Princess Sherbatoff; were the latter within reach the Mistress would cling to her shoulder, dig her nails into it, and hide her face against it for a few moments like a child playing at hide and seek. Concealed by this protecting screen, she was understood to be laughing until she cried and was as well able to think of nothing at all as people are who while saying a prayer that is rather long take the wise precaution of burying their faces in their hands. Mme. Verdurin used to imitate them when she listened to Beethoven quartets, so as at the same time to let it be seen that she regarded them as a prayer and not to let it be seen that she was asleep. \u201cI am quite serious, Madame,\u201d said Brichot. \u201cToo numerous, I consider, to-day is become the person who spends his time gazing at his navel as though it were the hub of the universe. As a matter of doctrine, I have no objection to offer to some Nirvana which will dissolve us in the great Whole (which, like Munich and Oxford, is considerably nearer to Paris than Asni\u00e8res or Bois-Colombes), but it is unworthy either of a true Frenchman, or of a true European even, when the Japanese are possibly at the gates of our Byzantium, that socialised anti-militarists should be gravely discussing the cardinal virtues of free verse.\u201d Mme. Verdurin felt that she might dispense with the Princess\u2019s mangled shoulder, and allowed her face to become once more visible, not without pretending to wipe her eyes and gasping two or three times for breath. But Brichot was determined that I should have my share in the entertainment, and having learned, from those oral examinations which he conducted so admirably, that the best way to flatter the young is to lecture them, to make them feel themselves important, to make them regard you as a reactionary: \u201cI have no wish to blaspheme against the Gods of Youth,\u201d he said, with that furtive glance at myself which a speaker turns upon a member of his audience whom he has mentioned by name. \u201cI have no wish to be damned as a heretic and renegade in the Mallarm\u00e9an chapel in which our new friend, like all the young men of his age, must have served the esoteric mass, at least as an acolyte, and have shewn himself deliquescent or Rosicrucian. But, really, we have seen more than enough of these intellectuals worshipping art with a big A, who, when they can no longer intoxicate themselves upon Zola, inject themselves with Verlaine. Become etheromaniacs out of Baude-lairean devotion, they would no longer be capable of the virile effort which the country may, one day or another, demand of them, anaesthetised as they are by the great literary neurosis in the heated, enervating atmosphere, heavy with unwholesome vapours, of a symbolism of the opium-pipe.\u201d Feeling incapable of feigning any trace of admiration for Brichot\u2019s inept and motley tirade, I turned to Ski and assured him that he was entirely mistaken as to the family to which M. de Charlus belonged; he replied that he was certain of his facts, and added that I myself had said that his real name was Gandin, Le Gandin. \u201cI told you,\u201d was my answer, \u201cthat Mme. de Cambremer was the sister of an engineer, M. Legrandin. I never said a word to you about M. de Charlus. There is about as much connexion between him and Mme. de Cambremer as between the Great Cond\u00e9 and Racine.\u201d \u201cIndeed! I thought there was,\u201d said Ski lightly, with no more apology for his mistake than he had made a few hours earlier for the mistake that had nearly made his party miss the train. \u201cDo you intend to remain long on this coast?\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked M. de Charlus, in whom she foresaw an addition to the faithful and trembled lest he should be returning too soon to Paris. \u201cGood Lord, one never knows,\u201d replied M. de Charlus in a nasal drawl. \u201cI should like to stay here until the end of September.\u201d \u201cYou are quite right,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin; \u201cthat is the time for fine storms at sea.\u201d \u201cTo tell you the truth, that is not what would influence me. I have for some time past unduly neglected the Archangel Saint Michael, my patron, and I should like to make amends to him by staying for his feast, on the 29th of September, at the Abbey on the Mount.\u201d \u201cYou take an interest in all that sort of thing?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, who might perhaps have succeeded in hushing the voice of her outraged anti-clericalism, had she not been afraid that so long an expedition might make the violinist and the Baron \u2018fail\u2019 her for forty-eight hours. \u201cYou are perhaps afflicted with intermittent deafness,\u201d M. de Charlus replied insolently. \u201cI have told you that Saint Michael is one of my glorious patrons.\u201d Then, smiling with a benevolent ecstasy, his eyes gazing into the distance, his voice strengthened by an excitement which seemed now to be not merely aesthetic but religious: \u201cIt is so beautiful at the offertory when Michael stands erect by the altar, in a white robe, swinging a golden censer heaped so high with perfumes that the fragrance of them mounts up to God.\u201d \u201cWe might go there in a party,\u201d suggested Mme. Verdurin, notwithstanding her horror of the clergy. \u201cAt that moment, when the offertory begins,\u201d went on M. de Charlus who, for other reasons but in the same manner as good speakers in Parliament, never replied to an interruption and would pretend not to have heard it, \u201cit would be wonderful to see our young friend Palestrinising, indeed performing an aria by Bach. The worthy Abbot, too, would be wild with joy, and that is the greatest homage, at least the greatest public homage that I can pay to my Holy Patron. What an edification for the faithful! We must mention it presently to the young Angelico of music, a warrior like Saint Michael.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saniette, summoned to make a fourth, declared that he did not know how to play whist. And Cottard, seeing that there was not much time left before our train, embarked at once on a game of \u00e9cart\u00e9 with Morel. M. Verdurin was furious, and bore down with a terrible expression upon Saniette. \u201cIs there anything in the world that you can play?\u201d he cried, furious at being deprived of the opportunity for a game of whist, and delighted to have found one to insult the old registrar. He, in his terror, did his best to look clever. \u201cYes, I can play the piano,\u201d he said. Cottard and Morel were seated face to face. \u201cYour deal,\u201d said Cottard. \u201cSuppose we go nearer to the card-table,\u201d M. de Charlus, worried by the sight of Morel in Cottard\u2019s company, suggested to M. de Cambremer. \u201cIt is quite as interesting as those questions of etiquette which in these days have ceased to count for very much. The only kings that we have left, in France at least, are the kings in the pack of cards, who seem to me to be positively swarming in the hand of our young virtuoso,\u201d he added a moment later, from an admiration for Morel which extended to his way of playing cards, to flatter him also, and finally to account for his suddenly turning to lean over the young violinist\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI-ee cut,\u201d said (imitating the accent of a cardsharper) Cottard, whose children burst out laughing, like his students and the chief dresser, whenever the master, even by the bedside of a serious case, uttered with the emotionless face of an epileptic one of his hackneyed witticisms. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to play,\u201d said Morel, seeking advice from M. de Charlus. \u201cJust as you please, you\u2019re bound to lose, whatever you play, it\u2019s all the same (c\u2019est \u00e9gal).\u201d \u201cEgal . . . Ingalli?\u201d said the doctor, with an insinuating, kindly glance at M. de Cambremer. \u201cShe was what we call a true diva, she was a dream, a Carmen such as we shall never see again. She was wedded to the part. I used to enjoy too listening to Ingalli \u2014 married.\u201d The Marquis drew himself up with that contemptuous vulgarity of well-bred people who do not realise that they are insulting their host by appearing uncertain whether they ought to associate with his guests, and adopt English manners by way of apology for a scornful expression: \u201cWho is that gentleman playing cards, what does he do for a living, what does he sell? I rather like to know whom I am meeting, so as not to make friends with any Tom, Dick or Harry. But I didn\u2019t catch his name when you did me the honour of introducing me to him.\u201d If M. Verdurin, availing himself of this phrase, had indeed introduced M. de Cambremer to his fellow-guests, the other would have been greatly annoyed. But, knowing that it was the opposite procedure that was observed, he thought it gracious to assume a genial and modest air, without risk to himself. The pride that M. Verdurin took in his intimacy with Cottard had increased if anything now that the doctor had become an eminent professor. But it no longer found expression in the artless language of earlier days. Then, when Cottard was scarcely known to the public, if you spoke to M. Verdurin of his wife\u2019s facial neuralgia: \u201cThere is nothing to be done,\u201d he would say, with the artless self-satisfaction of people who assume that anyone whom they know must be famous, and that everybody knows the name of their family singing-master. \u201cIf she had an ordinary doctor, one might look for a second opinion, but when that doctor is called Cottard\u201d (a name which he pronounced as though it were Bouchard or Charcot) \u201cone has simply to bow to the inevitable.\u201d Adopting a reverse procedure, knowing that M. de Cambremer must certainly have heard of the famous Professor Cottard, M. Verdurin adopted a tone of simplicity. \u201cHe\u2019s our family doctor, a worthy soul whom we adore and who would let himself be torn in pieces for our sakes; he is not a doctor, he is a friend, I don\u2019t suppose you have ever heard of him or that his name would convey anything to you, in any case to us it is the name of a very good man, of a very dear friend, Cottard.\u201d This name, murmured in a modest tone, took in M. de Cambremer who supposed that his host was referring to some one else. \u201cCottard? You don\u2019t mean Professor Cottard?\u201d At that moment one heard the voice of the said Professor who, at an awkward point in the game, was saying as he looked at his cards: \u201cThis is where Greek meets Greek.\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, to be sure, he is a professor,\u201d said M. Verdurin. \u201cWhat! Professor Cottard! You are not making a mistake?-You are quite sure it\u2019s the same man? The one who lives in the Rue du Bac?\u201d \u201cYes, his address is 43, Rue du Bac. You know him?\u201d \u201cBut everybody knows Professor Cottard. He\u2019s at the top of the tree! You might as well ask me if I knew Bouffe de Saint-Biaise or Courtois-Suffit. I could see when I heard him speak that he was not an ordinary person, that is why I took the liberty of asking you.\u201d \u201cCome now, what shall I play, trumps?\u201d asked Cottard. Then abruptly, with a vulgarity which would have been offensive even in heroic circumstances, as when a soldier uses a coarse expression to convey his contempt for death, but became doubly stupid in the safe pastime of a game of cards, Cottard, deciding to play a trump, assumed a sombre, suicidal air, and, borrowing the language of people who are risking their skins, played his card as though it were his life, with the exclamation: \u201cThere it is, and be damned to it!\u201d It was not the right card to play, but he had a consolation. In the middle of the room, in a deep armchair, Mme. Cottard, yielding to the effect, which she always found irresistible, of a good dinner, had succumbed after vain efforts to the vast and gentle slumbers that were overpowering her. In vain might she sit up now and again, and smile, whether at her own absurdity or from fear of leaving unanswered some polite speech that might have been addressed to her, she sank back, in spite of herself, into the clutches of the implacable and delicious malady. More than the noise, what awakened her thus for an instant only, was the giance (which, in her wifely affection she could see even when her eyes were shut, and foresaw, for the same scene occurred every evening and haunted her dreams like the thought of the hour at which one will have to rise), the glance with which the Professor drew the attention of those present to his wife\u2019s slumbers. To begin with, he merely looked at her and smiled, for if as a doctor he disapproved of this habit of falling asleep after dinner (or at least gave this scientific reason for growing annoyed later on, but it is not certain whether it was a determining reason, so many and diverse were the views that he held about it), as an all-powerful and teasing husband, he was delighted to be able to make a fool of his wife, to rouse her only partly at first, so that she might fall asleep again and he have the pleasure of waking her afresh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time, Mme. Cottard was sound asleep. \u201cNow then, L\u00e9ontine you\u2019re snoring,\u201d the professor called to her. \u201cI am listening to Mme. Swann, my dear,\u201d Mme. Cottard replied faintly, and dropped back into her lethargy. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect nonsense,\u201d exclaimed Cottard, \u201cshe\u2019ll be telling us presently that she wasn\u2019t asleep. She\u2019s like the patients who come to consult us and insist that they never sleep at all.\u201d \u201cThey imagine it, perhaps,\u201d said M. de Cambremer with a laugh. But the doctor enjoyed contradicting no less than teasing, and would on no account allow a layman to talk medicine to him. \u201cPeople do not imagine that they never sleep,\u201d he promulgated in a dogmatic tone. \u201cAh!\u201d replied the Marquis with a respectful bow, such as Cottard at one time would have made. \u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d Cottard went on, \u201cthat you have never administered, as I have, as much as two grains of trional without succeeding in provoking som-nolescence.\u201d \u201cQuite so, quite so,\u201d replied the Marquis, laughing with a superior air, \u201cI have never taken trional, or any of those drugs which soon cease to have any effect but ruin your stomach. When a man has been out shooting all night, like me, in the forest of Chantepie, I can assure you he doesn\u2019t need any trional to make him sleep.\u201d \u201cIt is only fools who say that,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cTrional frequently has a remarkable effect on the nervous tone. You mention trional, have you any idea what it is?\u201d \u201cWell . . . I\u2019ve heard people say that it is a drug to make one sleep.\u201d \u201cYou are not answering my question,\u201d replied the Professor, who, thrice weekly, at the Faculty, sat on the board of examiners. \u201cI don\u2019t ask you whether it makes you sleep or not, but what it is. Can you tell me what percentage it contains of amyl and ethyl?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer with embarrassment. \u201cI prefer a good glass of old brandy or even 345 Port.\u201d \u201cWhich are ten times as toxic,\u201d the Professor interrupted. \u201cAs for trional,\u201d M. de Cambremer ventured, \u201cmy wife goes in for all that sort of thing, you\u2019d better talk to her about it.\u201d \u201cShe probably knows just as much about it as yourself. In any case, if your wife takes trional to make her sleep, you can see that mine has no need of it. Come along, L\u00e9ontine, wake up, you\u2019re getting ankylosed, did you ever see me fall asleep after dinner? What will you be like when you\u2019re sixty, if you fall asleep now like an old woman? You\u2019ll go and get fat, you\u2019re arresting the circulation. She doesn\u2019t even hear what I\u2019m saying.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re bad for one\u2019s health, these little naps after dinner, ain\u2019t they, Doctor?\u201d said M. de Cambremer, seeking to rehabilitate himself with Cottard. \u201cAfter a heavy meal one ought to take exercise.\u201d \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d replied the Doctor. \u201cWe have taken identical quantities of food from the stomach of a dog that has lain quiet and from the stomach of a dog that has been running about and it is in the former that digestion is more advanced.\u201d \u201cThen it is sleep that stops digestion.\u201d \u201cThat depends upon whether you mean oesophagic digestion, stomachic digestion, intestinal digestion; it is useless to give you explanations which you would not understand since you have never studied medicine. Now then, L\u00e9ontine, quick march, it is time we were going.\u201d This was not true, for the doctor was going merely to continue his game, but he hoped thus to cut short in a more drastic fashion the slumbers of the deaf mute to whom he had been addressing without a word of response the most learned exhortations. Whether a determination to remain awake survived in Mme. Cottard, even in the state of sleep, or because the armchair offered no support to her head, it was jerked mechanically from left to right, and up and down, in the empty air, like a lifeless object, and Mme. Cottard, with her nodding poll, appeared now to be listening to music, now to be in the last throes of death. Where her husband\u2019s increasingly vehement admonitions failed of their effect, her sense of her own stupidity proved successful. \u201cMy bath is nice and hot,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut the feathers in the dictionary . . . \u201d she exclaimed as she sat bolt upright. \u201cOh! Good lord, what a fool I am. Whatever have I been saying, I was thinking about my hat, I\u2019m sure I said something silly, in another minute I should have been asleep, it\u2019s that wretched fire.\u201d Everybody began to laugh, for there was no fire in the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Note: In the French text of Sodome et Gomorrhe, Volume II ends at this point.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are making fun of me,\u201d said Mme. Cottard, herself laughing, and raising her hand to her brow to wipe away, with the light touch of a hypnotist and the sureness of a woman putting her hair straight, the last traces of sleep, \u201cI must offer my humble apologies to dear Mme. Verdurin and ask her to tell me the truth.\u201d But her smile at once grew sorrowful, for the Professor who knew that his wife sought to please him and trembled lest she should fail, had shouted at her: \u201cLook at yourself in the glass, you are as red as if you had an eruption of acne, you look just like an old peasant.\u201d \u201cYou know, he is charming,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201che has such a delightfully sarcastic side to his character. And then, he snatched my husband from the jaws of death when the whole Faculty had given him up. He spent three nights by his bedside, without ever lying down. And so Cottard to me, you know,\u201d she went on, in a grave and almost menacing tone, raising her hand to the twin spheres, shrouded in white tresses, of her musical temples, and as though we had wished to assault the doctor, \u201cis sacred! He could ask me for anything in the world! As it is, I don\u2019t call him Doctor Cottard, I call him Doctor God! And even in saying that I am slandering him, for this God does everything in his power to remedy some of the disasters for which the other is responsible.\u201d \u201cPlay a trump,\u201d M. de Charlus said to Morel with a delighted air. \u201cA trump, here goes,\u201d said the violinist. \u201cYou ought to have declared your king first,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cyou\u2019re not paying attention to the game, but how well you play!\u201d \u201cI have the king,\u201d said Morel. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine man,\u201d replied the Professor. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that business up there with the sticks?\u201d asked Mme. Verdurin, drawing M. de Cambremer\u2019s attention to a superb escutcheon carved over the mantelpiece. \u201cAre they your arms?\u201d she added with an ironical disdain. \u201cNo, they are not ours,\u201d replied M. de Cambremer. \u201cWe bear, barry of five, embattled counter-embattled or and gules, as many trefoils countercharged. No, those are the arms of the Arrachepels, who were not of our stock, but from whom we inherited the house, and nobody of our line has ever made any changes here. The Arrachepels (formerly Pelvilains, we are told) bore or five piles couped in base gules. When they allied themselves with the F\u00e9terne family, their blazon changed, but remainedcantoned within twenty cross crosslets fitchee in base or, a dexter canton ermine.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one for her!\u201d muttered Mme. de Cambremer. \u201cMy great-grandmother was a d\u2019Arrachepel or de Rachepel, as you please, for both forms are found in the old charters,\u201d continued M. de Cambremer, blushing vividly, for only then did the idea for which his wife had given him credit occur to him, and he was afraid that Mme. Verdurin might have applied to herself a speech which had been made without any reference to her. \u201cThe history books say that, in the eleventh century, the first Arrachepel, Mace, named Pelvilain, shewed a special aptitude, in siege warfare, in tearing up piles. Whence the name Arrachepel by which he was ennobled, and the piles which you see persisting through the centuries in their arms. These are the piles which, to render fortifications more impregnable, used to be driven, plugged, if you will pardon the expression, into the ground in front of them, and fastened together laterally. They are what you quite rightly called sticks, though they had nothing to do with the floating sticks of our good Lafontaine. For they were supposed to render a stronghold unassailable. Of course, with our modern artillery, they make one smile. But you must bear in mind that I am speaking of the eleventh century.\u201d \u201cIt is all rather out of date,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cbut the little campanile has a character.\u201d \u201cYou have,\u201d said Cottard, \u201cthe luck of . . . turlututu,\u201d a word which he gladly repeated to avoid using Moli\u00e8re\u2019s. \u201cDo you know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army?\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t mind being in his shoes,\u201d said Morel, who was tired of military service. \u201cOh! What a bad patriot,\u201d exclaimed M. de Charlus, who could not refrain from pinching the violinist\u2019s ear. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t know why the king of diamonds was turned out of the army,\u201d Cottard pursued, determined to make his joke, \u201cit\u2019s because he has only one eye.\u201d \u201cYou are up against it, Doctor,\u201d said M. de Cambremer, to shew Cottard that he knew who he was. \u201cThis young man is astonishing,\u201d M. de Charlus interrupted innocently. \u201cHe plays like a god.\u201d This observation did not find favour with the doctor, who replied: \u201cNever too late to mend. Who laughs last, laughs longest.\u201d \u201cQueen, ace,\u201d Morel, whom fortune was favouring, announced triumphantly. The doctor bowed his head as though powerless to deny this good fortune, and admitted, spellbound: \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cWe are so pleased to have met M. de Charlus,\u201d said Mme. de Cambremer to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cHad you never met him before? He is quite nice, he is unusual, he is of a period\u201c (she would have found it difficult to say which), replied Mme. Verdurin with the satisfied smile of a connoisseur, a judge and a hostess. Mme. de Cambremer asked me if I was coming to F\u00e9terne with Saint-Loup. I could not suppress a cry of admiration when I saw the moon hanging like an orange lantern beneath the vault of oaks that led away from the house. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, presently, when the moon has risen higher and the valley is lighted up, it will be a thousand times better.\u201d \u201cAre you staying any time in this neighbourhood, Madame?\u201d M. de Cambremer asked Mme. Cottard, a speech that might be interpreted as a vague intention to invite and dispensed him for the moment from making any more precise engagement. \u201cOh, certainly, Sir, I regard this annual exodus as most important for the children. Whatever you may say, they must have fresh air. The Faculty wanted to send me to Vichy; but it is too stuffy there, and I can look after my stomach when those big boys of mine have grown a little bigger. Besides, the Professor, with all the examinations he has to hold, has always got his shoulder to the wheel, and the hot weather tires him dreadfully. I feel that a man needs a thorough rest after he has been on the go all the year like that. Whatever happens we shall stay another month at least.\u201d \u201cAh! In that case we shall meet again.\u201d \u201cBesides, I shall be all the more obliged to stay here as my husband has to go on a visit to Savoy, and won\u2019t be finally settled here for another fortnight.\u201d \u201cI like the view of the valley even more than the sea view,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on. \u201cYou are going to have a splendid night for your journey.\u201d \u201cWe ought really to find out whether the carriages are ready, if you are absolutely determined to go back to Balbec to-night,\u201d M. Verdurin said to me, \u201cfor I see no necessity for it myself. We could drive you over to-morrow morning. It is certain to be fine. The roads are excellent.\u201d I said that it was impossible. \u201cBut in any case it is not time yet,\u201d the Mistress protested. \u201cLeave them alone, they have heaps of time. A lot of good it will do them to arrive at the station with an hour to wait. They are far happier here. And you, my young Mozart,\u201d she said to Morel, not venturing to address M. de Charlus directly, \u201cwon\u2019t you stay the night? We have some nice rooms facing the sea.\u201d \u201cNo, he can\u2019t,\u201d M. de Gharlus replied on behalf of the absorbed card-player who had not heard. \u201cHe has a pass until midnight only. He must go back to bed like a good little boy, obedient, and well-behaved,\u201d he added in a complaisant, mannered, insistent voice, as though he derived some sadic pleasure from the use of this chaste comparison and also from letting his voice dwell, in passing, upon any reference to Morel, from touching him with (failing his fingers) words that seemed to explore his person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the sermon that Brichot had addressed to me, M. de Cambremer had concluded that I was a Dreyfusard. As he himself was as anti-Dreyfusard as possible, out of courtesy to a foe, he began to sing me the praises of a Jewish colonel who had always been very decent to a cousin of the Chevregny and had secured for him the promotion he deserved. \u201cAnd my cousin\u2019s opinions were the exact opposite,\u201d said M. de Cambremer; he omitted to mention what those opinions were, but I felt that they were as antiquated and misshapen as his own face, opinions which a few families in certain small towns must long have entertained. \u201cWell, you know, I call that really fine!\u201d was M. de Cambremer\u2019s conclusion. It is true that he was hardly employing the word \u2018fine\u2019 in the aesthetic sense in which it would have suggested to his wife and mother different works, but works, anyhow, of art. M. de Cambremer often made use of this term, when for instance he was congratulating a delicate person who had put on a little flesh. \u201cWhat, you have gained half-a-stone in two months. I say, that\u2019s fine!\u201d Refreshments were set out on a table. Mme. Verdurin invited the gentlemen to go and choose whatever drinks they preferred. M. de Charlus went and drank his glass and at once returned to a seat by the card-table from which he did not stir. Mme. Verdurin asked him: \u201cHave you tasted my orangeade?\u201d Upon which M. de Charlus, with a gracious smile, in a crystalline tone which he rarely sounded and with endless motions of his lips and body, replied: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, it was strawberry-juice, I think, it was delicious.\u201d It is curious that a certain order of secret actions has the external effect of a manner of speaking or gesticulating which reveals them. If a gentleman believes or disbelieves in the Immaculate Conception, or in the innocence of Dreyfus, or in a plurality of worlds, and wishes to keep his opinion to himself, you will find nothing in his voice or in his movements that will let you read his thoughts. But on hearing M. de Charlus say in that shrill voice and with that smile and waving his arms: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d one could say: \u201cThere, he likes the stronger sex,\u201d with the same certainty as enables a judge to sentence a criminal who has not confessed, a doctor a patient suffering from general paralysis who himself is perhaps unaware of his malady but has made some mistake in pronunciation from which one can deduce that he will be dead in three years. Perhaps the people who conclude from a man\u2019s way of saying: \u201cNo, I preferred its neighbour, the strawberry-juice,\u201d a love of the kind called unnatural, have no need of any such scientific knowledge. But that is because there is a more direct relation between the revealing sign and the secret. Without saying it in so many words to oneself, one feels that it is a gentle, smiling lady who is answering and who appears mannered because she is pretending to be a man and one is not accustomed to seeing men adopt such mannerisms. And it is perhaps more pleasant to think that for long years a certain number of angelic women have been included by mistake in the masculine sex where, in exile, ineffectually beating their wings towards men in whom they inspire a physical repulsion, they know how to arrange a drawing-room, compose \u2018interiors.\u2019 M. de Charlus was not in the least perturbed that Mme. Verdurin should be standing, and remained installed in his armchair so as to be nearer to Morel. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it criminal,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin to the Baron, \u201cthat that creature who might be enchanting us with his violin should be sitting there at a card-table. When anyone can play the violin like that!\u201d \u201cHe plays cards well, he does everything well, he is so intelligent,\u201d said M. de Charlus, keeping his eye on the game, so as to be able to advise Morel. This was not his only reason, however, for not rising from his chair for Mme. Verdurin. With the singular amalgam that he had made of the social conceptions at once of a great nobleman and an amateur of art, instead of being polite in the same way that a man of his world would be, he would create a sort of tableau-vivant for himself after Saint-Simon; and at that moment was amusing himself by impersonating the Mar\u00e9chal d\u2019Uxelles, who interested him from other aspects also, and of whom it is said that he was so proud as to remain seated, with a pretence of laziness, before all the most distinguished persons at court. \u201cBy the way, Charlus,\u201d said Mme. Verdurip, who was beginning to grow familiar, \u201cyou don\u2019t know of any ruined old nobleman in your Faubourg who would come to me as porter?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes . . . why, yes,\u201d replied M. de Charlus with a genial smile, \u201cbut I don\u2019t advise it.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI should be afraid for your sake, that your smart visitors would call at the lodge and go no farther.\u201d This was the first skirmish between them. Mme. Verdurin barely noticed it. There were to be others, alas, in Paris. M. de Charlus remained glued to his chair. He could not, moreover, restrain a faint smile, seeing how his favourite maxims as to aristocratic prestige and middle-class cowardice were confirmed by the so easily won submission of Mme. Verdurin. The Mistress appeared not at all surprised by the Baron\u2019s posture, and if she left him it was only because she had been perturbed by seeing me taken up by M. de Cambremer. But first of all, she wished to clear up the mystery of M. de Charlus\u2019s relations with Comtesse Mole. \u201cYou told me that you knew Mme. de Mol\u00ea. Does that mean, you go there?\u201d she asked, giving to the words \u2018go there\u2019 the sense of being received there, of having received authority from the lady to go and call upon her. M. de Charlus replied with an inflexion of disdain, an affectation of precision and in a sing-song tone: \u201cYes, sometimes.\u201d This \u2018sometimes\u2019 inspired doubts in Mme. Verdurin, who asked: \u201cHave you ever met the Duc de Guermantes there?\u201d \u201cAh! That I don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cyou don\u2019t know the Duc de Guermantes?\u201d \u201cAnd how should I not know him?\u201d replied M. de Charlus, his lips curving in a smile. This smile was ironical; but as the Baron was afraid of letting a gold tooth be seen, he stopped it with a reverse movement of his lips, so that the resulting sinuosity was that of a good-natured smile. \u201cWhy do you say: \u2018How should I not know him?\u2019 \u201c \u201cBecause he is my brother,\u201d said M. de Charlus carelessly, leaving Mme. Verdurin plunged in stupefaction and in the uncertainty whether her guest was making fun of her, was a natural son, or a son by another marriage. The idea that the brother of the Duc de Guermantes might be called Baron de Charlus never entered her head. She bore down upon me. \u201cI heard M. de Cambremer invite you to dinner just now. It has nothing to do with me, you understand. But for your own sake, I do hope you won\u2019t go. For one thing, the place is infested with bores. Oh! If you like dining with provincial Counts and Marquises whom nobody knows, you will be supplied to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d \u201cI think I shall be obliged to go there once or twice. I am not altogether free, however, for I have a young cousin whom I cannot leave by herself\u201d (I felt that this fictitious kinship made it easier for me to take Albertine about). \u201cBut as for the Cambremers, as I have been introduced to them. . . . \u201d \u201cYou shall do just as you please. One thing I can tell you: it\u2019s extremely unhealthy; when you have caught pneumonia, or a nice little chronic rheumatism, you\u2019ll be a lot better off!\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t the place itself very pretty?\u201d \u201cMmmmyess. . . . If you like. For my part, I confess frankly that I would a hundred times rather have the view from here over this valley. To begin with, if they\u2019d paid us I wouldn\u2019t have taken the other house because the sea air is fatal to M. Verdurin. If your cousin suffers at all from nerves. . . . But you yourself have bad nerves, I think you have choking fits. Very well! You shall see. Go there once, you won\u2019t sleep for a week after it; but it\u2019s not my business.\u201d And without thinking of the inconsistency with what she had just been saying: \u201cIf it would amuse you to see the house, which is not bad, pretty is too strong a word, still it is amusing with its old moat, and the old drawbridge, as I shall have to sacrifice myself and dine there once, very well, come that day, I shall try to bring all my little circle, then it will be quite nice. The day after to-morrow we are going to Harambouville in the carriage. It\u2019s a magnificent drive, the cider is delicious. Come with us. You, Brichot, you shall come too. And you too, Ski. That will make a party which, as a matter of fact, my husband must have arranged already. I don\u2019t know whom all he has invited, Monsieur de Charlus, are you one of them?\u201d The Baron, who had not heard the whole speech, and did not know that she was talking of an excursion to Harambouville, gave a start. \u201cA strange question,\u201d he murmured in a mocking tone by which Mme. Verdurin felt hurt. \u201cAnyhow,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbefore you dine with the Cambremers, why not bring her here, your cousin? Does she like conversation, and clever people? Is she pleasant? Yes, very well then. Bring her with you. The Cambremers aren\u2019t the only people in the world. I can understand their being glad to invite her, they must find it difficult to get anyone. Here she will have plenty of fresh air, and lots of clever men. In any case, I am counting on you not to fail me next Wednesday. I heard you were having a tea-party at Rivebelle with your cousin, and M. de Charlus, and I forget who\u2019 else. You must arrange to bring the whole lot on here, it would be nice if you all came in a body. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to get here, the roads are charming; if you like I can send down for you. I can\u2019t imagine what you find attractive in Rivebelle, it\u2019s infested with mosquitoes. You are thinking perhaps of the reputation of the rock-cakes. My cook makes them far better. I can let you have them, here, Norman rock-cakes, the real article, and shortbread; I need say no more. Ah! If you like the filth they give you at Rivebelle, that I won\u2019t give you, I don\u2019t poison my guests, Sir, and even if I wished to, my cook would refuse to make such abominations and would leave my service. Those rock-cakes you get down there, you can\u2019t tell what they are made of. I knew a poor girl who got peritonitis from them, which carried her off in three days. She was only seventeen. It was sad for her poor mother,\u201d added Mme. Verdurin with a melancholy air beneath the spheres of her temples charged with experience and suffering. \u201cHowever, go and have tea at Rivebelle, if you enjoy being fleeced and flinging money out of the window. But one thing I beg of you, it is a confidential mission I am charging you with, on the stroke of six, bring all your party here, don\u2019t allow them to go straggling away by themselves. You can bring whom you please. I wouldn\u2019t say that to everybody. But I am sure that your friends are nice, I can see at once that we understand one another. Apart from the little nucleus, there are some very pleasant people coming on Wednesday. You don\u2019t know little Madame de Longpont. She is charming, and so witty, not in the least a snob, you will find, you\u2019ll like her immensely. And she\u2019s going to bring a whole troop of friends too,\u201d Mme. Verdurin added to shew me that this was the right thing to do and encourage me by the other\u2019s example. \u201cWe shall see which has most influence and brings most people, Barbe de Longpont or you. And then I believe somebody\u2019s going to bring Bergotte,\u201d she added with a vague air, this meeting with a celebrity being rendered far from likely by a paragraph which had appeared in the papers that morning, to the effect that the great writer\u2019s health was causing grave anxiety. \u201cAnyhow, you will see that it will be one of my most successful Wednesdays, I don\u2019t want to have any boring women. You mustn\u2019t judge by this evening, it has been a complete failure. Don\u2019t try to be polite, you can\u2019t have been more bored than I was, I thought myself it was deadly. It won\u2019t always be like to-night, you know! I\u2019m not thinking of the Cambremers, who are impossible, but I have known society people who were supposed to be pleasant, well, compared with my little nucleus, they didn\u2019t exist. I heard you say that you thought Swann clever. I must say, to my mind, his cleverness was greatly exaggerated, but without speaking of the character of the man, which I have always found fundamentally antipathetic, sly, underhand, I have often had him to dinner on Wednesdays. Well, you can ask the others, even compared with Brichot, who is far from being anything wonderful, a good assistant master, whom I got into the Institute, Swann was simply nowhere. He was so dull!\u201d And, as I expressed a contrary opinion: \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t want to say a word against him to you, since he was your friend, indeed he was very fond of you, he has spoken to me about you in the most charming way, but ask the others here if he ever said anything interesting, at our dinners. That, after all, is the supreme test. Well, I don\u2019t know why it was, but Swann, in my house, never seemed to come off, one got nothing out of him. And yet anything there ever was in him he picked up here.\u201d I assured her that he was highly intelligent. \u201cNo, you only think that, because you haven\u2019t known him as long as I have. One got to the end of him very soon. I was always bored to death by him.\u201d (Which may be interpreted: \u201cHe went to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles and the Guermantes and knew that I didn\u2019t.\u201d) \u201cAnd I can put up with anything, except being bored. That, I cannot and will not stand!\u201d Her horror of boredom was now the reason upon which Mme. Verdurin relied to explain the composition of the little group. She did not yet entertain duchesses because she was incapable of enduring boredom, just as she was unable to go for a cruise, because of sea-sickness. I thought to myself that what Mme. Verdurin said was not entirely false, and, whereas the Guermantes would have declared Brichot to be the stupidest man they had ever met, I remained uncertain whether he were not in reality superior, if not to Swann himself, at least to the other people endowed with the wit of the Guermantes who would have had the good taste to avoid and the modesty to blush at his pedantic pleasantries; I asked myself the question as though a fresh light might be thrown on the nature of the intellect by the answer that I should make, and with the earnestness of a Christian influenced by Port-Royal when he considers the problem of Grace. \u201cYou will see,\u201d Mme. Verdurin continued, \u201cwhen one has society people together with people of real intelligence, people of our set, that\u2019s where one has to see them, the society man who is brilliant in the kingdom of the blind, is only one-eyed here. Besides, the others don\u2019t feel at home any longer. So much so that I\u2019m inclined to ask myself whether, instead of attempting mixtures that spoil everything, I shan\u2019t start special evenings confined to the bores so as to have the full benefit of my little nucleus. However: you are coming again with your cousin. That\u2019s settled. Good. At any rate you will both find something to eat here. F\u00e9terne is starvation corner. Oh, by the way, if you like rats, go there at once, you will get as many as you want. And they will keep you there as long as you are prepared to stay. Why, you\u2019ll die of hunger. I\u2019m sure, when I go there, I shall have my dinner before I start. The more the merrier, you must come here first and escort me. We shall have high tea, and supper when we get back. Do you like apple-tarts? Yes, very well then, our chef makes the best in the world. You see, I was quite right when I told you that you were meant to live here. So come and stay. You know, there is far more room in the house than people think. I don\u2019t speak of it, so as not to let myself in for bores. You might bring your cousin to stay. She would get a change of air from Balbec. With this air here, I maintain I can cure incurables. I have cured them, I may tell you, and not only this time. For I have stayed quite close to here before, a place I discovered and got for a mere song, a very different style of house from their Raspelicre. I can shew you it if we go for a drive together. But I admit that even here the air is invigorating. Still, I don\u2019t want to say too much about it, the whole of Paris would begin to take a fancy to my little corner. That has always been my luck. Anyhow, give your cousin my message. We shall put you in two nice rooms looking over the valley, you ought to see it in the morning, with the sun shining on the mist! By the way, who is this Robert de Saint-Loup of whom you were speaking?\u201d she said with a troubled air, for she had heard that I was to pay him a visit at Donci\u00e8res, and was afraid that he might make me fail her. \u201cWhy not bring him here instead, if he\u2019s not a bore. I have heard of him from Morel; I fancy he\u2019s one of his greatest friends,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin with entire want of truth, for Saint-Loup and Morel were not even aware of one another\u2019s existence. But having heard that Saint-Loup knew M. de Charlus, she supposed that it was through the violinist, and wished to appear to know all about them. \u201cHe\u2019s not taking up medicine, by any chance, or literature? You know, if you want any help about examinations, Cottard can do anything, and I make what use of him I please. As for the Academy later on, for I suppose he\u2019s not old enough yet, I have several notes in my pocket. Your friend would find himself on friendly soil here, and it might amuse him perhaps to see over the house. Life\u2019s not very exciting at Donci\u00e8res. But you shall do just what you please, then you can arrange what you think best,\u201d she concluded, without insisting, so as not to appear to be trying to know people of noble birth, and because she always maintained that the system by which she governed the faithful, to wit despotism, was named liberty. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with you,\u201d she said, at the sight of M. Verdurin who, with gestures of impatience, was making for the wooden terrace that ran along the side of the drawing-room above the valley, like a man who is bursting with rage and must have fresh air. \u201cHas Saniette been annoying you again? But you know what an idiot he is, you have to resign yourself to him, don\u2019t work yourself up into such a state. I dislike this sort of thing,\u201d she said to me, \u201cbecause it is bad for him, it sends the blood to his head. But I must say that one would need the patience of an angel at times to put up with Saniette, and one must always remember that it is a charity to have him in the house. For my part I must admit that he\u2019s so gloriously silly, I can\u2019t help enjoying him. I dare say you heard what he said after dinner: \u2018I can\u2019t play whist, but I can the piano.\u2019 Isn\u2019t it superb? It is positively colossal, and incidentally quite untrue, for he knows nothing at all about either. But my husband, beneath his rough exterior, is very sensitive, very kind-hearted, and Saniette\u2019s self-centred way of always thinking about the effect he is going to make drives himcrazy. Come, dear, calm yourself, you know Cottard told you that it was bad for your liver. And it is I that will have to bear the brunt of it all,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin. \u201cTo-morrow Saniette will come back all nerves and tears. Poor man, he is very ill indeed. Still, that is no reason why he should kill other people. Besides, even at times when he is in pain, when one would like to be sorry for him, his silliness hardens one\u2019s heart. He is really too stupid. You have only to tell him quite politely that these scenes make you both ill, and he is not to come again, since that\u2019s what he\u2019s most afraid of, it will have a soothing effect on his nerves,\u201d Mme. Verdurin whispered to her husband\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One could barely make out the sea from the windows on the right. But those on the other side shewed the valley, now shrouded in a snowy cloak of moonlight. Now and again one heard the voices of Morel and Cottard. \u201cYou have a trump?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAh! You\u2019re in luck, you are,\u201d said M. de Cambremer to Morel, in answer to his question, for he had seen that the doctor\u2019s hand was full of trumps. \u201cHere comes the lady of diamonds,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s a trump, you know? My trick. But there isn\u2019t a Sorbonne any longer,\u201d said the doctor to M. de Cambremer; \u201cthere\u2019s only the University of Paris.\u201d M. de Cambremer confessed his inability to understand why the doctor made this remark to him. \u201cI thought you were talking about the Sorbonne,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cI heard you say: tu nous la sors bonne,\u201d he added, with a wink, to shew that this was meant for a pun. \u201cJust wait a moment,\u201d he said, pointing to his adversary, \u201cI have a Trafalgar in store for him.\u201d And the prospect must have been excellent for the doctor, for in his joy his shoulders began to shake rapturously with laughter, which in his family, in the \u2018breed\u2019 of the Cottards, was an almost zoological sign of satisfaction. In the previous generation the gesture of rubbing the hands together as though one were soaping them used to accompany this movement. Cottard himself had originally employed both forms simultaneously, but one fine day, nobody ever knew by whose intervention, wifely, professorial perhaps, the rubbing of the hands had disappeared. The doctor even at dominoes, when he got his adversary on the run, and made him take the double six, which was to him the keenest of pleasures, contented himself with shaking his shoulders. And when \u2014 which was as seldom as possible \u2014 he went down to his native village for a few days, and met his first cousin, who was still at the hand-rubbing stage, he would say to Mme. Cottard on his return: \u201cI thought poor Ren\u00e9 very common.\u201d \u201cHave you the little dee-ar?\u201d he said, turning to Morel. \u201cNo? Then I play this old David.\u201d \u201cThen you have five, you have won!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great victory, Doctor,\u201d said the Marquis. \u201cA Pyrrhic victory,\u201d said Cottard, turning to face the Marquis and looking at him over his glasses to judge the effect of his remark. \u201cIf there is still time,\u201d he said to Morel, \u201cI give you your revenge. It is my deal. Ah! no, here come the carriages, it will have to be Friday, and I shall shew you a trick you don\u2019t see every day.\u201d M. and Mme. Verdurin accompanied us to the door. The Mistress was especially coaxing with Saniette so as to make certain of his returning next time. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look to me as if you were properly wrapped up, my boy,\u201d said M. Verdurin, whose age allowed him to address me in this paternal tone. \u201cOne would say the weather had changed.\u201d These words filled me with joy, as though the profoundly hidden life, the uprising of different combinations which they implied in nature, hinted at other changes, these occurring in my own life, and created fresh possibilities in it. Merely by opening the door upon the park, before leaving, one felt that a different \u2018weather\u2019 had, at that mo-merit, taken possession of the scene; cooling breezes, one of the joys of summer, were rising in the fir plantation (where long ago Mme. de Cambremer had dreamed of Chopin) and almost imperceptibly, in caressing coils, capricious eddies, were beginning their gentle nocturnes. I declined the rug which, on subsequent evenings, I was to accept when Albertine was with me, more to preserve the secrecy of my pleasure than to avoid the risk of cold. A vain search was made for the Norwegian philosopher. Had he been seized by a colic? Had he been afraid of missing the train? Had an aeroplane come to fetch him? Had he been carried aloft in an Assumption? In any case he had vanished without anyone\u2019s noticing his departure, like a god. \u201cYou are unwise,\u201d M. de Cambremer said to me, \u201cit\u2019s as cold as charity.\u201d \u201cWhy charity?\u201d the doctor inquired. \u201cBeware of choking,\u201d the Marquis went on. \u201cMy sister never goes out at night. However, she is in a pretty bad state at present. In any case you oughtn\u2019t to stand about bare-headed, put your tile on at once.\u201d \u201cThey are not frigorifie chokings,\u201d said Cottard sententiously. \u201cOh, indeed!\u201d M. de Cambremer bowed. \u201cOf course, if that\u2019s your opinion. . . . \u201d \u201cOpinions of the press!\u201d said the doctor, smiling round his glasses. M. de Cambremer laughed, but, feeling certain that he was in the right, insisted: \u201cAll the same,\u201d he said, \u201cwhenever my sister goes out after dark, she has an attack.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no use quibbling,\u201d replied the doctor, regardless of his want of manners. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t practise medicine by the seaside, unless I am called in for a consultation. I am here on holiday.\u201d He was perhaps even more on holiday than he would have liked. M. de Cambremer having said to him as they got into the carriage together: \u201cWe are fortunate in having quite close to us (not on your side of the Day, on the opposite side, but it is quite narrow at that point) another medical celebrity, Doctor du Boulbon,\u201d Cottard, who, as a rule, from \u2018deontology,\u2019 abstained from criticising his colleagues, could not help exclaiming, as he had exclaimed to me on the fatal day when we had visited the little casino: \u201cBut he is not a doctor. He practises \u2018a literary medicine, it is all fantastic therapeutics, charlatanism. All the same, we are on quite good terms. I should take the boat and go over and pay him a visit, if I weren\u2019t leaving.\u201d But, from the air which Cottard assumed in speaking of du Boulbon to M. de Cambremer, I felt that the boat which he would gladly have taken to call upon him would have greatly resembled that vessel which, in order to go and ruin the waters discovered by another literary doctor, Virgil (who took all their patients from them as well), the doctors of Salerno had chartered, but which sank with them on the voyage. \u201cGood-bye, my dear Saniette, don\u2019t forget to come to-morrow, you know how my husband enjoys seeing you. He enjoys your wit, your intellect; yes indeed, you know quite well, he takes sudden moods, but he can\u2019t live without seeing you. It\u2019s always the first thing he asks me: \u2018Is Saniette coming? I do so enjoy seeing him.\u2019\u201d \u201cI never said anything of the sort,\u201d said M. Verdurin to Saniette with a feigned frankness which seemed perfectly to reconcile what the Mistress had just said with the manner in which he treated Saniette. Then looking at his watch, doubtless so as not to prolong the leave-taking in the damp night air, he warned the coachmen not to lose any time, but to be careful when going down the hill, and assured us that we should be in plenty of time for our train. This was to set down the faithful, one at one station, another at another, ending with myself, for no one else was going as far as Balbec, and beginning with the Cambremers. They, so as not to bring their horses all the way up to la Raspeli\u00e8re at night, took the train with us at Douville-F\u00e9terne. The station nearest to them was indeed not this, which, being already at some distance from the village, was farther still from the mansion, but la Sogne. On arriving at the station of Douville-F\u00e9terne, M. de Cambremer made a point of giving a \u2018piece,\u2019 as Fran\u00e7oise used to say, to the Verdurins\u2019 coachman (the nice, sensitive coachman, with melancholy thoughts), for M. de Cambremer was generous, and in that respect took, rather, \u2018after his mamma.\u2019 But, possibly because his \u2018papa\u2019s\u2019 strain intervened at this point, he felt a scruple, or else that there might be a mistake \u2014 either on his part, if, for instance, in the dark, he were to give a you instead of a franc, or on the recipient\u2019s who might not perceive the importance of the present that was being given him. And so he drew attention to it: \u201cIt is a franc I\u2019m giving you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said to the coachman, turning the coin until it gleamed in the lamplight, and so that the faithful might report his action to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cIsn\u2019t it? Twenty sous is right, as it\u2019s only a short drive.\u201d He and Mme. de Cambremer left us at la Sogne. \u201cI shall tell my sister,\u201d he repeated to me, \u201cthat you have choking fits, I am sure she will be interested.\u201d I understood that he meant: \u2018will be pleased.\u2019 As for his wife, she employed, in saying good-bye to me, two abbreviations which, even in writing, used to shock me at that time in a letter, although one has grown accustomed to them since, but which, when spoken, seem to me to-day even to contain in their deliberate carelessness, in their acquired familiarity, something insufferably pedantic: \u201cPleased to have met you,\u201d she said to me; \u201cgreetings to Saint-Loup, if you see him.\u201d In making this speech, Mme. de Cambremer pronounced the name \u2018Saint-Loupe.\u2019 I have never discovered who had pronounced it thus in her hearing, or what had led her to suppose that it ought to be so pronounced. However it may be, for some weeks afterwards, she continued to say \u2018Saint-Loupe\u2019 and a man who had a great admiration for her and echoed her in every way did the same. If other people said \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 they would insist, would say emphatically \u2018Saint-Loupe,\u2019 whether to teach the others an indirect lesson or to be different from them. But, no doubt, women of greater brilliance than Mme. de Cambremer told her, or gave her indirectly to understand that this was not the correct pronunciation, and that what she regarded as a sign of originality was a mistake which would make people think her little conversant with the usages of society, for shortly afterwards Mme. de Cambremer was again saying \u2018Saint-Lou,\u2019 and her admirer similarly ceased to hold out, whether because she had lectured him, or because he had noticed that she no longer sounded the final consonant, and had said to himself that if a woman of such distinction, energy and ambition had yielded, it must have been on good grounds. The worst of her admirers was her husband. Mme. de Cambremer loved to tease other people in a way that was often highly impertinent. As soon as she began to attack me, or anyone else, in this fashion, M. de Cambremer would start watching her victim, laughing the while. As the Marquis had a squint \u2014 a blemish which gives an effect of wit to the mirth even of imbeciles \u2014 the effect of this laughter was to bring a segment of pupil into the otherwise complete whiteness of his eye. So a sudden rift brings a patch of blue into an otherwise clouded sky. His monocle moreover protected, like the glass over a valuable picture, this delicate operation. As for the actual intention of his laughter, it was hard to say whether it was friendly: \u201cAh! You rascal! You\u2019re in an enviable position, aren\u2019t you. You have won the favour of a lady who has a pretty wit!\u201d Or coarse: \u201cWell, Sir, I hope you\u2019ll learn your lesson, you\u2019ve got to eat a slice of humble pie.\u201d Or obliging: \u201cI\u2019m here, you know, I take it with a laugh because it\u2019s all pure fun, but I shan\u2019t let you be ill-treated.\u201d Or cruelly accessory: \u201cI don\u2019t need to add my little pinch of salt, but you can see, I\u2019m revelling in all the insults she is showering on you.

Down in the Ocean: Part 1\n\n2. Down in the Ocean: Part 2\n\n3. Down In The Ocean...Up In The Stars 4. Universe Sanctuary\n\n5. Stars Light\u205fStar\n6.\u205f666\u205f\u271d 666\n\n7. Space\u205fRip\n\n\"this book belongs\u205fto the most rare of men. Perhaps not one of them is yet alive. First the day after tomorrow must come for me. Some men are born posthumously.\" F.N.\n\nDown In The Ocean: Part 1\n\nWalking on the sand they could feel th\u0435 hot, sun- kissed spectacles of sand stabbing th\u0435ir feet. Amplified by the sun's \u0435nergy after taking off their footw\u0435ar, the four friends hurried to grab a spot closest to the water. \"Let's get in!\", the youngest said as he removed his shirt and ran to the water. The other three joined him and felt the icy cold seawater as they submerged their feet lightly in the\n\nwater. \"On three\", the eldest said as he grabbed the other two girls' hands and one of the girls grabbed the youngest boys' hand. \"One...two...three!\" they shouted, and found them falling down into the blue deep.\n\nDown in the ocean they fell, passing families of fish and monsters that lived in the different levels of watery hell. As they fell deeper, the sunlight began to slowly disappear until there was only a black void. But suddenly, a beautiful colored city came into full view at the deepest part of the ocean. Although foreign to the group of friends, they felt welcomed by the colorful, neon city. Coral buildings lit up as if emblazoned by crimson, sapphire, and emerald stones. They were amazed and in awe at the sight. Then, as if an earthquake from an invader, the city began to be destroyed in the near distance.\n\nRazor-sharp teeth mixed with an unknown vengeance, tore the city of neon and light, having no mercy and no shame. As the lights began to fade, only death and destruction was left behind. Once again, the four friends encountered a black oblivion and so they decided to investigate.\n\nWalking around the barren city, they noticed another disturbing sight. In the ocean, like on the earth's terrain, there are black sinkholes of mystery. Leading to the unknown, nobody knew where these pits end. The four friends embraced courage and bravery and decided to step over the edge of the black pit, leaving their fate in the hands of the unknown.\n\n\n\nA familiar sensation washed over them in the black sea: stomach turning and flipping sensations of falling. Thinking this led on forever, their assumptions were dashed away when they felt the suddenness of solid ground. In another height dimension they looked up and saw a distant faint light shining down. Sunlight, hope, and love. Although they were in the unknown, they still had hope on their side. (star)\n\nWhen they looked around, they saw a desert made up of sand. Endless miles of sand and dunes made up this level of sea-hell. They then noticed a minuscule creature approaching them. A creature of the deep who was familiar with the depths introduced himself. \"Hello friends, I am the leader of the deep ocean. You can call me plankton. Don't be worried as all species of plankton go by this name, but if you want a specific name for me you may choose as you desire.\", he reassured.\n\n\"Um, hello there Mr. Plankton. What was all that about up there? A mysterious creature destroyed the entire beautiful city of neon colors. Why would he do such a thing?\", the eldest boy asked. \"Ah, the monster, Angler. Pay him no mind. You must venture on to find the secrets of the deep sea and the universe. You will find a glorious underwater paradise.\", he replied. \"Underwater paradise? But-\" the elder replied back but suddenly with a snap, Mr. Plankton disappeared, leaving only a pile of salty dust behind.\nAfter contemplating for a few moments, the four friends decided to listen to Mr. Plankton's advice and\n\n\n\nventured onward. Venture on to where, however, they didn't understand, but they moved forward continuing their adventure. They walked along the sand-desert terrain. Endless hills and dunes of sand particles after another they saw. \"What's the point of this?\", the youngest boy screamed out.\n\nOne of the girls replied with, \"maybe there's no point of this. Maybe this is a dream. An illusion.\". The youngest boy looked annoyed but kept on walking.\n\nWalking,\n\nand walking,\n\nand walking.\n\nOn and on.\n\nA never ending walk...\n\nWhy not running? Malnutrition and weakness would catch up to them and so the group kept going without stopping. Through their pain and boredom of never ending hills, they went on.\n\nIn the corner of their eyes, they noticed a twinkling light of hope. Shifting their bodies and heads, they noticed the twinkling gold light like a star in the distance. As they walked toward it they found themselves picking up speed until they were sprinting. 10 feet away...5 feet...and they were just about to grasp it when,\n\ndown_freefall\n\n\nDown, deeper. Around them they were falling in an endless darkness.\n\n\"This is what death must feel like.\" the youngest shouted and suddenly, Mr. Plankton appeared and was free falling alongside them. But this was not the Mr. Plankton they thought of. Instead, the ghost of Mr. Plankton was falling with them. He told them, \"don't be fooled my friends for the underwater paradise is not of light, but of darkness...\", and he disappeared once again.\n\nFeeling like an endless fall, the friends looked up, hoping for some helpful intervention or a sign of anything to help them...\n\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\nOnly the shimmer of a distant star shined from above. Unknown if it was a planet or a star body, the only sign of hope in their minds one last time until\n\nBANG!\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nA collision...\n\n*somewhere in this universe, a collision of human and planet occurred... A long hibernation followed.*\n\n\n\nDown in the Ocean: Part 2\n\nWaiting... Waiting... Waiting...\n\nAsteroids glazed by, passing by, slowly, watching the still planet. As time passed away, the asteroids did too.\n\nBreaking up into pieces and returning to the universe from where they came from.\n\nIn the watery space of the sea at the bottom of the ocean, planets lay alone. Lying dormant and waiting for the right time.\n\nLong ago, when the bodies landed on the ocean floor, the universe was birthed. With their dormancy, time passed and left behind a shadowy figure of its former self. The universe; tired and worn out from the status quo. The universe and divine realm was promised with love and harmony. In the human world, however, great masses of ignorance, hatred, and violence remained leaving behind a cold winter devoid of warmth.\n\nWhen things remain the same for too long, something must change. In all cycles, there is an end. The fruits of willing ignorance have been consumed for too long and now the universe and the planet of life are worn out. Sick of the willing ignorance that people live in day to day, associating with what does not matter: negativity.\n\nThere is a star among these four planets at the bottom of the sea. In the watery habitat he remained dormant and asleep for a short period of time. Asleep, but not dead. Granted with the task of saving the planet, he was ignored. The negative and hatred had consumed all life and positivity.\n\nThe humans think negatively in groups and with group comes unpredictable power and with negativity combined with power comes destruction. They desired hatred,\n\n\n\nignorance, and destruction and that was what the universe granted them.\n\nThis is the beginning of the end.\n\nThe angel lay dormant and then died. In death, he found reincarnation as an asteroid in the sea. The angel, rebirthed as this creature floated and swam up to the top to witness the demons' wish.\n\nThe element of fire contains great power. It grants the power of destruction and also love. Fire is one of the many blessings and curses in this universe. With his spirit of light he witnessed the power of the element. Not letting the evil overtake him, the universe asked him \"To live or to die?\". The angel chose to live but also to die. With this wish it was granted.\n\nFalling... Down...\n\nInto the deep...\n\nThe brightness of the fire slowly dissipated, leaving death and destruction, corpse and bone like the people were promised in its place. Like the fire, the light in his spirit disappeared and died.\n\n\n\nDown in the Ocean...Up in the\n\nStars\n\nWhat is your paradise?\n\n\n\nIs it traveling the world with your loved one? Doing what you love as a job? How about watching the whole world fall apart in front of your eyes?\n\nTwo lovers walked along the sand, gazing into the distance. \"Let's build a boat and travel the world\", one said. The other replied with \"okay\" and a smile. Holding hands, they built the boat with their bare hands, stopping only to admire their art. At last they finished and they kicked off from the shore, waving goodbye to nobody, only their beloved home.\n\nIn the middle of the ocean, the air began to get hot. Hotter and hotter it got and when some water from the sea splashed onto the lovers' skin, they winced. Boiling hot, but why?\n\nWith the boiling temperature, the sky became intense with thunder and ash-filled clouds. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of the attic from the past, the soot-like clouds were haunting and were only a prelude of what was to come.\n\nThousands of miles away, the lovers heard a loud explosion and with a great force, they were knocked off of their feet with a powerful shockwave. \"Look!\", cried one of the lovers as he pointed to the distance.\n\nA wall. A liquid wall of blood coming to knock them out. The ocean had turned blood-red and tsunami-like and was coming to destroy. Before the lovers were washed away into nothing, the sky opened up and through the opening they witnessed a bright light; a single glimmer of hope.\n\n\n\nLike the couples, people from all over the world saw this phenomenon of light and saw a ghostly spirit ascending. It looked like a dead or sleeping body being abducted by extraterrestrials, except the people of earth did not understand what was going on.\n\n*\n\nIf they only knew\n\n*\n\nUnder the ocean's surface, the dead fish remained\n\ndeceased. Then, it began to rise as a bright light shined upon the boy. Up and up and up, all through the different levels of hell he rose. As he was pulled out of the water, his body became human again but still dead. Above the bleeding sea he rose, through the small opening in the stormy clouds. Faster than a millisecond, the gap closed, and the planet was granted its wicked wish by the universe.\n\nAs he passed through the atmosphere, he shed his earthly vessel and was left as a sole soul; the original form. The soul opened its eyes to see the universe phenomenon that he always desired to see since the beginning. Earth was now covered in darkness and floating before him. He saw the crater-faced moon, a comet and asteroid passersby, and the life-giving brightest star in the solar system. Gazing at the sun and feeling its rays shine through him, he felt warmly at peace.\n\n\n\nWith the soul's human life behind him, he was ready to explore the deep caverns and secrets of the universe. Although he could not control his soul, he placed full trust that the universe would deliver him where he needed to go.\n\nblack holes, moon comet, planet\n\nunknown entity, father figure light chaser, dimension life host\n\nour universe is large but small infinite but finite immortal but mortal\n\n...\n\n*\n\n\n\nUniverse Sanctuary\n\n\"Hear the planets sing, feel the intense energy. Deliver him from...\"\n\nAs the soul floated throughout the infinite field of bright stars and darkness, he had flashbacks of his human childhood. To be more specific, his old childhood bedroom.\n\nIn his old bedroom, on the walls lay tiny white spectacles on solid black background: a two dimensional image of space. He also remembered the buzzing pest that was flying and buzzing nonstop around his habitat. With a light swat, its life ceased to exist onto the universe wallpaper and now as a single fly, he flew in the actual third dimension of space. The third dimension, where he saw elders and children, births and deaths of magnificent proportions...\n\nAs he floated past Aries, asteroids of chaos, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Gemini, Pisces, Scorpio, and another set of asteroids, he approached the entrance of his whole life and in the far distance he saw the creator of life and light, the brightest star in the solar system, start to slowly fade away.\n\nGoing into the unknown territory of the quiet and lonely universe can be frightening to mortals but to all immortal souls there is no such thing as fear. Minds clouded in dark clouds can't see what's on the other side of the fence, the other side of the coin, the void of the unknown.\n\nWhile the universe grants gifts, it doesn't grant its gems to negative vessels of energy. Sometimes, it takes a lifetime in order for the universe to grant the desired wishes it receives.\n\n\n\nEverything you desire is at your fingertips, even on the three dimensional plane,\n\nHowever,\n\nit takes inner work and inner searching in order to access these gifts.\n\n\n\nThe planets, each with their own unique personalities said goodbye to the soul with love. As the soul received these gifts of knowledge and heart, he finally felt at peace. Like sudden death, goodbyes can be difficult, but they are necessary in order to find what one is looking for: the knowledge and knowing of the infinite and truth.\n\nWith this goodbye, another approached. The universe knew that he had the tools in order to go beyond and so with this realization it granted him full control. His individual will power was granted and with that, he left the Milky Way Galaxy for good.\n\nKnowing that this had always been his dream, he was ready to explore many new adventures of infinite; infinite immortal adventures to learn hidden secrets. Finally, he left this sanctuary of peace and life in order to endure another sanctuary.\n\nAs the soul finally knew, the universe is the soul and the soul is the universe. Every soul comes to this revelation when they awaken again. The revelation that the soul is everywhere and nowhere all at once. In every dimension, every place of time, space, and event, the soul is there.\n\n\n\n*\n\nthe one soul inside all humans makes up the soul of the divine universe\n\n*\n\n\n\nStars Light Star\n\n\"Silently\n\none by one\n\nin the infinite meadows of heaven blossomed the lovely stars,\n\nthe forget-me-nots of the angels\" - H.W.L.\n\nAs his parents finished the bedtime story, they said goodnight and turned out the lights. The boy lay in his bed under the covers and watched the ceiling. Twinkling bright lights, star-like, twinkled back at him. He was always amazed whenever he would look outside and see the real phenomenon; the real bright stars. As he closed his eyes and dreamed, he dreamt of the biggest star in the entire universe. Bigger than the earth, the moon, and even the sun combined. He floated around this great mass and watched it as if he were in a movie in awe at each twinkling occurrence on its surface.\n\nWhen the boy grew up he desired more than ever to someday travel amongst the stars and see the biggest star with his own eyes...\n\n...so he did.\n\n\n\n3333 A.D.\n\nDrifting through the 3D plane of space, the ship floated seamlessly. News of a star, a star bigger than the sun came about when strange frequencies signaled to earth from the area. NASA quickly announced the discovery to the public and shortly after sent a space probe to investigate. As the probe got closer and closer to its goal, strange frequencies interfered and the probe slowly began to experience a full mechanical failure. However, through the use of a camera, it managed to capture a sight that was beyond what humans ever witnessed with their eyes before it died: millions of small solar flares of every color from the color spectrum danced in the atmosphere. Surrounding the massive star, it was like an angel-kissed phenomenon.\n\nThe non-controllable probe drifted until it was consumed entirely and destroyed by this star of color and light. NASA and the world amazed at what secrets the star may have, began funding a spacecraft that could travel light years. 3000 light years to be exact. As this began 100 years prior to the space voyage, it took 100 years to finally\n\n\n\ncomplete (or 100 years to retrieve it from a secret location on Earth? The world and history might never know...).\n\nIn January, 3333 A.D., S.C. LIGHT took off from earth. In an instant, the craft was in the galaxy of the bright star and set out to search for it. It took a couple of days until S.C. LIGHT found the multiple colored specks of solar flares floating around them. What they soon found was that the flares floated through the ship and when the crew touched the flares, they did not hurt; they burst into manifestations of bright light and then disappeared.\n\nThese solar flares did not hurt them nor the ship when they touched. Wondering where this bright star was and why they couldn't see it if they were around its solar flare specks, the crew got into their space suits and began to do a space walk outside.\n\nThrough the pressurized exit they left but to their horror, they found themselves floating through empty space. Flipping and doing contortions, they feared their lives would end, but something strange happened.\n\nThe crew stopped floating chaotically and stopped upright in relation to the spaceship. It was almost like they could walk even though there was no solid ground. In other words, they could walk in space. In front of their eyes, a small ball of light was floating. Out of nowhere, it began to spiral around itself in the form of Fibonacci's spiral.\n\nIt kept spiraling until it was the size circumferentially of six suns. As it spiraled to its enormous size, the crew suddenly found themselves many millions of miles away\n\n\n\nand were amazed again. The light at the center of the spiral burst to become the real planet.\n\nRainbows upon rainbows of colors burst into formation. The crew thought they would die because of the heat or get blinded by the bright light, but it was almost as if they were given permission by this great mass to live.\n\nWhen the star was fully formed, it sent a message to each of the humans witnessing it telepathically:\n\n\"Anything and Everything, Infinite and Immortal you have become. Think and it's yours.\n\nI am all of your desires and fears.\"\n\nWhen it finished communicating its message, a portal on the star opened up. In less than a second, the crew were sucked in and it closed behind them.\n\nWhite oblivion: the opposite of an oblivious afterlife. The group were now in an all white landscape. As they walked forward and took each stop, they could feel and see vibrations. One of them thought of the message they received: anything that they thought of could and would be theirs and they could manifest anything.\n\nThe first woman thought of strawberry ice cream in a cone. In an instant, the sweet ice cream in a cone was in hands. The second woman thought of a tall oak tree and in front of them, a tree sprouted from the white ground. One of the men dreamed of something bigger: another\n\n\n\nspacecraft so that they could easily return home. The other man with a brave might, thought of a wormhole to travel anywhere he wanted to in the infinite universe. In an instant, a cloudy mist that looked like a portal formed in front of them. Outsmarting the third, he thought of the wormhole traveling back to earth so he could go home. He then walked through the cloudy mist and found himself back on earth, but something was different...\n\n\n\nDEATH\n\nDead bodies everywhere. Even though he was protected from dying he could feel the heat of cities burning all over the earth. He could feel the earth itself physically burning.\n\nThe man ended up on a beach somewhere he did not recognize but he did notice black smoke rising into the atmosphere more inland. Along with the black smoke, there were black clouds covering the entire planet. As if the scene couldn't get any more dreadful, he noticed the disturbing ocean.\n\nArtery blood-red. It was as if blood had taken the place of water. Out of nowhere the sky crackled and a thick lightning bolt struck the ocean. With this strike, the ocean receded from the beach into a massive wall and became a tsunami.\n\nHowever, if did not crash into land. The tsunami formed a wall and then the wall began to travel outward towards the sea. The beach was no more, only miles and miles of sand. The man heard six explosions, then the sky became night: a night of black clouds, black smoke, and fire.\n\nRemembering his powers, he imagined himself back inside the rainbow-colored star. He opened his eyes and found himself back at once.\n\nAfter witnessing the horrors back on earth, he told the two women and other man about it. They began to be frightened and began to worry if they would ever have a\n\n\n\nhome again. After they thought worrying thoughts they received another message from the star being they were inside of.\n\n\"Please do not fear. Earth is destroyed. There are four survivors. You four have the tools,\n\nin order to create a new world.\n\nI must tell you however, there is a fifth survivor. But not in the current form...\n\nA survivor.\n\nA light bearer.\n\nAn angel.\n\nYou four must search for him\n\nAnd you will be able to create a new world based on,\n\nLove, Peace, and Harmony.\"\n\nAfter receiving this message, the four humans decided to search for this unknown angel who would help them form a new world without evil.\n\n\n\n666 \u271d 666\n\n\"The __________ will be the infernal ______ again for the\n\nthird and last time...\n\nSoon, many evils shall be committed by the means of _____, the infernal ______, that almost the entire world shall be found undone and desolate.\n\nBefore these events happen, many rare birds will cry in the air, \"Now!

The man thought about dimension and space and time. To the right of his bed was another bed that came furnished with the house. He usually put his things on that bed since it took up space in his room. He heard the sound of something hit the ground and became unsettled by it and began to think of something strange: What if it instead fell on the wall or in mid-air and made that same sound? The man stepped his foot on the ground and just above the bed to his right came a rip in space.\n\nAs he touched his right foot on the ground, he saw his foot hanging in midair coming through the rip. He then stood up with both feet on the floor and a magnificent phenomenon happened: He found that his other foot fell through and after a couple of seconds, he saw his body falling through the ground into the floor. Almost bewildered at what had happened, the rip in space was still floating in front of him but he didn't know what to do with it. It only showed a black void of space so he grasped the edges of the rip, peered through, and was amazed at what was there.\n\nThe universe is a complex thing made up of many complex ideas. There are written essays, history, life, and time in the universe and also humans. Beings unknown also contribute to the complexity of the universe. To describe the sights inside the space is easy: knowledge. The boy saw many man-made objects like the telescope, a solar system model, and even a diagram of the human body. Along with all of these pieces of knowledge, he also saw every piece of art ever created by humanity.\n\nAmong the art pieces, he saw the pyramids from Egypt, every church built, and every piece of art. Any human creation was in this rip in space.\n\nDown_\n\n_he fell into a never ending black void and as he fell down, each artistic piece and creation was shown in front of him from the first ever created to the most recent. It seems like it would take years to take in all this information but it was consumed in less than a second. Then, he finally knew the purpose of all of this.\n\nAfter the most recent art creation, he was surrounded by a black void again as he falling and eventually, everything started to slow down and he noticed that his falling sensation came to a conclusion. Then, he saw in front of him, his own body asleep on his bed. He knew he was on his bed for he was wearing the clothes that he was wearing before he ventured into the space rip. The boy looked content and at peace while he was asleep.\n\nAfter watching himself sleep, he called out \"Milky Way Galaxy\" and his sleeping body disappeared and was instantly shown the great size of the actual Milky Way Galaxy (true to size) floating in front of him. He then called out \"Pyramids of Giza\" and the ancient pyramids formed out of nothing in front of him. The boy called out \"Universe\" and all around him, little lights twinkled on and he could see forever. He eventually called out \"Home\" and was again shown his human body lying asleep. The boy then reached out to his sleeping body and touched it and was amazed at the sight of what happened.\n\nWhere he touched, beautiful light glowed on the sleeping skin and his sleeping self awoke and was staring back at him. They both floated in this black void but were independent of each other. They locked eyes and saw the past, present, and future of history and time. The version of himself staring back and his actual self touched their hands to communicate. Feelings of love, anger, fear, happiness, and every other emotion felt up to that point were communicated all at once and then they let go. The former sleeping version mouthed \"Come on\" and the next thing he knew, he was being pulled up, up past the creations of art, up above it all. He waved his hand and the next thing he knew everything was surrounding him and floating around the two like moons and planets.\n\nOut of nowhere, the rip in space became again and\n\nhe could see his bedroom wall. When he was about to leave, his former sleeping self gave him an object but it was only a ball of light, and then he said, \"You'll see\"\n\nwhich was audible this time. They then hugged and embraced each other meaningfully and his former sleeping self became one with him and he floated up into his room and onto the ground. The ball of light took the form of a black book, black pages and all. Inside the book there was every single creation of art in the entire course of history that he witnessed in the black void and on the last page was his name signed in gold on a blank black page. He took out a white crayon and drew a sleeping boy, like his former self. He also drew a bright yellow sun in the corner with rays shining down on himself and then he closed the book and filed it into his personal library.\n\nAfter all of that, he decided to go outside onto his private boat dock and ended up falling asleep, against the warmth of the sun's beating rays as the sun slept too, creating darkness\u2022\n\n\n\nBlack holes Comets\n\nUnknown entities Light chasers\n\nMoons Planets\n\nFather figures Dimension life hosts\n\nOUR LITTLE UNIVERSE\n\nWhen we change our perspective from earthly matters and stop searching for answers external,\n\nWe are surprised to find that OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE has always been within us...\n\n\n\nThe era of ignorance ends\n\nand,\n\nThe era of\n\n6\n\nbegins.\n\n\n\n6arrett7.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/188205", "artist_names": "Richard F.

Burton", "lyrics": "Arabian Nights, Vol. 3 (Chap. 13) LyricsTale Of Kamar Al Zaman\n\nThat there was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a King called Shahrim\u00e1n,[FN#220] who was lord of many troops and guards, and officers, and who reigned over certain islands, known as the Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n Islands,[FN#221] on the borders of the land of the Persians. But he was stricken in years and his bones were wasted, without having been blessed with a son, albeit he had four wives, daughters of Kings, and threescore concubines, with each of whom he was wont to lie one night in turn.[FN#222] This preyed upon his mind and disquieted him, so that he complained thereof to one of his Wazirs, saying, \"Verily I fear lest my kingdom be lost when I die, for that I have no son to succeed me.\" The Minister answered, \"O King, peradventure Allah shall yet bring something to pass; so rely upon the Almighty and be instant in prayer. It is also my counsel that thou spread a banquet and invite to it the poor and needy, and let them eat of thy food; and supplicate the Lord to vouchsafe thee a son; for perchance there may be among thy guests a righteous soul whose prayers find acceptance; and thereby thou shalt win thy wish.\" So the King rose, made the lesser ablution, and prayed a two-bow prayer,[FN#223] then he cried upon Allah with pure intention; after which he called his chief wife to bed and lay with her forthright. By grace of God she conceived and, when her months were accomplished, she bore a male child, like the moon on the night of fulness. The King named him Kamar al-Zam\u00e1n,[FN#224] and rejoiced in him with extreme joy and bade the city be dressed out in his honour; so they decorated the streets seven days, whilst the drums beat and the messengers bore the glad tidings abroad. Then wet and dry nurses were provided for the boy and he was reared in splendour and delight, until he reached the age of fifteen. He grew up of surpassing beauty and seemlihead and symmetry, and his father loved him so dear that he could not brook to be parted from him day or night. One day he complained to a certain of his Ministers anent the excess of his love for his only child, saying, \"O thou the Wazir, of a truth I fear for my son, Kamar al-Zaman, the shifts and accidents which befal man and fain would I marry him in my life-time.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O King, know thou that marriage is one of the most honourable of moral actions, and thou wouldst indeed do well and right to marry thy son in thy lifetime, ere thou make him Sultan.\" On this quoth the King, \"Hither with my son Kamar al-Zaman;\" so he came and bowed his head to the ground in modesty before his sire. \"O Kamar al Zaman,\" said King Shahriman, \"of a truth I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee during my lifetime.\" Replied he, \"O my father, know that I have no lust to marry nor cloth my soul incline to women; for that concerning their craft and perfidy I have read many books and heard much talk, even as saith the poet,\n\n'Now, an of women ask ye, I reply:\u2014*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affairs I'm versed a doctor rare!\nWhen man's head grizzles and his money dwindles, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affections he hath naught for share.'\n\nAnd another said:\u2014\n'Rebel against women and so shalt thou serve Allah the more; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The youth who gives women the rein must forfeit all hope to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     soar.\nThey'll baulk him when seeking the strange device, Excelsior, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tho' waste he a thousand of years in the study of science\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and lore.' \"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verses he continued, \"O my father, wedlock is a thing whereto I will never consent; no, not though I drink the cup of death.\" When Sultan Shahriman heard these words from his son, light became darkness in his sight and he grieved thereat with great grief.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman heard these words from his son, the light became darkness in his sight and he grieved over his son's lack of obedience to his directions in the matter of marriage; yet, for the great love he bore him, he was unwilling to repeat his wishes and was not wroth with him, but caressed him and spake him fair and showed him all manner of kindness such as tendeth to induce affection. All this, and Kamar al-Zaman increased daily in beauty and loveliness and amorous grace; and the King bore with him for a whole year till he became perfect in eloquence and elegant wit. All men were ravished with his charms; and every breeze that blew bore the tidings of his gracious favour; his fair sight was a seduction to the loving and a garden of delight to the longing, for he was honey-sweet of speech and the sheen of his face shamed the full moon; he was a model of symmetry and blandishment and engaging ways; his shape was as the willow-wand or the rattan- cane and his cheeks might take the place of rose or red anemone. He was, in fine the pink of perfection, even as the poet hath said of him,\n\n\"He came and cried they, 'Now be Allah blest! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Praise Him that clad that soul in so fair vest!'\nHe's King of Beauty where the beauteous be; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All are his Ryots,[FN#225] all obey his hest:\nHis lip-dew's sweeter than the virgin honey; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His teeth are pearls in double row close press:\nAll charms are congregate in him alone, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And deals his loveliness to man unrest.\nBeauty wrote on those cheeks for worlds to see *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I testify there is none good but He.'\"[FN#226]\n\nWhen the year came to an end, the King called his son to him and said, \"O my son, wilt thou not hearken to me?\" Whereupon Kamar al-Zaman fell down for respect and shame before his sire and replied, \"O my father, how should I not hearken to thee, seeing that Allah commandeth me to obey thee and not gain-say thee?\" Rejoined King Shahriman, \"O my son, know that I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee whilst yet I live, and make thee King over my realm, before my death.\" When the Prince heard his sire pronounce these words he bowed his head awhile, then raised it and said, \"O my father, this is a thing which I will never do; no, not though I drink the cup of death! I know of a surety that the Almighty hath made obedience to thee a duty in religion; but, Allah upon thee! press me not in this matter of marriage, nor fancy that I will ever marry my life long; for that I have read the books both of the ancients and the moderns, and have come to know all the mischiefs and miseries which have befallen them through women and their endless artifices. And how excellent is the saying of the poet,\n'He whom the randy motts entrap *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall never see deliverance!\nThough build he forts a thousand-fold, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose mighty strength lead-plates enhance,[FN#227]\nTheir force shall be of no avail; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     These fortresses have not a chance!\nWomen aye deal in treachery *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To far and near o'er earth's expanse\nWith fingers dipt in Henna-blood *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And locks in braids that mad the glance;\nAnd eyelids painted o'er with Kohl *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  They gar us drink of dire mischance.'\n\nAnd how excellently saith another,\n\n'Women, for all the chastity they claim, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Are offal cast by kites where'er they list:\nThis night their talk and secret charms are shine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That night another joyeth calf and wrist:\nLike inn, whence after night thou far'st at dawn, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lodges other wight thou hast not wist.'\"[FN#228]\n\nNow when King Shahriman heard these his son's words and learnt the import of his verses and poetical quotations, he made no answer, of his excessive love for him, but redoubled in graciousness and kindness to him. He at once broke up the audience and, as soon as the seance was over, he summoned his Minister and taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir! tell me how I shall deal with my son in the matter of marriage.\"- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted stay.\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King summoned his Minister; and, taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir, tell me what I shall do with my son in the matter of marriage. Of a truth I took counsel with thee thereon and thou didst counsel me to marry him, before making him King. I have spoken with him of wedlock time after time and he still gainsaid me; so do thou, O Wazir, forthright advise me what to do.\" Answered the Minister, \"O King, wait another year and, if after that thou be minded to speak to him on the matter of marriage, speak not to him privily, but address him on a day of state, when all the Emirs and Wazirs are present with the whole of the army standing before thee. And when all are in crowd then send for thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and summon him; and, when he cometh, broach to him the matter of marriage before the Wazirs and Grandees and Officers of state and Captains; for he will surely be bashful and daunted by their presence and will not dare to oppose thy will.\" Now when King Shahriman heard his Wazir's words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, seeing success in the project, and bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour. Then he took patience with his son another year, whilst, with every day that passed over him, Kamar al-Zaman increased in beauty and loveliness, and elegance and perfect grace, till he was nigh twenty years old. Indeed Allah had clad him in the cloak of comeliness and had crowned him with the crown of completion: his eye-glance was more bewitching than H\u00e1r\u00fat and Mar\u00fat[FN#229] and the play of his luring looks more misleading than T\u00e1gh\u00fat;[FN#230] and his cheeks shone like the dawn rosy-red and his eyelashes stormed the keen-edged blade: the whiteness of his brow resembled the moon shining bright, and the blackness of his locks was as the murky night; and his waist was more slender than the gossamer[FN#231] and his back parts than two sand heaps bulkier, making a Babel of the heart with their softness; but his waist complained of the weight of his hips and loins; and his charms ravished all mankind, even as one of the poets saith in these couplets,\n\"By his eyelash tendril curled, by his slender waist I swear,\nBy the dart his witchery feathers, fatal hurtling through the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   air;\nBy the just roundness of his shape, by his glances bright and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   keen\nBy the swart limping of his locks, and his fair forehead shining\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sheen;\nBy his eyebrows which deny that she who looks on them should\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sleep,\nWhich now commanding, now forbidding, o'er me high dominion keep;\nBy the roses of his cheek, his face as fresh as myrtle wreath\nHis tulip lips, and those pure pearls that hold the places of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     teeth;\nBy his noble form, which rises featly turned in even swell\nTo where upon his jutting chest two young pomegranates seem to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   dwell\nBy his supple moving hips, his taper waist, the silky skin,\nBy all he robbed Perfection of, and holds enchained his form\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     within;\nBy his tongue of steadfastness, his nature true, and excellent,\nBy the greatness of his rank, his noble birth, and high descent,\nMusk from my love her savour steals, who musk exhales from every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     limb\nAnd all the airs ambergris breathes are but the Zephyr's blow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     o'er him.\nThe sun, methinks, the broad bright sun, as low before my love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     should quail\nAs would my love himself transcend the paltry paring of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     nail!\"[FN#232]\nSo King Shahriman, having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shahriman having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival, a day of state when the audience hall was filled with his Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of his reign and Officers of State and Captains of might and main. Thereupon he sent for his son Kamar al-Zaman who came, and kissing the ground before him three times, stood in presence of his sire with his hands behind his back the right grasping the left.[FN#233] Then said the King to him, \"Know O my son, that I have not sent for thee on this occasion and summoned thee to appear before this assembly and all these officers of estate here awaiting our orders save and except that I may lay a commandment on thee, wherein do thou not disobey me; and my commandment is that thou marry, for I am minded to wed thee to a King's daughter and rejoice in thee ere I die.\" When the Prince heard this much from his royal sire, he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then raising it towards his father and being moved thereto at that time by youthful folly and boyish ignorance, replied, \"But for myself I will never marry; no, not though I drink the cup of death! As for thee, thou art great in age and small of wit: hast thou not, twice ere this day and before this occasion, questioned me of the matter of marriage and I refused my consent? Indeed thou dotest and are not fit to govern a flock of sheep!\" So saying Kamar al-Zaman unclasped his hands from behind his back and tucked up his sleeves above his elbows before his father, being in a fit of fury; moreover, he added many words to his sire, knowing not what he said in the trouble of his spirits. The King was confounded and ashamed, for that this befel in the presence of his grandees and soldier-officers assembled on a high festival and a state occasion; but presently the majesty of Kingship took him, and he cried out at his son and made him tremble. Then he called to the guards standing before him and said, \"Seize him!' So they came forward and laid hands on him and, binding him, brought him before his sire, who bade them pinion his elbows behind his back and in this guise make him stand before the presence. And the Prince bowed down his head for fear and apprehension, and his brow and face were beaded and spangled with sweat; and shame and confusion troubled him sorely. Thereupon his father abused him and reviled him and cried, \"Woe to thee, thou son of adultery and nursling of abomination![FN#234] How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman cried out to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee. Knowest thou not that this deed thou hast done were a disgrace to him had it been done by the meanest of my subjects?\" And the King commanded his Mamelukes to loose his elbow bonds and imprison him in one of the bastions of the citadel. So they took the Prince and thrust him into an old tower, wherein there was a dilapidated saloon and in its middle a ruined well, after having first swept it and cleansed its floor-flags and set therein a couch on which they laid a mattress, a leathern rug and a cushion; and then they brought a great lanthorn and a wax candle, for that place was dark, even by day. And lastly the Mamelukes led Kamar al-Zaman thither, and stationed an eunuch at the door. And when all this was done, the Prince threw himself on the couch, sad-spirited, and heavy- hearted; blaming himself and repenting of his injurious conduct to his father, whenas repentance availed him naught, and saying, \"Allah curse marriage and marriageable and married women, the traitresses all! Would I had hearkened to my father and accepted a wife! Had I so done it had been better for me than this jail.\" This is how it fared with him; but as regards King Shahri man, he remained seated on his throne all through the day until sundown; then he took the Minister apart and said to him \"Know thou, O Wazir, that thou and thou only west the cause of all this that hath come to pass between me and my son by the advice thou west pleased to devise; and so what dost thou counsel me to do now?\" Answered he, \"O King, leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days: then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, said to King Shahriman, \"Leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days; then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\" The King accepted the Wazir's opinion and lay down to sleep that night troubled at heart concerning his son; for he loved him with dearest love because he had no other child but this; and it was his wont every night not to sleep, save after placing his arm under his son's neck. So he passed that night in trouble and unease on the Prince 's account, tossing from side to side, as he were laid on coals of Artemisia-wood[FN#235]: for he was overcome with doubts and fears and sleep visited him not all that livelong night; but his eyes ran over with tears and he began repeating, ;\n\n\"While slanderers slumber, longsome is my night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Suffice thee a heart so sad in parting-plight;\nI say, while night in care slow moments by, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'What! no return for thee, fair morning light?'\"\n\nAnd the saying of another,\n\n\"When saw I Pleiad-stars his glance escape *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And Pole star draught of sleep upon him pour;\nAnd the Bier-daughters[FN#236] wend in mourning dight, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I knew that morning was for him no more!\"\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, when the night came upon him the eunuch set the lanthorn before him and lighting the wax-candle, placed it in the candlestick; then brought him somewhat of food. The Prince ate a little and continually reproached himself for his unseemly treatment of his father, saying to himself, \"O my soul, knowest thou not that a son of Adam is the hostage of his tongue, and that a man's tongue is what casteth him into deadly perils?\" Then his eyes ran over with tears and he bewailed that which he had done, from anguished vitals and aching heart, repenting him with exceeding repentance of the wrong wherewith he had wronged his father and repeating,\n\n\"Fair youth shall die by stumbling of the tongue: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Stumble of foot works not man's life such wrong:\nThe slip of lip shall oft smite off the head, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     While slip of foot shall never harm one long.\"\n\nNow when he had made an end of eating, he asked for the wherewithal to wash his hands and when the Mameluke had washed them clean of the remnants of food, he arose and made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the prayers of sundown and nightfall, conjoining them in one; after which he sat down.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince Kamar al-Zaman had prayed (conjoining them in one) the prayers of sundown and nightfall, he sat down on the well and began reciting the Koran, and he repeated \"The Cow,\" the \"House of Imr\u00e1n,\" and \"Y. S.;\" \"The Compassionate,\" \"Blessed be the King,\" \"Unity\" and \"The two Talismans''[FN#237]; and he ended with blessing and supplication and with saying, \"I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned.\"[FN#238] Then he lay down upon his couch which was covered with a mattress of satin from al- Ma'adin town, the same on both sides and stuffed with the raw silk of Irak; and under his head was a pillow filled with ostrich-down And when ready for sleep, he doffed his outer clothes and drew off his bag-trousers and lay down in a shirt of delicate stuff smooth as wax; and he donned a head-kerchief of azure Mar\u00e1zi[FN#239] cloth; and at such time and on this guise Kamar al-Zaman was like the full-orbed moon, when it riseth on its fourteenth night. Then, drawing over his head a coverlet of silk, he fell asleep with the lanthorn burning at his feet and the wax-candle over his head, and he ceased not sleeping through the first third of the night, not knowing what lurked for him in the womb of the Future, and what the Omniscient had decreed for him. Now, as Fate and Fortune would have it, both tower and saloon were old and had been many years deserted; and there was therein a Roman well inhabited by a Jinniyah of the seed of Iblis[FN#240] the Accursed, by name Maym\u00fanah, daughter of Al- Dimiry\u00e1t, a renowned King of the J\u00e1nn.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the name of the Jinniyah in question was Maymunah, daughter of Al-Dimiryat; a renowned King of the Jann. And as Kamar al-Zaman continued sleeping till the first third of the night, Maymunah came up out of the Roman well and made for the firmament, thinking to listen by stealth to the converse of the angels; but when she reached the mouth of the well, she saw a light shining in the tower, contrary to custom; and having dwelt there many years without seeing the like, she said to herself, \"Never have I witnessed aught like this\"; and, marvelling much at the matter, determined that there must be some cause therefor. So she made for the light and found the eunuch sleeping within the door; and inside she saw a couch spread, whereon was a human form with the wax-candle burning at his head and the lanthorn at his feet, and she wondered to see the light and stole towards it little by little. Then she folded her wings and stood by the bed and, drawing back the coverlid, discovered Kamar al-Zaman's face. She was motionless for a full hour in admiration and wonderment; for the lustre of his visage outshone that of the candle; his face beamed like a pearl with light; his eyelids were languorous like those of the gazelle; the pupils of his eyes were intensely black and brilliant[FN#241]; his cheeks were rosy red; his eye-brows were arched like bows and his breath exhaled a scent of musk, even as saith of him the poet,\n\n\"I kissed him: darker grew those pupils,[FN#242] which *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Seduce my soul, and cheeks flushed rosier hue;\nO heart, if slanderers dare to deem there be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His like in chasms, Say 'Bring him hither, you!' \"\n\nNow when Maymunah saw him, she pronounced the formula of praise,[FN#243] and said, \"Blessed be Allah, the best of Creators!\"; for she was of the true-believing Jinn; and she stood awhile gazing on his face, exclaiming and envying the youth his beauty and loveliness. And she said in herself, \"By Allah! I will do no hurt to him nor let any harm him; nay, from all of evil will I ransom him, for this fair face deserveth not but that folk should gaze upon it and for it praise the Lord. Yet how could his family find it in their hearts to leave him in such desert place where, if one of our M\u00e1rids came upon him at this hour, he would assuredly slay him.\" Then the Ifritah Maymunah bent over him and kissed him between the eyes, and presently drew back the sheet over his face which she covered up; and after this she spread her wings and soaring into the air, flew upwards. And after rising high from the circle of the saloon she ceased not winging her way through air and ascending skywards till she drew near the heaven of this world, the lowest of the heavens. And behold, she heard the noisy flapping of wings cleaving the welkin and, directing herself by the sound, she found when she drew near it that the noise came from an Ifrit called Dahnash. So she swooped down on him like a sparrow-hawk and, when he was aware of her and knew her to be Maymunah, the daughter of the King of the Jinn, he feared her and his side-muscles quivered; and he implored her forbearance, saying, I conjure thee by the Most Great and August Name and by the most noble talisman graven upon the seal-ring of Solomon, entreat me kindly and harm me not!\" When she heard these words her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Verily, thou conjurest me, O accursed, with a mighty conjuration. Nevertheless, I will not let thee go, till thou tell me whence thou comest at this hour.\" He replied, \"O Princess, Know that I come from the uttermost end of China-land and from among the Islands, and I will tell thee of a wonderful thing I have seen this night. If thou kind my words true, let me wend my way and write me a patent under thy hand and with thy sign manual that I am thy freedman, so none of the Jinn-hosts, whether of the upper who fly or of the lower who walk the earth or of those who dive beneath the waters, do me let or hindrance.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"And what is it thou hast seen this night, O liar, O accursed! Tell me without leasing and think not to escape from my hand with falses, for I swear to thee by the letters graven upon the bezel of the seal-ring of Solomon David son (on both of whom be peace!), except thy speech be true, I will pluck out thy feathers with mine own hand and strip off thy skin and break thy bones!\" Quoth the Ifrit Dahnash son of Shamh\u00farish[FN#244] the Flyer, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-eight Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash spoke thus to Maymunah, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\" Then he resumed, \"Know, O my mistress, that I come to-night from the Islands of the Inland Sea in the parts of China, which are the realms of King Ghay\u00far, lord of the Islands and the Seas and the Seven Palaces. There I saw a daughter of his, than whom Allah hath made none fairer in her time: I cannot picture her to thee, for my tongue would fail to describe her with her due of praise; but I will name to thee a somewhat of her charms by way of approach. Now her hair is like the nights of disunion and separation and her face like the days of union and delectation; and right well hath the poet said when picturing her,\n\n'She dispread the locks from her head one night, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Showing four fold nights into one night run\nAnd she turned her visage towards the moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And two moons showed at moment one.'\n\nShe hath a nose like the edge of the burnished blade and cheeks like purple wine or anemones blood-red: her lips as coral and carnelian shine and the water of her mouth is sweeter than old wine; its taste would quench Hell's fiery pain. Her tongue is moved by wit of high degree and ready repartee: her breast is a seduction to all that see it (glory be to Him who fashioned it and finished it!); and joined thereto are two upper arms smooth and rounded; even as saith of her the poet Al-Walah\u00e1n,[FN#245]\n\n'She hath wrists which, did her bangles not contain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would run from out her sleeves in silvern rain.'\n\nShe hath breasts like two globes of ivory, from whose brightness the moons borrow light, and a stomach with little waves as it were a figured cloth of the finest Egyptian linen made by the Copts, with creases like folded scrolls, ending in a waist slender past all power of imagination; based upon back parts like a hillock of blown sand, that force her to sit when she would fief stand, and awaken her, when she fain would sleep, even as saith of her and describeth her the poet,\n\n\n'She hath those hips conjoined by thread of waist, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Hips that o'er me and her too tyrannise\nMy thoughts they daze whene'er I think of them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And weigh her down whene'er she would uprise.'[FN#246]\n\nAnd those back parts are upborne by thighs smooth and round and by a calf like a column of pearl, and all this reposeth upon two feet, narrow, slender and pointed like spear-blades,[FN#247] the handiwork of the Protector and Requiter, I wonder how, of their littleness, they can sustain what is above them. But I cut short my praises of her charms fearing lest I be tedious.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash bin Shamhurish said to the Ifritah Maymunah, \"Of a truth I cut short my praises fearing lest I be tedious.\" Now when Maymunah heard the description of that Princess and her beauty and loveliness, she stood silent in astonishment; whereupon Dahnash resumed, \"The father of this fair maiden is a mighty King, a fierce knight, immersed night and day in fray and fight; for whom death hath no fright and the escape of his foe no dread, for that he is a tyrant masterful and a conqueror irresistible, lord of troops and armies and continents and islands, and cities and villages, and his name is King Ghayur, Lord of the Islands and of the Seas and of the Seven Palaces. Now he loveth his daughter, the young maiden whom I have described to thee, with dearest love and, for affection of her, he hath heaped together the treasures of all the kings and built her therewith seven palaces, each of a different fashion; the first of crystal, the second of marble, the third of China steel, the fourth of precious stones and gems of price, the fifth of porcelain and many-hued onyxes and ring bezels, the sixth of silver and the seventh of gold. And he hath filled the seven palaces with all sorts of sumptuous furniture, rich silken carpets and hangings and vessels of gold and silver and all manner of gear that kings require; and hath bidden his daughter to abide in each by turns for a certain season of the year; and her name is the Princess Budur.[FN#248] Now when her beauty became known and her name and fame were bruited abroad in the neighbouring countries, all the kings sent to her father to demand her of him in marriage, and he consulted her on the matter, but she disliked the very word wedlock with a manner of abhorrence and said, O my father, I have no mind to marry; no, not at all; for I am a sovereign Lady and a Queen suzerain ruling over men, and I have no desire for a man who shall rule over me. And the more suits she refused, the more her suitors' eagerness increased and all the Royalties of the Inner Islands of China sent presents and rarities to her father with letters asking her in marriage. So he pressed her again and again with advice on the matter of espousals; but she ever opposed to him refusals, till at last she turned upon him angrily and cried, 'O my father, if thou name matrimony to me once more, I will go into my chamber and take a sword and, fixing its hilt in the ground, will set its point to my waist; then will I press upon it, till it come forth from my back, and so slay myself.' Now when the King heard these her words, the light became darkness in his sight and his heart burned for her as with a flame of fire, because he feared lest she should kill herself; and he was filled with perplexity concerning her affair and the kings her suitors. So he said to her 'If thou be determined not to marry and there be no help for it abstain from going and coming in and out.' Then he placed her in a house and shut her up in a chamber, appointing ten old women as duennas to guard her, and forbade her to go forth to the Seven Palaces; moreover, he made it appear that he was incensed against her, and sent letters to all the kings, giving them to know that she had been stricken with madness by the Jinns; and it is now a year since she hath thus been secluded.\" Then continued the Ifrit Dahnash, addressing the Ifritah Maymunah, \"And I, O my lady go to her every night and take my fill of feeding my sight on her face and I kiss her between the eyes: yet, of my love to her, I do her no hurt neither mount her, for that her youth is fair and her grace surpassing: every one who seeth her jealouseth himself for her. I conjure thee, therefore, O my lady, to go back with me and look on her beauty and loveliness and stature and perfection of proportion; and after, if thou wilt, chastise me or enslave me; and win to thy will, for it is shine to bid and to forbid.\" So saying, the Ifrit Dahnash bowed his head towards the earth and drooped his wings downward; but Maymunah laughed at his words and spat in his face and answered, \"What is this girl of whom thou pratest but a potsherd wherewith to wipe after making water?[FN#249] Faugh! Faugh! By Allah, O accursed, I thought thou hadst some wondrous tale to tell me or some marvellous news to give me. How would it be if thou were to sight my beloved? Verily, this night I have seen a young man, whom if thou saw though but in a dream, thou wouldst be palsied with admiration and spittle would flow from thy mouth.\" Asked the Ifrit, \"And who and what is this youth?\"; and she answered, \"Know, O Dahnash, that there hath befallen the young man the like of what thou tellest me befel thy mistress; for his father pressed him again and again to marry, but he refused, till at length his sire waxed wroth at being opposed and imprisoned him in the tower where I dwell: and I came up to-night and saw him.\" Said Dahnash, \"O my lady, shew me this youth, that I may see if he be indeed handsomer than my mistress, the Princess Budur, or not; for I cannot believe that the like of her liveth in this our age.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed, O most ill-omened of Marids and vilest of Satans![FN#250] Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the One Hundred and Eightieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifritah Maymunah spake thus to the Ifrit Dahnash, \"Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world! Art thou mad to fellow thy beloved with my beloved?\" He said, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady, go back with me and look upon my mistress, and after I will with thee and look upon thy beloved.\" She answered, \"It must needs be so, O accursed, for thou art a knavish devil; but I will not go with thee nor shalt thou come with me, save upon condition of a wager which is this. If the lover thou lovest and of whom thou boastest so bravely, prove handsomer than mine whom I mentioned and whom I love and of whom I boast, the bet shall be shine against me; but if my beloved prove the handsomer the bet shall be mine against thee.\" Quoth Dahnash the Ifrit, \"O my lady, I accept this thy wager and am satisfied thereat; so come with me to the Islands.\" Quoth Maymunah; \"No! for the abode of my beloved is nearer than the abode of shine: here it is under us; so come down with me to see my beloved and after we will go look upon thy mistress.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" said Dahnash. So they descended to earth and alighted in the saloon which the tower contained; then Maymunah stationed Dahnash beside the bed and, putting out her hand, drew back the silken coverlet from Kamar al-Zaman's face, when it glittered and glistened and shimmered and shone like the rising sun. She gazed at him for a moment, then turning sharply round upon Dahnash said, \"Look, O accursed, and be not the basest of madmen; I am a maid, yet my heart he hath waylaid.\" So Dahnash looked at the Prince and long continued gazing steadfastly on him then, shaking his head, said to Maymunah, \"By Allah, O my lady, thou art excusable; but there is yet another thing to be considered, and this is, that the estate female differeth from the male. By Allah's might, this thy beloved is the likest of all created things to my mistress in beauty and loveliness and grace and perfection; and it is as though they were both cast alike in the mould of seemlihead.\" Now when Maymunah heard these words, the light became darkness in her sight and she dealt him with her wing so fierce a buffet on the head as well-nigh made an end of him. Then quoth she to him, \"I conjure thee, by the light of his glorious countenance, go at once, O accursed, and bring hither thy mistress whom thou lovest so fondly and foolishly, and return in haste that we may lay the twain together and look on them both as they lie asleep side by side; so shall it appear to us which be the goodlier and more beautiful of the two. Except thou obey me this very moment, O accursed, I will dart my sparks at thee with my fire and consume thee; yea, in pieces I will rend thee and into the deserts cast thee, that to stay at home and wayfarer an example thou be!\" Quoth Dahnash, \"O my lady, I will do thy behests, for I know forsure that my mistress is the fairer and the sweeter.\" So saying the If rit flew away and Maymunah flew with him to guard him. They were absent awhile and presently returned, bearing the young lady, who was clad in a shift of fine Venetian silk, with a double edging of gold and purfled with the most exquisite of embroidery having these couplets worked upon the ends of the sleeves,\n\n\"Three matters hinder her from visiting us, in fear *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Of hate-full, slandering envier and his hired spies:\nThe shining light of brow, the trinkets' tinkling voice, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And scent of essences that tell whene'er she tries:\nGi'en that she hide her brow with edge of sleeve, and leave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     At home her trinketry, how shall her scent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     disguise?''[FN#251]\n\nAnd Dahnash and Maymunah stinted not bearing that young lady till they had carried her into the saloon and had laid her beside the youth Kamar al-Zaman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash and the Ifritah Maymunah stinted not bearing Princess Budur till they descended and laid her on the couch beside Kamar al- Zaman. Then they uncovered both their faces, and they were the likest of all folk, each to other, as they were twins or an only brother and sister; and indeed they were a seduction to the pious, even as saith of them the poet Al-Mub\u00edn,\n\n\"O heart! be not thy love confined to one, *\nLest thou by doting or disdain be undone:\nLove all the fair, and thou shalt find with them *\nIf this be lost, to thee that shall be won.\"\n\nAnd quoth another,\n\n\"Mine eyes beheld two lying on the ground; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Both had I loved if on these eyne they lay!\"\n\nSo Dahnash and Maymunah gazed on them awhile, and he said, \"By Allah, O my lady, it is good! My mistress is assuredly the fairer.\" She replied, \"Not so, my beloved is the fairer; woe to thee, O Dahnash! Art blind of eye and heart that lean from fat thou canst not depart? Wilt thou hide the truth? Dost thou not see his beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetry? Out on thee, hear what I purpose to say in praise of my beloved and, if thou be a lover true to her thou dost love, do thou the like for her thou Lovest.\" Then she kissed Kamar al-Zaman again and again between the eyes and improvised this ode,\n\n\"How is this? Why should the blamer abuse thee in his pride?\nWhat shall console my heart for thee, that art but slender bough?\n\nA Nature Kohl'd[FN#252] eye thou hast that witcheth far and wide;\nFrom pure platonic love[FN#253] of it deliverance none I trow!\n\nThose glances, fell as plundering Turk, to heart such havoc deal\nAs never havocked scymitar made keenest at the curve.\n\nOn me thou layest load of love the heaviest while I feel\nSo feeble grown that under weight of chemisette I swerve.\n\nMy love for thee as wottest well is habit, and my lowe\nIs nature; to all others false is all the love I tender:\n\nNow were my heart but like to shine I never would say No;\nOnly my wasted form is like thy waist so gracious slender:\n\nOut on him who in Beauty's robe for moon like charms hath fame,\nAnd who is claimed by mouth of men as marvel of his tribe!\n\n'Of man what manner may he be' (ask they who flyte and blame)\n'For whom thy heart is so distressed?' I only cry 'Describe!'\n\nOh stone-entempered heart of him! learn of his yielding grace\nAnd bending form to show me grace and yielding to consent.\nOh my Prince Beautiful, thou hast an Overseer in place[FN#254]\nWho irketh me, and eke a Groom whose wrong cloth ne'er relent.\n\nIndeed he lieth who hath said that all of loveliness\nWas pent in Joseph: in thy charms there's many and many a Joe!\n\nThe Genii dread me when I stand and face to face address;\nBut meeting thee my fluttering heart its shame and terror show.\n\nI take aversion semblance and I turn from thee in fright,\nBut more aversion I assume, more love from me dost claim;\n\nThat hair of jetty black! That brow e'er raying radiant light! Those eyne wherein white jostles black![FN#255] That dearling dainty frame!\"\n\nWhen Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he joyed with exceeding joy and marvelled with excessive wonderment.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Ifrit Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he shook for exceeding joy and said, \"Thou hast celebrated thy beloved in song and thou hast indeed done well in praise of him whom thou lovest! And there is no help for it but that I also in my turn do my best to enfame my mistress, and recite somewhat in her honour.\" Then the Ifrit went up to the Lady Budur; and' kissing her between the eyes, looked at Maymunah and at his beloved Princess and recited the following verses, albeit he had no skill in poesy,\n\n\"Love for my fair they chide in angry way; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unjust for ignorance, yea unjustest they!\nAh lavish favours on the love mad, whom *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Taste of thy wrath and parting woe shall slay:\nIn sooth for love I'm wet with railing tears, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That rail mine eyelids blood thou mightest say:\nNo marvel what I bear for love, 'tis marvel *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That any know my \"me\" while thou'rt away:\nUnlawful were our union did I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thy love, or heart incline to other May.\"\n\nAnd eke these words:\u2014\n\n\"I feed eyes on their stead by the valley's side, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And I'm slain and my slaver[FN#256] aside hath tried:\nGrief-wine have I drunken, and down my cheeks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Dance tears to the song of the camel-guide:\nFor union-blessing I strive though sure, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In Budur and Su'ad all my bliss shall bide:[FN#257]\nWot I not which of three gave me most to 'plain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So hear them numbered ere thou decide:\nThose Sworders her eyne, that Lancer her fig- *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     -ure, or ring-mail'd Locks which her forehead hide.\nQuoth she (and I ask of her what so wights *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or abide in towns or in desert ride[FN#258] )\nTo me, 'In thy heart I dwell, look there!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Where's my heart ah where? ah where?'\"\n\nWhen Maymunah heard these lines from the Ifrit, she said, \"Thou hast done well, O Dahnash! But say thou which of the two is the handsomer?\" And he answered, \"My mistress Budur is handsomer than thy beloved!\" Cried Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed. Nay, my beloved is more beautiful than shine!\" But Dahnash persisted, \"Mine is the fairer.\" And they ceased not to wrangle and challenge each other's words till Maymunah cried out at Dahnash and would have laid violent hands on him, but he humbled himself to her and, softening his speech, said, \"Let not the truth be a grief to thee, and cease we this talk, for all we say is to testify in favour of our lovers; rather let each of us withdraw the claim and seek we one who shall judge fairly between us which of the two be fairer; and by his sentence we will abide.\" \"I agree to this,\" answered she and smote the earth with her foot, whereupon there came out of it an Ifrit blind of an eye, humpbacked and scurvy-skinned, with eye-orbits slit up and down his face.[FN#259] On his head were seven horns and four locks of hair fell to his heels; his hands were pitchfork-like and his legs mast-like and he had nails as the claws of a lion, and feet as the hoofs of the wild ass.[FN#260] When that If rit rose out of the earth and sighted Maymunah, he kissed the ground before her and, standing with his hands clasped behind him, said, \"What is thy will, O my mistress, O daughter of my King?\"[FN#261] She replied, \"O Kashkash, I would have thee judge between me and this accursed Dahnash.\" And she made known to him the matter, from first to last, whereupon the Ifrit Kashkash looked at the face of the youth and then at the face of the girl; and saw them lying asleep, embraced, each with an arm under the other's neck, alike in beauty and loveliness and equal in grace and goodliness. The Marid gazed long upon them, marvelling at their seemlihead; and, after carefully observing the twain, he turned to Maymunah and Dahnash, and reseated these couplets.\n\n\"Go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not\nThe words detractors utter, envious churls\nCan never favour love. Oh! sure the Merciful\nNe'er made a thing more fair to look upon,\nThan two fond lovers in each others' arms,\nSpeaking their passion in a mute embrace.\nWhen heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them\nStrike idly on cold steel. So when thou'st found\nOne purely, wholly shine, accept her true heart,\nAnd live for her alone. Oh! thou that blamest\nThe love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk,\nHow canst thou minister to a mind diseased?\"[FN#262]\n\nThen he turned again to Maymunah and Dahnash and said to them, \"By Allah, if you will have the truth, I tell you fairly the twain be equal in beauty, and loveliness and perfect grace and goodliness, nor can I make any difference between them on account of their being man and woman. But I have another thought which is that we wake each of them in turn, without the knowledge of the other, and whichever is the more enamoured shall be held inferior in seemlihead and comeliness.\" Quoth Maymunah, \"Right is this recking,\" and quoth Dahnash, \"I consent to this.\" Then Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman, whereupon he started from sleep in a fright.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-third Night,\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman who started from sleep in a fright and rubbed the bitten part, his neck, and scratched it hard because of the smart. Then turning sideways, he found lying by him something whose breath was sweeter than musk and whose skin was softer than cream. Hereat marvelled he with great marvel and he sat up and looked at what lay beside him; when he saw it to be a young lady like an union pearl, or a shining sun, or a dome seen from afar on a well built wall; for she was five feet tall, with a shape like the letter Alif[FN#263], bosomed high and rosy checked; even as saith of her the poet,\n\n\"Four things which ne'er conjoin, unless it be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To storm my vitals and to shed my blood:\nBrow white as day and tresses black as night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cheeks rosy red and lips which smiles o'erflood.\"\n\nAnd also quoth another,\n\n\"A Moon she rises, Willow wand she waves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Breathes Ambergris, and gazes, a Gazelle:\nMeseems that sorrow woes my heart and wins *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, when she wendeth hastes therein to dwell!\"\n\nAnd when Kamar al-Zaman saw the Lady Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, and her beauty and comeliness, she was sleeping clad in a shift of Venetian silk, without her petticoat-trousers, and wore on her head a kerchief embroidered with gold and set with stones of price: her ears were hung with twin earrings which shone like constellations and round her neck was a collar of union pearls, of size unique, past the competence of any King. When he saw this, his reason was confounded and natural heat began to stir in him; Allah awoke in him the desire of coition and he said to himself, \"Whatso Allah willeth, that shall be, and what He willeth not shall never be!\" So saying, he put out his hand and, turning her over, loosed the collar of her chemise; then arose before his sight her bosom, with its breasts like double globes of ivory; whereat his inclination for her redoubled and he desired her with exceeding hot desire, He would have awakened her but she would not awake, for Dahnash had made her sleep heavy; so he shook her and moved her, saying, \"O my beloved, awake and look on me; I am Kamar al-Zaman.\" But she awoke not, neither moved her head; where-upon he considered her case for a long hour and said to himself, \"If I guess aright, this is the damsel to whom my father would have married me and these three years past I have refused her; but Inshallah!\u2014God willing\u2014as soon as it is dawn, I will say to him, 'Marry me to her, that I may enjoy her.'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to himself, \"By Allah, when I see dawn I will say to my sire, 'Marry me to her that I may enjoy her'; nor will I let half the day pass ere I possess her and take my fill of her beauty and loveliness.\" Then he bent over Budur to buss her, whereat the Jinniyah Maymunah trembled and was abashed and Dahnash, the Ifrit, was like to fly for joy. But, as Kamar al- Zaman was about to kiss her upon the mouth, he was ashamed before Allah and turned away his head and averted his face, saying to his heart, \"Have patience.\" Then he took thought awhile and said, \"I will be patient; haply my father when he was wroth with me and sent me to this jail, may have brought my young lady and made her lie by my side to try me with her, and may have charged her not to be readily awakened when I would arouse her, and may have said to her, 'Whatever thing Kamar al-Zaman do to thee, make me ware thereof'; or belike my sire standeth hidden in some stead whence (being himself unseen) he can see all I do with this young lady; and to morrow he will scold me and cry, 'How cometh it that thou sayest, I have no mind to marry; and yet thou didst kiss and embrace yonder damsel?' So I will withhold myself lest I be ashamed before my sire; and the right and proper thing to do is not to touch her at this present, nor even to look upon her, except to take from her somewhat which shall serve as a token to me and a memorial of her; that some sign endure between me and her.\" Then Kamar al-Zaman raised the young lady's hand and took from her little finger a seal-ring worth an immense amount of money, for that its bezel was a precious jewel and around it were graven these couplets,\n\n\"Count not that I your promises forgot, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Despite the length of your delinquencies\nBe generous, O my lord, to me inclining; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply your mouth and cheeks these lips may kiss:\nBy Allah, ne'er will I relinquish you *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Albe you will transgress love's boundaries.\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman took the seal-ring from the little finger of Queen Budur and set it on his own; then, turning his back to her, went to sleep.[FN#264] When Maymunah the Jinniyah saw this, she was glad and said to Dahnash and Kashkash, \"Saw ye how my beloved Kamar al-Zaman bore himself chastely towards this young lady? Verily, this was of the perfection of his good gifts; for observe you twain how he looked on her and noted her beauty and loveliness, and yet embraced her not neither kissed her nor put his hand to her, but turned his back and slept.\" Answered they, \"Even so!\" Thereupon Maymunah changed herself into a flea and entering into the raiment of Budur, the loved of Dahnash, crept up her calf and came upon her thigh and, reaching a place some four carats[FN#265] below her navel, there bit her. Thereupon she opened her eyes and sitting up in bed, saw a youth lying beside her and breathing heavily in his sleep, the loveliest of Almighty Allah's creatures, with eyes that put to shame the fairest Houris of Heaven; and a mouth like Solomon's seal, whose water was sweeter to the taste and more efficacious than a theriack, and lips the colour of coral-stone, and cheeks like the blood red anemone, even as saith one, describing him in these couplets,\n\n\"My mind's withdrawn from Zaynab and Naw\u00e1r[FN#266] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     By rosy cheeks that growth of myrtle bear;\nI love a fawn, a tunic-vested boy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And leave the love of bracelet-wearing Fair:\nMy mate in hall and closet is unlike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her that I play with, as at home we pair.\nOh thou, who blam'st my flight from Hind and Zaynab, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The cause is clear as dawn uplighting air!\nWould'st have me fare[FN#267] a slave, the thrall of thrall, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cribbed, pent, confined behind the bar and wall?\"\n\nNow when Princess Budur saw him, she was seized by a transport of passion and yearning and love-longing,\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur saw Kamar al-Zaman she was forthwith seized with a transport of passion and yearning and love longing, and she said to herself, \"Alas, my shame! This is a strange youth and I know him not. How cometh he to be lying by my side on one bed?\" Then she looked at him a second time and, noting his beauty and loveliness, said, \"By Allah, he is indeed a comely youth and my heart[FN#268] is well-nigh torn in sunder with longing for him! But alas, how am I shamed by him! By the Almighty, had I known it was this youth who sought me in marriage of my father, I had not rejected him, but had wived with him and enjoyed his loveliness!\" Then she gazed in his face and said, \"O my lord and light of mine eyes, awake from sleep and take thy pleasure in my beauty and grace.\" And she moved him with her hand; but Maymunah the Jinniyah let down sleep upon him as it were a curtain, and pressed heavily on his head with her wings so that Kamar al-Zaman awoke not. Then Princess Budur shook him with her hands and said, \"My life on thee, hearken to me; awake and up from thy sleep and look on the narcissus and the tender down thereon, and enjoy the sight of naked waist and navel; and touzle me and tumble me from this moment till break of day! Allah upon thee, O my lord, sit up and prop thee against the pillow and slumber not!\" Still Kamar al-Zaman made her no reply but breathed hard in his sleep. Continued she, \"Alas! Alas! thou art insolent in thy beauty and comeliness and grace and loving looks! But if thou art handsome, so am I handsome; what then is this thou dost? Have they taught thee to flout me or hath my father, the wretched old fellow,[FN#269] made thee swear not to speak to me to-night?\" But Kamar al-Zaman opened not his mouth neither awoke, whereat her passion for him redoubled and Allah inflamed her heart with love of him. She stole one glance of eyes that cost her a thousand sighs: her heart fluttered, and her vitals throbbed and her hands and feet quivered; and she said to Kamar al-Zaman \"Talk to me, O my lord! Speak to me, O my friend! Answer me, O my beloved, and tell me thy name, for indeed thou hast ravished my wit!\" And during all this time he abode drowned in sleep and answered her not a word, and Princess Budur sighed and said, \"Alas! Alas! why art thou so proud and self satisfied?\" Then she shook him and turning his hand over, saw her seal-ring on his little finger, whereat she cried a loud cry, and followed it with a sigh of passion and said, \"Alack! Alack! By Allah, thou art my beloved and thou lovest me! Yet thou seemest to turn thee away from me out of coquetry, for all, O my darling, thou camest to me, whilst I was asleep and knew not what thou didst with me, and tookest my seal-ring; and yet I will not pull it off thy finger.\" So saying, she opened the bosom of his shirt and bent over him and kissed him and put forth her hand to him, seeking somewhat that she might take as a token, but found nothing. Then she thrust her hand into his breast and, because of the smoothness of his body, it slipped down to his waist and thence to his navel and thence to his yard, whereupon her heart ached and her vitals quivered and lust was sore upon her, for that the desire of women is fiercer than the desire of men,[FN#270] and she was ashamed of her own shamelessness. Then she plucked his seal-ring from his finger, and put it on her own instead of the ring he had taken, and bussed his inner lips and hands, nor did she leave any part of him unkissed; after which she took him to her breast and embraced him and, laying one of her hands under his neck and the other under his arm-pit, nestled close to him and fell asleep by his side.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur fell asleep by the side of Kamar al-Zaman, after doing that which she did, quoth Maymunah to Dahnash, Night thou, O accursed, how proudly and coquettishly my beloved bore himself, and how hotly and passionately thy mistress showed herself to my dearling? There can be no doubt that my beloved is handsomer than shine; nevertheless I pardon thee.\" Then she wrote him a document of manumission and turned to Kashkash and said, \"Go, help Dahnash to take up his mistress and aid him to carry her back to her own place, for the night waneth apace and there is but little left of it.\" \"I hear and I obey;\" answered Kashkash. So the two Ifrits went forward to Princess Budur and upraising her flew away with her; then, bearing her back to her own place, they laid her on her bed, whilst Maymunah abode alone with Kamar al-Zaman, gazing upon him as he slept, till the night was all but spent, when she went her way. As soon as morning morrowed, the Prince awoke from sleep and turned right and left, but found not the maiden by him and said in his mind, \"What is this business? It is as if my father would incline me to marriage with the damsel who was with me and have now taken her away by stealth, to the intent that my desire for wedlock may redouble.\" Then he called out to the eunuch who slept at the door, saying, \"Woe to thee, O damned one, arise at once!\" So the eunuch rose, bemused with sleep, and brought him basin and ewer, whereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered the water closet and did his need;[FN#271] then, coming out made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the dawn-prayer, after which he sat telling on his beads the ninety-and-nine names of Almighty Allah. Then he looked up and, seeing the eunuch standing in service upon him, said, \"Out on thee, O Saw\u00e1b! Who was it came hither and took away the young lady from my side and I still sleeping?\" Asked the eunuch, 'O my lord, what manner of young lady?\" \"The young lady who lay with me last night,\" replied Kamar al-Zaman. The eunuch was startled at his words and said to him, \"By Allah, there hath been with thee neither young lady nor other! How should young lady have come in to thee, when I was sleeping in the doorway and the door was locked? By Allah, O my lord, neither male nor female hath come in to thee!\" Exclaimed the Prince, \"Thou liest, O pestilent slave!: is it of thy competence also to hoodwink me and refuse to tell me what is become of the young lady who lay with me last night and decline to inform me who took her away?\" Replied the eunuch (and he was affrighted at him), \"By Allah, O my lord, I have seen neither young lady nor young lord!\" His words only angered Kamar al-Zaman the more and he said to him, \"O accursed one, my father hath indeed taught thee deceit! Come hither.\" So the eunuch came up to him, and the Prince took him by the collar and dashed him to the ground; whereupon he let fly a loud fart[FN#272] and Kamar al-Zaman, kneeling upon him, kicked him and throttled him till he fainted away. Then he dragged him forth and tied him to the well-rope, and let him down like a bucket into the well and plunged him into the water, then drew him up and lowered him down again. Now it was hard winter weather, and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not to plunge the eunuch into the water and pull him up again and douse him and haul him whilst he screamed and called for help; and the Prince kept on saying \"By Allah, O damned one, I will not draw thee up out of this well till thou tell me and fully acquaint me with the story of the young lady and who it was took her away, whilst I slept.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One and Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to the eunuch, \"By Allah! I will not draw thee up out of this well until thou tell me the story of the young lady and who it was took her away whilst I slept.\" Answered the eunuch, after he had seen death staring him in the face; \"O my lord, let me go and I will relate to thee the truth and the whole tale.\" So Kamar al-Zaman pulled him up out of the well, all but dead for suffering, what with cold and the pain of dipping and dousing, drubbing and dread of drowning. He shook like cane in hurricane, his teeth were clenched as by cramp and his clothes were drenched and his body befouled and torn by the rough sides of the well: briefly he was in a sad pickle. Now when Kamar al-Zaman saw him in this sorry plight, he was concerned for him; but, as soon as the eunuch found himself on the floor, he said to him, \"O my lord, let me go and doff my clothes and wring them out and spread them in the sun to dry, and don others; after which I will return to thee forthwith and tell thee the truth of the matter.\" Answered the Prince, \"O rascal slave! hadst thou not seen death face to face, never hadst thou confessed to fact nor told me a word; but go now and do thy will, and then come back to me at once and tell me the truth.\" Thereupon the eunuch went out, hardly crediting his escape, and ceased not running, stumbling and rising in his haste, till he came in to King Shahriman, whom he found sitting at talk with his Wazir of Kamar al-Zaman's case. The King was saying to the Minister, \"I slept not last night, for anxiety concerning my son, Kamar al-Zaman and indeed I fear lest some harm befal him in that old tower. What good was there in imprisoning him?\" Answered the Wazir, \"Have no care for him. By Allah, no harm will befal him! None at all! Leave him in prison for a month till his temper yield and his spirit be broken and he return to his senses.\" As the two spoke behold, up rushed the eunuch, in the aforesaid plight, making to the King who was troubled at sight of him; and he cried \"O our lord the Sultan! Verily, thy son's wits are fled and he hath gone mad, he hath dealt with me thus and thus, so that I am become as thou seest me, and he kept saying, 'A young lady lay with me this night and stole away secretly whilst I slept. Where is she?' And he insisteth on my letting him know where she is and on my telling him who took her away. But I have seen neither girl nor boy: the door was locked all through the night, for I slept before it with the key under my head, and I opened to him in the morning with my own hand. When King Shahriman heard this, he cried out, saying, \"Alas, my son!;\" and he was enraged with sore rage against the Wazir, who had been the cause of all this case and said to him, \"Go up, bring me news of my son and see what hath befallen his mind.\" So the Wazir rose and, stumbling over his long skirts, in his fear of the King's wrath, hastened with the slave to the tower. Now the sun had risen and when the Minister came in to Kamar al-Zaman, he found him sitting on the couch reciting the Koran; so he saluted him and seated himself by his side, and said to him, \"O my lord, this wretched eunuch brought us tidings which troubled and alarmed us and which incensed the King.\" Asked Kamar al-Zaman, \"And what hath he told you of me to trouble my father? In good sooth he hath troubled none but me.\" Answered the Wazir, \"He came to us in fulsome state and told us of thee a thing which Heaven forfend; and the slave added a lie which it befitteth not to repeat, Allah preserve thy youth and sound sense and tongue of eloquence, and forbid to come from thee aught of offense!\" Quoth the Prince, \"O Wazir, and what thing did this pestilent slave say of me?\" The Minister replied, \"He told us that thy wits had taken leave of thee and thou wouldst have it that a young lady lay with thee last night, and thou west instant with him to tell thee whither she went and thou diddest torture him to that end.\" But when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was enraged with sore rage and he said to the Wazir, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her per misted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman heard the words of the Wazir he was enraged with sore rage and said to him, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did and forbade him to tell me what became of the young lady who lay with me last night. But thou, O Wazir, art cleverer than the eunuch, so do thou tell me without stay or delay, whither went the young lady who slept on my bosom last night; for it was you who sent her and bade her steep in my embrace and we lay together till dawn; but, when I awoke, I found her not. So where is she now?\" Said the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al-Zaman, Allah's name encompass thee about! By the Almighty, we sent none to thee last night, but thou layest alone, with the door locked on thee and the eunuch sleeping behind it, nor did there come to thee young lady or any other. Regain thy reason, O my lord, and stablish thy senses and occupy not thy mind with vanities.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman who was incensed at his words, \"O Wazir, the young lady in question is my beloved, the fair one with the black eyes and rosy cheeks, whom I held in my arms all last night.\" So the Minister wondered at his words and asked him, \"Didst thou see this damsel last night with shine own eyes on wake or in sleep?\" Answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O ill- omened old man, dost thou fancy I saw her with my ears? Indeed, I saw her with my very eyes and awake, and I touched her with my hand, and I watched by her full half the night, feeding my vision on her beauty and loveliness and grace and tempting looks. But you had schooled her and charged her to speak no word to me; so she feigned sleep and I lay by her side till dawn, when I awoke and found her gone.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al- Zaman, haply thou sawest this in thy sleep; it must have been a delusion of dreams or a deception caused by eating various kinds of food, or a suggestion of the accursed devils.\" Cried the Prince, \"O pestilent old man! wilt thou too make a mock of me and tell me this was haply a delusion of dreams, when that eunuch confessed to the young lady, saying, 'At once I will return to thee and tell thee all about her?'\" With these words, he sprang up and rushed at the Wazir and gripped hold of his beard (which was long[FN#273]) and, after gripping it, he twisted his hand in it and haling him off the couch, threw him on the floor. It seemed to the Minister as though his soul departed his body for the violent plucking at his beard; and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not kicking the Wazir and basting his breast and ribs and cuffing him with open hand on the nape of his neck till he had well-nigh beaten him to death. Then said the old man in his mind, \"Just as the eunuch-slave saved his life from this lunatic youth by telling him a lie, thus it is even fitter that I do likewise; else he will destroy me. So now for my lie to save myself, he being mad beyond a doubt.\" Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O my lord, pardon me; for indeed thy father charged me to conceal from thee this affair of the young lady; but now I am weak and weary and wounded with funding; for I am an old man and lack strength and bottom to endure blows. Have, therefore, a little patience with me and I will tell thee all and acquaint thee with the story of the young woman.\" When the Prince heard this, he left off drubbing him and said, \"Wherefore couldst thou not tell me the tale until after shame and blows? Rise now, unlucky old man that thou art, and tell me her story.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"Say, dost thou ask of the young lady with the fair face and perfect form?\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"Even so! Tell me, O Wazir, who it was that led her to me and laid her by my side, and who was it that took her away from me by night; and let me know forthright whither she is gone, that I myself may go to her at once. If my father did this deed to me that he might try me by means of that beautiful girl, with a view to our marriage, I consent to wed her and free myself of this trouble; for he did all these dealings with me only because I refused wedlock. But now I consent and I say again, I consent to matrimony: so tell this to my father, O Wazir, and advise him to marry me to that young lady; for I will have none other and my heart loveth none save her alone. Now rise up at once and haste thee to my father and counsel him to hurry on our wedding and bring me his answer within this very hour.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"'Tis well!\" and went forth from him, hardly believing himself out of his hands. Then he set off from the tower, walking and tripping up as he went, for excess of fright and agitation, and he ceased not hurrying till he came in to King Shahriman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-nineth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, fared forth from the tower, and ceased not running till he came in to King Shahriman, who said to him as he sighted him, \"O thou Wazir, what man hath brought thee to grief and whose mischief hath treated thee in way unlief; how happeneth it that I see thee dumb foundered and coming to me thus astounded?\" Replied the Wazir, \"O King! I bring thee good news.\" \"And what is it?\" quoth Shahriman, and quoth the Wazir, \"Know that thy son Kamar al- Zaman's wits are clean gone and that he hath become stark mad.\" Now when the King heard these words of the Minister, light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O Wazir, make clear to me the nature of his madness.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O my lord, I hear and I obey.\" Then he told him that such and such had passed and acquainted him with all that his son had done; whereupon the King said to him, \"Hear, O Wazir, the good tidings which I give thee in return for this thy fair news of my son's insanity; and it shall be the cutting off of thy head and the forfeiture of my favour, O most ill-omened of Wazirs and foulest of Emirs! for I feel that thou hast caused my son's disorder by the wicked advice and the sinister counsel thou hast given me first and last. By Allah, if aught of mischief or madness have befallen my son I will most assuredly nail thee upon the palace dome and make thee drain the bitterest draught of death!'' Then he sprang up and, taking the Wazir, with him, fared straight for the tower and entered it. And when Kamar al-Zaman saw the two, he rose to his father in haste from the couch whereon he sat and kissing his hands drew back and hung down his head and stood before him with his arms behind him, and thus remained for a full hour. Then he raised his head towards his sire; the tears gushed from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks and he began repeating,\n\n\"Forgive the sin 'neath which my limbs are trembling,\nFor the slave seeks for mercy from his master;\nI've done a fault, which calls for free confession,\nWhere shall it call for mercy, and forgiveness?''[FN#274]\n\nWhen the King heard this, he arose and embraced his son, and kissing him between the eyes, made him sit by his side on the couch; then he turned to the Wazir, and, looking on him with eyes of wrath, said, \"O dog of Wazirs, how didst thou say of my son such and such things and make my heart quake for him?\" Then he turned to the Prince and said, \"O my son, what is to-day called?\" He answered, \"O my father, this day is the Sabbath, and to morrow is First day: then come Second day, Third, Fourth, Fifth day and lastly Friday.\"[FN#275] Exclaimed the King, \"O my son, O Kamar al-Zaman, praised be Allah for the preservation of thy reason! What is the present month called in our Arabic?\" \"Z\u00fa'l Ka'adah,\" answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"and it is followed by Z\u00fa'l hijjah; then cometh Muharram, then Safar, then Rab\u00ed'a the First and Rab\u00ed'a the Second, the two Jam\u00e1d\u00e1s, Rajab, Sha'aban, Ramaz\u00e1n and Shaww\u00e1l.\" At this the King rejoiced exceedingly and spat in the Wazir's face, saying, \"O wicked old man, how canst thou say that my son is mad? And now none is mad but thou.\" Hereupon the Minister shook his head and would have spoken, but bethought himself to wait awhile and see what might next befal. Then the King said to his child, \"O my son, what words be these thou saddest to the eunuch and the Wazir, declaring, 'I was sleeping with a fair damsel this night?'[FN#276] What damsel is this of whom thou speakest?\" Then Kamar al-Zaman laughed at his father's words and replied, \"O my father, know that I can bear no more jesting; so add me not another mock or even a single word on the matter, for my temper hath waxed short by that you have done with me. And know, O my father, with assured knowledge, that I consent to marry, but on condition that thou give me to wife her who lay by my side this night; for I am certain it was thou sentest her to me and madest me in love with her and then despatchedst a message to her before the dawn and tookest her away from beside me.\" Rejoined the King, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth King Shahriman to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness! What thing be this young lady whom thou fanciest I sent to thee last night and then again that I sent to withdraw her from thee before dawn? By the Lord, O my son, I know nothing of this affair, and Allah upon thee, tell me if it be a delusion of dreaming or a deception caused by indisposition. For verily thou layest down to sleep last night with thy mind occupied anent marriage and troubled with the talk of it (Allah damn marriage and the hour when I spake of it and curse him who counselled it!); and without doubt or diffidence I can say that being moved in mind by the mention of wedlock thou dreamedst that a handsome young lady embraced thee and didst fancy thou sawest her when awake. But all this, O my son, is but an imbroglio of dreams.\" Replied Kamar al-Zaman, \"Leave this talk and swear to me by Allah, the All creator, the Omniscient; the Humbler of the tyrant Caesars and the Destroyer of the Chosroes, that thou knowest naught of the young lady nor of her woning-place.\" Quoth the King, \"By the Might of Allah Almighty, the God of Moses and Abraham, I know naught of all this and never even heard of it; it is assuredly a delusion of dreams thou hast seen in sleep.' Then the Prince replied to his sire, \"I will give thee a self evident proof that it happened to me when on wake.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al Zamar said to his sire, \"I will give thee a self-evident proof that this happened to me when on wake. Now let me ask thee, did it ever befal any man to dream that he was battling a sore battle and after to awake from sleep and find in his hand a sword-blade besmeared with blood? Answered the King, \"No, by Allah, O my son, this hath never been.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, \"I will tell thee what happened to me and it was this. Meseemed I awoke from sleep in the middle of the past night and found a girl lying by my side, whose form was like mine and whose favour was as mine. I embraced her and turned her about with my hand and took her seal- ring, which I put on my finger, and she pulled off my ring and put it on hers. Then I went to sleep by her side, but refrained from her for shame of thee, deeming that thou hadst sent her to me, intending to tempt me with her and incline me to marriage, and suspecting thee to be hidden somewhere whence thou couldst see what I did with her. And I was ashamed even to kiss her on the mouth for thy account, thinking over this temptation to wedlock; and, when I awoke at point of day, I found no trace of her, nor could I come at any news of her, and there befel me what thou knowest of with the eunuch and with the Wazir. How then can this case have been a dream and a delusion, when the ring is a reality? Save for her ring on my finger I should indeed have deemed it a dream; but here is the ring on my little finger: look at it, O King, and see what is its worth.\" So saying he handed the ring to his father, who examined it and turned it over, then looked to his son and said, \"Verily, there is in this ring some mighty mystery and some strange secret. What befel thee last night with the girl is indeed a hard nut to crack, and I know not how intruded upon us this intruder. None is the cause of all this posher save the Wazir; but, Allah upon thee, O my son, take patience, so haply the Lord may turn to gladness this thy grief and to thy sadness bring complete relief: as quoth one of the poets,\n\n'Haply shall Fortune draw her rein, and bring *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fair chance, for she is changeful, jealous, vain:\nStill I may woo my want and wishes win, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And see on heels of care unfair, the fain.'\n\nAnd now, O my son, I am certified at this hour that thou art not mad; but thy case is a strange one which none can clear up for thee save the Almighty.\" Cried the Prince, \"By Allah, O my father, deal kindly with me and seek out this young lady and hasten her coming to me; else I shall die of woe and of my death shall no one know.\" Then he betrayed the ardour of his passion; and turned towards his father and repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"If your promise of personal call prove untrue, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Deign in vision to grant me an interview:\nQuoth they, 'How can phantom[FN#277] appear to the sight *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of a youth, whose sight is fordone, perdue?'\"\n\nThen, after ending his poetry, Kamar al-Zaman again turned to his father, with submission and despondency, and shedding tears in flood, began repeating these lines.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman had repeated to his father these verses, he wept and complained and groaned from a wounded heart; and added these lines,\n\n\"Beware that eye glance which hath magic might; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherever turn those orbs it bars our flight:\nNor be deceived by low sweet voice, that breeds *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    A fever festering in the heart and sprite:\nSo soft that silky skin, were rose to touch it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She'd cry and tear-drops rain for pain and fright:\nDid Zephyr e'en in sleep pass o'er her land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Scented he'd choose to dwell in scented site:\nHer necklets vie with tinkling of her belt; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her wrists strike either wristlet dumb with spite:\nWhen would her bangles buss those rings in ear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Upon the lover's eyne high mysteries 'light:\nI'm blamed for love of her, nor pardon claim; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Eyes are not profiting which lack foresight:\nHeaven strip thee, blamer mine! unjust art thou; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Before this fawn must every eye low bow.\"[FN#278]\n\nAfter which he said, \"By Allah, O my father, I cannot endure to be parted from her even for an hour.\" The King smote hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! No cunning contrivance can profit us in this affair.\" Then he took his son by the hand and carried him to the palace, where Kamar al-Zaman lay down on the bed of languor and the King sat at his head, weeping and mourning over him and leaving him not, night or day, till at last the Wazir came in to him and said, \"O King of the age and the time, how long wilt thou remain shut up with thy son and hide thyself from thy troops. Haply, the order of thy realm may be deranged, by reason of shine absence from thy Grandees and Officers of State. It behoveth the man of understanding, if he have various wounds in his body, to apply him first to medicine the most dangerous; so it is my counsel to thee that thou remove thy son from this place to the pavilion which is in the palace overlooking the sea; and shut thyself up with him there, setting apart in every week two days, Thursday and Monday, for state receptions and progresses and reviews. On these days let shine Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and high Officials and Grandees of the realm and the rest of the levies and the lieges have access to thee and submit their affairs to thee; and do thou their needs and judge among them and give and take with them and bid and forbid. And the rest of the week thou shalt pass with thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and cease not thus doing till Allah shall vouchsafe relief to you twain. Think not, O King, that thou art safe from the shifts of Time and the strokes of Change which come like a traveller in the night; for the wise man is ever on his guard and how well saith the poet,\n\n'Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And fearedst not what ills might bring thee Fate:\nThe Nights so fair and restful cozened thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For peaceful Nights bring woes of heavy weight.\nOh children of mankind whom Time befriends, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware of Time's deceits or soon or late!'''[FN#279]\n\nWhen the Sultan heard his Wazir's words he saw that they were right and deemed his counsel wise, and it had effect upon him for he feared lest the order of the state be deranged; so he rose at once and bade transport his son from his sick room to the pavilion in the palace overlooking the sea. Now this palace was girt round by the waters and was approached by a causeway twenty cubits wide. It had windows on all sides commanding an ocean- view; its floor was paved with parti-coloured marbles and its ceiling was painted in the richest pigments and figured with gold and lapis-lazuli. They furnished it for Kamar al-Zaman with splendid upholstery, embroidered rugs and carpets of the richest silk; and they clothed the walls with choice brocades and hung curtains bespangled with gems of price. In the midst they set him a couch of juniper[FN#280]-wood inlaid with pearls and jewels, and Kamar al-Zaman sat down thereon, but the excess of his concern and passion for the young lady had wasted his charms and emaciated his body; he could neither eat nor drink nor sleep; and he was like a man who had been sick twenty years of sore sickness. His father seated himself at his head, grieving for him with the deepest grief, and every Monday and Thursday he gave his Wazirs and Emirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and Lords of the realm and levies and the rest of his lieges leave to come up to him in that pavilion. So they entered and did their several service and duties and abode with him till the end of the day, when they went their ways and the King returned to his son in the pavilion whom he left not night nor day; and he ceased not doing on this wise for many days and nights. Such was the case with Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman; but as regards Princess Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seven Palaces, when the two Jinns bore her up and laid her on her bed, she slept till daybreak, when she awoke and sitting upright looked right and left, but saw not the youth who had lain in her bosom. At this her vitals fluttered, her reason fled and she shrieked a loud shriek which awoke all her slave girls and nurses and duennas. They flocked in to her; and the chief of them came forward and asked, \"What aileth thee, O my lady?\" Answered the Princess, \"O wretched old woman, where is my beloved, the handsome youth who lay last night in my bosom? Tell me whither he is gone.\" Now when the duenna heard this, the light starkened in her sight and she feared from her mischief with sore affright, and said to her, \"O my Lady Budur, what unseemly words are these?\" Cried the Princess, \"Woe to thee pestilent crone that thou art! I ask thee again where is my beloved, the goodly youth with the shining face and the slender form, the jetty eyes and the joined eyebrows, who lay with me last night from supper-tide until near daybreak?\" She rejoined \"By Allah, O my lady, I have seen no young man nor any other. I conjure thee, carry not this unseemly jest too far lest we all lose our lives; for perhaps the joke may come to thy father's ears and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the duenna bespake the Lady Budur in these words, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady! carry not this unseemly jest too far; for perhaps it may come to thy father's ears, and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\" The Princess rejoined, \"In very sooth a youth lay with me last night, one of the fairest-faced of men.\" Exclaimed the duenna, \"Heaven preserve thy reason! indeed no one lay with thee last night.\" Thereupon the Princess looked at her hand and, finding Kamar al-Zaman's seal-ring on her finger in stead of her own, said to her, \"Woe to thee, thou accursed! thou traitress! wilt thou lie to me and tell me that none lay with me last night and swear to me a falsehood in the name of the Lord?\" Replied the duenna, \"By Allah, I do not lie to thee nor have I sworn falsely.\" Then the Princess was incensed by her words and, drawing a sword she had by her, she smote the old woman with it and slew her;[FN#281] whereupon the eunuch and the waiting-women and the concubines cried out at her, and ran to her father and, without stay or delay, acquainted him with her case. So the King went to her, and asked her, \"O my daughter, what aileth thee?\"; and she answered, \"O my father, where is the youth who lay with me last night?\" Then her reason fled from her head and she cast her eyes right and left and rent her raiment even to the skirt. When her sire saw this, he bade the women lay hands on her; so they seized her and manacled her, then putting a chain of iron about her neck, made her fast to one of the palace-windows and there left her.[FN#282] Thus far concerning Princess Budur; but as regards her father, King Ghayur, the world was straitened upon him when he saw what had befallen his daughter, for that he loved her and her case was not a little grievous to him. So he summoned on it the doctors and astrologers and men skilled in talisman- writing and said to them, \"Whoso healeth my daughter of what ill she hath, I will marry him to her and give him half of my kingdom; but whoso cometh to her and cureth her not, I will strike off his head and hang it over her palace-gate.\" Accordingly, all who went in to her, but failed to heal her, he beheaded and hung their heads over the palace-gates, till he had beheaded on her account forty doctors and crucified forty astrologers; wherefor the general held aloof from her, all the physicians having failed to medicine her malady; and her case was a puzzle to the men of science and the adepts in cabalistic characters. And as her longing and passion redoubled and love and distraction were sore upon her, she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"My fondness, O my moon, for thee my foeman is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to thy comradeship the nights my thought compel:\nIn gloom I bide with fire that flames below my ribs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose lowe I make comparison with heat of Hell:\nI'm plagued with sorest stress of pine and ecstasy; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor clearest noon tide can that horrid pain dispel.\"\n\nThen she sighed and repeated these also,\n\n\"Salams fro' me to friends in every stead; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Indeed to all dear friends do I incline:\nSalams, but not salams that bid adieu; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Salams that growth of good for you design:\nI love you dear, indeed, nor less your land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But bide I far from every need of mine!\"\n\nAnd when the Lady Budur ceased repeating her poetry, she wept till her eyes waxed sore and her cheeks changed form and hue, and in this condition she continued three years. Now she had a foster-brother, by name Marzaw\u00e1n,[FN#283] who was travelling in far lands and absent from her the whole of this time. He loved her with an exceeding love, passing the love of brothers; so when he came back he went in to his mother and asked for his sister, the Princess Budur. She answered him, \"O my son, thy sister hath been smitten with madness and hath passed these three years with a chain of iron about her neck; and all the physicians and men of science have failed of healing her.\" When Marzawan heard these words he said, \"I must needs go in to her; peradventure I may discover what she hath, and be able to medicine her;\" and his mother replied, \"Needs must thou visit her, but wait till to morrow, that I may contrive some thing to suit thy case.\" Then she went a-foot to the palace of the Lady Budur and, accosting the eunuch in charge of the gates, made him a present and said to him, \"I have a daughter, who was brought up with thy mistress and since then I married her; and, when that befel the Princess which befel her, she became troubled and sore concerned, and I desire of thy favour that my daughter may go in to her for an hour and look on her; and then return whence she came, so shall none know of it.\" Quoth the eunuch, \"This may not be except by night, after the King hath visited his child and gone away; then come thou and thy daughter.\" So she kissed the eunuch's hand and, returning home, waited till the morrow at nightfall; and when it was time she arose and sought her son Marzawan and attired him in woman's apparel; then, taking his hand in hers, led him towards the palace, and ceased not walking with him till she came upon the eunuch after the Sultan had ended his visit to the Princess. Now when the eunuch saw her, he rose to her, and said, \"Enter, but do not prolong thy stay!\" So they went in and when Marzawan beheld the Lady Budur in the aforesaid plight, he saluted her, after his mother had doffed his woman's garb: then he took out of their satchel books he had brought with him; and, lighting a wax- candle, he began to recite certain conjurations Thereupon the Princess looked at him and recognising him, said, \"O my brother, thou hast been absent on thy travels' and thy news have been cut off from us.\" He replied, \"True! but Allah hath brought me back safe and sound, I am now minded to set out again nor hath aught delayed me but the news I hear of thee; wherefore my heart burned for thee and I came to thee, so haply I may free thee of thy malady.\" She rejoined, O my brother, thinkest thou it is madness aileth me?\" \"Yes.\" answered he, and she said, \"Not so, by Allah! 'tis even as saith the poet,\n\n'Quoth they 'Thou rav'st on him thou lov'st': quoth I, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'The sweets of love are only for th' insane!'\nLove never maketh Time his friend befriend; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Only the Jinn-struck wight such boon can gain:\nWell! yes, I'm mad: bring him who madded me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, if he cure m: madness, blame restrain!'\"\n\nThen she let Marzawan know that she was love-daft and he said \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply there may be in my hand something which shall be a means of deliverance for thee.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of da, and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Marzawar thus addressed Princess Budur, \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply Allah may inspire me with a means of deliverance for thee.\" Quoth she, \"O my brother, hear my story which is this. One night I awoke from sleep, in the last third of the night[FN#284] and, sitting up, saw by my side the handsomest of youths that be, and tongue faileth to describe him, for he was as a willow-wand or an Indian rattan-cane. So methought it was my father who had done on this wise in order thereby to try me, for that he had consulted me concerning wedlock, when the Kings sought me of him to wife, and I had refused. It was this though withheld me from arousing him, for I feared that, if I did aught of embraced him, he would peradventure inform my father of m, doings. But in the morning, I found on my finger his seal-ring, in place of my own which he had taken. And, O my brother, m, heart was seized with love of him at first sight; and, for the violence of my passion and longing, I have never savoured the taste of sleep and have no occupation save weeping alway and repeating verses night and day. And this, O my brother, is my story and the cause of my madness.\" Then she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Now Love hast banished all that bred delight; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With that heart-nibbling fawn my joys took flight:\nLightest of trifles lover's blood to him *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who wastes the vitals of the hapless wight!\nFor him I'm jealous of my sight and thought; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart acts spy upon my thought and sight:\nThose long-lashed eyelids rain on me their shafts *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Guileful, destroying hearts where'er they light:\nNow, while my portion in the world endures, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall I behold him ere I quit world-site?\nWhat bear I for his sake I'd hide, but tears *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Betray my feelings to the spy's despight.\nWhen near, our union seemeth ever far; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When far, my thoughts to him aye nearest are.\"\n\nAnd presently she continued, \"See then, O my brother, how thou mayest aid me in mine affliction.\" So Marzawan bowed his head ground-wards awhile, wondering and not knowing what to do, then he raised it and said to her, \"All thou hast spoken to me I hold to be true, though the case of the young man pass my understanding: but I will go round about all lands and will seek for what may heal thee; haply Allah shall appoint thy healing to be at my hand. Meanwhile, take patience and be not disquieted.\" Thereupon Marzawan farewelled her, praying that she might be constant and left her repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Thine image ever companies my sprite, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    For all thou'rt distant from the pilgrim's sight:\nBut my heart-wishes e'er attract thee near: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    What is the lightning's speed to Thought's swift flight?\nThen go not thou, my very light of eyes *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which, when thou'rt gone, lack all the Kohl of light.\"\n\nThen Marzawan returned to his mother's house, where he passed the night. And when the morrow dawned, having equipped himself for his journey, he fared forth and ceased not faring from city to city and from island to island for a whole month, till he came to a town named Al-Tayrab.[FN#285] Here he went about scenting news of the townsfolk, so haply he might light on a cure for the Princess's malady, for in every capital he entered or passed by, it was reported that Queen Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, had lost her wits. But arriving at Al-Tayrab city, he heard that Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, was fallen sick and afflicted with melancholy madness. So Marzawan asked the name of the Prince's capital and they said to him, \"It is on the Islands of Khalidan and it lieth distant from our city a whole month's journey by sea, but by land it is six months' march.\" So he went down to the sea in a ship which was bound for the Khalidan Isles, and she sailed with a favouring breeze for a whole month, till they came in sight of the capital; and there remained for them but to make the land when, behold, there came out on them a tempestuous wind which carried away the masts and rent the canvas, so that the sails fell into the sea and the ship capsized, with all on board,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship capsized with all on board, each sought his own safety; and as for Marzawan the set of the sea carried him under the King's palace, wherein was Kamar al-Zaman. And by the decree of destiny it so happened that this was the day on which King Shahriman gave audience to his Grandees and high officers, and he was sitting, with his son's head on his lap, whilst an eunuch fanned away the flies; and the Prince had not spoken neither had he eaten nor drunk for two days, and he was grown thinner than a spindle.[FN#286] Now the Wazir was standing respectfully a-foot near the latticed window giving on the sea and, raising his eyes, saw Marzawan being beaten by the billows and at his last gasp; whereupon his heart was moved to pity for him, so he drew near to the King and moving his head towards him said, \"I crave thy leave, O King, to go down to the court of the pavilion and open the water-gate that I may rescue a man who is at the point of drowning in the sea and bring him forth of danger into deliverance; peradventure, on this account Allah may free thy son from what he hath!\" The King replied, \"O thou Wazir, enough is that which hath befallen my son through thee and on shine account. Haply, if thou rescue this drowning man, he will come to know our affairs, and look on my son who is in this state and exult over me; but I swear by Allah, that if this half-drowned wretch come hither and learn our condition and look upon my son and then fare forth and speak of our secrets to any, I will assuredly strike off thy head before his; for thou, O my Minister art the cause of all that hath betided us, first and last. Now do as thou wilt.\" Thereupon the Wazir sprang up and, opening the private pastern which gave upon the sea, descended to the causeway; then walked on twenty steps and came to the water where he saw Marzawan nigh unto death. So he put out his hand to him and, catching him by his hair, drew him ashore in a state of insensibility, with belly full of water and eyes half out of his head. The Wazir waited till he came to himself, when he pulled off his wet clothes and clad him in a fresh suit, covering his head with one of his servants' turbands; after which he said to him, Know that I have been the means of saving thee from drowning: do not thou requite me by causing my death and shine own.\"\u00c4And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir did to Marzawan what he did, he thus addressed him Know that I have been the cause of saving thee from drowning so requite me not by causing my death and shine own.\" Asked Marzawan, And how so?\"; and the Wazir answered, \"Thou art at this hour about to go up and pass among Emirs and Wazirs all of them silent and none speaking, because of Kamar al-Zaman the son of the Sultan.\" Now when Marzawan heard the name of Kamar al-Zaman, he knew that this was he whom he had heard spoken of in sundry cities and of whom he came in search, but he feigned ignorance and asked the Wazir, \"And who is Kamar al-Zaman? Answered the Minister, \"He is the son of Sultan Shahriman and he is sore sick and lieth strown on his couch restless alway, eating not nor drinking neither sleeping night or day; indeed he is nigh upon death and we have lost hope of his living and are certain that he is dying. Beware lest thou look too long on him, or thou look on any other than that where thou settest thy feet: else thou art a lost man, and I also.\" He replied, \"Allah upon thee, O Wazir, I implore thee, of thy favour, acquaint me touching this youth thou describest, what is the cause of the condition in which he is.\" The Wazir replied, \"I know none, save that, three years ago, his father required him to wed, but he refused; whereat the King was wroth and imprisoned him. And when he awoke on the morrow, he fancied that during the night he had been roused from sleep and had seen by his side a young lady of passing loveliness, whose charms tongue can never express; and he assured us that he had plucked off her seal-ring from her finger and had put it on his own and that she had done likewise; but we know not the secret of all this business. So by Allah, O my son, when thou comest up with me into the palace, look not on the Prince, but go thy way; for the Sultan's heart is full of wrath against me.\" So said Marzawan to himself, \"By Allah; this is the one I sought!\" Then he followed the Wazir up to the palace, where the Minister seated himself at the Prince's feet; but Marzawan found forsooth nothing to do but go up to Kamar al-Zaman and stand before him at gaze. Upon this the Wazir, died of affright in his skin, and kept looking at Marzawan and signalling him to wend his way; but he feigned not to see him and gave not over gazing upon Kamar al- Zaman, till he was well assured that it was indeed he whom he was seeking,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan looked upon Kamar al-Zaman and knew that it was indeed he whom he was seeking, he cried, \"Exalted be Allah, Who hath made his shape even as her shape and his complexion as her complexion and his cheek as her cheek!'' Upon this Kamar al-Zaman opened his eyes and gave earnest ear to his speech; and, when Marzawan saw him inclining to hear, he repeated these couplets[FN#287],\n\n\"I see thee full of song and plaint and love's own ecstasy;\nDelighting in describing all the charms of loveliness:\n\nArt smit by stroke of Love or hath shaft-shot wounded thee?\nNone save the wounded ever show such signals of distress!\nHo thou! crown the wine cup and sing me singular\nPraises to Sulaym\u00e1, Al-Rab\u00e1b, Tan'oum addrest;[FN#288]\n\nGo round the grape-vine sun[FN#289] which for mansion hath a jar;\nWhose East the cup boy is, and here my mouth that opes for West.\n\nI'm jealous of the very clothes that dare her sides enroll\nWhen she veils her dainty body of the delicatest grace:\n\nI envy every goblet of her lips that taketh toll\nWhen she sets the kissing cup on that sweetest kissing-place.\n\nBut deem not by the keen-edged scymitar I'm slain\u2014\nThe hurts and harms I dree are from arrows of her eyes.\n\nI found her finger tips, as I met her once again,\nDeep-reddened with the juice of the wood that ruddy dyes;[FN#290]\n\nAnd cried, 'Thy palms thou stainedst when far away was I\nAnd this is how thou payest one distracted by his pine!'\n\nQuoth she (enkindling in my heart a flame that burned high\nSpeaking as one who cannot hide of longing love the sign),\n\n'By thy life, this is no dye used for dyeing; so forbear\nThy blame, nor in charging me with falsing Love persist!\n\nBut when upon our parting-day I saw thee haste to fare,\n\nThe while were bared my hand and my elbow and my wrist;\n\n'I shed a flood of blood-red tears and with fingers brushed away; Hence blood-reddened were the tips and still blood-red they remain.'\n\nHad I wept before she wept, to my longing-love a prey,\nBefore repentance came, I had quit my soul of pain;\n\nBut she wept before I wept and I wept to see her care\nAnd I said, 'All the merit to precedent;'[FN#291]\n\nBlame me not for loving her, now on self of Love I swear\nFor her sake, for her only, these pains my soul torment.\n\nShe hath all the lere of Lukm\u00e1n[FN#292] and Y\u00fasuf's beauty lief;\nSweet singer David's voice and Maryam's chastity:\n\nWhile I've all Jacob's mourning and Jonah's prison-grief,\nAnd the sufferings of Job and old Adam's history:\n\nYet kill her not, albeit of my love for her I die;\nBut ask her why my blood to her was lawful. ask her why?\"\n\nWhen Marzawan recited this ode, the words fell upon Kamar al- Zaman's heart as freshness after fever and returning health; and he sighed and, turning his tongue in his mouth, said to his sire, \"O my father, let this youth come and sit by my side.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to his sire, \"O my father, allow this youth to come and sit by my side.\" Now when the King heard these words from his son, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, though at the first his heart had been set against Marzawan and he had determined that the stranger's head needs must be stricken off: but when he heard Kamar al-Zaman speak, his anger left him and he arose and drawing Marzawan to him, seated him by his son and turning to him said, \"Praised be Allah for thy safety!\" He replied, \"Allah preserve thee! and preserve thy son to thee!\" and called down blessings on the King. Then the King asked, \"From what country art thou?\"; and he answered, \"From the Islands of the Inland Sea, the kingdom of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas and the Seven Palaces.\" Quoth King Shahriman, \"Maybe thy coming shall be blessed to my son and Allah vouchsafe to heal what is in him.\" Quoth Marzawan, \"Inshallah, naught shall be save what shall be well!\" Then turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he said to him in his ear unheard of the King and his court, 'O my lord! be of good cheer, and hearten thy heart and let shine eyes be cool and clear and, with respect to her for whose sake thou art thus, ask not of her case on shine account. But thou keptest thy secret and fellest sick, while she told her secret and they said she had gone mad; so she is now in prison, with an iron chain about her neck, in most piteous plight; but, Allah willing, the healing of both of you shall come from my hand.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, his life returned to him and he took heart and felt a thrill of joy and signed to his father to help him sit up; and the King was like to fly for gladness and rose hastily and lifted him up. Presently, of his fear for his son, he shook the kerchief of dismissal[FN#293]; and all the Emirs and Wazirs withdrew; then he set two pillows for his son to lean upon, after which he bade them perfume the palace with saffron and decorate the city, saying to Marzawan, \"By Allah, O my son, of a truth shine aspect be a lucky and a blessed!\" And he made as much of him as he might and called for food, and when they brought it, Marzawan came up to the Prince and said, \"Rise, eat with me.\" So he obeyed him and ate with him, and all the while the King invoked blessings on Marzawan and said, \"How auspicious is thy coming, O my son!\" And when the father saw his boy eat, his joy and gladness redoubled, and he went out and told the Prince's mother and all the household. Then he spread throughout the palace the good news of the Prince's recovery and the King commanded the decoration of the city and it was a day of high festival. Marzawan passed that night with Kamar al-Zaman, and the King also slept with them in joy and delight for his son's recovery.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman also passed that night with them in the excess of his joy for his son's recovery. And when the next morning dawned, and the King had gone away and the two young men were left alone, Kamar al-Zaman told his story from beginning to end to Marzawan who said, \"In very sooth I know her with whom thou didst foregather; her name is the Princess Budur and she is daughter to King Ghayur.\" Then he related to him all that had passed with the Princess from first to last and acquainted him with the excessive love she bore him, saying, \"All that befel thee with thy father hath befallen her with hers, and thou art without doubt her beloved, even as she is shine; so brace up thy resolution and take heart, for I will bring thee to her and unite you both anon and deal with you even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Albe to lover adverse be his love, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And show aversion howso may he care;\nYet will I manage that their persons[FN#294] meet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'en as the pivot of a scissor pair.\"\n\nAnd he ceased not to comfort and solace and encourage Kamar al- Zaman and urged him to eat and drink till he ate food and drank wine, and life returned to him and he was saved from his ill case; and Marzawan cheered him and diverted him with talk and songs and stories, and in good time he became free of his disorder and stood up and sought to go to the Hammam.[FN#295] So Marzawan took him by the hand and both went to the bath, where they washed their bodies and made them clean.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundredth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, went to the Hammam, his father in his joy at this event freed the prisoners, and presented splendid dresses to his grandees and bestowed large alm-gifts upon the poor and bade decorate the city seven days. Then quoth Marzawan to Kamar al-Zaman, \"Know, O my lord, that I came not from the Lady Budur save for this purpose, and the object of my journey was to deliver her from her present case; and it remaineth for us only to devise how we may get to her, since thy father cannot brook the thought of parting from thee. So it is my counsel that to-morrow thou ask his leave to go abroad hunting. Then do thou take with thee a pair of saddle-bags full of money and mount a swift steed, and lead a spare horse, and I will do the like, and say to thy sire, 'I have a mind to divert myself with hunting the desert and to see the open country and there to pass one night.' Suffer not any servant to follow us, for as soon as we reach the open country, we will go our ways.\" Kamar al- Zaman rejoiced in this plan with great joy and cried, \"It is good.\" Then he stiffened his back and, going in to his father, sought his leave and spoke as he had been taught, and the King consented to his going forth a-hunting and said, \"O my son, blessed be the day that restoreth thee to health! I will not gainsay thee in this; but pass not more than one night in the desert and return to me on the morrow; for thou knowest that life is not good to me without thee, and indeed I can hardly believe thee to be wholly recovered from what thou hadst,[FN#296] because thou art to me as he of whom quoth the poet,\n\n'Albe by me I had through day and night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Solomon's carpet and the Chosroes' might,\nBoth were in value less than wing of gnat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unless these eyne could hold thee aye in sight.'\"[FN#297]\n\nThen the King equipped his son Kamar al-Zaman and Marzawan for the excursion, bidding make ready for them four horses, together with a dromedary to carry the money and a camel to bear the water and belly timber; and Kamar al-Zaman forbade any of his attendants to follow him. His father farewelled him and pressed him to his breast and kissed him, saying, \"I ask thee in the name of Allah, be not absent from me more than one night, wherein sleep will be unlawful to me, for I am even as saith the poet,\n\n'Thou present, in the Heaven of heavens I dwell; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Bearing shine absence is of hells my Hell:\nPledged be for thee my soul! If love for thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be crime, my crime is of the fellest fell.\nDoes love-lowe burn thy heart as burns it mine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Doomed night and day Gehenna-fire to smell?'\"\n\nAnswered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O my father, Inshallah, I will lie abroad but one night!\" Then he took leave of him, and he and Marzawan mounted and leading the spare horses, the dromedary with the money and the camel with the water and victual, turned their faces towards the open country;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawning day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and First Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman and Marzawan fared forth and turned their faces towards the open country; and they travelled from the first of the day till nightfall, when they halted and ate and drank and fed their beasts and rested awhile; after which they again took horse and ceased not journeying for three days, and on the fourth they came to a spacious tract wherein was a thicket. They alighted in it and Marzawan, taking the camel and one of the horses, slaughtered them and cut off their flesh and stripped their bones. Then he doffed from Kamar al-Zaman his shirt and trousers which he smeared with the horse's blood and he took the Prince's coat which he tore to shreds and befouled with gore; and he cast them down in the fork of the road. Then they ate and drank and mounting set forward again; and, when Kamar al- Zaman asked why this was done, and said, \"What is this O my brother, and how shall it profit us?\"; Marzawan replied, \"Know that thy father, when we have outstayed the second night after the night for which we had his leave, and yet we return not, will mount and follow in our track till he come hither; and, when he happeneth upon this blood which I have spilt and he seeth thy shirt and trousers rent and gore-fouled, he will fancy that some accident befel thee from bandits or wild-beasts, so he will give up hope of thee and return to his city, and by this device we shall win our wishes.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"By Allah, this be indeed a rare device! Thou hast done right well.''[FN#298] Then the two fared on days and nights and all that while Kamar al-Zaman did naught but complain when he found himself alone, and he ceased not weeping till they drew near their journeys end, when he rejoiced and repeated these verses,\n\n\"Wilt tyrant play with truest friend who thinks of thee each\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     hour, * And after showing love-desire betray indifference?\nMay I forfeit every favour if in love I falsed thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thee I left, abandon me by way of recompense:\nBut I've been guilty of no crime such harshness to deserve, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if I aught offended thee I bring my penitence;\nOf Fortune's wonders one it is thou hast abandoned me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Fortune never wearieth of showing wonderments.\"\n\nWhen he had made an end of his verses, Marzawan said to him, \"Look! these be King Ghayur's Islands;\" whereat Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done, and kissed him between the eyes and strained him\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan said \"Look! these be the Islands of King Ghayur;\" Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done and kissed him between the eyes and strained him to his bosom. And after reaching the Islands and entering the city they took up their lodging in a khan, where they rested three days from the fatigues of their wayfare; after which Marzawan carried Kamar al-Zaman to the bath and, clothing him in merchant's gear, provided him with a geomantic tablet of gold,[FN#299] with a set of astrological instruments and with an astrolabe of silver, plated with gold. Then he said to him, \"Arise, O my lord, and take thy stand under the walls of the King's palace and cry out, 'I am the ready Reckoner; I am the Scrivener; I am he who weeteth the Sought and the Seeker; I am the finished man of Science; I am the Astrologer accomplished in experience! Where then is he that seeketh?' As soon as the King heareth this, he will send after thee and carry thee in to his daughter the Princess Budur, thy lover; but when about going in to her do thou say to him, 'Grant me three days' delay, and if she recover, give her to me to wife; and if not, deal with me as thou dealest with those who forewent me.' He will assuredly agree to this, so as soon as thou art alone with her, discover thyself to her; and when she seeth thee, she will recover strength and her madness will cease from her and she will be made whole in one night. Then do thou give her to eat and drink. and her father, rejoicing in her recovery, will marry thee to her and share his kingdom with thee; for he hath imposed on himself this condition and so peace be upon thee.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words he exclaimed, \"May I never lack thy benefits!\", and, taking the set of instruments aforesaid, sallied forth from the caravanserai in the dress of his order. He walked on till he stood under the walls of King Ghayur's palace, where he began to cry out, saying, \"I am the Scribe, I am the ready Reckoner, I am he who knoweth the Sought and the Seeker; I am he who openeth the Volume and summeth up the Sums;[FN#300] who Dreams can expound whereby the sought is found! Where then is the seeker?\" Now when the city people heard this, they flocked to him, for it was long since they had seen Scribe or Astrologer, and they stood round him and, looking upon him, they saw one in the prime of beauty and grace and perfect elegance, and they marvelled at his loveliness, and his fine stature and symmetry. Presently one of them accosted him and said, \"Allah upon thee, O thou fair and young, with the eloquent tongue! incur not this affray; nor throw thy life away in thine ambition to marry the Princess Budur. Only cast shine eyes upon yonder heads hung up; all their owners have lost their lives in this same venture.\" Yet Kamar al-Zaman paid no heed to them, but cried out at the top of his voice, saying, \"I am the Doctor, the Scrivener! I am the Astrologer, the Calculator!\" And all the townsfolk forbade him from this, but he regarded them not at all, saying in his mind, \"None knoweth desire save whoso suffereth it.\" Then he began again to cry his loudest, shouting, \"I am the Scrivener, I am the Astrologer!\"\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman in no wise heeded the words of the citizens, but continued to cry out, \"I am the Calculator! I am the Astrologer!\" Thereupon all the townsfolk were wroth with him and said to him, \"Thou art nothing but an imbecile, silly, self-willed lad! Have pity on shine own youth and tender years and beauty and loveliness.\" But he cried all the more, \"I am the Astrologer, I am the Calculator! Is there any one that seeketh?\" As he was thus crying and the people forbidding him, behold, King Ghayur heard his voice and the clamour of the lieges and said to his Wazir, \"Go down and bring me yon Astrologer.\" So the Wazir, went down in haste, and taking Kamar al-Zaman from the midst of the crowd led him up to the King; and when in the presence he kissed the ground and began versifying,\n\n\"Eight glories meet, all, all conjoined in thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby may Fortune aye thy servant be:\nLere, lordliness, grace, generosity; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Plain words, deep meaning, honour, victory!\"\n\nWhen the King looked upon him, he seated him by his side and said to him, \"By Allah, O my son, an thou be not an astrologer, venture not thy life nor comply with my condition; for I have bound myself that whoso goeth in to my daughter and healeth her not of that which hath befallen her I will strike off his head; but whoso healeth her him I will marry to her. So let not thy beauty and loveliness delude thee: for, by Allah! and again, by Allah! If thou cure her not, I will assuredly cut off thy head.\" And Kamar al-Zaman replied, \"This is thy right; and I consent, for I wot of this ere came I hither.\" Then King Ghayur took the Kazis to witness against him and delivered him to the eunuch, saying, \"Carry this one to the Lady Budur.\" So the eunuch took him by the hand and led him along the passage; but Kamar al-Zaman outstripped him and pushed on before, whilst the eunuch ran after him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Hasten not to shine own ruin: never yet saw I astrologer so eager for his proper destruction; but thou weetest not what calamities are before thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman turned away his face from the eunuch,\u2014And Shah razed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the eunuch thus addressed Kamar al-Zaman, \"Patience, and no indecent hurry!\"; the Prince turned away his face and began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"A Sage, I feel a fool before thy charms; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Distraught, I wot not what the words I say:\nIf say I 'Sun,' away thou dost not pass *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From eyes of me, while suns go down with day:\nThou hast completed Beauty, in whose praise *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Speech-makers fail, and talkers lose their way.\"\n\nThen the eunuch stationed Kamar al-Zaman behind the curtain of the Princess's door and the Prince said to him, \"Which of the two ways will please thee more, treat and cure thy lady from here or go in and heal her within the curtain?\" The eunuch marvelled at his words and answered, \"An thou heal her from here it were better proof of thy skill.\" Upon this Kamar al-Zaman sat down behind the curtain and, taking out ink case, pen and paper, wrote the following: \"This is the writ of one whom passion swayeth,* and whom longing waylayeth * and wakeful misery slayeth * one who despaireth of living * and looketh for naught but dying * with whose mourning heart * nor comforter nor helper taketh part * One whose sleepless eyes * none succoureth from anxieties * whose day is passed in fire * and his night in torturing desire * whose body is wasted for much emaciation * and no messenger from his beloved bringeth him consolation.\" And after this he indited the following couplets,\n\n\"I write with heart devoted to thy thought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And eyelids chafed by tears of blood they bled;\nAnd body clad, by loving pine and pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In shirt of leanness, and worn down to thread,\nTo thee complain I of Love's tormentry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which ousted hapless Patience from her stead:\nA toi! show favour and some mercy deign, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For Passion's cruel hands my vitals shred.\"\n\nAnd beneath his lines he wrote these cadenced sentences, \"The heart's pain is removed * by union with the beloved * and whomso his lover paineth * only Allah assaineth! * If we or you have wrought deceit * may the deceiver win defeat! * There is naught goodlier than a lover who keeps faith * with the beloved who works him scathe.\" Then, by way of subscription, he wrote, \"From the distracted and despairing man * whom love and longing trepan * from the lover under passion's ban * the prisoner of transport and distraction * from this Kamar al-Zaman * son of Shahriman * to the peerless one * of the fair Houris the pearl-union * to the Lady Budur * daughter of King Al Ghayur * Know thou that by night I am sleepless * and by day in distress * consumed with increasing wasting and pain * and longing and love unfain * abounding in sighs * with tear flooded eyes * by passion captive ta'en * of Desire the slain * with heart seared by the parting of us twain * the debtor of longing bane, of sickness cup-companion * I am the sleepless one, who never closeth eye * the slave of love, whose tears run never dry * for the fire of my heart is still burning * and never hidden is the flame of my yearning.\" Then on the margin Kamar al-Zaman wrote this admired verse,\n\n\"Salem from graces hoarded by my Lord *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To her, who holds my heart and soul in hoard!\"\n\nAnd also these,\n\n\"Pray'ee grant me some words from your lips, belike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Such mercy may comfort and cool these eyne:\nFrom the stress of my love and my pine for you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I make light of what makes me despised, indign:\nAllah guard a folk whose abode was far, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And whose secret I kept in the holiest shrine:\nNow Fortune in kindness hath favoured me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thrown on threshold dust of this love o' mine:\nBy me bedded I looked on Bud\u00far, whose sun *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The moon of my fortunes hath made to shine.\"\n\nThen, having affixed his seal-ring to the missive, he wrote these couplets in the place of address,\n\n\"Ask of my writ what wrote my pen in dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And hear my tale of misery from this scroll;\nMy hand is writing while my tears down flow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to the paper 'plains my longing soul:\nMy tears cease not to roll upon this sheet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if they stopped I'd cause blood-gouts to roll.\"\n\nAnd at the end he added this other verse,\n\n\"I've sent the ring from off thy finger bore *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I when we met, now deign my ring restore!\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman set the Lady Budur's ring inside the letter and sealed it and gave it to the eunuch, who took it and went in with it to his mistress.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman, after setting the seal-ring inside the epistle, gave it to the eunuch who took it and went in with it to his mistress; and, when the Lady Budur opened it, she found therein her own very ring. Then she read the paper and when she understood its purport and knew that it was from her beloved, and that he in person stood behind the curtain, her reason began to fly and her breast swelled for joy and rose high; and she repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Long, long have I bewailed the sev'rance of our loves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With tears that from my lids streamed down like burning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rain;\nAnd vowed that, if the days deign reunite us two, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My lips should never speak of severance again:\nJoy hath o'erwhelmed me so that, for the very stress *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of that which gladdens me to weeping I am fain.\nTears are become to you a habit, O my eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So that ye weep as well for gladness as for pain.''[FN#301]\n\nAnd having finished her verse, the Lady Budur stood up forthwith and, firmly setting her feet to the wall, strained with all her might upon the collar of iron, till she brake it from her neck and snapped the chains. Then going forth from behind the curtain she threw herself on Kamar al-Zaman and kissed him on the mouth, like a pigeon feeding its young.[FN#302] And she embraced him with all the stress of her love and longing and said to him, \"O my lord do I wake or sleep and hath the Almighty indeed vouchsafe] us reunion after disunion? Laud be to Allah who hath our loves repaired, even after we despaired!\" Now when the eunuch saw her in this case, he went off running to King Ghayur and, kissing the ground before him, said, \"O my lord, know that this Astrologer is indeed the Shaykh of all astrologers, who are fools to him, all of them; for verily he hath cured thy daughter while standing behind the curtain and without going in to her.\" Quoth the King, \"Look well to it, is this news true?\" Answered the eunuch, \"O my lord, rise and come and see for thyself how she hath found strength to break the iron chains and is come forth to the Astrologer, kissing and embracing him.\" Thereupon the King arose and went in to his daughter who, when she saw him, stood up in haste and covered her head,[FN#303] and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"The toothstick love I not; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Siw\u00e1k,'[FN#304] I miss thee, for it sounds 'Siw\u00e1-ka'.\nThe caper-tree I love; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Ar\u00e1k'[FN#305] it sounds I look on thee, 'Ar\u00e1-ka.'\"\n\nThereupon the King was so transported for joy at her recovery that he felt like to fly and kissed her between the eyes, for he loved her with dearest love; then, turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he asked him who he was, and said, \"What countryman art thou?\" So the Prince told him his name and rank, and informed him that he was the son of King Shahriman, and presently related to him the whole story from beginning to end; and acquainted him with what happened between himself and the Lady Budur; and how he had taken her seal-ring from her finger and had placed it on his own; whereat Ghayur marvelled and said, \"Verily your story deserveth in books to be chronicled, and when you are dead and gone age after age be read.\" Then he summoned Kazis and witnesses forthright and married the Lady Budur to Prince Kamar al-Zaman; after which he bade decorate the city seven days long. So they spread the tables with all manner of meats, whilst the drums beat and the criers anounced the glad tidings, and all the troops donned their richest clothes; and they illuminated the city and held high festival. Then Kamar al-Zaman went in to the Lady Budur and the King rejoiced in her recovery and in her marriage; and praised Allah for that He had made her to fall in love with a goodly youth of the sons of Kings. So they unveiled her and displayed the bride before the bridegroom; and both were the living likeness of each other in beauty and comeliness and grace and love-allurement. Then Kamar al-Zaman lay with her that night and took his will of her, whilst she in like manner fulfilled her desire of him and enjoyed his charms and grace; and they slept in each other's arms till the morning. On the morrow, the King made a wedding-feast to which he gathered all comers from the Islands of the Inner and Outer Seas, and he spread the tables with choicest viands nor ceased the banquetting for a whole month. Now when Kamar al-Zaman had thus fulfilled his will and attained his inmost desire, and whenas he had tarried awhile with the Princess Budur, he bethought him of his father, King Shahriman, and saw him in a dream, saying, \"O my son, is it thus thou dealest with me?\" and recited in the vision these two couplets,\n\n\"Indeed to watch the darkness-moon he blighted me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to star-gaze through longsome night he plighted me:\nEasy, my heart! for haply he'll unite with thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And patience, Sprite! with whatso ills he dight to thee.\"\n\nNow after seeing his father in the dream and hearing his re preaches, Kamar al-Zaman awoke in the morning, afflicted and troubled, whereupon the Lady Budur questioned him and he told her what he had seen.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman acquainted the Lady Budur with what he had seen in his dream, she and he went in to her sire and, telling him what had passed, besought his leave to travel. He gave the Prince the permission he sought; but the Princess said, \"O my father, I cannot bear to be parted from him.\" Quoth Ghayur, her sire, \"Then go thou with him,\" and gave her leave to be absent a whole twelvemonth and afterwards to visit him in every year once; so she kissed his hand and Kamar al-Zaman did the like. Thereupon King Ghayur proceeded to equip his daughter and her bridegroom for the journey, and furnished them with outfit and appointments for the march; and brought out of his stables horses marked with his own brand, blood-dromedaries[FN#306] which can journey ten days without water, and prepared a litter for his daughter, besides loading mules and camels with victual; moreover, he gave them slaves and eunuchs to serve them and all manner of travellinggear; and on the day of departure, when King Ghayur took leave of Kamar al-Zaman, he bestowed on him ten splendid suits of cloth of gold embroidered with stones of price, together with ten riding horses and ten she-camels, and a treasury of money;[FN#307] and he charged him to love and cherish his daughter the Lady Budur. Then the King accompanied them to the farthest limits of his Islands where, going in to his daughter Budur in the litter, he kissed her and strained her to his bosom, weeping and repeating,\n\n\"O thou who wooest Severance, easy fare! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For love-embrace belongs to lover-friend:\nFare softly! Fortune's nature falsehood is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And parting shall love's every meeting end.\"\n\nThen leaving his daughter, he went to her husband and bade him farewell and kissed him; after which he parted from them and, giving the order for the march he returned to his capital with his troops. The Prince and Princess and their suite fared on without stopping through the first day and the second and the third and the fourth, nor did they cease faring for a whole month till they came to a spacious champaign, abounding in pasturage, where they pitched their tents; and they ate and drank and rested, and the Princess Budur lay down to sleep. Presently, Kamar al-Zaman went in to her and found her lying asleep clad in a shift of apricot-coloured silk that showed all and everything; and on her head was a coif of gold-cloth embroidered with pearls and jewels. The breeze raised her shift which laid bare her navel and showed her breasts and displayed a stomach whiter than snow, each one of whose dimples would contain an ounce of benzoin- ointment.[FN#308] At this sight, his love and longing redoubled, and he began reating,\n\n\"An were it asked me when by hell-fire burnt, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When flames of heart my vitals hold and hem,\n'Which wouldst thou chose, say wouldst thou rather them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or drink sweet cooling draught?' I'd answer, 'Them!' \"\n\nThen he put his hand to the band of her petticoat-trousers and drew it and loosed it, for his soul lusted after her, when he saw a jewel, red as dye-wood, made fast to the band. He untied it and examined it and, seeing two lines of writing graven thereon, in a character not to be read, marvelled and said in his mind, \"Were not this bezel something to her very dear she had not bound it to her trousers-band nor hidden it in the most privy and precious place about her person, that she might not be parted from it. Would I knew what she cloth with this and what is the secret that is in it.\" So saying, he took it and went outside the tent to look at it in the light,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he took the bezel to look at it in the light, the while he was holding it behold, a bird swooped down on him and, snatching the same from his hand, flew off with it and then lighted on the ground. There-upon Kamar al-Zaman fearing to lose the jewel, ran after the bird; but it flew on before him, keeping just out of his reach, and ceased not to draw him on from dale to dale and from hill to hill, till the night starkened and the firmament darkened, when it roosted on a high tree. So Kamar al-Zaman stopped under the tree confounded in thought and faint for famine and fatigue, and giving himself up for lost, would have turned back, but knew not the way whereby he came, for that darkness had overtaken him. Then he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious the Great!\"; and laying him down under the tree (whereon was the bird) slept till the morning, when he awoke and saw the bird also wake up and fly away. He arose and walked after it, and it flew on little by little before him, after the measure of his faring; at which he smiled and said, \"By Allah, a strange thing! Yesterday, this bird flew before me as fast as I could run, and to-day, knowing that I have awoke tired and cannot run, he flieth after the measure of my faring. By Allah, this is wonderful! But I must needs follow this bird whether it lead me to death or to life; and I will go wherever it goeth, for at all events it will not abide save in some inhabited land.[FN#309] So he continued to follow the bird which roosted every night upon a tree; and he ceased not pursuing it for a space of ten days, feeding on the fruits of the earth and drinking of its waters. At the end of this time, he came in sight of an inhabited city, whereupon the bird darted off like the glance of the eye and, entering the town, disappeared from Kamar al-Zaman, who knew not what it meant or whither it was gone; so he marvelled at this and exclaimed, \"Praise be to Allah who hath brought me in safety to this city!\" Then he sat down by a stream and washed his hands and feet and face and rested awhile; and, recalling his late easy and pleasant life of union with his beloved and contrasting it with his present plight of trouble and fatigue and distress and strangerhood and famine and severance, the tears streamed from his eyes and he began repeating these cinquains,\n\n\"Pain had I hid thy handwork, but it showed, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Changed sleep for wake, and wake with me abode:\nWhen thou didst spurn my heart I cried aloud *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pate, hold thy hand and cease to gird and goad:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          In dole and danger aye my sprite I spy!\nAn but the Lord of Love were just to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep fro' my eyelids ne'er were forced to flee.\nPity, my lady, one for love o' thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Prom his tribes darling brought to low degree:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Love came and doomed Wealth beggar-death to die.\nThe railers chide at thee: I ne'er gainsay, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But stop my ears and dumbly sign them Nay:\n'Thou lov'st a slender may,' say they; I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I've picked her out and cast the rest away:'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Enough; when Fate descends she blinds man's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          eye!\"[FN#310]\n\nAnd as soon as he had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he rose and walked on little by little, till he entered the city.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as Kamar al-Zaman had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he arose and entered the city-gate[FN#311] not knowing whither he should wend. He crossed the city from end to end, entering by the land-gate, and ceased not faring on till he came out at the sea- gate, for the city stood on the sea-shore. Yet he met not a single one of its citizens. And after issuing from the land-gate he fared forwards and ceased not faring till he found himself among the orchards and gardens of the place; and, passing among the trees presently came to a garden and stopped before its door; where-upon the keeper came out to him and saluted him. The Prince returned his greeting and the gardener bade him welcome, saying, \"Praised be Allah that thou hast come off safe from the dwellers of this city! Quick, come into the garth, ere any of the townfolk see thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered that garden, wondering in mind, and asked the keeper, \"What may be the history of the people of this city and who may they be?\" The other answered, \"Know that the people of this city are all Magians: but Allah upon thee, tell me how thou camest to this city and what caused thy coming to our capital.\" Accordingly Kamar al-Zaman told the gardener all that had befallen him from beginning to end, whereat he marvelled with great marvel and said, \"Know, O my son, that the cities of Al-Islam lie far from us; and between us and them is a four months' voyage by sea and a whole twelve months' journey by land. We have a ship which saileth every year with merchandise to the nearest Moslem country and which entereth the seas of the Ebony Islands and thence maketh the Khalidan Islands, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" Thereupon Kamar al- Zaman considered awhile and concluded that he could not do better than abide in the garden with the gardener and become his assistant, receiving for pay one fourth of the produce. So he said to him, \"Wilt thou take me into thy service, to help thee in this garden?\" Answered the gardener, \"To hear is to consent;\" and began teaching him to lead the water to the roots of the trees. So Kamar al-Zaman abode with him, watering the trees and hoeing up the weeds and wearing a short blue frock which reached to his knees. And he wept floods of tears; for he had no rest day or night, by reason of his strangerhood and he ceased not to repeat verses upon his beloved, amongst others the following couplets,\n\n\n\"Ye promised us and will ye not keep plight? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ye said a say and shall not deed be dight?\nWe wake for passion while ye slumber and sleep; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Watchers and wakers claim not equal right:\nWe vowed to keep our loves in secrecy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But spake the meddler and you spoke forthright:\nO friend in pain and pleasure, joy and grief, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In all case you, you only, claim my sprite!\nMid folk is one who holds my prisoned heart; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would he but show some ruth for me to sight.\nNot every eye like mine is wounded sore, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Not every heart like mine love-pipings blight:\nYe wronged me saying, Love is wrongous aye *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yea! ye were right, events have proved that quite.\nForget they one love-thralled, whose faith the world *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Robs not, though burn the fires in heart alight:\nIf an my foeman shall become my judge, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whom shall I sue to remedy his despight?\nHad not I need of love nor love had sought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart forsure were not thus love-distraught.\"\n\nSuch was the case with Kamar al-Zaman; but as regards his wife, the Lady Budur, when she awoke she sought her husband and found him not: then she saw her petticoat-trousers undone, for the band had been loosed and the bezel lost, whereupon she said to herself, \"By Allah, this is strange! Where is my husband? It would seem as if he had taken the talisman and gone away, knowing not the secret which is in it. Would to Heaven I knew whither can he have wended! But it must needs have been some extraordinary matter that drew him away, for he cannot brook to leave me a moment. Allah curse the stone and damn its hour!\" Then she considered awhile and said in her mind, \"If I go out and tell the varlets and let them learn that my husband is lost they will lust after me: there is no help for it but that I use stratagem. So she rose and donned some of her husband's clothes and riding- boots, and a turband like his, drawing one corner of it across her face for a mouth-veil.[FN#312] Then, setting a slave-girl in her litter, she went forth from the tent and called to the pages who brought her Kamar al-Zaman's steed; and she mounted and bade them load the beasts and resume the march. So they bound on the burdens and departed; and she concealed her trick, none doubting but she was Kamar al-Zaman, for she favoured him in face and form; nor did she cease journeying, she and her suite, days and nights, till they came in sight of a city overlooking the Salt Sea, where they pitched their tents without the walls and halted to rest. The Princess asked the name of the town and was told, \"It is called the City of Ebony; its King is named Arman\u00fas, and he hath a daughter Hay\u00e1t al-Nuf\u00fas[FN#313] hight,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur halted within sight of the Ebony City to take her rest, King Armanus sent a messenger, to learn what King it was who had encamped without his capital; so the messenger, coming to the tents, made inquiry anent their King, and was told that she was a King's son who had lost the way being bound for the Khalidan Islands; whereupon he returned to King Armanus with the tidings; and, when the King heard them, he straightway rode out with the lords of his land to greet the stranger on arrival. As he drew near the tents the Lady Budur came to meet him on foot, whereupon the King alighted and they saluted each other. Then he took her to the city and, bringing her up to the palace, bade them spread the tables and trays of food and commanded them to transport her company and baggage to the guess house. So they abode there three days; at the end of which time the King came in to the Lady Budur. Now she had that day gone to the Hammam and her face shone as the moon at its full, a seduction to the world and a rending of the veil of shame to mankind; and Armanus found her clad in a -suit of silk, embroidered with gold and jewels; so he said to her, 'O my son, know that I am a very old man, decrepit withal, and Allah hath blessed me with no child save one daughter, who resembleth thee in beauty and grace; and I am now waxed unfit for the conduct of the state. She is shine, O my son; and, if this my land please thee and thou be willing to abide and make thy home here, I will marry thee to her and give thee my kingdom and so be at rest.\" When Princess Budur heard this, she bowed her head and her forehead sweated for shame, and she said to herself. \"How shall I do, and I a woman? If I refuse and depart from him, I cannot be safe but that haply send after me troops to slay me; and if I consent, belike I shall be put to shame. I have lost my beloved Kamar al-Zaman and know not what is become of him; nor can I escape from this scrape save by holding my peace and consenting and abiding here, till Allah bring about what is to be.\" So she raised her head and made submission to King Armanus, saying, \"Hearkening and obedience!\"; whereat he rejoiced and bade the herald make proclamation throughout the Ebony Islands to hold high festival and decorate the houses. Then he assembled his Chamberlains and Nabobs, and Emirs and Wazirs and his officers of state and the Kazis of the city; and, formally abdicating his Sultanate, endowed Budur therewith and invested her in all the vestments of royalty. The Emirs and Grandees went in to her and did her homage, nothing doubting but that she was a young man, and all who looked on her bepissed their bag-trousers, for the excess of her beauty and loveliness. Then, after the Lady Budur had been made Sultan and the drums had been beaten in announcement of the glad event, and she had been ceremoniously enthroned, King Armanus proceeded to equip his daughter Hayat al-Nufus for marriage, and in a few days, they brought the Lady Budur in to her, when they seemed as it were two moons risen at one time or two suns in conjunction. So they entered the bridal-chamber and the doors were shut and the curtains let down upon them, after the attendants had lighted the wax-candles and spread for them the carpet-bed. When Budur found herself alone with the Princess Hayat al-Nufus, she called to mind her beloved Kamar al-Zaman and grief was sore upon her. So she wept for his absence, and estrangement and she began repeating,\n\n\"O ye who fled and left my heart in pain low li'en, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No breath of life if found within this frame of mine:\nI have an eye which e'er complains of wake, but lo! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tears occupy it would that wake content these eyne!\nAfter ye marched forth the lover 'bode behind; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Question of him what pains your absence could design!\nBut for the foods of tears mine eyelids rail and rain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My fires would flame on high and every land calcine.\nTo Allah make I moan of loved ones lost for aye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who for my pine and pain no more shall pain and pine:\nI never wronged them save that over love I nurst: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Love departs us lovers into blest and curst.\"\n\nAnd when she had finished her repeating, the Lady Budur sat down beside the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and kissed her on the mouth; after which rising abruptly, she made the minor ablution and betook herself to her devotions; nor did she leave praying till Hayat al-Nufus fell asleep, when she slips into bed and lay with her back to her till morning. And when day had broke the King and Queen came in to their daughter and asked her how she did. whereupon she told them what she had seen, and repeated to them the verses she had heard. Thus far concerning Hayat al-Nufus and her father; but as regards Queen Budur she went forth and seated herself upon the royal throne and all the Emirs and Captains and Officers of state came up to her and wished her joy of the kingship, kissing the earth before her and calling down blessings upon her. And she accosted them with smiling face and clad them in robes of honour, augmenting the fiefs of the high officials and giving largesse to the levies; wherefore all the people loved her and offered up prayers for the long endurance of her reign, doubting not but that she was a man. And she ceased not sitting all day in the hall of audience, bidding and forbidding; dispensing justice, releasing prisoners and remitting the customs-dues, till nightfall, when she withdrew to the apartment prepared for her. Here she found Hayat al-Nufus seated, so she sat down by her side and, clapping her on the back, coaxed and caressed her and kissed her between the eyes, and fell to versifying in these couplets,\n\n\"What secret kept I these my tears have told, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And my waste body must my love unfold:\nThough hid my pine, my plight on parting day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To every envious eye my secret sold:\nO ye who broke up camp, you've left behind *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My spirit wearied and my heart a-cold:\nIn my hearts core ye dwell, and now these eyne *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Roll blood-drops with the tears they whilome rolled:\nThe absent will I ransom with my soul; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All can my yearning for their sight behold:\nI have an eye whose babe,[FN#314] for love of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rejected sleep nor hath its tears controlled.\nThe foeman bids me patient bear his loss, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ne'er may mine ears accept the ruth he doled!\nI tricks their deme of me, and won my wish *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of Kamar al-Zaman's joys manifold:\nHe joins all perfect gifts like none before, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Boasted such might and main no King of old:\nSeeing his gifts, Bin Z\u00e1'idah's[FN#315] largesse *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Forget we, and Mu'\u00e1wiyah mildest-soul'd:[FN#316]\nWere verse not feeble and o'er short the time *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I had in laud of him used all of rhyme.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur stood up and wiped away her tears and, making the lesser ablution,[FN#317] applied her to pray: nor did she give over praying till drowsiness overcame the Lady Hayat al- Nufus and she slept, whereupon the Lady Budur came and lay by her till the morning. At daybreak, she arose and prayed the dawn- prayer; and presently seated herself on the royal throne and passed the day in ordering and counter ordering and giving laws and administering justice. This is how it fared with her; but as regards King Armanus he went in to his daughter and asked her how she did; so she told him all that had befallen her and repeated to him the verses which Queen Budur had recited, adding, \"O my father, never saw I one more abounding in sound sense and modesty than my husband, save that he cloth nothing but weep and sigh.\" He answered, \"O my daughter, have patience with him yet this third night, and if he go not in unto thee and do away thy maidenhead, we shall know how to proceed with him and oust him from the throne and banish him the country.\" And on this wise he agreed with his daughter what course he would take.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Tenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Armanus had agreed with his daughter on this wise and had determined what course he would take and night came on, Queen Budur arose from the throne of her kingdom and betaking herself to the palace, entered the apartment prepared for her. There she found the wax-candles lighted and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus seated and awaiting her; whereupon she bethought her of her husband and what had betided them both of sorrow and severance in so short a space; she wept and sighed and groaned groan upon groan, and began improvising these couplets,\n\n\"News of my love fill all the land, I swear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     As suns on Ghaz\u00e1[FN#318]-wold rain heat and glare:\nSpeaketh his geste but hard its sense to say; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thus never cease to grow my cark and care:\nI hate fair Patience since I loved thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'er sawest lover hate for love to bear?\nA glance that dealt love-sickness dealt me death, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Glances are deadliest things with torments rare:\nHe shook his love locks down and bared his chin, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby I spied his beauties dark and fair:\nMy care, my cure are in his hands; and he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who caused their dolour can their dole repair:\nHis belt went daft for softness of his waist; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His hips, for envy, to uprise forbear:\nHis brow curl-diademed is murky night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveil 't and lo! bright Morn shows brightest light.\"\n\nWhen she had finished her versifying, she would have risen to pray, but, lo and behold! Hayat al-Nufus caught her by the skirt and clung to her saying, \"O my lord, art thou not ashamed before my father, after all his favour, to neglect me at such a time as this?\" When Queen Budur heard her words, she sat down in the same place and said, \"O my beloved, what is this thou sayest?\" She replied, \"What I say is that I never saw any so proud of himself as thou. Is every fair one so disdainful? I say not this to incline thee to me; I say it only of my fear for thee from King Armanus; because he purposeth, unless thou go in unto me this very night, and do away my maidenhead, to strip thee of the kingship on the morrow and banish thee his kingdom; and peradventure his excessive anger may lead him to slay thee. But I, O my lord, have ruth on thee and give thee fair warning; and it is thy right to reck.\"[FN#319] Now when Queen Budur heard her speak these words, she bowed her head ground-wards awhile in sore perplexity and said in herself, \"If I refuse I'm lost; and if I obey I'm shamed. But I am now Queen of all the Ebony Islands and they are under my rule, nor shall I ever again meet my Kamar al- Zaman save in this place; for there is no way for him to his native land but through the Ebony Islands. Verily, I know not what to do in my present case, but I commit my care to Allah who directeth all for the best, for I am no man that I should arise and open this virgin girl.\" Then quoth Queen Budur to Hayat al- Nufus, \"O my beloved, that I have neglected thee and abstained from thee is in my own despite.\" And she told her her whole story from beginning to end and showed her person to her, saying, \"I conjure thee by Allah to keep my counsel, for I have concealed my case only that Allah may reunite me with my beloved Kamar al- Zaman and then come what may.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eleventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur acquainted Hayat al-Nufus with her history and bade her keep it secret, the Princess heard her with extreme wonderment and was moved to pity and prayed Allah to reunite her with her beloved, saying, \"Fear nothing, O my sister; but have patience till Allah bring to pass that which must come to pass:\" and she began repeating,\n\n\"None but the men of worth a secret keep;\nWith worthy men a secret's hidden deep;\nAs in a room, so secrets lie with me,\nWhose door is sealed, lock shot and lost the key.\"[FN#320]\n\nAnd when Hayat al-Nufus had ended her verses, she said, \"O my sister, verily the breasts of the noble and brave are of secrets the grave; and I will not discover shine.\" Then they toyed and embraced and kissed and slept till near the Mu'ezzin's call to dawn prayer, when Hayat al-Nufus arose and took a pigeon-poult,[FN#321] and cut its throat over her smock and besmeared herself with its blood. Then she pulled off her petticoat-trousers and cried aloud, where-upon her people hastened to her and raised the usual lullilooing and outcries of joy and gladness. Presently her mother came in to her and asked her how she did and busied herself about her and abode with her till evening; whilst the Lady Budur arose with the dawn, and repaired to the bath and, after washing herself pure, proceeded to the hall of audience, where she sat down on her throne and dispensed justice among the folk. Now when King Armanus heard the loud cries of joy, he asked what was the matter and was informed of the consummation of his daughter's marriage; whereat he rejoiced and his breast swelled with gladness and he made a great marriage-feast whereof the merry-making lasted a long time. Such was their case: but as regards King Shahriman it was on this wise. After his son had fared forth to the chase accompanied by Marzawan, as before related, he tarried patiently awaiting their return at nightfall; but when his son did not appear he passed a sleepless night and the dark hours were longsome upon him; his restlessness was excessive, his excitement grew upon him and he thought the morning would never dawn. Anc when day broke he sat expecting his son and waited till noon, but he came not; whereat his heart forebode separation and was fired with fears for Kamar al-Zaman; and he cried, \"Alas! my son!\" and he wept till his clothes were drenched with tears, and repeated with a beating heart,\n\n\n\"Love's votaries I ceased not to oppose, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Till doomed to taste Love's bitter and Love's sweet:\nI drained his rigour-cup to very dregs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Self humbled at its slaves' and freemen's feet:\nFortune had sworn to part the loves of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She kept her word how truly, well I weet!\"\n\nAnd when he ended his verse, he wiped away his tears and bade his troops make ready for a march and prepare for a long expedition. So they all mounted and set forth, headed by the Sultan, whose heart burnt with grief and was fired with anxiety for his son Kamar al-Zaman; and they advanced by forced marches. Now the King divided his host into six divisions, a right wing and a left wing, a vanguard and a rear guard;[FN#322] and bade them rendezvous for the morrow at the cross-roads. Accordingly they separated and scoured the country all the rest of that day till night, and they marched through the night and at noon of the ensuing day they joined company at the place where four roads met. But they knew not which the Prince followed, till they saw the sign of torn clothes and sighted shreds of flesh and beheld blood still sprinkled by the way and they noted every piece of the clothes and fragment of mangled flesh scattered on all sides. Now when King Shahriman saw this, he cried from his heart-core a loud cry, saying, \"Alas, my son!\"; and buffeted his face and plucks his beard and rent his raiment, doubting not but his son was dead. Then he gave himself up to excessive weeping and wailing, and the troops also wept for his weeping, all being assured that Prince Kamar al-Zaman had perished. They threw dust on their heads, and the night surprised them shedding tears and lamenting till they were like to die. Then the King with a heart on fire and with burning sighs spake these couplets,\n\n\"Chide not the mourner for bemourning woe; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Enough is yearning every Ill to show:\nHe weeps for stress of sorrow and of pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And these to thee best evidence his lowe:\nHappy![FN#323] of whom Love sickness swore that ne'er *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Should cease his eye lids loving tears to flow:\nHe mourns the loss of fairest, fullest Moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shining o'er all his peers in glorious glow:\nBut death made drink a brimming cup, what day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He fared from natal country fain to go:\nHis home left he and went from us to grief; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor to his brethren could he say adieu:\nYea, his loss wounded me with parting pangs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And separation cost me many a throe:\nHe fared farewelling, as he fared, our eyes; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Whenas his Lord vouch-safed him Paradise.\"\n\nAnd when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twelfth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital, giving up his son for lost, and deeming that wild beasts or banditti had set upon him and torn him to pieces; and made proclamation that all in the Khalidan Islands should don black in mourning for him. Moreover, he built, in his memory, a pavilion, naming it House of Lamentations; and on Mondays and Thursdays he devoted himself to the business of the state and ordering the affairs of his levies and lieges; and the rest of the week he was wont to spend in the House of Lamentations, mourning for his son and bewailing him with elegiac verses,[FN#324] of which the following are some:\u2014\n\n\"My day of bliss is that when thou appearest; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My day of bale[FN#325] is that whereon thou farest:\nThough through the night I quake in dread of death; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Union wi' thee is of all bliss the dearest.\"\n\nAnd again he said,\n\n\"My soul be sacrifice for one, whose going *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Afflicted hearts with sufferings sore and dread:\nLet joy her widowed term[FN#326] fulfil, for I *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Divorced joy with the divorce thrice-said.\"[FN#327]\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Queen Budur daughter of King Ghayur, she abode as ruler in the Ebony Islands, whilst the folk would point to her with their fingers, and say, \"Yonder is the son-in-law of King Armanus.\" And every night she lay with Hayat al-Nufus, to whom she lamented her desolate state and longing for her husband Kamar al-Zaman; weeping and describing to her his beauty and loveliness, and yearning to enjoy him though but in a dream: And at times she would repeat,\n\n\"Well Allah wots that since my severance from thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I wept till forced to borrow tears at usury:\n'Patience!' my blamer cried, 'Heartsease right soon shalt see!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Say, blamer, where may home of Patience be?'\"\n\nThis is how it fared with Queen Budur; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, he abode with the gardener in the garden for no short time, weeping night and day and repeating verses bewailing the past time of enjoyment and delight; whilst the gardener kept comforting him and assuring him that the ship would set sail for the land of the Moslems at the end of the year. And in this condition he continued till one day he saw the folk crowding together and wondered at this; but the gardener came in to him and said, \"O my son, give over work for this day nor lead water to the trees; for it is a festival day, whereon folk visit one another. So take thy rest and only keep shine eye on the garden, whilst I go look after the ship for thee; for yet but a little while and I send thee to the land of the Moslems.\" Upon this, he went forth from the garden leaving to himself Kamar al-Zaman, who fell to musing upon his case till his heart was like to break and the tears streamed from his eyes. So he wept with excessive weeping till he swooned away and, when he recovered, he rose and walked about the garden, pondering what Time had done with him and bewailing the long endurance of his estrangement and separation from those he loved. As he was thus absorbed in melancholy thought, his foot stumbled and he fell on his face, his forehead striking against the projecting root of a tree; and the blow cut it open and his blood ran down and mingled with his tears Then he rose and, wiping away the blood, dried his tears and bound his brow with a piece of rag; then continued his walk about the garden engrossed by sad reverie. Presently, he looked up at a tree and saw two birds quarrelling thereon, and one of them rose up and smote the other with its beak on the neck and severed from its body its head, wherewith it flew away, whilst the slain bird fell to the ground before Kamar al-Zaman. As it lay, behold, two great birds swooped down upon it alighting, one at the head and the other at the tail, and both drooped their wings and bowed their bills over it and, extending their necks towards it, wept. Kamar al-Zaman also wept when seeing the birds thus bewail their mate, and called to mind his wife and father, And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman wept and lamented his separation from spouse and sire, when he beheld those two birds weeping over their mate. Then he looked at the twain and saw them dig a grave and therein bury the slain bird; after which they flew away far into the firmament and disappeared for a while; but presently they returned with the murtherer-bird and, alighting on the grave of the murthered, stamped on the slayer till they had done him to death. Then they rent his belly and tearing out his entrails, poured the blood on the grave of the slain[FN#328]: moreover, they stripped off his skin and tare his flesh in pieces and, pulling out the rest of the bowels, scattered them hither and thither. All this while Kamar al-Zaman was watching them wonderingly; but presently, chancing to look at the place where the two birds had slain the third, he saw therein something gleaming. So he drew near to it and noted that it was the crop of the dead bird. Whereupon he took it and opened it and found the talisman which had been the cause of his separation from his wife. But when he saw it and knew it, he fell to the ground a-fainting for joy; and, when he revived, he said, \"Praised be Allah! This is a foretaste of good and a presage of reunion with my beloved.\" Then he examined the jewel and passed it over his eyes[FN#329]; after which he bound it to his forearm, rejoicing in coming weal, and walked about till nightfall awaiting the gardener's return; and when he came not, he lay down and slept in his wonted place. At daybreak he rose to his work and, girding his middle with a cord of palm- fibre, took hatchet and basket and walked down the length of the garden, till he came to a carob-tree and struck the axe into its roots. The blow rang and resounded; so he cleared away the soil from the place and discovered a trap-door and raised it.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the Two Hundred and Fourteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman raised the trap-door, he found a winding stair, which he descended and came to an ancient vault of the time of Ad and Tham\u00fad,[FN#330] hewn out of the rock. Round the vault stood many brazen vessels of the bigness of a great oil-jar which he found full of gleaming red gold: whereupon he said to himself, \"Verily sorrow is gone and solace is come!\" Then he mounted from the souterrain to the garden and, replacing the trap-door as it was before, busied himself in conducting water to the trees till the last of the day, when the gardener came back and said to him, \"O my son, rejoice at the good tidings of a speedy return to thy native land: the merchants are ready equipped for the voyage and the ship in three days' time will set sail for the City of Ebony, which is the first of the cities of the Moslems, and after making it, thou must travel by land a six months' march till thou come to the Islands of Khalidan, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" At this Kamar al-Zaman rejoiced and began repeating,\n\n\"Part not from one whose wont is not to part from you; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor with your cruel taunts an innocent mortify:\nAnother so long parted had ta'en heart from you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And had his whole condition changed,\u2014but not so I.\"\n\nThen he kissed the gardener's hand and said, \"O my father, even as thou hast brought me glad tidings, so I also have great good news for thee,' and told him anent his discovery of the vault; whereat the gardener rejoiced and said, \"O my son, fourscore years have I dwelt in this garden and have never hit on aught whilst thou, who hast not sojourned with me a year, hast discovered this thing; wherefore it is Heaven's gift to thee, which shall end thy crosses and aid thee to rejoin thy folk and foregather with her thou lovest.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"There is no help but it must be shared between me and thee.\" Then he carried him to the underground-chamber and showed him the gold, which was in twenty jars: he took ten and the gardener ten, and the old man said to him, \"O my son, fill thyself leather bottles[FN#331] with the sparrow-olives[FN#332] which grow in this garden, for they are not found except in our land; and the merchants carry them to all parts. Lay the gold in the bottles and strew it over with olives: then stop them and cover them and take them with thee in the ship.\" So Kamar al-Zaman arose without stay or delay and took fifty leather bottles and stored in each somewhat of the gold, and closed each one after placing a layer of olives over the gold; and at the bottom of one of the bottles he laid the talisman. Then sat he down to talk with the gardener, confident of speedy reunion with his own people and saying to himself, \"When I come to the Ebony Islands I will journey thence to my father's country and enquire for my beloved Budur. Would to Heaven I knew whether she returned to her own land or journeyed on to my father's country or whether there befel her any accident by the way.\" And he began versifying,\n\n\"Love in my breast they lit and fared away, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And far the land wherein my love is pent:\nFar lies the camp and those who camp therein; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Par is her tent-shrine, where I ne'er shall tent.\nPatience far deaf me when from me they fled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep failed mine eyes, endurance was forspent:\nThey left and with them left my every joy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wending with them, nor find I peace that went:\nThey made these eyes roll down love tears in flood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lacking them these eyne with tears are drent.\nWhen my taste spins once again would see them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When pine and expectation but augment,\nIn my heart's core their counterfeits I trace, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With love and yearning to behold their grace.\"\n\nThen, while he awaited the end of the term of days, he told the gardener the tale of the birds and what had passed between them; whereat the hearer wondered; and they both lay down and slept till the morning. The gardener awoke sick and abode thus two days; but on the third day, his sickness increased on him, till they despaired of his life and Kamar al-Zaman grieved with sore grief for him. Meanwhile behold, the Master and his crew came and enquired for the gardener; and, when Kamar al-Zaman told them that he was sick, they asked, \"Where be the youth who is minded to go with us to the Ebony Islands?\" \"He is your servent and he standeth before you!\" answered the Prince and bade them carry the bottles of olives to the ship; so they transported them, saying, \"Make haste, thou, for the wind is fair;\" and he replied, \"I hear and obey.\" Then he carried his provaunt on board and, returning to bid the gardener farewell, found him in the agonies of death; so he sat down at his head and closed his eyes, and his soul departed his body; whereupon he laid him out and committed him to the earth unto the mercy of Allah Almighty. Then he made for the ship but found that she had already weighed anchor and set sail; nor did she cease to cleave the seas till she disappeared from his sight. So he went back to whence he came heavy-hearted with whirling head; and neither would he address a soul nor return a reply; and reaching the garden and sitting down in cark and care he threw dust on his head and buffeted his cheeks.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship sped on her course, Kamar al-Zaman returned to the garden in cark and care; but- anon he rented the place of its owner and hired a man to help him in irrigating the trees. Moreover, he repaired the trap-door and he went to the underground chamber and bringing the rest of the gold to grass, stowed it in other fifty bottles which he filled up with a layer of olives. Then he enquired of the ship and they told him that it sailed but once a year, at which his trouble of mind redoubled and he cried sore for that which had betided him, above all for the loss of the Princess Budur's talisman, and spent his nights and days weeping and repealing verses. Such was his case; but as regards the ship she sailed with a favouring wind till she reached the Ebony Islands. Now by decree of destiny, Queen Budur was sitting at a lattice-window overlooking the sea and saw the galley cast anchor upon the strand. At this sight, her heart throbbed and she took horse with the Chamberlains and Nabobs and, riding down to the shore, halted by the ship, whilst the sailors broke bulk and bore the bales to the storehouses; after which she called the captain to her presence and asked what he had with him. He answered \"O King, I have with me in this ship aromatic drugs and cosmetics and healing powders and ointments and plasters and precious metals and rich stuffs and rugs of Yemen leather, not to be borne of mule or camel, and all manner of otters and spices and perfumes, civet and ambergris and camphor and Sumatra aloes-wood, and tamerinds[FN#333] and sparrow-olives to boot, such as are rare to find in this country.\" When she heard talk of sparrow- olives her heart longed for them and she said to the ship-master, \"How much of olives hast thou?\" He replied, \"Fifty bottles full, but their owner is not with us, so the King shall take what he will of them.\" Quoth she, \"Bring them ashore, that I may see them.'' Thereupon he called to the sailors, who brought her the fifty bottles; and she opened one and, looking at the olives, said to the captain, \"I will take the whole fifty and pay you their value, whatso it be.\" He answered, \"By Allah, O my lord, they have no value in our country; moreover their shipper tarried behind us, and he is a poor man.\" Asked she, \"And what are they worth here?\" and he answered \"A thousand dirhams.\" \"I will take them at a thousand,\" she said and bade them carry the fifty bottles to the palace. When it was night, she called for a bottle of olives and opened it, there being none in the room but herself and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then, placing a dish before her she turned into it the contents of the jar, when there fell out into the dish with the olives a heap of red gold; and she said to the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, \"This is naught but gold!\" So she sent for the rest of the bottles and found them all full of precious metal and scarce enough olives to fill a single jar. Moreover, she sought among the gold and found therein the talisman, which she took and examined and behold, it was that which Kamar al- Zaman had taken from off the band of her petticoat trousers. Thereupon she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Budur saw the talisman she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon; and when she recovered she said to herself, \"Verily, this talisman was the cause of my separation from my beloved Kamar al-Zaman; but now it is an omen of good.\" Then she showed it to Hayat al-Nufus and said to her, \"This was the cause of disunion and now, please Allah, it shall be the cause of reunion.\" As soon as day dawned she seated herself on the royal throne and sent for the ship-master, who came into the presence and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"Where didst thou leave the owner of these olives?\" Quoth he, \"O King of the age, we left him in the land of the Magians and he is a gardener there.\" She rejoined, \"Except thou bring him to me, thou knowest not the harm which awaiteth thee and thy ship.\" Then she bade them seal up the magazines of the merchants and said to them, \"Verily the owner of these olives hath borrowed of me and I have a claim upon him for debt and, unless ye bring him to me, I will without fail do you all die and seize your goods.\" So they went to the captain and promised him the hire of the ship, if he would go and return a second time, saying, \"Deliver us from this masterful tyrant.\" Accordingly the skipper embarked and set sail and Allah decreed him a prosperous voyage, till he came to the Island of the Magians and, landing by night, went up to the garden. Now the night was long upon Kamar al-Zaman, and he sat, bethinking him of his beloved, and bewailing what had befallen him and versifying,\n\n\"A night whose stars refused to run their course, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     A night of those which never seem outworn:\nLike Resurrection-day, of longsome length[FN#334] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To him that watched and waited for the morn.\"\n\nNow at this moment, the captain knocked at the garden-gate, and Kamar al-Zaman opened and went out to him, whereupon the crew seized him and went down with him on board the ship and set sail forthright; and they ceased not voyaging days and nights, whilst Kamar al-Zaman knew not why they dealt thus with him; but when he questioned them they replied, \"Thou hast offended against the Lord of the Ebony Islands, the son-in-law of King Armanus, and thou hast stolen his monies, miserable that thou art!\" Said he, \"By Allah! I never entered that country nor do I know where it is!\" However, they fared on with him, till they made the Ebony Islands and landing, carried him up to the Lady Budur, who knew him at sight and said, \"Leave him with the eunuchs, that they may take him to the bath.\" Then she relieved the merchants of the embargo and gave the captain a robe of honour worth ten thousand pieces of gold; and, after returning to the palace, she went in that night to the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and told her what had passed, saying, \"Keep thou my counsel, till I accomplish my purpose, and do a deed which shall be recorded and shall be read by Kings and commoners after we be dead and gone.\" And when she gave orders that they bear Kamar al-Zaman to the bath, they did so and clad him in a royal habit so that, when he came forth, he resembled a willow-bough or a star which shamed the greater and lesser light[FN#335] and its glow, and his life and soul returned to his frame. Then he repaired to the palace and went in to the Princess Budur; and when she saw him she schooled her heart to patience, till she should have accomplished her purpose; and she bestowed on him Mamelukes and eunuchs, camels and mules. Moreover, she gave him a treasury of money and she ceased not advancing him from dignity to dignity, till she made him Lord High Treasurer and committed to his charge all the treasures of the state; and she admitted him to familiar favour and acquainted the Emirs with his rank and dignity. And all loved him, for Queen Budur did not cease day by day to increase his allowances. As for Kamar al-Zaman, he was at a loss anent the reason of her thus honouring him; and he gave gifts and largesse out of the abundance of the wealth; and he devoted himself to the service of King Armanus; so that the King and all the Emirs and people, great and small, adored him and were wont to swear by his life. Nevertheless, he ever marvelled at the honour and favour shown him by Queen Budur and said to himself, \"By Allah, there needs must be a reason for this affection! Peradventure, this King favoureth me not with these immoderate favours save for some ill purpose and, therefore, there is no help but that I crave leave of him to depart his realm.\" So he went in to Queen Budur and said to her, \"O King, thou hast overwhelmed me with favours, but it will fulfil the measure of thy bounties if thou take from me all thou hast been pleased to bestow upon me, and permit me to depart.\" She smiled and asked, \"What maketh thee seek to depart and plunge into new perils, whenas thou art in the enjoyment of the highest favour and greatest prosperity?\" Answered Kamar al- Zaman, \"O King, verily this favour, if there be no reason for it, is indeed a wonder of wonders, more by token that thou hast advanced me to dignities such as befit men of age and experience, albeit I am as it were a young child.\" And Queen Budur rejoined, \"The reason is that I love thee for shine exceeding loveliness and thy surpassing beauty; and if thou wilt but grant me my desire of thy body, I will advance thee yet farther in honour and favour and largesse; and I will make thee Wazir, for all thy tender age even as the folk made me Sultan over them and I no older than thou; so that nowadays there is nothing strange when children take the head and by Allah, he was a gifted man who said,\n\n'It seems as though of Lot's tribe were our days, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And crave with love to advance the young in years.'\"[FN#336]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was abashed and his cheeks flushed till they seemed a-flame; and he said, \"I need not these favours which lead to the commission of sin; I will live poor in wealth but wealthy in virtue and honour.\" Quoth she, \"I am not to be duped by thy scruples, arising from prudery and coquettish ways; and Allah bless him who saith,\n\n'To him I spake of coupling, but he said to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    How long this noyous long persistency?'\nBut when gold piece I showed him, he cried, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'Who from the Almighty Sovereign e'er shall flee?'\"\n\nNow when Kamar al-Zaman, heard these words and understood her verses and their import, he said, \"O King, I have not the habit of these doings, nor have I strength to bear these heavy burthens for which elder than I have proved unable; then how will it be with my tender age?\" But she smiled at his speech and retorted, \"Indeed, it is a matter right marvellous how error springeth from the disorder of man's intendiment!! Since thou art a boy, why standest thou in fear of sin or the doing of things forbidden, seeing that thou art not yet come to years of canonical responsibility; and the offences of a child incur neither punishment nor reproof? Verily, thou hast committed thyself to a quibble for the sake of contention, and it is thy duty to bow before a proposal of fruition, so henceforward cease from denial and coyness, for the commandment of Allah is a decree foreordained:[FN#337] indeed, I have more reason than thou to fear falling and by sin to be misled; and well inspired was he who said,\n\n'My prickle is big and the little one said, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Thrust boldly in vitals with lion-like stroke!\nThen I, ' 'Tis a sin!; and he, 'No sin to me! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   So I had him at once with a counterfeit poke.\"[FN#338]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, the light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O King, thou hast in thy household fair women and female slaves, who have not their like in this age: shall not these suffice thee without me?

So he rose up with her, on this condition, and went with her to her own boudoir, that she might quench the lowe of her lust, saying, \"There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the fated decree of the All- powerful, the All-wise!\"; and he doffed his bag-trousers, shamefull and abashed, with the tears running from his eyes for stress of affright. Thereat she smiled and making him mount upon a couch with her, said to him, \"After this night, thou shalt see naught that will offend thee.\" Then she turned to him bussing and bosoming him and bending calf over calf, and said to him, \"Put thy hand between my thighs to the accustomed place; so haply it may stand up to prayer after prostration.\" He wept and cried, \"I am not good at aught of this,\" but she said, \"By my life, an thou do as I bid thee, it shall profit thee!\" So he put out his hand, with vitals a-fire for confusion, and found her thighs cooler than cream and softer than silk. The touching of them pleasured him and he moved his hand hither and thither, till it came to a dome abounding in good gifts and movements and shifts, and said in himself, \"Perhaps this King is a hermaphrodite,[FN#348] neither man nor woman quite;\" so he said to her, \"O King, I cannot find that thou hast a tool like the tools of men; what then moved thee to do this deed?\" Then loudly laughed Queen Budur till she fell on her back,[FN#349] and said, \"O my dearling, how quickly thou hast forgotten the nights we have lain together!\" Then she made herself known to him, and he knew her for his wife, the Lady Budur, daughter of King al-Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas. So he embraced her and she embraced him, and he kissed her and she kissed him; then they lay down on the bed of pleasure voluptuous, repeating the words of the poet,\n\n\"When his softly bending shape bid him close to my embrace *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which clips him all about like the tendrils of the vine\nAnd shed a flood of softness on the hardness of his heart, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He yielded though at first he was minded to decline;\nAnd dreading lest the railer's eye should light upon his form, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Came armoured with caution to baffle his design:\nHis waist makes moan of hinder cheeks that weigh upon his feet *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Like heavy load of merchandise upon young camel li'en;\nGirt with his glances scymitar which seemed athirst for blood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And clad in mail of dusky curls that show the sheeniest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     shine,\nHis fragrance wafted happy news of footstep coming nigh, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to him like a bird uncaged I flew in straightest line:\nI spread my cheek upon his path, beneath his sandal-shoon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lo! the stibium[FN#350] of their dust healed all my hurt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     of eyne.\nWith one embrace again I bound the banner of our loves[FN#351] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And loosed the knot of my delight that bound in bonds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    malign:\nThen bade I make high festival, and straight came flocking in *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pure joys that know not grizzled age[FN#352] nor aught of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pain and pine:\nThe full moon dotted with the stars the lips and pearly teeth *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That dance right joyously upon the bubbling face of wine:\nSo in the prayer-niche of their joys I yielded me to what *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would make the humblest penitent of sinner most indign.\nI swear by all the signs[FN#353] of those glories in his face *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I'll ne'er forget the Chapter entituled Al-Ikhlas.\"[FN#354]\n\nThen Queen Budur told Kamar al-Zaman all that had befallen her from beginning to end and he did likewise; after which he began to upbraid her, saying, \"What moved thee to deal with me as thou hast done this night?\" She replied, \"Pardon me! for I did this by way of jest, and that pleasure and gladness might be increased.\" And when dawned the morn and day arose with its sheen and shone, she sent to King Armanus, sire of the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, and acquainted him with the truth of the case and that she was wife to Kamar al-Zaman. Moreover, she told him their tale and the cause of their separation, and how his daughter was a virgin, pure as when she was born. He marvelled at their story with exceeding marvel and bade them chronicle it in letters of gold. Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O King's son, art thou minded to become my son-in-law by marrying my daughter?\" Replied he, \"I must consult the Queen Budur, as she hath a claim upon me for benefits without stint.\" And when he took counsel with her, she said, \"Right is thy recking; marry her and I will be her handmaid; for I am her debtor for kindness and favour and good offices, and obligations manifold, especially as we are here in her place and as the King her father hath whelmed us with benefits.\"[FN#355] Now when he saw that she inclined to this and was not jealous of Hayat al-Nufus, he agreed with her upon this matter.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventeenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman agreed with his wife, Queen Budur, upon this matter and told King Armanus what she had said; whereat he rejoiced with great joy. Then he went out and, seating himself upon his chair of estate, assembled all the Wazirs, Emirs, Chamberlains and Grandees, to whom he related the whole story of Kamar al-Zaman and his wife, Queen Budur, from first to last; and acquainted them with his desire to marry his daughter Hayat al-Nufus to the Prince and make him King in the stead of Queen Budur. Whereupon said they all, \"Since he is the husband of Queen Budur, who hath been our King till now, whilst we deemed her son-in-law to King Armanus, we are all content to have him to Sultan over us; and we will be his servants, nor will we swerve from his allegiance.\" So Armanus rejoiced hereat and, summoning Kazis and witnesses and the chief officers of state, bade draw up the contract of marriage between Kamar al-Zaman and his daughter, the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then he held high festival, giving sumptuous marriage-feasts and bestowing costly dresses of honour upon all the Emirs and Captains of the host; moreover he distributed alms to the poor and needy and set free all the prisoners. The whole world rejoiced in the coming of Kamar al-Zaman to the throne, blessing him and wishing him endurance of glory and prosperity, renown and felicity; and, as soon as he became King, he remitted the customs-dues and released all men who remained in gaol. Thus he abode a long while, ordering himself worthily towards his lieges; and he lived with his two wives in peace, happiness, constancy and content, lying the night with each of them in turn. He ceased not after this fashion during many years, for indeed all his troubles and afflictions were blotted out from him and he forgot his father King Shahriman and his former estate of honour and favour with him. After a while Almighty Allah blessed him with two boy children, as they were two shining moons, through his two wives; the elder whose name was Prince Amjad,[FN#356] by Queen Budur, and the younger whose name was Prince As'ad by Queen Hayat al-Nufus; and this one was comelier than his brother. They were reared in splendour and tender affection, in respectful bearing and in the perfection of training; and they were instructed in penmanship and science and the arts of government and horsemanship, till they attained the extreme accomplishments and the utmost limit of beauty and loveliness; both men and women being ravished by their charms. They grew up side by side till they reached the age of seventeen, eating and drinking together and sleeping in one bed, nor ever parting at any time or tide; wherefore all the people envied them. Now when they came to man's estate and were endowed with every perfection, their father was wont, as often as he went on a journey, to make them sit in his stead by turns in the hall of judgement; and each did justice among the folk one day at a time. But it came to pass, by confirmed fate and determined lot, that love for As'ad (son of Queen Hayat al-Nufus) rose in the heart of Queen Budur, and that affection for Amjad (son of Queen Budur) rose in the heart of Queen Hayat al-Nufus.[FN#357] Hence it was that each of the women used to sport and play with the son of her sister-wife, kissing him and straining him to her bosom, whilst each mother thought that the other's behaviour arose but from maternal affection. On this wise passion got the mastery of the two women's hearts and they became madly in love with the two youths, so that when the other's son came in to either of them, she would press him to her breast and long for him never to be parted from her; till, at last, when waiting grew longsome to them and they found no path to enjoyment, they refused meat and drink and banished the solace of sleep. Presently, the King fared forth to course and chase, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day in turn as was their wont.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King fared forth to sport and hunt, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day by turn, as was their wont. Now Prince Amjad sat in judgement the first day, bidding and forbidding, appointing and deposing, giving and refusing; and Queen Hayat al-Nufus, mother of As'ad, wrote to him a letter suing for his favour and discovering to him her passion and devotion; altogether put tiny off the mask and giving him to know that she desired to enjoy him. So she took a scroll and thereon indited these cadences, \"From the love deranged * the sorrowful and estranged * whose torment is prolonged for the longing of thee! * Were I to recount to thee the extent of my care * and what of sadness I bear * the passion which my heart cloth tear * and all that I endure for weeping and unrest * and the rending of my sorrowful breast * my unremitting grief * and my woe without relief * and all my suffering for severance of thee * and sadness and love's ardency * no letter could contain it; nor calculation could compass it * Indeed earth and heaven upon me are strait; and I have no hope and no trust but what from thee I await * Upon death I am come nigh * and the horrors of dissolution I aby * Burning upon me is sore * with parting pangs and estrangement galore * Were I to set forth the yearnings that possess me more and more * no scrolls would suffice to hold such store * and of the excess of my pain and pine, I have made the following lines:- -\n\nWere I to dwell on heart-consuming heat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unease and transports in my spins meet,\nNothing were left of ink and reeden pen *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor aught of paper; no, not e'en a sheet.\n\nThen Queen Hayat al-Nufus wrapped up her letter in a niece of costly silk scented with musk and ambergris; and folded it up with her silken hair-strings[FN#358] whose cost swallowed down treasures laid it in a handkerchief and gave it to a eunuch bidding him bear it to Prince Amjad.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Nineteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that she gave her missive to the eunuch in waiting and bade him bear it to Prince Amjad. And that eunuch went forth ignoring what the future hid for him (for the Omniscient ordereth events even as He willeth); and, going in to the Prince, kissed the ground between his hands and handed to him the letter. On receiving the kerchief he opened it and, reading the epistle and recognizing its gist he was ware that his father's wife was essentially an adulteress and a traitress at heart to her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman. So he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and railed at women and their works, saying, \"Allah curse women, the traitresses, the imperfect in reason and religion!\"[FN#359] Then he drew his sword and said to the eunuch, \"Out on thee, thou wicked slave! Dost thou carry messages of disloyalty for thy lord's wife? By Allah, there is no good in thee, O black of hue and heart, O foul of face and Nature's forming!\" So he smote him on the neck and severed his head from his body; then, folding the kerchief over its contents he thrust it into his breast pocket and went in to his own mother and told her what had passed, reviling and reproaching her, and saying, \"Each one of you is viler than the other; and, by Allah the Great and Glorious, did I not fear ill-manneredly to transgress against the rights of my father, Kamar al-Zaman, and my brother, Prince As'ad, I would assuredly go in to her and cut off her head, even as I cut off that of her eunuch!\" Then he went forth from his mother in a mighty rage; and when the news reached Queen Hayat al-Nufus of what he had done with her eunuch, she abused him[FN#360] and cursed him and plotted perfidy against him. He passed the night, sick with rage, wrath and concern; nor found he pleasure in meat, drink or sleep. And when the next morning dawned Prince As'ad fared forth in his turn to rule the folk in his father's stead, whilst his mother, Hayat al-Nufus, awoke in feeble plight because of what she had heard from Prince Amjad concerning the slaughter of her eunuch. So Prince As'ad sat in the audience-chamber that day, judging and administering justice, appointing and deposing, bidding and forbidding, giving and bestowing. And he ceased not thus till near the time of afternoon-prayer, when Queen Budur sent for a crafty old woman and, discovering to her what was in her heart, wrote a letter to Prince As'ad, complaining of the excess of her affection and desire for him in these cadenced lines, \"From her who perisheth for passion and love-forlorn * to him who in nature and culture is goodliest born * to him who is conceited of his own loveliness * and glories in his amorous grace * who from those that seek to enjoy him averteth his face * and refuseth to show favour unto the self abasing and base * him who is cruel and of disdainful mood * from the lover despairing of good * to Prince As'ad * with passing beauty endowed * and of excelling grace proud * of the face moon bright * and the brow flower-white * and dazzling splendid light * This is my letter to him whose love melteth my body * and rendeth my skin and bones! * Know that my patience faileth me quite * and I am perplexed in my plight * longing and restlessness weary me * and sleep and patience deny themselves to me * but mourning and watching stick fast to me * and desire and passion torment me * and the extremes of languor and sickness have sheet me * Yet may my life be a ransom for thee * albeit thy pleasure be to slay her who loveth thee * and Allah prolong the life of thee * and preserve thee from all infirmity!\" And after these cadences she wrote these couplets,\n\n\"Fate hath commanded I become thy fere, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O shining like full moon when clearest clear!\nAll beauty dost embrace, all eloquence; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Brighter than aught within our worldly sphere:\nContent am I my torturer thou be: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply shalt alms me with one lovely leer!\nHappy her death who dieth for thy love! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No good in her who holdeth thee unclear!\"\n\nAnd also the following couplets,\n\n\"Unto thee, As'ad! I of passion-pangs complain; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Have ruth on slave of love so burnt with flaming pain:\nHow long, I ask, shall hands of Love disport with me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With longings, dolour, sleepliness and bale and bane?\nAnon I 'plain of sea in heart, anon of fire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In vitals, O strange case, dear wish, my fairest fain!\nO blamer, cease thy blame, and seek thyself to fly *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From love, which makes these eyne a rill of tears to rain.\nHow oft I cry for absence and desire, Ah grief! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But all my crying naught of gain for me shall gain:\nThy rigours dealt me sickness passing power to bear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thou art my only leach, assain me an thou deign!\nO chider, chide me not in caution, for I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That plaguey Love to thee shall also deal a bout.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur perfumed the letter-paper with a profusion of odoriferous musk and, winding it in her hairstrings which were of Iraki silk, with pendants of oblong emeralds, set with pearls and stones of price, delivered it to the old woman, bidding her carry it to Prince As'ad.[FN#361] She did so in order to pleasure her, and going in to the Prince, straightway and without stay, found him in his own rooms and delivered to him the letter in privacy; after which she stood waiting an hour or so for the answer. When As'ad had read the paper and knew its purport, he wrapped it up again in the ribbons and put it in his bosom-pocket: then (for he was wrath beyond all measure of wrath) he cursed false women and sprang up and drawing his sword, smote the old trot on the neck and cut off her pate. Thereupon he went in to his mother, Queen Hayat al-Nufus, whom he found lying on her bed in feeble case, for that which had betided her with Prince Amjad, and railed at her and cursed her; after which he left her and fore-gathered with his brother, to whom he related all that had befallen him with Queen Budur, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, but that I was ashamed before thee, I had gone in to her forthright and had smitten her head off her shoulders!\" Replied Prince Amjad, \"By Allah, O my brother, yesterday when I was sitting upon the seat of judgement, the like of what hath befallen thee this day befel me also with thy mother who sent me a letter of similar purport.\" And he told him all that had passed, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, naught but respect for thee withheld me from going in to her and dealing with her even as I dealt with the eunuch!\" They passed the rest of the night conversing and cursing womankind, and agreed to keep the matter secret, lest their father should hear of it and kill the two women. Yet they ceased not to suffer trouble and foresee affliction. And when the morrow dawned, the King returned with his suite from hunting and sat awhile in his chair of estate; after which he sent the Emirs about their business and went up to his palace, where he found his two wives lying a-bed and both exceeding sick and weak. Now they had made a plot against their two sons and concerted to do away their lives, for that they had exposed themselves before them and feared to be at their mercy and dependent upon their forbearance. When Kamar al-Zaman saw them on this wise, he said to them, \"What aileth you?\" Whereupon they rose to him and kissing his hands answered, perverting the case and saying \"Know, O King, that thy two sons, who have been reared in thy bounty, have played thee false and have dishonoured thee in the persons of thy wives.\" Now when he heard this, the light became darkness in his sight, and he raged with such wrath that his reason fled: then said he to them, \"Explain me this matter.\" Replied Queen Budur, \"O King of the age, know that these many days past thy son As'ad hath been in the persistent habit of sending me letters and messages to solicit me to lewdness and adultery while I still forbade him from this, but he would not be forbidden; and, when thou wentest forth to hunt, he rushed in on me, drunk and with a drawn sword in his hand, and smiting my eunuch, slew him. Then he mounted on my breast, still holding the sword, and I feared lest he should slay me, if I gainsaid him, even as he had slain my eunuch; so he took his wicked will of me by force. And now if thou do me not justice on him, O King, I will slay myself with my own hand, for I have no need of life in the world after this foul deed.\" And Queen Hayat al-Nufus, choking with tears, told him respecting Prince Amjad a story like that of her sister-wife.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twentieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen Hayat al-Nufus told her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman, a story like that of her sister in wedlock, Budur, and, quoth she, \"The same thing befel me with thy son Amjad;\" after which she took to weeping and wailing and said, \"Except thou do me justice on him I will tell my father, King Armanus.\" Then both women wept with sore weeping before King Kamar al-Zaman who, when he saw their tears and heard their words, concluded that their story was true and, waxing wroth beyond measure of wrath, went forth thinking to fall upon his two sons and put them to death. On his way he met his father- in-law, King Armanus who, hearing of his return from the chase, had come to salute him at that very hour and, seeing him with naked brand in hand and blood dripping from his nostrils, for excess of rage, asked what ailed him. So Kamar al-Zaman told him all that his sons Amjad and As'ad had done and added, \"And here I am now going in to them to slay them in the foulest way and make of them the most shameful of examples.\" Quoth King Armanus (and indeed he too was wroth with them), \"Thou dost well, O my son, and may Allah not bless them nor any sons that do such deed against their father's honour. But, O my son, the sayer of the old saw saith, 'Whoso looketh not to the end hath not Fortune to friend.' In any case, they are thy sons, and it befitteth not that thou kill them with shine own hand, lest thou drink of their death-agony,[FN#362] and anon repent of having slain them whenas repentance availeth thee naught. Rather do thou send them with one of thy Mamelukes into the desert and let him kill them there out of thy sight, for, as saith the adage, 'Out of sight of my friend is better and pleasanter.'[FN#363] And when Kamar al-Zaman heard his father-in-law's words, he knew them to be just; so he sheathed his sword and turning back, sat down upon the throne of his realm. There he summoned his treasurer, a very old man, versed in affairs and in fortune's vicissitudes, to whom he said, \"Go in to my sons, Amjad and As'ad; bind their hands behind them with strong bonds, lay them in two chests and load them upon a mule. Then take horse thou and carry them into mid desert, where do thou kill them both and fill two vials with their blood and bring the same to me in haste.\" Replied the treasurer, \"I hear and I obey,\" and he rose up hurriedly and went out forthright to seek the Princes; and, on his road, he met them coming out of the palace-vestibule, for they had donned their best clothes and their richest; and they were on their way to salute their sire and give him joy of his safe return from his going forth to hunt. Now when he saw them, he laid hands on them, saying, \"Omy sons, know ye that I am but a slave commanded, and that your father hath laid a commandment on me; will ye obey his commandment?\" They said, \"Yes\"; whereupon he went up to them and, after pinioning their arms, laid them in the chests which he loaded on the back of a mule he had taken from the city. And he ceased not carrying them into the open country till near noon, when he halted in a waste and desolate place and, dismounting from his mare, let down the two chests from the mule's back. Then he opened them and took out Amjad and As'ad; and when he looked upon them he wept sore for their beauty and loveliness; then drawing his sword he said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, indeed it is hard for me to deal so evilly by you; but I am to be excused in this matter, being but a slave commanded, for that your father King Kamar al-Zaman hath bidden me strike off your heads.\" They replied, \"O Emir, do the King's bidding, for we bear with patience that which Allah (to Whom be Honour, Might and Glory!) hath decreed to us; and thou art quit of our blood.\" Then they embraced and bade each other farewell, and As'ad said to the treasurer, \"Allah upon thee, O uncle, spare me the sight of my brother's death-agony and make me not drink of his anguish, but kill me first, for that were the easier for me.\" And Amjad said the like and entreated the treasurer to kill him before As'ad, saying, \"My brother is younger than I; so make me not taste of his anguish. And they both wept bitter tears whilst the treasurer wept for their weeping;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the treasurer wept for their weeping; then the two brothers embraced and bade farewell and one said to the other, \"All this cometh of the malice of those traitresses, my mother and thy mother; and this is the reward of my forbearance towards thy mother and of thy for bearance towards my mother! But there is no Might and there is no Majesty save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning.\"[FN#364] And As'ad em braced his brother, sobbing and repeating these couplets,\n\n\"O Thou to whom sad trembling wights in fear complain! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   O ever ready whatso cometh to sustain!\nThe sole resource for me is at Thy door to knock, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   At whose door knock an Thou to open wilt not deign?\nO Thou whose grace is treasured in the one word, Be![FN#365] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Favour me, I beseech, in Thee all weals contain.\"\n\nNow when Amjad heard his brother's weeping he wept also and pressing him to his bosom repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"O Thou whose boons to me are more than one! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose gifts and favours have nor count nor bound!\nNo stroke of all Fate's strokes e'er fell on me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Thee to take me by the hand I found.\"\nThen said Amjad to the treasurer, \"I conjure thee by the One, Omnipotent, the Lord of Mercy, the Beneficent! slay me before my brother As'ad, so haply shall the fire be quencht in my heart's core and in this life burn no more.\" But As'ad wept and exclaimed, \"Not so: I will die first;\" whereupon quoth Amjad, \"It were best that I embrace thee and thou embrace me, so the sword may fall upon us and slay us both at a single stroke.\" Thereupon they embraced, face to face and clung to each other straitly, whilst the treasurer tied up the twain and bound them fast with cords, weeping the while. Then he drew his blade and said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, it is indeed hard to me to slay you! But have ye no last wishes that I may fulfil or charges which I may carry out, or message which I may deliver?\" Replied Amjad, \"We have no wish; and my only charge to thee is that thou set my brother below and me above him, that the blow may fall on me first, and when thou hast killed us and returnest to the King and he asketh thee, 'What heardest thou from them before their death?'; do thou answer, 'Verily thy sons salute thee and say to thee, Thou knewest not if we were innocent or guilty, yet hast thou put us to death and hast not certified thyself of our sin nor looked into our case.' Then do thou repeat to him these two couplets,\n\n'Women are Satans made for woe o' men; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I fly to Allah from their devilish scathe:\nSource of whatever bale befel our kind, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    In wordly matters and in things of Faith.'\"\n\nContinued Amjad, \"We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was ad the Two Hundred and Twenty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad added, speaking to the treasurer, \"We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets which thou hast just now heard; and I conjure thee by Allah to have patience with us, whilst I cite to my brother this other pair of couplets.\" Then he wept with sore weeping and began,\n\n\"The Kings who fared before us showed *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Of instances full many a show:\nOf great and small and high and low *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     How many this one road have trod!\"\n\nNow when the treasurer heard these words from Amjad, he wept till his beard was wet, whilst As'ad's eyes brimmed with tears and he in turn repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Fate frights us when the thing is past and gone; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Weeping is not for form or face alone[FN#366]:\nWhat ails the Nights?[FN#367] Allah blot out our sin, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And be the Nights by other hand undone!\nEre this Zubayr-son[FN#368] felt their spiteful hate, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who fled for refuge to the House and Stone:\nWould that when Kh\u00e1rijah was for Amru slain[FN#369] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     They had ransomed Ali with all men they own.\"\n\nThen, with cheeks stained by tears down railing he recited also these verses,\n\n\"In sooth the Nights and Days are charactered *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    By traitor falsehood and as knaves they lie;\nThe Desert-reek[FN#370] recalls their teeth that shine; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    All horrid blackness is their K of eye:\nMy sin anent the world which I abhor *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Is sin of sword when sworders fighting hie.\"\n\nThen his sobs waxed louder and he said,\n\n\"O thou who woo'st a World[FN#371] unworthy, learn *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Tis house of evils, 'tis Perdition's net:\nA house where whoso laughs this day shall weep *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    The next: then perish house of fume and fret!\nEndless its frays and forays, and its thralls *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Are ne'er redeemed, while endless risks beset.\nHow many gloried in its pomps and pride, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Till proud and pompous did all bounds forget,\nThen showing back of shield she made them swill[FN#372] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Full draught, and claimed all her vengeance debt.\nFor know her strokes fall swift and sure, altho' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Long bide she and forslow the course of Fate:\nSo look thou to thy days lest life go by *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Idly, and meet thou more than thou hast met;\nAnd cut all chains of world-love and desire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And save thy soul and rise to secrets higher.\"\n\nNow when As'ad made an end of these verses, he strained his brother Amjad in his arms, till they twain were one body, and the treasurer, drawing his sword, was about to strike them, when behold, his steed took fright at the wind of his upraised hand, and breaking its tether, fled into the desert. Now the horse had cost a thousand gold pieces and on its back was a splendid saddle worth much money; so the treasurer threw down his sword, and ran after his beast.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when his horse ran away, the treasurer ran after it in huge concern, and ceased not running to catch the runaway till it entered a thicket. He followed it whilst it dashed through the wood, smiting the earth with its hoofs till it raised a dust-cloud which towered high in air; and snorting and puffing and neighing and waxing fierce and furious. Now there happened to be in this thicket a lion of terrible might; hideous to sight, with eyes sparkling light: his look was grim and his aspect struck fright into man's sprite. Presentry the treasurer turned and saw the lion making towards him; but found no way of escape nor had he his sword with him. So he said in himself, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This strait is come upon me for no other cause but because of Amjad and As'ad; and indeed this journey was unblest from the first!\" Meanwhile the two Princes were grievously oppressed by the heat and grew sore athirst, so that their tongues hung out and they cried for succour, but none came to their relief and they said, \"Would to Heaven we had been slain and were at peace from this pain! But we know not whither the horse hath fled, that the treasurer is gone and hath left us thus pinioned. If he would but come back and do us die, it were easier to us than this torture to aby.\" Said As'ad, \"O my brother, be patient, and the relief of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) shall assuredly come to us; for the horse started not away save of His favour towards us, and naught irketh us but this thirst.\" Upon this he stretched and shook himself and strained right and left, till he burst his pinion-bonds; then he rose and unbound his brother and catching up the Emir's sword, said, \"By Allah, we will not go hence, till we look after him and learn what is become of him.\" Then they took to following on the trail till it led them to the thicket and they said to each other, \"Of a surety, the horse and the treasurer have not passed out of this wood.\" Quoth As'ad, \"Stay thou here, whilst I enter the thicket and search it;\" and Amjad replied, \"I will not let thee go in alone: nor will we enter it but together; so if we escape, we shall escape together and if we perish, we shall perish together.\" Accordingly both entered and found that the lion had sprang upon the treasurer, who lay like a sparrow in his grip, calling upon Allah for aid and signing with his hands to Heaven. Now when Amjad saw this, he took the sword and, rushing upon the lion, smote him between the eyes and laid him dead on the ground. The Emir sprang up, marvelling at this escape and seeing Amjad and As'ad, his master's sons, standing there, cast himself at their feet and exclaimed, \"By Allah, O my lords, it were intolerable wrong in me to do you to death. May the man never be who would kill you! Indeed, with my very life, I will ransom you.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the treasurer to Amjad and As'ad, \"With my life will I ransom you both!\" Then he hastily rose and, at once embracing them, enquired how they had loosed their bonds and come thither; whereupon they told him how the bonds of one of them had fallen loose and he had unbound the other, whereto they were helped by the purity of their intentions, and how they had tracked his trail till they came upon him. So he thanked them for their deed and went with them forth of the thicket; and, when they were in the open country, they said to him, \"O uncle, do our father's bidding.\" He replied, \"Allah forbid that I should draw near to you with hurt! But know ye that I mean to take your clothes and clothe you with mine; then will I fill two vials with the lion's blood and go back to the King and tell him I have out vou to death. But as for you two, fare ye forth into the lands, for Allah's earth is wide; and know, O my lords, that it paineth me to part from you.\" At this, they all fell a-weeping; then the two youths put off their clothes and the treasurer habited them with his own. Moreover he made two parcels of their dress and, filling two vials with the lion's blood, set the parcels before him on his horse's back. Presently he took leave of them and, making his way to the city, ceased not faring till he went in to King Kamar al-Zaman and kissed the ground between his hands. The King saw him changed in face and troubled (which arose from his adventure with the lion) and, deeming this came of the slaughter of his two sons, rejoiced and said to him, \"Hast thou done the work?\" \"Yes, O our lord,\" replied the treasurer and gave him the two parcels of clothes and the two vials full of blood. Asked the King, \"What didst thou observe in them; and did they give thee any charge?\" Answered the treasurer, \"I found them patient and resigned to what came down upon them and they said to me, 'Verily, our father is excusable; bear him our salutation and say to him, 'Thou art quit of our killing. But we charge thee repeat to him these couplets,\n\n'Verily women are devils created for us. We seek refuge with God from the artifice of the devils. They are the source of all the misfortunes that have appeared among mankind in the affairs of the world and of religion.'''[FN#373]\n\nWhen the King heard these words of the treasurer, he bowed his head earthwards, a long while and knew his sons' words to mean that they had been wrongfully put to death. Then he bethought himself of the perfidy of women and the calamities brought about by them; and he took the two parcels and opened them and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping,\u2014And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Kamar la-Zaman opened the two bundles and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping, it so came to pass that he found, in the pocket of his son As'ad's raiment, a letter in the hand of his wife enclosing her hair strings; so he opened and read it and understanding the contents knew that the Prince had been falsely accused and wrongously. Then he searched Amjad's parcel of dress and found in his pocket a letter in the handwriting of Queen Hayat al-Nufus enclosing also her hair-strings; so he opened and read it and knew that Amjad too had been wronged; whereupon he beat hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I have slain my sons unjustly.\" And he buffeted his face, crying out, \"Alas, my sons! Alas, my long grief!\" Then he bade them build two tombs in one house, which he styled \"House of Lamentations,\" and had graved thereon his sons' names; and he threw himself on Amjad's tomb, weeping and groaning and lamenting, and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"O moon for ever set this earth below, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose loss bewail the stars which stud the sky!\nO wand, which broken, ne'er with bend and wave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall fascinate the ravisht gazer's eye;\nThese eyne for jealousy I 'reft of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nor shall they till next life thy sight descry:\nI'm drowned in sea of tears for insomny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherefore, indeed in S\u00e1hirah-stead[FN#374] I lie.\"\nThen he threw himself on As'ad's tomb, groaning and weeping and lamenting and versifying with these couplets,\n\"Indeed I longed to share unweal with thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    But Allah than my will willed otherwise:\nMy grief all blackens 'twixt mine eyes and space, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet whitens all the blackness from mine eyes:[FN#375]\nOf tears they weep these eyne run never dry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And ulcerous flow in vitals never dries:\nRight sore it irks me seeing thee in stead[FN#376] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where slave with sovran for once levelled lies.\"\n\nAnd his weeping and wailing redoubled; and, after he had ended his lamentations and his verse, he forsook his friends and intimates, and denying himself to his women and his family, cut himself off from the world in the House of Lamentations, where he passed his time in weeping for his sons. Such was his case; but as regards Amjad and As'ad they fared on into the desert eating of the fruits of the earth and drinking of the remnants of the rain for a full month, till their travel brought them to a mountain of black flint[FN#377] whose further end was unknown; and here the road forked, one line lying along the midway height and the other leading to its head. They took the way trending to the top and gave not over following it five days, but saw no end to it and were overcome with weariness, being unused to walking upon the mountains or elsewhere.[FN#378] At last, despairing of coming to the last of the road, they retraced their steps and, taking the other, that led over the midway heights,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princes Amjad and As'ad returned from the path leading to the Mountain- head and took that which ran along the midway heights, and walked through all that day till nightfall, when As'ad, weary with much travel, said to Amjad, \"O my brother, I can walk no farther, for I am exceeding weak.\" Replied Amjad, \"O my brother, take courage! May be Allah will send us relief.\" So they walked on part of the night, till the darkness closed in upon them, when As'ad became weary beyond measure of weariness and cried out, \"O my brother, I am worn out and spent with walking,\" and threw himself upon the ground and wept. Amjad took him in his arms and walked on with him, bytimes sitting down to rest till break of day, when they came to the mountain-top and found there a stream of running water and by it a pomegranate-tree and a prayer-niche.[FN#379] They could hardly believe their eyes when they saw it; but, sitting down by that spring, drank of its water and ate of the fruit of that granado-tree; after which they lay on the ground and slept till sunrise, when they washed and bathed in the spring and, eating of the pomegranates, slept again till the time of mid-afternoon prayer. Then they thought to continue their journey, but As'ad could not walk, for both his feet were swollen. So they abode there three days till they were rested, after which they set out again and fared on over the mountain days and nights, tortured by and like to die of thirst, till they sighted a city gleaming afar off, at which they rejoiced and made towards it. When they drew near it, they thanked Allah (be His Name exalted!) and Amjad said to As'ad, \"O my brother, sit here, whilst I go to yonder city and see what it is and whose it is and where we are in Allah's wide world, that we may know through what lands we have passed in crossing this mountain, whose skirts had we followed, we had not reached this city in a whole year. So praised be Allah for safety!\" Replied As'ad, \"By Allah, O my brother, none shall go down into that city save myself, and may I be thy ransom! If thou leave me alone, be it only for an hour, I shall imagine a thousand things and be drowned in a torrent of anxiety on shine account, for I cannot brook shine absence from me.\" Amjad rejoined, \"Go then and tarry not. So As'ad took some gold pieces, and leaving his brother to await him, descended the mountain and ceased not faring on till he entered the city. As he threaded the streets he was met by an old man age-decrepit, whose beard flowed down upon his breast and forked in twain;[FN#380] he bore a walking-staff in his hand and was richly clad, with a great red turband on his head. When As'ad saw him, he wondered at his dress and his mien; nevertheless, he went up to him and saluting him said, \"Where be the way to the market, O my master?\" Hearing these words the Shaykh smiled in his face and replied, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" As'ad rejoined, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Shaykh who met As'ad smiled in his face and said to him, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" and As'ad replied, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\" Then rejoined the old man, \"Verily, thou gladdenest our country with thy presence, O my son, and thou desolatest shine own land by reason of shine absence. What wantest thou of the market?\" Quoth As'ad, \"O uncle, I have a brother, with whom I have come from a far land and with whom I have journeyed these three months; and, when we sighted this city, I left him, who is my elder brother, upon the mountain and came hither, purposing to buy victual and what else, and return therewith to him, that we might feed thereon.\" Said the old man, \"Rejoice in all good, O my son, and know thou that to-day I give a marriage-feast, to which I have bidden many guests, and I have made ready plenty of meats, the best and most delicious that heart can desire. So if thou wilt come with me to my place, I will give thee freely all thou lackest without asking thee a price or aught else. Moreover I will teach thee the ways of this city; and, praised be Allah, O my son, that I, and none other have happened upon thee.\" \"As thou wilt,\" answered As'ad, \"do as thou art disposed, but make haste, for indeed my brother awaiteth me and his whole heart is with me.\" The old man took As'ad by the hand and carried him to a narrow lane, smiling in his face and saying, \"Glory be to Him who hath delivered thee from the people of this city!\" And he ceased not walking till he entered a spacious house, wherein was a saloon and behold, in the middle of it were forty old men, well stricken in years, collected together and forming a single ring as they sat round about a lighted fire, to which they were doing worship and prostrating themselves.[FN#381] When As'ad saw this, he was confounded and the hair of his body stood on end though he knew not what they were; and the Shaykh said to them, \"O Elders of the Fire, how blessed is this day!\" Then he called aloud, saying, \"Hello, Ghazb\u00e1n!\" Whereupon there came out to him a tall black slave of frightful aspect, grim-visaged and flat nosed as an ape who, when the old man made a sign to him, bent As'ad's arms behind his back and pinioned them; after which the Shaykh said to him, \"Let him down into the vault under the earth and there leave him and say to my slave girl Such-an-one, 'Torture him night and day and give him a cake of bread to eat morning and evening against the time come of the voyage to the Blue Sea and the Mountain of Fire, whereon we will slaughter him as a sacrifice.'\" So the black carried him out at another door and, raising a flag in the floor, discovered a flight of twenty steps leading to a chamber[FN#382] under the earth, into which he descended with him and, laying his feet in irons, gave him over to the slave girl and went away. Meanwhile, the old men said to one another, \"When the day of the Festival of the Fire cometh, we will sacrifice him on the mountain, as a propitiatory offering whereby we shall pleasure the Fire.\" Presently the damsel went down to him and beat him a grievous beating, till streams of blood flowed from his sides and he fainted; after which she set at his head a scone of bread and a cruse of brackish water and went away and left him. In the middle of the night, he revived and found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating: so he wept bitter tears; and recalling his former condition of honour and prosperity, lordship and dominion, and his separation from his sire and his exile from his native land.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when As'ad found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating he recalled his whilome condition of honour and prosperity and dominion and lordship, and he wept and groaned aloud and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Stand by the ruined stead and ask of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor deem we dwell there as was state of us:\nThe World, that parter, hath departed us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet soothes not hate-full hearts the fate of us:\nWith whips a cursed slave girl scourges us, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And teems her breast with rancorous hate of us:\nAllah shall haply deign to unpart our lives, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Chastise our foes, and end this strait of us.\"\n\nAnd when As'ad had spoken his poetry, he put out his hand towards his head and finding there the crust and the cruse full of brackish water he ate a bittock, just enough to keep life in him, and drank a little water, but could get no sleep till morning for the swarms of bugs[FN#383] and lice. As soon as it was day, the slave girl came down to him and changed his clothes, which were drenched with blood and stuck to him, so that his skin came off with the shirt; wherefor he shrieked aloud and cried, \"Alas!\" and said, \"O my God, if this be Thy pleasure, increase it upon me! O Lord, verily Thou art not unmindful of him that oppresseth me; do Thou then avenge me upon him!\" And he groaned and repeated the following verses,\n\n\n\"Patient, O Allah! to Thy destiny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I bow, suffice me what Thou deign decree:\nPatient to bear Thy will, O Lord of me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Patient to burn on coals of Ghaz\u00e1-tree:\nThey wrong me, visit me with hurt and harm; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply Thy grace from them shall set me free:\nFar be's, O Lord, from thee to spare the wronger *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O Lord of Destiny my hope's in Thee!\"\n\nAnd what another saith,\n\n\"Bethink thee not of worldly state, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Leave everything to course of Fate;\nFor oft a thing that irketh thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall in content eventuate;\nAnd oft what strait is shall expand, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And what expanded is wax strait.\nAllah will do what wills His will *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So be not thou importunate!\nBut 'joy the view of coming weal *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall make forget past bale and bate.\"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verse, the slave-girl came down upon him with blows till he fainted again; and, throwing him a flap of bread and a gugglet of saltish water, went away and left him sad and lonely, bound in chains of iron, with the blood streaming from his sides and far from those he loved. So he wept and called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that As'ad called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed; so he wept and groaned and complained and poured forth tears in floods and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"Easy, O Fate! how long this wrong, this injury, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Robbing each morn and eve my brotherhood fro' me?\nIs't not time now thou deem this length sufficiency *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Of woes and, O thou Heart of Rock, show clemency?\nMy friends thou wrongedst when thou madst each enemy *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Mock and exult me for thy wrongs, thy tyranny:\nMy foeman's heart is solaced by the things he saw *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   In me, of strangerhood and lonely misery:\nSuffice thee not what came upon my head of dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Friends lost for evermore, eyes wan and pale of blee?\nBut must in prison cast so narrow there is naught *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Save hand to bite, with bitten hand for company;\nAnd tears that tempest down like goodly gift of cloud, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And longing thirst whose fires weet no satiety.\nRegretful yearnings, singulfs and unceasing sighs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Repine, remembrance and pain's very ecstacy:\nDesire I suffer sore and melancholy deep, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And I must bide a prey to endless phrenesy:\nI find me ne'er a friend who looks with piteous eye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And seeks my presence to allay my misery:\nSay, liveth any intimate with trusty love *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Who for mine ills will groan, my sleepless malady?\nTo whom moan I can make and, peradventure, he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall pity eyes that sight of sleep can never see?\nThe flea and bug suck up my blood, as wight that drinks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wine from the proffering hand of fair virginity:\nAmid the lice my body aye remindeth me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of orphan's good in K\u00e1zi's claw of villainy:\nMy home's a sepulchre that measures cubits three, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where pass I morn and eve in chained agony:\nMy wines are tears, my clank of chains takes music's stead, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cares my dessert of fruit and sorrows are my bed.\"\n\nAnd when he had versed his verse and had prosed his prose, he again groaned and complained and remembered he had been and how he had been parted from his brother. Thus far concerning him; but as regards his brother Amjad, he awaited As'ad till mid-day yet he returned not to him: whereupon Amjad's vitals fluttered, the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirtieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Amjad awaited his brother As'ad till mid-day and he returned not to him, Amjad's vitals fluttered; the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears, exclaiming, \"Alas, my brother! Alas, my friend! Alas my grief! How I feared me we should be separated!\" Then he descended from the mountain-top with the tears running down his cheeks; and, entering the city, ceased not walking till he made the market. He asked the folk the name of the place and concerning its people and they said, \"This is called the City of the Magians, and its citizens are mostly given to Fire-worshipping in lieu of the Omnipotent King.\" Then he enquired of the City of Ebony and they answered, \"Of a truth it is a year's journey thither by land and six months by sea: it was governed erst by a King called Armanus; but he took to son- in-law and made King in his stead a Prince called Kamar al-Zaman distinguished for justice and munificence, equity and benevolence.\" When Amjad heard tell of his father, he groaned and wept and lamented and knew not whither to go. However, he bought a something of food and carried it to a retired spot where he sat down thinking to eat; but, recalling his brother, he fell a- weeping and swallowed but a morsel to keep breath and body together, and that against his will. Then he rose and walked about the city, seeking news of his brother, till he saw a Moslem tailor sitting in his shop so he sat down by him and told him his story; whereupon quoth the tailor, \"If he have fallen into the hands of the Magians, thou shalt hardly see him again: yet it may be Allah will reunite you twain. But thou, O my brother,\" he continued wilt thou lodge with me?\" Amjad answered, \"Yes\"; and the tailor rejoiced at this. So he abode with him many days, what while the tailor comforted him and exhorted him to patience and taught him tailoring, till he became expert in the craft. Now one day he went forth to the sea-shore and washed his clothes; after which he entered the bath and put on clean raiment; then he walked about the city, to divert himself with its sights and presently there met him on the way a woman of passing beauty and loveliness, without peer for grace and comeliness. When she saw him she raised her face-veil and signed to him by moving her eyebrows and her eyes with luring glances, and versified these couplets,\n\n\"I drooped my glance when seen thee on the way *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As though, O slim-waist! felled by Sol's hot ray:\nThou art the fairest fair that e'er appeared, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fairer to-day than fair of yesterday:[FN#384]\nWere Beauty parted, a fifth part of it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With Joseph or a part of fifth would stay;\nThe rest would fly to thee, shine ownest own; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be every soul thy sacrifice, I pray!\"\n\nWhen Amjad heard these her words, they gladdened his heart which inclined to her and his bowels yearned towards her and the hands of love sported with him; so he sighed to her in reply and spoke these couplets,\n\n\"Above the rose of cheek is thorn of lance;[FN#385] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who dareth pluck it, rashest chevisance?\nStretch not thy hand towards it, for night long *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Those lances marred because we snatched a glance!\nSay her, who tyrant is and tempter too *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     (Though justice might her tempting power enhance):\u2014\nThy face would add to errors were it veiled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveiled I see its guard hath best of chance!\nEye cannot look upon Sol's naked face; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But can, when mist-cloud dims his countenance:\nThe honey-hive is held by honey-bee;[FN#386] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ask the tribe-guards what wants their vigilance?\nAn they would slay me, let them end their ire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rancorous, and grant us freely to advance:\nThey're not more murderous, an charge the whole *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Than charging glance of her who wears the mole.\"\n\nAnd hearing these lines from Amjad she sighed with the deepest sighs and, signing to him again, repeated these couplets,\n\n\"'Tis thou hast trodden coyness path not I: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Grant me thy favours for the time draws nigh:\nO thou who makest morn with light of brow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And with loosed brow-locks night in lift to stye!\nThine idol-aspect made of me thy slave, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tempting as temptedst me in days gone by:\n'Tis just my liver fry with hottest love: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who worship fire for God must fire aby:\nThou sellest like of me for worthless price; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thou must sell, ask high of those who buy.\"\nWhen Amjad heard these her words he said to her, \"Wilt thou come to my lodging or shall I go with thee to shine?\" So she hung her head in shame to the ground and repeated the words of Him whose Name be exalted, \"Men shall have the pre-eminence above women, because of those advantages wherein Allah hath caused the one of them to excel the other.\"[FN#387] Upon this, Amjad took the hint.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad took the woman's hint and understood that she wished to go with him whither he was going; he felt himself bounder to find a place wherein to receive her, but was ashamed to carry her to the house of his host, the tailor. So he walked on and she walked after him, and the two ceased not walking from street to street and place to place, till she was tired and said to him, \"O my lord, where is thy house?\" Answered he, \"Before us a little way.\" Then he turned aside into a handsome by-street, followed by the young woman, and walked on till he came to the end, when he found it was no thoroughfare and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" Then raising his eyes, he saw, at the upper end of the lane a great doer with two stone benches; but it was locked. So Amjad sat down on one of the benches and she on the other; and she said to him, \"O my lord, wherefore waitest thou?\" He bowed his head awhile to the ground then raised it and answered, \"I am awaiting my Mameluke who hath the key; for I bade him make me ready meat and drink and flowers, to deck the wine-service against my return from the bath.\" But he said to himself, \"Haply the time will be tedious to her and she will go about her business, leaving me here, when I will wend my own way.\" However, as soon as she was weary of long waiting, she said, \"O my lord, thy Mameluke delayeth; and here are we sitting in the street;\" and she arose and took a stone and went up to the lock. Said Amjad, \"Be not in haste, but have patience till the servant come.\" However, she hearkened not to him, but smote the wooden bolt with the stone and broke it in half, whereupon the door opened. Quoth he, \"What possessed thee to do this deed?\" Quoth she, \"Pooh, pooh, my lord! what matter it? Is not the house thy house and thy place?\" He said, \"There was no need to break the bolt.\" Then the damsel entered, to the confusion of Amjad, who knew not what to do for fear of the people of the house; but she said to him, \"Why dost thou not enter, O light of mine eyes and core of my heart?\" Replied he, \"I hear and obey; but my servant tarrieth long and I know not if he have done aught of what I bade him and specially enjoined upon him, or not.\" Hereupon he entered, sore in fear of the people of the house, and found himself in a handsome saloon with four dais'd recesses, each facing other, and containing closets and raised seats, all bespread with stuffs of silk and brocade; and in the midst was a jetting fountain of costly fashion, on whose margin rested a covered tray of meats, with a leather tablecloth hanging up and gem-encrusted dishes, full of fruits and sweet- scented flowers. Hard by stood drinking vessels and a candlestick with a single wax-candle therein; and the place was full of precious stuffs and was ranged with chests and stools, and on each seat lay a parcel of clothes upon which was a purse full of monies, gold and silver. The floor was paved with marble and the house bore witness in every part to its owner's fortune. When Amjad saw all this, he was confounded at his case and said to himself, \"I am a lost man! Verily we are Allah's and to Allah we are returning!\" As for the damsel, when she sighted the place she rejoiced indeed with a joy nothing could exceed, and said to him, \"By Allah, O my lord, thy servant hath not failed of his duty; for see, he hath swept the place and cooked the meat and set on the fruit; and indeed I come at the best of times.\" But he paid no heed to her, his heart being taken up with fear of the house- folk; and she said, \"Fie, O my lord, O my heart! What aileth thee to stand thus?\" Then she sighed and, giving him a buss which sounded like the cracking of a walnut, said, \"O my lord, an thou have made an appointment with other than with me, I will gird my middle and serve her and thee. Amjad laughed from a heart full of rage and wrath and came forwards and sat down, panting and saying to himself, \"Alack, mine ill death and doom when the owner of the place shall return!\" Then she seated herself by him and fell to toying and laughing, whilst Amjad sat careful and frowning, thinking a thousand thoughts and communing with himself, \"Assuredly the master of the house cannot but come, and then what shall I say to him? he needs must kill me and my life will be lost thus foolishly.\" Presently she rose and, tucking up her sleeves, took a tray of food on which she laid the cloth and then set it before Amjad and began to eat, saying, \"Eat, O my lord.\" So he came forward and ate; but the food was not pleasant to him; on the contrary he ceased not to look towards the door, till the damsel had eaten her fill, when she took away the tray of the meats and, setting on the dessert, fell to eating of the dried fruits. Then she brought the wine service and opening the jar, filled a cup and handed it to Amjad, who took it from her hand saying to him self, ' Ah, ah! and well away, when the master of the house cometh and seeth me!\"; and he kept his eyes fixed on the threshold, even with cup in hand. While he was in this case, lo! in came the master of the house, who was a white slave, one of the chief men of the city, being Master of the Horse[FN#388] to the King. He had fitted up this saloon for his pleasures, that he might make merry therein and be private with whom he would, and he had that day bidden a youth whom he loved and had made this entertainment for him. Now the name of this slave was Bah\u00e1dur,[FN#389] and he was open of hand, generous, munificent and fain of alms-giving and charitable works.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it wad the Two Hundred and Thirty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Bahadur, the Master of the Horse and the owner of the house, came to the door of the saloon and found it open, he entered slowly and softly and looking in, with head advanced and out stretched neck, saw Amjad and the girl sitting before the dish of fruit and the wine-jar in front of them. Now Amjad at that moment had the cup in his hand and his face turned to the door; and when his glance met Bahadur's eyes his hue turned pale yellow and his side-muscles quivered, so seeing his trouble Bahadur signed to him with his finger on his lips, as much as to say, \"Be silent and come hither to me.\" Whereupon he set down the cup and rose and the damsel cried, \"Whither away?\" He shook his head and, signing to her that he wished to make water, went out into the passage barefoot. Now when he saw Bahadur he knew him for the master of the house; so he hastened to him and, kissing his hands, said to him, \"Allah upon thee, O my lord, ere thou do me a hurt, hear what I have to say.\" Then he told him who he was from first to last and acquainted him with what caused him to quit his native land and royal state, and how he had not entered his house of his free will, but that it was the girl who had broken the lock-bolt and done all this.[FN#390] When Bahadur heard his story and knew that he was a King's son, he felt for him and, taking compassion on him, said, \"Hearken to me, O Amjad, and do what I bid thee and I will guarantee thy safety from that thou fearest; but, if thou cross me, I will kill thee.\" Amjad replied, \"Command me as thou wilt: I will not gainsay thee in aught; no, never, for I am the freedman of thy bounty.\" Rejoined Bahadur, \"Then go back forthwith into the saloon, sit down in thy place and be at peace and at shine ease; I will presently come in to thee, and when thou seest me (remember my name is Bahadur) do thou revile me and rail at me, saying, 'What made thee tarry till so late?' And accept no excuse from me; nay, so far from it, rise and beat me; and, if thou spare me, I will do away thy life. Enter now and make merry and whatsoever thou seekest of me at this time I will bring thee forthwith; and do thou spend this night as thou wilt and on the morrow wend thy way. This I do in honour of thy strangerhood, for I love the stranger and hold myself bounder to do him devoir.\" So Amjad kissed his hand, and, returning to the saloon with his face clad in its natural white and red, at once said to the damsel, \"O my mistress, thy presence hath gladdened this shine own place and ours is indeed a blessed night.\" Quoth the girl, \"Verily I see a wonderful change in thee, that thou now welcomest me so cordially!\" So Amjad answered, \"By Allah, O my lady, methought my servant Bahadur had robbed me of some necklaces of jewels, worth ten thousand diners each; however, when I went out but now in concern for this, I sought for them and found them in their place. I know not why the slave tarrieth so long and needs must I punish him for it.\" She was satisfied with his answer, and they sported and drank and made merry and ceased not to be so till near sundown, when Bahadur came in to them, having changed his clothes and girt his middle and put on shoes, such as are worn of Mamelukes. He saluted and kissed the ground; then held his hands behind him and stood, with his head hanging down, as one who confesseth to a fault. So Amjad looked at him with angry eyes and asked, \"Why hast thou tarried till now, O most pestilent of slaves?\" Answered Bahadur, \"O my lord, I was busy washing my clothes and knew not of thy being here; for our appointed time was nightfall and not day-tide.\" But Amjad cried out at him, saying, \"Thou liest, O vilest of slaves! By Allah, I must needs beat thee.\" So he rose and, throwing Bahadur prone on the ground, took a stick and beat him gently; but the damsel sprang up and, snatching the stick from his hand, came down upon Bahadur so lustily, that in extreme pain the tears ran from his eyes and he ground his teeth together and called out for succour; whilst Amjad cried out to the girl \"Don't\"; and she cried out, \"Let me satisfy my anger upon him!\" till at last he pulled the stick out of her hand and pushed her away. So Bahadur rose and, wiping away his tears from his cheeks, waited upon them the while, after which he swept the hall and lighted the lamps; but as often as he went in and out, the lady abused him and cursed him till Amjad was wroth with her and said, \"For Almighty Allah's sake leave my Mameluke; he is not used to this.\" Then they sat and ceased not eating and drinking (and Bahadur waiting upon them) till midnight when, being weary with service and beating, he fell asleep in the midst of the hall and snored and snorted; whereupon the damsel, who was drunken with wine, said to Amjad, \"Arise, take the sword hanging yonder and cut me off this slave's head; and, if thou do it not, I will be the death of thee!\" \"What possesseth thee to slay my slave?\" asked Amjad; and she answered, \"Our joyaunce will not be complete but by his death. If thou wilt not kill him, I will do it myself.\" Quoth Amjad, \"By Allah's rights to thee, do not this thing!\" Quoth she, \"It must perforce be;\" and, taking down the sword, drew it and made at Bahadur to kill him; but Amjad said in his mind, \"This man hath entreated us courteously and sheltered us and done us kindness and made himself my slave: shall we requite him by slaughtering him? This shall never be!\" Then he said to the woman, \"If my Mameluke must be killed, better I should kill him than thou.\" So saying, he took the sword from her and, raising his hand, smote her on the neck and made her head fly from her body. It fell upon Bahadur who awoke and sat up and opened his eyes, when he saw Amjad standing by him and in his hand the sword dyed with blood, and the damsel lying dead. He enquired what had passed, and Amjad told him all she had said, adding, \"Nothing would satisfy her but she must slay thee; and this is her reward.\" Then Bahadur rose and, kissing the Prince's hand, said to him, \"Would to Heaven thou hadst spared her! but now there is nothing for it but to rid us of her without stay or delay, before the day-break.\" Then he girded his loins and took the body, wrapped it in an Ab\u00e1-cloak and, laying it in a large basket of palm-leaves, he shouldered it saying, \"Thou art a stranger here and knowest no one: so sit thou in this place and await my return till day-break. If I come back to thee, I will assuredly do thee great good service and use my endeavours to have news of thy brother; but if by sunrise I return not, know that all is over with me; and peace be on thee, and the house and all it containeth of stuffs and money are shine.\" Then he fared forth from the saloon bearing the basket; and, threading the streets, he made for the salt sea, thinking to throw it therein: but as he drew near the shore, he turned and saw that the Chief of Police and his officers had ranged themselves around him; and, on recognising him, they wondered and opened the basket, wherein they found the slain woman. So they seized him and laid him in bilboes all that night till the morning, when they carried him and the basket, as it was, to the King and reported the case. The King was sore enraged when he looked upon the slain and said to Bahadur, \"Woe to thee! Thou art always so doing; thou killest folk and castest them into the sea and takest their goods. How many murders hast thou done ere this?\" Thereupon Bahadur hung his head.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahadur hung down his head groundwards before the King, who cried out at him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Who killed this girl?\" He replied, \"O my lord! I killed her, and there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"[FN#391] So the King in his anger, commanded to hang him; and the hangman went down with him by the King's commandment, and the Chief of Police accompanied him with a crier who called upon all the folk to witness the execution of Bahadur, the King's Master of the Horse; and on this wise they paraded him through the main streets and the market-streets. This is how it fared with Bahadur; but as regards Amjad, he awaited his host's return till the day broke and the sun rose, and when he saw that he came not, he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Would I knew what is become of him?\" And, as he sat musing behold, he heard the crier proclaiming Bahadur's sentence and bidding the people to see the spectacle of his hanging at midday; whereat he wept and exclaimed, \"Verily, we are Allah's and to Him we are returning! He meaneth to sacrifice himself unjustly for my sake, when I it was who slew her. By Allah, this shall never be!\" Then he went from the saloon and, shutting the door after him, hurriedly threaded the streets till he overtook Bahadur, when he stood before the Chief of Police and said to him, \"O my lord, put not Bahadur to death, for he is innocent. By Allah, none killed her but I.\" Now when the Captain of Police heard these words, he took them both and, carrying them before the King, acquainted him with what Amjad had said; whereupon he looked at the Prince and asked him, \"Didst thou kill the damsel?\" He answered, \"Yes\" and the King said, \"Tell me why thou killedst her, and speak the truth.\" Replied Amjad, \"O King, it is indeed a marvellous event and a wondrous matter that hath befallen me: were it graven with needles on the eye-corners, it would serve as a warner to whoso would be warned!\" Then he told him his whole story and informed him of all that had befallen him and his brother, first and last; whereat the King was much startled and surprised and said to him, \"Know that now I find thee to be excusable; but list, O youth! Wilt thou be my Waz\u00edr?\" \"Hearkening and obedience,\" answered Amjad whereupon the King bestowed magnificent dresses of honour on him and Bahadur and gave him a handsome house, with eunuchs and officers and all things needful, appointing him stipends and allowances and bidding him make search for his brother As'ad. So Amjad sat down in the seat of the Wazirate and governed and did justice and invested and deposed and took and gave. Moreover, he sent out a crier to cry his brother throughout the city, and for many days made proclamation in the main streets and market-streets, but heard no news of As'ad nor happened on any trace of him. Such was his case; but as regards his brother, the Magi ceased not to torture As'ad night and day and eve and morn for a whole year's space, till their festival drew near, when the old man Bahram[FN#392] made ready for the voyage and fitted out a ship for himself.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahram, the Magian, having fitted out a ship for the voyage, took As'ad and put him in a chest which he locked and had it transported on board. Now it so came to pass that, at the very time of shipping it, Amjad was standing to divert himself by looking upon the sea; and when he saw the men carrying the gear and shipping it, his heart throbbed and he called to his pages to bring him his beast. Then, mounting with a company of his officers, he rode down to the sea-side and halted before the Magian's ship, which he commended his men to board and search. They did his bidding, and boarded the vessel and rummaged in every part, but found nothing; so they returned and told Amjad, who mounted again and rode back. But he felt troubled in mind; and when he reached his place and entered his palace, he cast his eyes on the wall and saw written thereon two lines which were these couplets,\n\n\"My friends! if ye are banisht from mine eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From heart and mind ye ne'er go wandering:\nBut ye have left me in my woe, and rob *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rest from my eyelids while ye are slumbering.\"\n\nAnd seeing them Amjad thought of his brother and wept. Such was his case; but as for Bahram, the Magian, he embarked and shouted and bawled to his crew to make sail in all haste. So they shook out the sails and departed and ceased not to fare on many days and nights; and, every other day, Bahram took out As'ad and gave him a bit of bread and made him drink a sup of water, till they drew near the Mountain of Fire. Then there came out on them a storm-wind and the sea rose against them, so that the ship was driven out of her course till she took a wrong line and fell into strange waters; and, at last they came in sight of a city builded upon the shore, with a castle whose windows overlooked the main. Now the ruler of this city was a Queen called Marj\u00e1nah, and the captain said to Bahram, \"O my lord, we have strayed from our course and come to the island of Queen Marjanah, who is a devout Moslemah; and, if she know that we are Magians, she will take our ship and slay us to the last man. Yet needs must we put in here to rest and refit.\" Quoth Bahram, \"Right is thy recking, and whatso thou seest fit that will I do!\" Said the ship master, \"If the Queen summon us and question us, how shall we answer her?\"; and Bahram replied, \"Let us clothe this Moslem we have with us in a Mameluke's habit and carry him ashore with us, so that when the Queen sees him, she will suppose and say, 'This is a slave.' As for me I will tell her that I am a slave-dealer[FN#393] who buys and sells white slaves, and that I had with me many but have sold all save this one, whom I retained to keep my accounts, for he can read and write.\" And the captain said \"This device should serve.\" Presently they reached the city and slackened sail and cast the anchors; and the ship lay still, when behold, Queen Marjanah came down to them, attended by her guards and, halting before the vessel, called out to the captain, who landed and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"What is the lading of this thy ship and whom hast thou with thee?\"\" Quoth he, \"O Queen of the Age, I have with me a merchant who dealeth in slaves.\" And she said, \"Hither with him to me\"; whereupon Bahram came ashore to her, with As'ad walking behind him in a slave's habit, and kissed the earth before her. She asked, \"What is thy condition?\"; and he answered, \"I am a dealer in chattels.\" Then she looked at As'ad and, taking him for a Mameluke, asked him, \"What is thy name, O youth?\" He answered, \"Dost thou ask my present or my former name?\" \"Hast thou then two names?\" enquired she, and he replied (and indeed his voice was choked with tears), \"Yes; my name aforetime was Al-As'ad, the most happy, but now it is Al- Mu'tarr\u2014Miserrimus.\" Her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Canst thou write?\" \"Yes,'' answered he, and she gave him ink- case and reed-pen and paper and said to him, \"Write somewhat that I may see it.\" So he wrote these two couplets,\n\n\"What can the slave do when pursued by Fate, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O justest Judge! whatever be his state?[FN#394]\nWhom God throws hand bound in the depths and says, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware lest water should thy body wet?\"[FN#395]\n\nNow when she read these lines, she had ruth upon him and said to Bahram, \"Sell me this slave.\" He replied, \"O my lady, I cannot sell him, for I have parted with all the rest and none is left with me but he.\" Quoth the Queen, \"I must need have him of thee, either by sale or way of gift.\" But quoth Bahram, \"I will neither sell him nor give him.\" Whereat she was wroth and, taking As'ad by the hand, carried him up to the castle and sent to Bahram, saying, \"Except thou set sail and depart our city this very night, I will seize all thy goods and break up thy ship.\" Now when the message reached the Magian, he grieved with sore grief and cried, \"Verily this voyage is on no wise to be commended.\" Then he arose and made ready and took all he needed and awaited the coming of the night to resume his voyage, saying to the sailors, \"Provide yourselves with your things and fill your water-skins, that we may set sail at the last of the night.\" So the sailors did their business and awaited the coming of darkness. Such was their case; but as regards Queen Marjanah, when she had brought As'ad into the castle, she opened the casements overlooking the sea and bade her handmaids bring food. They set food before As'ad and herself and both ate, after which the Queen called for wine.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Marjanah bade her handmaids bring wine and they set it before her, she fell to drinking with As'ad. Now, Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) filled her heart with love for the Prince and she kept filling his cup and handing it to him till his reason fled; and presently he rose and left the hall to satisfy a call of nature. As he passed out of the saloon he saw an open door through which he went and walked on till his walk brought him to a vast garden full of all manner fruits and flowers; and, sitting down under a tree, he did his occasion. Then he rose and went up to a jetting fountain in the garden and made the lesser ablution and washed his hands and face, after which he would have risen to go away; but the air smote him and he fell back, with his clothes undone and slept, and night overcame him thus. So far concerning him; but as concerns Bahram, the night being come, he cried out to his crew, saying, \"Set sail and let us away!\"; and the' answered, \"We hear and obey, but wait till we fill our water- skins and then we will set sail.\" So they landed with their water skins and went round about the castle, and found nothing but garden-walls: whereupon they climbed over into the garden and followed the track of feet, which led them to the fountain; and there they found As'ad lying on his back. They knew him and were glad to find him; and, after filling their water-skins, they bore him off and climbed the wall again with him and carried him back in haste to Bahram to whom they said, \"Hear the good tidings of thy winning thy wish; and gladden thy heart and beat thy drums and sound thy pipes; for thy prisoner, whom Queen Marjanah took from thee by force, we have found and brought back to thee\"; and they threw As'ad down before him. When Bahram saw him, his heart leapt for joy and his breast swelled with gladness. Then he bestowed largesse on the sailors and bade them set sail in haste. So they sailed forthright, intending to make the Mountain of Fire and stayed not their course till the morning. This is how it fared with them; but as regards Queen Marjanah, she abode awhile, after As'ad went down from her, awaiting his return in vain for he came not; thereupon she rose and sought him, yet found no trace of him. Then she bade her women light flambeaux and look for him, whilst she went forth in person and, seeing the garden- door open, knew that he had gone thither. So she went out into the garden and finding his sandals lying by the fountain, searched the place in every part, but came upon no sign of him; and yet she gave not over the search till morning. Then she enquired for the ship and they told her, \"The vessel set sail in the first watch of the night\"; wherefor she knew that they had taken As'ad with them, and this was grievous to her and she was sore an-angered. She bade equip ten great ships forthwith and, making ready for fight, embarked in one of the ten with her Mamelukes and slave-women and men-at-arms, all splendidly accoutred and weaponed for war. They spread the sails and she said to the captains, \"If you overtake the Magian's ship, ye shall have of me dresses of honour and largesse of money; but if you fail so to do, I will slay you to the last man.\" Whereat fear and great hope animated the crews and they sailed all that day and the night and the second day and the third day till, on the fourth they sighted the ship of Bahram, the Magian, and before evening fell the Queen's squadron had surrounded it on all sides, just as Bahram had taken As'ad forth of the chest and was beating and torturing him, whilst the Prince cried out for help and deliverance, but found neither helper nor deliverer: and the grievous bastinado sorely tormented him. Now while so occupied, Bahram chanced to look up and, seeing himself encompassed by the Queen's ships, as the white of the eye encompasseth the black, he gave himself up for lost and groaned and said, \"Woe to thee, O As'ad! This is all out of thy head.\" Then taking him by the hand he bade his men throw him overboard and cried, \"By Allah I will slay thee before I die myself!\" So they carried him along by the hands and feet and cast him into the sea and he sank; but Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) willed that his life be saved and that his doom be deferred; so He caused him to sink and rise again and he struck out with his hands and feet, till the Almighty gave him relief, and sent him deliverance; and the waves bore him far from the Magian's ship and threw him ashore. He landed, scarce crediting his escape, and once more on land he doffed his clothes and wrung them and spread them out to dry; whilst he sat naked and weeping over his condition, and bewailing his calamities and mortal dangers, and captivity and stranger hood. And presently he repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"Allah, my patience fails: I have no ward; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My breast is straitened and clean cut my cord;\nTo whom shall wretched slave of case complain *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Save to his Lord? O thou of lords the Lord!\"\n\nThen, having ended his verse, he rose and donned his clothes but he knew not whither to go or whence to come; so he fed on the herbs of the earth and the fruits of the trees and he drank of the streams, and fared on night and day till he came in sight of a city; whereupon he rejoiced and hastened his pace; but when he reached it,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it Was the Two Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he reached the city the shades of evening closed around him and the gates were shut. Now by the decrees of Pate and man's lot this was the very city wherein he had been a prisoner and to whose King his brother Amjad was Minister. When As'ad saw the gate was locked, he turned back and made for the burial-ground, where finding a tomb without a door, he entered therein and lay down and fell asleep, with his face covered by his long sleeve.[FN#396] Meanwhile, Queen Marjanah, coming up with Bahram's ship, questioned him of As'ad. Now the Magian, when Queen Marjanah overtook him with her ships, baffled her by his artifice and gramarye; swearing to her that he was not with him and that he knew nothing of him. She searched the ship, but found no trace of her friend, so she took Bahram and, carrying him back to her castle, would have put him to death, but he ransomed himself from her with all his good and his ship; and she released him and his men. They went forth from her hardly believing in their deliverance, and fared on ten days' journey till they came to their own city and found the gate shut, it being eventide. So they made for the burial-ground, thinking to lie the night there and, going round about the tombs, as Fate and Fortune would have it, saw the building wherein As'ad lay wide open; whereat Bahram marvelled and said, \"I must look into this sepulchre.\" Then he entered and found As'ad lying in a corner fast asleep, with his head covered by his sleeve; so he raised his head, and looking in his face, knew him for the man on whose account he had lost his good and his ship, and cried, \"What! art thou yet alive?\" Then he bound him and gagged him without further parley, and carried him to his house, where he clapped heavy shackles on his feet and lowered him into the underground dungeon aforesaid prepared for the tormenting of Moslems, and he bade his daughter by name Bost\u00e1n,[FN#397] torture him night and day, till the next year, when they would again visit the Mountain of Fire and there offer him up as a sacrifice. Then he beat him grievously and locking the dungeon door upon him, gave the keys to his daughter. By and by, Bostan opened the door and went down to beat him, but finding him a comely youth and a sweet-faced with arched brows and eyes black with nature's Kohl,[FN#398] she fell in love with him and asked him, \"What is thy name?\" \"My name is As'ad,\" answered he; whereat she cried, \"Mayst thou indeed be happy as thy name,[FN#399] and happy be thy days! Thou deservest not torture and blows, and I see thou hast been injuriously entreated.\" And she comforted him with kind words and loosed his bonds. Then she questioned him of the religion of Al-Islam and he told her that it was the true and right Faith and that our lord Mohammed had approved himself by surpassing miracles[FN#400] and signs manifest, and that fire-worship is harmful and not profitable; and he went on to expound to her the tenets of Al-Islam till she was persuaded and the love of the True Faith entered her heart. Then, as Almighty Allah had mixed up with her being a fond affection for As'ad, she pronounced the Two Testimonies[FN#401] of the Faith and became of the people of felicity. After this, she brought him meat and drink and talked with him and they prayed together: moreover, she made him chicken stews and fed him therewith, till he regained strength and his sickness left him and he was restored to his former health. Such things befel him with the daughter of Bahram, the Magian; and so it happened that one day she left him and stood at the house-door when behold, she heard the crier crying aloud and saying, \"Whoso hath with him a handsome young man, whose favour is thus and thus, and bringeth him forth, shall have all he seeketh of money; but if any have him and deny it, he shall be hanged over his own door and his property shall be plundered and his blood go for naught.\" Now As'ad had acquainted Bostan bint Bahram with his whole history: so, when she heard the crier, she knew that it was he who was sought for and, going down to him, told him the news. Then he fared forth and made for the mansion of the Wazir, whom, when As'ad saw, exclaimed, \"By Allah, this Minister is my brother Amjad!\" Then he went up (and the damsel walking behind him) to the Palace, where he again saw his brother, and threw himself upon him; whereupon Amjad also knew him and fell upon his neck and they embraced each other, whilst the Wazir's Mamelukes dismounted and stood round them. They lay awhile insensible and, when they came to themselves, Amjad took his brother and carried him to the Sultan, to whom he related the whole story, and the Sultan charged him to plunder Bahram's house.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Sultan ordered Amjad to plunder Bahram's house and to hang its owner. So Amjad despatched thither for that purpose a company of men, who sacked the house and took Bahram and brought his daughter to the Wazir by whom she was received with all honour, for As'ad had told his brother the torments he had suffered and the kindness she had done him. Thereupon Amjad related in his turn to As'ad all that had passed between himself and the damsel; and how he had escaped hanging and had become Wazir; and they made moan, each to other, of the anguish they had suffered for separation. Then the Sultan summoned Bahram and bade strike off his head; but he said, \"O most mighty King, art thou indeed resolved to put me to death?\" Replied the King, \"Yes, except thou save thyself by becoming a Moslem.\" Quoth Bahram, \"O King, bear with me a little while!\" Then he bowed his head groundwards and presently raising it again, made pro fession of The Faith and islamised at the hands of the Sultan. They all rejoiced at his conversion and Amjad and As'ad told him all that had befallen them, whereat he wondered and said, \"O my lords, make ready for the journey and I will depart with you and carry you back to your father's court in a ship.\" At this they rejoiced and wept with sore weeping but he said, \"O my lords, weep not for your departure, for it shall reunite you with those you love, even as were Ni'amah and Naomi.\" \"And what befel Ni'amah and Naomi?\" asked they. \"They tell,\" replied Bahram, \"(but Allah alone is All knowing) the following tale of\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n\n\n[FN#221] The \"topothesia\" is worthy of Shakespeare's day. \"Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n\" is evidently a corruption of \"Kh\u00e1lidat\u00e1ni\" (for Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1t), the Eternal, as Ibn Wardi calls the Fortunate Islands, or Canaries, which owe both their modern names to the classics of Europe. Their present history dates from A.D. 1385, unless we accept the Dieppe-Rouen legend of Labat which would place the discovery in A.D. 1326. I for one thoroughly believe in the priority on the West African Coast, of the gallant descendants of the Northmen.\n\n[FN#222] Four wives are allowed by Moslem law and for this reason. If you marry one wife she holds herself your equal, answers you and \"gives herself airs\"; two are always quarrelling and making a hell of the house; three are \"no company\" and two of them always combine against the nicest to make her hours bitter. Four are company, they can quarrel and \"make it up\" amongst themselves, and the husband enjoys comparative peace. But the Moslem is bound by his law to deal equally with the four, each must have her dresses her establishment and her night, like her sister wives. The number is taken from the Jews (Arbah Turim Ev. Hazaer, i.) \"the wise men have given good advice that a man should not marry more than four wives.\" Europeans, knowing that Moslem women are cloistered and appear veiled in public, begin with believing them to be mere articles of luxury, and only after long residence they find out that nowhere has the sex so much real liberty and power as in the Moslem East. They can possess property and will it away without the husband's leave: they can absent themselves from the house for a month without his having a right to complain; and they assist in all his counsels for the best of reasons: a man can rely only on his wives and children, being surrounded by rivals who hope to rise by his ruin. As regards political matters the Circassian women of Constantinople really rule the Sultanate and there soignez la femme! is the first lesson of getting on in the official world.\n\n[FN#223] This two-bow prayer is common on the bride-night; and at all times when issue is desired.\n\n[FN#224] The older Camaralzaman=\"Moon of the age.\" Kamar is the moon between her third and twenty-sixth day: Hil\u00e1l during the rest of the month: Badr (plur. Bud\u00far whence the name of the Princess) is the full moon.\n\n[FN#225] Arab \"Ra'\u00e1y\u00e1\" plur. of 'Ra'\u00edyat\" our Anglo-Indian Ryot, lit. a liege, a subject; secondarily a peasant, a Fellah.\n\n[FN#226] Another audacious parody of the Moslem \"testification\" to the one God, and to Mohammed the Apostle.\n\n[FN#227] Showing how long ago forts were armed with metal plates which we have applied to war-ships only of late years.\n\n[FN#228] The comparison is abominably true\u2014in the East.\n\n[FN#229] Two fallen angels who taught men the art of magic. They are mentioned in the Koran (chaps. ii.), and the commentators have extensively embroidered the simple text. Popularly they are supposed to be hanging by their feet in a well in the territory of Babel, hence the frequent allusions to \"Babylonian sorcery\" in Moslem writings; and those who would study the black art at head-quarters are supposed to go there. They are counterparts of the Egyptian Jamnes and Mambres, the Jannes and Jambres of St. Paul (2 Tim. iii. 8).\n\n[FN#230] An idol or idols of the Arabs (Allat and Ozza) before Mohammed (Koran chaps. ii. 256). Etymologically the word means \"error\" and the termination is rather Hebraic than Arabic.\n\n[FN#231] Arab. \"Khayt hamay\u00e1n\" (wandering threads of vanity), or\nMukh\u00e1t al-Shaytan (Satan's snivel),=our \"gossamer\"=God's summer\n(Mutter Gottes Sommer) or God's cymar (?).\n\n[FN#232] These lines occur in Night xvii.; so I borrow from\nTorrens (p. 163) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#233] A posture of peculiar submission; contrasting strongly with the attitude afterwards assumed by Prince Charming.\n\n[FN#234] A mere term of vulgar abuse not reflecting on either parent: I have heard a mother call her own son, \"Child of adultery.\"\n\n[FN#235] Arab. \"Ghaz\u00e1,\" the Artemisia (Euphorbia ?) before noticed. If the word be a misprint for Ghad\u00e1 it means a kind of Euphorbia which, with the Ar\u00e1k (wild caper-tree) and the Daum palm (Crucifera thebiaca), is one of the three normal growths of the Arabian desert (Pilgrimage iii. 22).\n\n[FN#236] Arab. \"Ban\u00e1t al-Na'ash,\" usually translated daughters of the bier, the three stars which represent the horses in either Bear, \"Charles' Wain,\" or Ursa Minor, the waggon being supposed to be a bier. \"Ban\u00e1t\" may be also sons, plur. of Ibn, as the word points to irrational objects. So Job (ix. 9 and xxxviii. 32) refers to U. Major as \"Ash\" or \"Aysh\" in the words, \"Canst thou guide the bier with its sons?\" (erroneously rendered \"Arcturus with his sons\") In the text the lines are enigmatical, but apparently refer to a death parting.\n\n[FN#237] The Chapters are: 2, 3, 36, 55, 67 and the two last (\"Daybreak\" cxiii. and \"Men\" cxiv.), which are called Al-Mu'izzat\u00e1ni (vulgar Al-Mu'izzatayn), the \"Two Refuge-takings or Preventives,\" because they obviate enchantment. I have translated the two latter as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Say:\u2014Refuge I take with the Lord of the Day-break *\nfrom mischief of what He did make *\nfrom mischief of moon eclipse-showing *\nand from mischief of witches on cord-knots blowing *\nand from mischief of envier when envying.\"\n\n\"Say:\u2014Refuge I take with the Lord of men *\nthe sovran of men *\nthe God of men *\nfrom the Tempter, the Demon *\nwho tempteth in whisper the breasts of men *\nand from Jinnis and (evil) men.\"\n\n[FN#238] The recitations were N\u00e1filah, or superogatory, two short chapters only being required and the taking refuge was because he slept in a ruin, a noted place in the East for Ghuls as in the West for ghosts.\n\n[FN#239] Lane (ii. 222) first read \"M\u00faroozee\" and referred it to the Mur\u00faz tribe near Herat he afterwards (iii. 748) corrected it to \"Marwazee,\" of the fabric of Marw (Margiana) the place now famed for \"Mervousness.\" As a man of Rayy (Rhages) becomes R\u00e1z\u00ed (e.g. Ibn F\u00e1ris al-Raz\u00ed), so a man of Marw is Mar\u00e1zi, not Mur\u00fazi nor M\u00e1rwazi. The \"Mikna' \" was a veil forming a kind of \"respirator,\" defending from flies by day and from mosquitos, dews and draughts by night. Easterns are too sensible to sleep with bodies kept warm by bedding, and heads bared to catch every blast. Our grandfathers and grandmothers did well to wear bonnets-de-nuit, however ridiculous they may have looked.\n\n[FN#240] Iblis, meaning the Despairer, is called in the Koran (chaps. xviii. 48) \"One of the genii (Jinnis) who departed from the command of his Lord.\" Mr. Rodwell (in loco) notes that the Satans and Jinnis represent in the Koran (ii. 32, etc.) the evil-principle and finds an admixture of the Semitic Satans and demons with the \"Genii from the Persian (Babylonian ?) and Indian (Egyptian ?) mythologies.\"\n\n[FN#241] Of course she could not see his eyes when they were shut; nor is this mere Eastern inconsequence. The writer means, \"had she seen them, they would have showed,\" etc.\n\n[FN#242] The eyes are supposed to grow darker under the influence of wine and sexual passion.\n\n[FN#243] To keep off the evil eye.\n[FN#244] Like Dahnash this is a fanciful P. N., fit only for a Jinni. As a rule the appellatives of Moslem \"genii\" end in\u00fas (oos), as Tarn\u00fas, Huliy\u00e1nus, the Jewish in\u2014nas, as Jattunas; those of the Tars\u00e1 (the \"funkers\" i.e. Christians) in\u2014d\u00fas, as Sid\u00fas, and the Hindus in\u2014t\u00fas, as Nakt\u00fas (who entered the service of the Prophet Shays, or Seth, and was converted to the Faith). The King of the Genii is Malik Katsh\u00e1n who inhabits Mount Kaf; and to the west of him lives his son-in-law, Abd al-Rahman with 33,000 domestics: these names were given by the Apostle Mohammed. \"Baktan\u00fas\" is lord of three Moslem troops of the wandering Jinns, which number a total of twelve bands and extend from Sind to Europe. The Jinns, Divs, Peris (\"fairies\") and other pre-Adamitic creatures were governed by seventy-two Sultans all known as Sulayman and the last I have said was J\u00e1n bin J\u00e1n. The angel H\u00e1ris was sent from Heaven to chastise him, but in the pride of victory he also revolted with his followers the Jinns whilst the Peris held aloof. When he refused to bow down before Adam he and his chiefs were eternally imprisoned but the other Jinns are allowed to range over earth as a security for man's obedience. The text gives the three orders. flyers. walkers and divers.\n\n[FN#245] i.e. distracted (with love); the Lakab, or poetical name, of apparently a Spanish poet.\n\n[FN#246] Nothing is more \"anti-pathetic\" to Easterns than lean hips and flat hinder-cheeks in women and they are right in insisting upon the characteristic difference of the male and female figure. Our modern sculptors and painters, whose study of the nude is usually most perfunctory, have often scandalised me by the lank and greyhound-like fining off of the frame, which thus becomes rather simian than human.\n\n[FN#247] The small fine foot is a favourite with Easterns as well as Westerns. Ovid (A.A.) is not ashamed \"ad teneros Oscula (not basia or suavia) ferre pedes.\" Ariosto ends the august person in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Il breve, asciutto, e ritondetto piece,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (The short-sized, clean-cut, roundly-moulded foot).\n\nAnd all the world over it is a sign of \"blood,\" i.e. the fine nervous temperament.\n\n[FN#248] i.e. \"full moons\": the French have corrupted it to\n\"Badoure\"; we to \"Badoura.\" winch is worse.\n\n[FN#249] As has been said a single drop of urine renders the clothes ceremoniously impure, hence a Stone or a handful of earth must be used after the manner of the torche-cul. Scrupulous Moslems, when squatting to make water, will prod the ground before them with the point o f stick or umbrella, so as to loosen it and prevent the spraying of the urine.\n\n[FN#250] It is not generally known to Christians that Satan has a wife called Aww\u00e1 (\"Haww\u00e1\" being the Moslem Eve) and, as Adam had three sons, the Tempter has nine, viz., Zu 'l-baysun who rules in bazars. Wassin who prevails in times of trouble. Awan who counsels kings; Haffan patron of wine-bibbers; Marrah of musicians and dancers; Masbut of news-spreaders (and newspapers ?); Dulh\u00e1n who frequents places of worship and interferes with devotion. Dasim, lord of mansions and dinner tables, who prevents the Faithful saying \"Bismillah\" and \"Inshallah,\" as commanded in the Koran (xviii. 23), and Lak\u00eds, lord of Fire worshippers (Herklots, chap. xxix. sect. 4).\n\n[FN#251] Strong perfumes, such as musk (which we Europeans dislike and suspect), are always insisted upon in Eastern poetry, and Mohammed's predilection for them is well known. Moreover the young and the beautiful are held (justly enough) to exhale a natural fragrance which is compared with that of the blessed in Paradise. Hence in the Mu'allakah of Imr al-Keys:\u2014\n\nBreathes the scent of musk when they rise to rove, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As the Zephyr's breath with the flavour o'clove.\n\nIt is made evident by dogs and other fine-nosed animals that every human being has his, or her, peculiar scent which varies according to age and health. Hence animals often detect the approach of death.\n\n[FN#252] Arab. \"Kahl\u00e1.\" This has been explained. Mohammed is said to have been born with \"Kohl'd eyes.\"\n\n[FN#253] Haw\u00e1 al-'uzr\u00ed, before noticed (Night cxiv.).\n\n[FN#254] These lines, with the N\u00e1zir (eye or steward), the H\u00e1jib (Groom of the Chambers or Chamberlain) and Joseph, are also repeated from Night cxiv. For the Nazir see Al-Hariri (Nos. xiii. and xxii.)\n\n[FN#255] The usual allusion to the H\u00far (Houris) from \"Hangar,\" the white and black of the eye shining in contrast. The Persian Magi also placed in their Heaven (Bihisht or Minu) \"Huran,\" or black-eyed nymphs, under the charge of the angel Zamiy\u00e1d.\n\n[FN#256] In the first hemistich, \"bi-shitt 'it w\u00e1dy\" (by the wady-bank): in the second, \"wa shatta 'l w\u00e1dy\" (\"and my slayer\"\u2014 i.e. w\u00e1dy act. part. of wady, killing\u2014\"hath paced away\").\n\n[FN#257] The double entendre is from the proper names Bud\u00far and Su'\u00e1d (Beatrice) also meaning \"auspicious (or blessed) full moons.\"\n\n[FN#258] Arab. \"H\u00e1zir\" (also Ahl al-hazer, townsmen) and B\u00e1di, a Badawi, also called \"Ahl al-Wabar,\" people of the camel's hair (tent) and A'ar\u00e1b (Nomadic) as opposed to Arab (Arab settled or not). They still boast with Ibn Abbas, cousin of Mohammed, that they have kerchiefs (not turbands) for crowns, tents for houses, loops for walls, swords for scarves and poems for registers or written laws.\n\n[FN#259] This is a peculiarity of the Jinn tribe when wearing hideous forms. It is also found in the Hindu Rakshasa.\n\n[FN#260] Which, by the by, are small and beautifully shaped. The animal is very handy with them, as I learnt by experience when trying to \"Rareyfy\" one at Bayrut.\n\n[FN#261] She being daughter of Al-Dimiry\u00e1t, King of the Jinns.\nMr. W. F. Kirby has made him the subject of a pretty poem.\n\n[FN#262] These lines have occurred in Night xxii. I give\nTorrens's version (p. 223) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#263] Arab. \"K\u00e1mat Alfiyyah,\" like an Alif, the first of the Arabic alphabet, the Heb. Aleph. The Arabs, I have said, took the flag or water leaf form and departed very far from the Egyptian original (we know from Plutarch that the hieroglyphic abecedarium began with \"a\"), which was chosen by other imitators, namely the bull's head, and which in the cursive form, especially the Phnician, became a yoke. In numerals \"Alif\" denotes one or one thousand. It inherits the traditional honours of Alpha (as opposed to Omega) and in books, letters and writings generally it is placed as a monogram over the \"Bismillah,\" an additional testimony to the Unity. (See vol. i. p. 1.) In medi\u00e6val Christianity this place of honour was occupied by the cross: none save the wildest countries have preserved it, but our vocabulary still retains Criss' (Christ-)cross Row, for horn-book, on account of the old alphabet and nine digits disposed in the form of a Latin cross. Hence Tickell (\"The Horn-book\"):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014\u2014Mortals ne'er shall know\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        More than contained of old the Chris'-cross Row.\n\n[FN#264] The young man must have been a demon of chastity.\n\n[FN#265] Arab. \"Kir\u00e1t\" from i.e. bean, the seed of the Abrus precatorius, in weight=two to three (English) grains; and in length=one finger-breadth here; 24 being the total. The Moslem system is evidently borrowed from the Roman \"as\" and \"uncia.\"\n\n[FN#266] Names of women.\n\n[FN#267] Arab. \"Amsa\" (lit. he passed the evening) like \"asbaha\" (he rose in the morning) \"Azh\u00e1\" (he spent the forenoon) and \"bata\" (he spent the night), are idiomatically used for \"to be in any state, to continue\" without specification of time or season.\n\n[FN#268] Lit. \"my liver ;\" which viscus, and not the heart, is held the seat of passion, a fancy dating from the oldest days. Theocritus says of Hercules, \"In his liver Love had fixed a wound\" (Idyl. xiii.). In the Anthologia \"Cease, Love, to wound my liver and my heart\" (lib. vii.). So Horace (Odes, i. 2); his Latin Jecur and the Persian \"Jigar\" being evident congeners. The idea was long prevalent and we find in Shakespeare:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Alas, then Love may be called appetite,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         No motion of the liver but the palate.\n\n[FN#269] A marvellous touch of nature, love ousting affection; the same trait will appear in the lover and both illustrate the deep Italian saying, \"Amor discende, non ascende.\" The further it goes down the stronger it becomes as of grand-parent for grand-child and vice versa.\n\n[FN#270] This tenet of the universal East is at once fact and unfact. As a generalism asserting that women's passion is ten times greater than man's (Pilgrimage, ii. 282), it is unfact. The world shows that while women have more philoprogenitiveness, men have more amativeness; otherwise the latter would not propose and would nurse the doll and baby. Pact, however, in low-lying lands, like Persian Mazanderan versus the Plateau; Indian Malabar compared with Mar\u00e1tha-land; California as opposed to Utah and especially Egypt contrasted with Arabia. In these hot damp climates the venereal requirements and reproductive powers of the female greatly exceed those of the male; and hence the dissoluteness of morals would be phenomenal, were it not obviated by seclusion, the sabre and the revolver. In cold-dry or hot-dry mountainous lands the reverse is the case; hence polygamy there prevails whilst the low countries require polyandry in either form, legal or illegal (i,e. prostitution) I have discussed this curious point of \"geographical morality\" (for all morality is, like conscience, both geographical and chronological), a subject so interesting to the lawgiver, the student of ethics and the anthropologist, in \"The City of the Saints \" But strange and unpleasant truths progress slowly, especially in England.\n\n[FN#271] This morning evacuation is considered, in the East, a sine qu\u00e2 non of health; and old Anglo-Indians are unanimous in their opinion of the \"bard fajar\" (as they mispronounce the dawn-clearance). The natives of India, Hind\u00fas (pagans) and Hind\u00eds (Moslems), unlike Europeans, accustom themselves to evacuate twice a day, evening as well as morning. This may, perhaps, partly account for their mildness and effeminacy; for:\u2014\n\nC'est la constipation qui rend l'homme rigoureux.\n\nThe English, since the first invasion of cholera, in October, 1831, are a different race from their costive grandparents who could not dine without a \"dinner-pill.\" Curious to say the clyster is almost unknown to the people of Hindostan although the barbarous West Africans use it daily to \"wash 'um belly,\" as the Bonney-men say. And, as Sonnini notes to propose the process in Egypt under the Beys might have cost a Frankish medico his life.\n\n[FN#272] The Egyptian author cannot refrain from this characteristic polissonnerie; and reading it out is always followed by a roar of laughter. Even serious writers like Al- Hariri do not, as I have noted, despise the indecency.\n\n[FN#273] \"'Long beard and little wits,\" is a saying throughout the East where the Kausaj (= man with thin, short beard) is looked upon as cunning and tricksy. There is a venerable Joe Miller about a schoolmaster who, wishing to singe his long beard short, burnt it off and his face to boot:\u2014which reminded him of the saying. A thick beard is defined as one which wholly conceals the skin; and in ceremonial ablution it must be combed out with the fingers till the water reach the roots. The Sunnat, or practice of the Prophet, was to wear the beard not longer than one hand and two fingers' breadth. In Persian \"K\u00faseh\" (thin beard) is an insulting term opposed to \"Khush-r\u00edsh,\" a well-bearded man. The Iranian growth is perhaps the finest in the world, often extending to the waist; but it gives infinite trouble, requiring, for instance, a bag when travelling. The Arab beard is often composed of two tufts on the chin-sides and straggling hairs upon the cheeks; and this is a severe mortification, especially to Shaykhs and elders, who not only look upon the beard as one of man's characteristics, but attach a religious importance to the appendage. Hence the enormity of Kamar al-Zaman's behaviour. The Persian festival of the vernal equinox was called Kusehnish\u00edn (Thin-beard sitting). An old man with one eye paraded the streets on an ass with a crow in one hand and a scourge and fan in the other, cooling himself, flogging the bystanders and crying heat! heat! (garm\u00e1! garm\u00e1!). For other particulars see Richardson (Dissertation, p. Iii.). This is the Italian Giorno delle Vecchie, Thursday in Mid Lent, March 12 (1885), celebrating the death of Winter and the birth of Spring.\n\n[FN#274] I quote Torrens (p. 400) as these lines have occurred in\nNight xxxviii.\n\n[FN#275] Moslems have only two names for week days, Friday,\nAl-Jum'ah or meeting-day, and Al-Sabt, Sabbath day, that is\nSaturday. The others are known by numbers after Quaker fashion\nwith us, the usage of Portugal and Scandinavia.\n\n[FN#276] Our last night.\n\n[FN#277] Arab. \"Tayf\"=phantom, the nearest approach to our \"ghost,\" that queer remnant of Fetishism imbedded in Christianity; the phantasma, the shade (not the soul) of tile dead. Hence the accurate Niebuhr declares, \"apparitions (i.e., of the departed) are unknown in Arabia.\" Haunted houses are there tenanted by Ghuls, Jinns and a host of supernatural creatures; but not by ghosts proper; and a man may live years in Arabia before he ever hears of the \"Tayf.\" With the Hindus it is otherwise (Pilgrimage iii. 144). Yet the ghost, the embodied fear of the dead and of death is common, in a greater or less degree, to all peoples; and, as modern Spiritualism proves, that ghost is not yet laid.\n\n[FN#278] Mr. Payne (iii. 133) omits the lines which are \u00e0propos de rein and read much like \"nonsense verses.\" I retain them simply because they are in the text.\n\n[FN#279] The first two couplets are the quatrain (or octave) in\nNight xxxv.\n\n[FN#280] Arab. \"Ar'ar,\" the Heb. \"Aroer,\" which Luther and the A.\nV. translate \"heath.\" The modern Aramaic name is \"Lizz\u00e1b\"\n(Unexplored Syria. i. 68).\n\n[FN#281] In the old version and the Bresl. Edit. (iii. 220) the\nPrincess beats the \"Kahram\u00e1nah,\" but does not kill her.\n\n[FN#282] 'This is still the popular Eastern treatment of the insane.\n\n[FN#283] Pers. \"Marz-b\u00e1n\" = Warden of the Marches, Margrave. The foster-brother in the East is held dear as, and often dearer than, kith and kin.\n\n[FN#284] The moderns believe most in the dawn-dream.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014Quirinus\n\nPost mediam noctem visus, quum somnia vera.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          (Horace Sat. i. 10, 33,)\n\n[FN#285] The Bresl.

Both are used by Nizami and Al-Hariri, the most \"elegant\" of Arab writers.\n\n[FN#287] These form a Kas\u00eddah, Ode or Elegy= rhymed couplets numbering more than thirteen: If shorter it is called a \"Ghazal.\" I have not thought it necessary to preserve the monorhyme.\n\n[FN#288] Sulaym\u00e1 dim. of Salm\u00e1= any beautiful woman Rab\u00e1b = the viol mostly single stringed: Tan'oum=she who is soft and gentle.

The distich is highly fanciful and the conceits would hardly occur to a\n\n[FN#290] Arab. \"Andam,\" a term applied to Brazil-wood (also called \"Bakkam\") and to \"dragon's blood,\" but not, I think, to tragacanth, the \"goat's thorn,\" which does not dye. Andam is often mentioned in The Nights.\n\n[FN#291] The superior merit of the first (explorer, etc.) is a lieu commun with Arabs. So Al-Hariri in Preface quotes his predecessor:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Justly of praise the price I pay;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          The praise is his who leads the way.\n\n[FN#292] There were two Lukmans, of whom more in a future page.\n\n[FN#293] This symbolic action is repeatedly mentioned in The\nNights.\n\n[FN#294] Arab. \"Shakhs\"=a person, primarily a dark spot. So \"Saw\u00e1d\"=blackness, in Al-Hariri means a group of people who darken the ground by their shade.\n\n[FN#295] The first bath after sickness, I have said, is called\n\"Ghusl al-Sihhah,\"\u2014the Washing of Health.\n\n[FN#296] The words \"malady\" and \"disease\" are mostly avoided during these dialogues as ill-omened words which may bring on a relapse.\n\n[FN#297] Solomon's carpet of green silk which carried him and all his host through the air is a Talmudic legend generally accepted in Al-Islam though not countenanced by the Koran. chaps xxvii. When the \"gnat's wing\" is mentioned, the reference is to Nimrod who, for boasting that he was lord of all, was tortured during four hundred years by a gnat sent by Allah up his ear or nostril.\n\n[FN#298] The absolute want of morality and filial affection in the chaste young man is supposed to be caused by the violence of his passion, and he would be pardoned because he \"loved much.\"\n\n[FN#299] I have noticed the geomantic process in my \"History of Sindh\" (chaps. vii.). It is called \"Zarb al-Ram!\" (strike the sand, the French say \"frapper le sable\") because the rudest form is to make on the ground dots at haphazard, usually in four lines one above the other: these are counted and, if even-numbered, two are taken ( ** ); if odd one ( * ); and thus the four lines will form a scheme say * * * * * * This is repeated three times, producing the same number of figures; and then the combination is sought in an explanatory table or, if the practitioner be expert, he pronounces off-hand. The Nights speak of a \"Takht Raml\" or a board, like a schoolboy's slate, upon which the dots are inked instead of points in sand. The moderns use a \"Kura'h,\" or oblong die, upon whose sides the dots, odd and even, are marked; and these dice are hand-thrown to form the e figure. By way of complication Geomancy is mixed up with astrology and then it becomes a most complicated kind of ariolation and an endless study. \"Napoleon's Book of Fate,\" a chap-book which appeared some years ago, was Geomancy in its simplest and most ignorant shape. For the rude African form see my Mission to Dahome, i. 332, and for that of Darfour, pp. 360-69 of Shaykh Mohammed's Voyage before quoted.\n\n[FN#300] Translators understand this of writing marriage contracts; I take it in a more general sense.\n\n[FN#301] These lines are repeated from Night Ixxv.: with Mr. Payne's permission I give his rendering (iii. 153) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#302] The comparison is characteristically Arab.\n\n[FN#303] Not her \"face\": the head, and especially the back of the head, must always be kept covered, even before the father.\n\n[FN#304] Arab. \"Siw\u00e1k\"=a tooth-stick; \"Siw\u00e1-ka\"=lit. other than thou.\n\n[FN#305] Arab. \"Ar\u00e1k\"=tooth stick of the wild caper-tree; \"Ar\u00e1-ka\" lit.=I see thee. The capparis spinosa is a common desert-growth and the sticks about a span long (usually called Misw\u00e1k), are sold in quantities at Meccah after being dipped in Zemzem water. In India many other woods are used, date-tree, Salvadora, Achyrantes, phyllanthus, etc. Amongst Arabs peculiar efficacy accompanies the tooth-stick of olive, \"the tree springing from Mount Sinai\" (Koran xxiii. 20); and Mohammed would use no other, because it prevents decay and scents the mouth. Hence Koran, chaps. xcv. 1. The \"Misw\u00e1k\" is held with the unused end between the ring-finger and minimus, the two others grasp the middle and the thumb is pressed against the back close to the lips. These articles have long been sold at the Medical Hall near the \"Egyptian Hall,\" Piccadilly. They are better than our unclean tooth-brushes because each tooth gets its own especial rubbing' not a general sweep; at the same time the operation is longer and more troublesome. In parts of Africa as well as Asia many men walk about with the tooth-stick hanging by a string from the neck.\n\n[FN#306] The \"Mehari,\" of which the Algerine-French speak, are the dromedaries bred by the Mahrah tribe of Al-Yaman, the descendants of Mahrat ibn Haydan. They are covered by small wild camels (?) called Al-H\u00fash, found between Oman and Al-Shihr: others explain the word to mean \"stallions of the Jinns \" and term those savage and supernatural animals, \"Naj\u00e1ib al-Mahriyah\"nobles of the Mahrah.\n\n[FN#307] Arab. \"Khaznah\"=a thousand purses; now about \u00a35000. It denotes a large sum of money, like the \"Badrah,\" a purse containing 10,000 dirhams of silver (Al-Hariri), or 80,000 (Burckhardt Prov. 380); whereas the \"Nis\u00e1b\" is a moderate sum of money, gen. 20 gold dinars=200 silver dirhams.\n\n[FN#308] As The Nights show, Arabs admire slender forms; but the hips and hinder cheeks must be highly developed and the stomach fleshy rather than lean. The reasons are obvious. The Persians who exaggerate everything say e.g. (Husayn V\u00e1iz in the Anv\u00e1r-i-Suhayli):\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          How paint her hips and waist ? Who saw\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          A mountain (Koh) dangling to a straw (k\u00e1h)?\n\nIn Antar his beloved Abla is a tamarisk (T. Orientalis). Others compare with the palm-tree (Solomon), the Cypress (Persian, esp. Hafiz and Firdausi) and the Ar\u00e1k or wild Capparis (Arab.).\n\n[FN#309] Ubi aves ibi angel). All African travellers know that a few birds flying about the bush, and a few palm-trees waving in the wind, denote the neighbourhood of a village or a camp (where angels are scarce). The reason is not any friendship for man but because food, animal and vegetable, is more plentiful Hence Albatrosses, Mother Carey's (Mater Cara, the Virgin) chickens, and Cape pigeons follow ships.\n\n[FN#310] The stanza is called Al-Mukhammas=cinquains; the quatrains and the \"bob,\" or \"burden\" always preserve the same consonance. It ends with a Koranic lieu commun of Moslem morality.\n\n[FN#311] Moslem port towns usually have (or had) only two gates. Such was the case with Bayrut, Tyre, Sidon and a host of others; the faubourg-growth of modern days has made these obsolete. The portals much resemble the entrances of old Norman castles\u2014Arques for instance. (Pilgrimage i. 185.)\n\n[FN#312] Arab. \"Lis\u00e1m\"; before explained.\n\n[FN#313] i.e. Life of Souls (persons, etc.).\n\n[FN#314] Arab. \"Ins\u00e1nu-h\u00e1\"=her (i.e. their) man: i.e. the babes of the eyes: the Assyrian Ishon, dim. of Ish=Man; which the Hebrews call \"B\u00e1bat\" or \"Bit\" (the daughter) the Arabs \"Bubu (or Hadakat) al-Aye\"; the Persians \"Mardumak-i-chashm\" (mannikin of the eye); the Greeks and the Latins pupa, pupula, pupilla. I have noted this in the Lyricks of Camoens (p. 449).\n\n[FN#315] Ma'an bin Z\u00e1'idah, a soldier and statesman of the eighth century.\n\n[FN#316] The mildness of the Caliph Mu'\u00e1wiyah, the founder of the Ommiades, proverbial among the Arabs, much resembles the \"meekness\" of Moses the Law-giver, which commentators seem to think has been foisted into Numbers xii. 3.\n\n[FN#317] Showing that there had been no consummation of the marriage which would have demanded \"Ghusl,\" or total ablution, at home or in the Hammam.\n\n[FN#318] I have noticed this notable desert-growth.\n\n[FN#319] 'The \"situation\" is admirable, solution appearing so difficult and catastrophe imminent.\n\n[FN#320] This quatrain occurs in Night ix.: I have borrowed from\nTorrens (p. 79) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#321] The belief that young pigeon's blood resembles the virginal discharge is universal; but the blood most resembling man's is that of the pig which in other points is so very human. In our day Arabs and Hindus rarely submit to inspection the nuptial sheet as practiced by the Israelites and Persians. The bride takes to bed a white kerchief with which she staunches the blood and next morning the stains are displayed in the Harem. In Darfour this is done by the bridegroom. \"Prima Venus debet esse cruenta,\" say the Easterns with much truth, and they have no faith in our complaisant creed which allows the hymen-membrane to disappear by any but one accident.\n\n[FN#322] Not meaning the two central divisions commanded by the\nKing and his Wazir.\n\n[FN#323] Ironic\u00e8.\n\n[FN#324] Arab. \"Rasy\"=praising in a funeral sermon.\n\n[FN#325] Arab. \"Man\u00e1y\u00e1,\" plur. of \"Maniyat\" = death. Mr. R. S. Poole (the Academy, April 26, 1879) reproaches Mr. Payne for confounding \"Muniyat\" (desire) with \"Maniyat\" (death) but both are written the same except when vowel-points are used.\n\n[FN#326] Arab. \"Iddat,\" alluding to the months of celibacy which, according to Moslem law, must be passed by a divorced woman before she can re-marry.\n\n[FN#327] Arab. \"Tal\u00e1k bi'l-Sal\u00e1sah\"=a triple divorce which cannot be revoked; nor can the divorcer re-marry the same woman till after consummation with another husband. This subject will continually recur.\n\n[FN#328] An allusion to a custom of the pagan Arabs in the days of ignorant Heathenism The blood or brain, soul or personality of the murdered man formed a bird called Sady or H\u00e1mah (not the Hum\u00e1 or Hum\u00e1i, usually translated \"phnix\") which sprang from the head, where four of the five senses have their seat, and haunted his tomb, crying continually, \"Usk\u00fani!\"=Give me drink (of the slayer's blood) ! and which disappeared only when the vendetta was accomplished. Mohammed forbade the belief. Amongst the Southern Slavs the cuckoo is supposed to be the sister of a murdered man ever calling or vengeance.\n\n[FN#329] To obtain a blessing and show how he valued it.\n\n[FN#330] Well-known tribes of proto-historic Arabs who flourished before the time of Abraham: see Koran (chaps. xxvi. et passim). They will be repeatedly mentioned in The Nights and notes.\n\n[FN#331] Arab. \"Amt\u00e1r\"; plur. of \"Matr,\" a large vessel of leather or wood for water, etc.\n\n[FN#332] Arab. \"As\u00e1f\u00edr\u00ed,\" so called because they attract sparrows (as\u00e1f\u00edr) a bird very fond of the ripe oily fruit. In the Romance of \"Antar\" As\u00e1f\u00edr camels are beasts that fly like birds in fleetness. The reader must not confound the olives of the text with the hard unripe berries (\"little plums pickled in stale\") which appear at English tables, nor wonder that bread and olives are the beef-steak and potatoes of many Mediterranean peoples It is an excellent diet, the highly oleaginous fruit supplying the necessary carbon,\n\n[FN#333] Arab. \"Tamer al-Hindi\"=the \"Indian-date,\" whence our word \"Tamarind.\" A sherbet of the pods, being slightly laxative, is much drunk during the great heats; and the dried fruit, made into small round cakes, is sold in the bazars. The traveller is advised not to sleep under the tamarind's shade, which is infamous for causing ague and fever. In Sind I derided the \"native nonsense,\" passed the night under an \"Indian date-tree\" and awoke with a fine specimen of ague which lasted me a week.\n\n[FN#334] Moslems are not agreed upon the length of the Day of Doom when all created things, marshalled by the angels, await final judgment; the different periods named are 40 years, 70, 300 and 50,000. Yet the trial itself will last no longer than while one may milk an ewe, or than \"the space between two milkings of a she-camel.\" This is bringing down Heaven to Earth with a witness; but, after all, the Heaven of all faiths, including \"Spiritualism,\" the latest development, is only an earth more or less glorified even as the Deity is humanity more or less perfected.\n\n[FN#335] Arab. \"Al-Kamar\u00e1ni,\" lit. \"the two moons.\" Arab rhetoric prefers it to \"Shams\u00e1ni,\" or {`two suns,\" because lighter (akhaff), to pronounce. So, albeit Omar was less worthy than Abu-Bakr the two are called \"Al-Omar\u00e1ni,\" in vulgar parlance, Omarayn.\n\n[FN#336] Alluding to the angels who appeared to the Sodomites in the shape of beautiful youths (Koran xi.).\n\n[FN#337] Koran xxxiii. 38.\n\n[FN#338] \"Niktu-hu taklidan\" i.e. not the real thing (with a woman). It may also mean \"by his incitement of me.\" All this scene is written in the worst form of Persian-Egyptian blackguardism, and forms a curious anthropological study. The \"black joke\" of the true and modest wife is inimitable.\n\n[FN#339] Arab. \"Jam\u00edz\" (in Egypt \"Jammayz\") = the fruit of the true sycomore (F. Sycomorus) a magnificent tree which produces a small tasteless fig, eaten by the poorer classes in Egypt and by monkeys. The \"T\u00edn\" or real fig here is the woman's parts; the \"mulberry- fig,\" the anus. Martial (i. 65) makes the following distinction:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficus, quas scimus in arbore nasci,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficos, Caeciliane, tuos.\n\nAnd Modern Italian preserves a difference between fico and fica.\n\n[FN#340] Arab. \"Gh\u00e1niyat Az\u00e1r\u00e1\" (plur. of Azr\u00e1 = virgin): the former is properly a woman who despises ornaments and relies on \"beauty unadorned\" (i.e. in bed).\n\n[FN#341] \"Nihil usitatius apud monachos, cardinales, sacrificulos,\" says Johannes de la Casa Beneventius Episcopus, quoted by Burton Anat. of Mel. lib. iii. Sect. 2; and the famous epitaph on the Jesuit,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Ci-git un Jesuite:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Passant, serre les fesses et passe vite!\n\n[FN#342] Arab. \"Kiblah\"=the fronting-place of prayer, Meccah for Moslems, Jerusalem for Jews and early Christians. See Pilgrimage (ii. 321) for the Moslem change from Jerusalem to Meccah and ibid. (ii. 213) for the way in which the direction was shown.\n\n[FN#343] The Koran says (chaps. ii.): \"Your wives are your tillage: go in therefore unto your tillage in what manner so ever ye will.\" Usually this is understood as meaning in any posture, standing or sitting, lying, backwards or forwards. Yet there is a popular saying about the man whom the woman rides (vulg. St. George, in France, le Postillon); \"Cursed be who maketh woman Heaven and himself earth!\" Some hold the Koranic passage to have been revealed in confutation of the Jews, who pretended that if a man lay with his wife backwards, he would beget a cleverer child. Others again understand it of preposterous venery, which is absurd: every ancient law-giver framed his code to increase the true wealth of the people\u2014population\u2014and severely punished all processes, like onanism, which impeded it. The Persians utilise the hatred of women for such misuse when they would force a wive to demand a divorce and thus forfeit her claim to Mahr (dowry); they convert them into catamites till, after a month or so, they lose all patience and leave the house.\n\n[FN#344] Koran lit 9: \"He will be turned aside from the Faith (or Truth) who shall be turned aside by the Divine decree;\" alluding, in the text, to the preposterous venery her lover demands.\n[FN#345] Arab. \"Fut\u00fah\" meaning openings, and also victories, benefits. The lover congratulates her on her mortifying self in order to please him.\n\n[FN#346] \"And the righteous work will be exalt\": (Koran xxxv. 11) applied ironically.\n\n[FN#347] A prolepsis of Tommy Moore:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Your mother says, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         There's something not quite right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               And you're in fault as much as I,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Now, on my soul, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          I swear 'twould not be right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               To let your mother tell a lie.\n\nBut the Arab is more moral than Mr. Little. as he purposes to repent.\n\n[FN#348] Arab. \"Khunsa\" flexible or flaccid, from Khans=bending inwards, i.e. the mouth of a water-skin before drinking. Like Mukhannas, it is also used for an effeminate man, a passive sodomite and even for a eunuch. Easterns still believe in what Westerns know to be an impossibility, human beings with the parts and proportions of both sexes equally developed and capable of reproduction; and Al-Islam even provides special rules for them (Pilgrimage iii. 237). We hold them to be Buffon's fourth class of (duplicate) monsters belonging essentially to one or the other sex, and related to its opposite only by some few characteristics. The old Greeks dreamed, after their fashion, a beautiful poetic dream of a human animal uniting the contradictory beauties of man and woman. The duality of the generative organs seems an old Egyptian tradition, at least we find it in Genesis (i. 27) where the image of the Deity is created male and female, before man was formed out of the dust of the ground (ii. 7). The old tradition found its way to India (if the Hindus did not borrow the idea from the Greeks); and one of the forms of Mahadeva, the third person of their triad, is entitled \"Ardhan\u00e1r\u00ed\"=the Half-woman, which has suggested to them some charming pictures. Europeans, seeing the left breast conspicuously feminine, have indulged in silly surmises about the \"Amazons.\"\n\n[FN#349] This is a mere phrase for our \"dying of laughter\": the queen was on her back. And as Easterns sit on carpets, their falling back is very different from the same movement off a chair.\n\n[FN#350] Arab. \"Ismid,\" the eye-powder before noticed.\n\n[FN#351] When the Caliph (e.g. Al-T\u00e1'i li'llah) bound a banner to a spear and handed it to an officer, he thereby appointed him Sultan or Viceregent.\n\n[FN#352] Arab. \"Sh\u00e1ib al-ingh\u00e1z\"=lit. a gray beard who shakes head in disapproval.\n\n[FN#353] Arab. \"Ay\u00e1t\" = the Hebr. \"Ototh,\" signs, wonders or\nKoranic verses.\n\n[FN#354] The Chapter \"Al-Ikhl\u00e1s\" i.e. clearing (oneself from any faith but that of Unity) is No. cxii. and runs thus:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Say, He is the One God!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                The sempiternal God,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0           He begetteth not, nor is He begot,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0              And unto Him the like is not.\n\nIt is held to be equal in value to one-third of the Koran, and is daily used in prayer. Mr. Rodwell makes it the tenth.\n\n[FN#355] The Lady Budur shows her noble blood by not objecting to her friend becoming her Zarrat (sister-wife). This word is popularly derived from \"Zarar\"=injury; and is vulgarly pronounced in Egypt \"Durrah\" sounding like Durrah = a parrot (see Burckhardt's mistake in Prov. 314). The native proverb says, \"Ayshat al-durrah murrah,\" the sister-wife hath a bitter life. We have no English equivalent; so I translate indifferently co-wife, co-consort, sister-wife or sister in wedlock.\n\n[FN#356] Lane preserves the article \"El-Amjad\" and \"El-As'ad;\" which is as necessary as to say \"the John\" or \"the James,\" because neo-Latins have \"il Giovanni\" or \"il Giacomo.\" In this matter of the article, however, it is impossible to lay down a universal rule: in some cases it must be preserved and only practice in the language can teach its use. For instance, it is always present in Al-Bahrayn and al-Yaman; but not necessarily so with Irak and Najd.\n\n[FN#357] It is hard to say why this ugly episode was introduced.\nIt is a mere false note in a tune pretty enough.\n\n[FN#358] The significance of this action will presently appear.\n\n[FN#359] An \"Had\u00eds.\"\n\n[FN#360] Arab. \"Sabb\" = using the lowest language of abuse. chiefly concerning women-relatives and their reproductive parts.\n\n[FN#361] The reader will note in the narration concerning the two Queens the parallelism of the Arab's style which recalls that of the Hebrew poets. Strings of black silk are plaited into the long locks (an \"idiot-fringe\" being worn over the brow) because a woman is cursed \"who joineth her own hair to the hair of another\" (especially human hair). Sending the bands is a sign of affectionate submission; and, in extremes\" cases the hair itself is sent.\n\n[FN#362] i.e., suffer similar pain at the spectacle, a phrase often occurring.\n\n[FN#363] i.e., when the eye sees not, the heart grieves not.\n\n[FN#364] i.e., unto Him we shall return, a sentence recurring in almost every longer chapter of the Koran.\n\n[FN#365] Arab. \"Kun,\" the creative Word (which, by the by, proves the Koran to be an uncreated Logos); the full sentence being \"Kun fa k\u00e1na\" = Be! and it became. The origin is evidently, \"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light\" (Gen. i. 3); a line grand in its simplicity and evidently borrowed from the Egyptians, even as Yahveh (Jehovah) from \"Ankh\"=He who lives (Brugsch Hist. ii. 34).\n\n[FN#366] i.e. but also for the life and the so-called \"soul.\"\n\n[FN#367] Arab. \"Lay\u00e1li\"=lit. nights which, I have said, is often applied to the whole twenty-four hours. Here it is used in the sense of \"fortune\" or \"fate ;\" like \"days\" and \"days and nights.\"\n\n[FN#368] Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr a nephew of Ayishah, who had rebuilt the Ka'abah in A.H. 64 (A.D. 683), revolted (A.D. 680) against Yezid and was proclaimed Caliph at Meccah. He was afterwards killed (A.D. 692) by the famous or infamous Hajj\u00e1j general of Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, the fifth Ommiade, surnamed \"Sweat of a stone\" (skin-flint) and \"Father of Flies,\" from his foul breath. See my Pilgrimage, etc. (iii. 192-194), where are explained the allusions to the Ka'abah and the holy Black Stone.\n\n[FN#369] These lines are part of an elegy on the downfall of one of the Moslem dynasties in Spain, composed in the twelfth century by Ibn Abdun al-Andal\u00fasi. The allusion is to the famous conspiracy of the Kh\u00e1rijites (the first sectarians in Mohammedanism) to kill Ah, Mu'awiyah and Amru (so written but pronounced \"Amr\") al-As, in order to abate intestine feuds m Al-Islam. Ali was slain with a sword-cut by Ibn Muljam a name ever damnable amongst the Persians; Mu'awiyah escaped with a wound and Kharijah, the Chief of Police at Fustat or old Cairo was murdered by mistake for Amru. After this the sectarian wars began.\n\n[FN#370] Arab. \"Sar\u00e1b\"= (Koran, chaps. xxiv.) the reek of the Desert, before explained. It is called \"Lama,\" the shine, the loom, in Al-Hariri. The world is compared with the mirage, the painted eye and the sword that breaks in the sworder's hand.\n\n[FN#371] Arab. \"Duny\u00e1,\" with the common alliteration \"d\u00e1niyah\" (=Pers. \"d\u00fan\"), in prose as well as poetry means the things or fortune of this life opp. to \"Akhirah\"=future life.\n\n[FN#372] Arab. \"Walgh,\" a strong expression primarily denoting the lapping of dogs; here and elsewhere \"to swill, saufen.\"\n\n[FN#373] The lines are repeated from Night ccxxi. I give Lane's version (ii. 162) by way of contrast and\u2014warning.\n\n[FN#374] \"S\u00e1hirah\" is the place where human souls will be gathered on Doom-day: some understand by it the Hell Sa'\u00edr (No. iv.) intended for the Sabians or the Devils generally.\n\n[FN#375] His eyes are faded like Jacob's which, after weeping for Joseph, \"became white with mourning\" (Koran, chaps. xxi.). It is a stock comparison.\n\n[FN#376] The grave.\n\n[FN#377] Arab. \"Saww\u00e1n\" (popularly pronounced Suw\u00e1n) =\"Syenite\" from Syrene; generally applied to silex, granite or any hard stone.\n\n[FN#378] A proceeding fit only for thieves and paupers: \"Alpinism\" was then unknown. \"You come from the mountain\" (al-Jabal) means, \"You are a clod-hopper\"; and \"I will sit upon the mountain\"=turn anchorite or magician. (Pilgrimage i. 106.)\n\n[FN#379] Corresponding with wayside chapels in Catholic countries. The Moslem form would be either a wall with a prayer niche (Mibr\u00e1b) fronting Meccah-wards or a small domed room. These little oratories are often found near fountains, streams or tree-clumps where travellers would be likely to alight. I have described one in Sind (\"Scinde or the Unhappy Valley\" i. 79), and have noted that scrawling on the walls is even more common in the East than in the West; witness the monuments of old Egypt bescribbled by the Greeks and Romans. Even the paws of the Sphinx are covered with such graffiti; and those of Ipsambul or Abu S\u00edmbal have proved treasures to epigraphists.\n\n[FN#380] In tales this characterises a Persian; and Hero Rustam is always so pictured.\n\n[FN#381] The Parsis, who are the representatives of the old Guebres, turn towards the sun and the fire as their Kiblah or point of prayer; all deny that they worship it. But, as in the case of saints' images, while the educated would pray before them for edification (Labia) the ignorant would adore them (Dulia); and would make scanty difference between the \"reverence of a servant\" and the \"reverence of a slave.\" The human sacrifice was quite contrary to Guebre, although not to Hindu, custom; although hate and vengeance might prompt an occasional murder.\n\n[FN#382] These oubliettes are common in old eastern houses as in the medieval Castles of Europe, and many a stranger has met his death in them. They are often so well concealed that even the modern inmates are not aware of their existence.\n\n[FN#383] Arab. \"Bakk\"; hence our \"bug\" whose derivation (like that of \"cat\" \"dog\" and \"hog\") is apparently unknown to the dictionaries, always excepting M. Littr\u00e9's.\n\n[FN#384] i.e. thy beauty is ever increasing.\n\n[FN#385] Alluding, as usual, to the eye-lashes, e.g.\nAn eyelash arrow from an eyebrow bow.\n\n[FN#386] Lane (ii. 168) reads:\u2014\"The niggardly female is protected by her niggardness;\" a change of \"Nah\u00edlah\" (bee-hive) into \"Bakh\u00edlah\" (she skin flint).\n\n[FN#387] Koran iv. 38. The advantages are bodily strength, understanding and the high privilege of Holy War. Thus far, and thus far only, woman amongst Moslems is \"lesser\n\n[FN#388] Arab. \"Amir Y\u00e1kh\u00far,\" a corruption of \"Akhor\"=stable\n(Persian).\n\n[FN#389] A servile name in Persian, meaning \"the brave,\" and a title of honour at the Court of Delhi when following the name. Many English officers have made themselves ridiculous (myself amongst the number) by having it engraved on their seal-rings, e.g. Brown S\u00e1hib Bah\u00e1dur. To write the word \"Behadir\" or \"Bah\u00e1dir\" is to adopt the wretched Turkish corruption.\n\n[FN#390] \"Jerry Sneak\" would be the English reader's comment; but in the East all charges are laid upon women.\n\n[FN#391] Here the formula means \"I am sorry for it, but I couldn't help it.\"\n\n[FN#392] A noble name of the Persian Kings (meaning the planet\nMars) corrupted in Europe to Varanes.\n\n[FN#393] Arab. \"Jall\u00e1b,\" one of the three muharram\u00e1t or forbiddens, the H\u00e1rik al-hajar (burner of stone) the K\u00e1ti' al-shajar (cutter of trees, without reference to Hawarden N. B.) and the B\u00e1yi' al-bashar (seller of men, vulg. Jall\u00e1b). The two former worked, like the Italian Carbonari, in desert places where they had especial opportunities for crime. (Pilgrimage iii. 140.) None of these things must be practiced during Pilgrimage on the holy soil of Al-Hijaz\u2014not including Jeddah.\n\n[FN#394] The verses contain the tenets of the Murjiy sect which attaches infinite importance to faith and little or none to works. Sale (sect. viii.) derives his \"Morgians\" from the \"Jabrians\" (Jabari), who are the direct opponents of the \"Kadarians\" (Kadari), denying free will and free agency to man and ascribing his actions wholly to Allah. Lane (ii. 243) gives the orthodox answer to the heretical question:\u2014\n\nWater could wet him not if God please guard His own; *\nNor need man care though bound of hands in sea he's thrown:\nBut if His Lord decree that he in sea be drowned; *\nHe'll drown albeit in the wild and wold he wone.\n\nIt is the old quarrel between Predestination and Freewill which cannot be solved except by assuming a Law without a Lawgiver.\n\n[FN#395] Our proverb says: Give a man luck and throw him into the sea.\n\n[FN#396] As a rule Easterns, I repeat, cover head and face when sleeping especially in the open air and moonlight. Europeans find the practice difficult, and can learn it only by long habit.\n\n[FN#397] Pers. = a flower-garden. In Galland, Bahram has two daughters, Bostama and Cavam a. In the Bres. Edit. the daughter is \"Bostan\" and the slave-girl \"Kaw\u00e1m.\"\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Kah\u00edl\"=eyes which look as if darkened with antimony: hence the name of the noble Arab breed of horses \"Kuhaylat\" (Al-Ajuz, etc.).\n\n[FN#399] \"As'ad\"=more (or most) fortunate.\n\n[FN#400] This is the vulgar belief, although Mohammed expressly disclaimed the power in the Koran (chaps. xiii. 8), \"Thou art commissioned to be a preacher only and not a worker of miracles.\" \"Signs\" (Arab. Ay\u00e1t) may here also mean verses of the Koran, which the Apostle of Allah held to be his standing miracles. He despised the common miracula which in the East are of everyday occurrence and are held to be easy for any holy man. Hume does not believe in miracles because he never saw one. Had he travelled in the East he would have seen (and heard of) so many that his scepticism (more likely that testimony should be false than miracles be true) would have been based on a firmer foundation. It is one of the marvels of our age that whilst two-thirds of Christendom (the Catholics and the \"Orthodox\" Greeks) believe in \"miracles\" occurring not only in ancient but even in our present days, the influential and intelligent third (Protestant) absolutely \"denies the fact.\"\n\n[FN#401] Arab. \"Al-Shah\u00e1dat\u00e1ni\"; testifying the Unity and the\nApostleship.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/709244", "artist_names": "Bobby Vee (Ft.
