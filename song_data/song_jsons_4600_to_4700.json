This generation, the wise ones, this is what it is\n\n[Verse 1: Avatar the Articulate (AKA Avie Fresh)]\nImagine getting baked in the States without the jakes taping\nYour plates, no papers, just vapors, no waste\nNo smoke, no carcinogens, no chemical waste that companies\nPut in tobacco, keep us strapped to the taste\nNo baseheads, no Feds, won\u2019t be no crime \u2018cause there\u2019s no money\nHolodecks simulate sex, so there\u2019s no monkeys\nNo rape, no gas on interstates\nOnly solar power, showers go straight to toilet tanks\nNo doctors that misdiagnose just to bill\nNo frills, everybody chill, no Jong Ill\nNo nukes, no troops, no dictators to kill\nNo education gap crap that we instantly fill\nNo BPA in plastic, hard deals with no blue pills\nNo bills, there\u2019s food for everyone, no reason to steal\nThat\u2019s real.  It\u2019s just some thoughts for your mind frame.  If I ruled\nThe world, no rappers would get plaques just to rhyme lame\n[Hook: Gabrielle Billie and (Avatar the Articulate (AKA Avie Fresh))]\nIf I ruled the world\n(Imagine that)\nI\u2019d free all my sons\nI love \u2018em, love \u2018em, baby\nBlack diamonds and pearls\n(Could it be?  If you could be mine, we\u2019d both shine)\nIf I ruled the world\n(Still living for today in these last days and times)\n\n[Verse 2: Avatar the Articulate (AKA Avie Fresh)]\nYo, uh\nNow if I ruled the world, I probably really wouldn\u2019t rule it.  I would\nJust lie back with a sack and mint julips, have it\nAll computed, citizens could choose what the future\u2019s root is\nIt\u2019s better than being controlled by a few that\u2019s suited\nBusiness decisions fucking up the system.  I\u2019ll puff the izm\nAnd hold my head.  When I\u2019m dead, what up with my children?\nLet\u2019s make a better place for them to live in, no BP\nAnd Exxon fucking up rivers and our fishing\nOpen your eyes to the lies histories told foul\nWhen drug companies kill and never get no trial\nCars took alcohol \u2018til Prohibition made us switch to oil\nFor fourteen years, and there\u2019s the biggest trick of all\nMake college free and all knowledge free, no virus\nNo violence.  Fuck all them old policies\nI\u2019d use science to remove the wool that keeps us people blinded\nTalk only facts\u2014if it\u2019s not that, then keep quiet\nStar Trek whips phase out the planes\nUnderwater trains powered by magnets kind of strange\nIt sounds foul, but every bank exec could go downtown\nLock \u2018em up in Attica and feed children in Africa\nYou might also like[Hook: Gabrielle Billie and (Avatar the Articulate (AKA Avie Fresh))] (x3)\nIf I ruled the world\n(Imagine that)\nI\u2019d free all my sons\nI love \u2018em, love \u2018em, baby\nBlack diamonds and pearls\n(Could it be?

"EMOTIONAL LyricsThere\u2019s not enough drugs in the world to wipe my frickin\u2019 past away\nBut it feels like it was just yesterday\nWhen I found out my mom passed away\nSo much I still have to say\nBut I passed up on my only shot\nShould have showed you that \u2018I love you\u2019\nBut I was too busy smoking pot\nToo busy starting fights, and arguments and breaking rules\nHanging out with the wrong group of people, because I thought it made me cool\nBut now I know I was a fool\nSorry for being such a jerk\nAnd now you\u2019re dead and I can\u2019t take any of it back and it makes it so much worse\nAnd I just want to be able wake up in the morning and pretend it doesn\u2019t hurt\nOn the day you died, I wondered why the hell you had to go to work\nBecause if you didn\u2019t, you would still be alive\nI\u2019d be able to sleep at night\nWhy the hell would God take you from this planet and leave me behind\nYou love me? Vince, Monica, Stacey and my damn brother\nIt bothers me knowing my children are never gonna meet their grandmother\nI just want to cry\nActually I want to die\nCause the day you passed away I bottled it all up inside\nA couple days ago was Mothers Day\nBut you weren\u2019t here to celebrate\nThey say that when you die, you always make it to a better place\nThat may be true, but without you I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll make it through\nYou always said you loved me\nBut I never said the same to you\n[You+Me \u2013 Break The Cycle]\nCircles and cycles and seasons\nFor everything there\u2019s always reason\nBut it\u2019s never good\nNever turns out as it should\n\nAnd now I lay awake and reminisce everything that you did for me\nIf God is real, then how can any of this crap be meant to be?\nI love you so much, now I\u2019ll never gonna be able to tell you that\nJust to see your face again, I\u2019ll go through frickin\u2019 hell and back\nBut I know you never coming back\nI wish I had my mother back\nYou\u2019re the only reason that I\u2019m breathing, only reason that I want to rap\nEverybody want to be able to hold me back and try to keep me on the ground\nThey say that God is real, and I keep looking but he\u2019s not around\nAin\u2019t nobody ever gonna be able to save me, I can\u2019t save my frickin\u2019 myself\nNeed some major help\nCuz I don\u2019t want to burn inside the flames of hell\nEverything you do in life, is gotta be for something right\nThink I need to go to bed and deal with the pain another night\nI don\u2019t even want to write\nBut I gotta be able to cope with the pain\nSo I say to hell with a broken heart, I got a broken brain\nI just want to walk away\nBut I still got a lot to say\nBut I feel like I\u2019m better off dead, or put in jail and locked away\nYou might also like[You+Me \u2013 Break The Cycle]\nCircles and cycles and seasons\nFor everything there\u2019s always reason\nBut it\u2019s never good\nNever turns out as

description of his attitude;\u2014otherwise he will naturally stand represented, by your imagination, in an uneasy posture,\u2014stiff,\u2014perpendicular,\u2014dividing the weight of his body equally upon both legs;\u2014his eye fixed, as if on duty;\u2014his look determined,\u2014clenching the sermon in his left hand, like his firelock.\u2014In a word, you would be apt to paint Trim, as if he was standing in his platoon ready for action,\u2014His attitude was as unlike all this as you can conceive.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stood before them with his body swayed, and bent forwards just so far, as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the plain of the horizon;\u2014which sound orators, to whom I address this, know very well to be the true persuasive angle of incidence;\u2014in any other angle you may talk and preach;\u2014'tis certain;\u2014and it is done every day;\u2014but with what effect,\u2014I leave the world to judge!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to a mathematical exactness,\u2014does it not shew us, by the way, how the arts and sciences mutually befriend each other?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How the duce Corporal Trim, who knew not so much as an acute angle from an obtuse one, came to hit it so exactly;\u2014or whether it was chance or nature, or good sense or imitation, &c. shall be commented upon in that part of the cyclopaedia of arts and sciences, where the instrumental parts of the eloquence of the senate, the pulpit, and the bar, the coffee-house, the bed-chamber, and fire-side, fall under consideration.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stood,\u2014for I repeat it, to take the picture of him in at one view, with his body swayed, and somewhat bent forwards,\u2014his right leg from under him, sustaining seven-eighths of his whole weight,\u2014the foot of his left leg, the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude, advanced a little,\u2014not laterally, nor forwards, but in a line betwixt them;\u2014his knee bent, but that not violently,\u2014but so as to fall within the limits of the line of beauty;\u2014and I add, of the line of science too;\u2014for consider, it had one eighth part of his body to bear up;\u2014so that in this case the position of the leg is determined,\u2014because the foot could be no farther advanced, or the knee more bent, than what would allow him, mechanically to receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it, and to carry it too.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>This I recommend to painters;\u2014need I add,\u2014to orators!\u2014I think not; for unless they

left hand, raised something above his stomach, and detached a little from his breast;\u2014his right arm falling negligently by his side, as nature and the laws of gravity ordered it,\u2014but with the palm of it open and turned towards his audience, ready to aid the sentiment in case it stood in need.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corporal Trim's eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony with the other parts of him;\u2014he looked frank,\u2014unconstrained,\u2014 something assured,\u2014but not bordering upon assurance.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let not the critic ask how Corporal Trim could come by all this.\u2014I've told him it should be explained;\u2014but so he stood before my father, my uncle Toby, and Dr. Slop,\u2014so swayed his body, so contrasted his limbs, and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure,\u2014a statuary might have modelled from it;\u2014nay, I doubt whether the oldest Fellow of a College,\u2014or the Hebrew Professor himself, could have much mended it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trim made a bow, and read as follows:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sermon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hebrews xiii.

read it with such a sneering tone, as if the Parson was going to abuse the Apostle.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He is, an' please your Honour, replied Trim.

But from whence, replied my father, have you concluded so soon, Dr. Slop, that the writer is of our church?\u2014for aught I can see yet,\u2014he may be of any church.\u2014Because, answered Dr. Slop, if he was of ours,\u2014he durst no more take such a licence,\u2014than a bear by his beard:\u2014If, in our communion, Sir, a man was to insult an apostle,\u2014a saint,\u2014or even the paring of a saint's nail,\u2014he would have his eyes scratched out.\u2014What, by the saint? quoth my uncle Toby. No, replied Dr. Slop, he would have an old house over his head. Pray is the Inquisition an ancient building, answered my uncle Toby, or is it a modern one?\u2014I know nothing of architecture, replied Dr. Slop.\u2014An' please your Honours, quoth Trim, the Inquisition is the vilest\u2014Prithee spare thy description, Trim, I hate the very name of it, said my father.\u2014No matter for that, answered Dr. Slop,\u2014it has its uses; for tho' I'm no great advocate for it, yet, in such a case as this, he would soon be taught better manners; and I can tell him, if he went on at that rate, would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains. God help him then, quoth my uncle Toby. Amen, added Trim; for Heaven above knows, I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it.\u2014I never heard one word of it before, said my uncle Toby, hastily:\u2014How came he there, Trim?\u2014O, Sir, the story will make your heart bleed,\u2014as it has made mine a thousand times;\u2014but it is too long to be told now;\u2014your Honour shall hear it from first to last some day when I am working beside you in our fortifications;\u2014but the short of the story is this;\u2014That my brother Tom went over a servant to Lisbon,\u2014and then married a Jew's widow, who kept a small shop, and sold sausages, which somehow or other, was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed, where he was lying with his wife and two small children, and carried directly to the Inquisition, where, God help him, continued Trim, fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heart,\u2014the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour; he was as honest a soul, added Trim, (pulling out his handkerchief) as ever blood warmed.\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014The tears trickled down Trim's cheeks faster than he could well wipe them away.\u2014A dead silence in the room ensued for some minutes.\u2014Certain proof of pity!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Come Trim, quoth my father, after he saw the poor fellow's grief had got a little vent,\u2014read on,\u2014and put this melancholy story out of thy head:\u2014I grieve that I interrupted thee; but prithee begin the sermon again;\u2014for if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse, as thou sayest, I have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the apostle has given.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corporal Trim wiped his face, and returned his handkerchief into his pocket, and, making a bow as he did it,\u2014he began again.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sermon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hebrews xiii. 18.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014For we trust we have a good Conscience.\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Trust! trust we have a good conscience!

Conscience had something else to do all this time, than break in upon him; as Elijah reproached the god Baal,\u2014this domestic god was either talking, or pursuing, or was in a journey, or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Perhaps He was gone out in company with Honour to fight a duel: to pay off some debt at play;\u2014or dirty annuity, the bargain of his lust; Perhaps Conscience all this time was engaged at home, talking aloud against petty larceny, and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured him against all temptation of committing; so that he lives as merrily;'\u2014(If he was of our church, tho', quoth Dr. Slop, he could not)\u2014'sleeps as soundly in his bed;\u2014and at last meets death unconcernedly;\u2014perhaps much more so, than a much better man.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(All this is impossible with us, quoth Dr. Slop, turning to my father,\u2014the case could not happen in our church.\u2014It happens in ours, however, replied my father, but too often.\u2014I own, quoth Dr. Slop, (struck a little with my father's frank acknowledgment)\u2014that a man in the Romish church may live as badly;\u2014but then he cannot easily die so.\u2014'Tis little matter, replied my father, with an air of indifference,\u2014how a rascal dies.\u2014I mean, answered Dr. Slop, he would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments.\u2014Pray how many have you in all, said my uncle Toby,\u2014for I always forget?\u2014Seven, answered Dr. Slop.\u2014Humph!\u2014said my uncle Toby; tho' not accented as a note of acquiescence,\u2014but as an interjection of that particular species of surprize, when a man in looking into a drawer, finds more of a thing than he expected.\u2014Humph! replied my uncle Toby. Dr. Slop, who had an ear, understood my uncle Toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the seven sacraments.\u2014Humph! replied Dr. Slop, (stating my uncle Toby's argument over again to him)\u2014Why, Sir, are there not seven cardinal virtues?\u2014Seven mortal sins?\u2014Seven golden candlesticks?\u2014Seven heavens?\u2014'Tis more than I know, replied my uncle Toby.\u2014Are there not seven wonders of the world?\u2014Seven days of the creation?\u2014Seven planets?\u2014Seven plagues?\u2014That there are, quoth my father with a most affected gravity.

A whole year had almost passed from first commission of that crime, to the time Nathan was sent to reprove him; and we read not once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified, during all that time, for what he had done.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Thus conscience, this once able monitor,\u2014placed on high as a judge within us, and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one too,\u2014by an unhappy train of causes and impediments, takes often such imperfect cognizance of what passes,\u2014does its office so negligently,\u2014sometimes so corruptly,\u2014that it is not to be trusted alone; and therefore we find there is a necessity, an absolute necessity, of joining another principle with it, to aid, if not govern, its determinations.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be misled in,\u2014namely, in what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man, an useful citizen, a faithful subject to your king, or a good servant to your God,\u2014call in religion and morality.\u2014Look, What is written in the law of God?\u2014How readest thou?\u2014Consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truth;\u2014what say they?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Let Conscience determine the matter upon these reports;\u2014and then if thy heart condemns thee not, which is the case the apostle supposes,\u2014the rule will be infallible;'\u2014(Here Dr. Slop fell asleep)\u2014'thou wilt have confidence towards God;\u2014that is, have just grounds to believe the judgment thou hast past upon thyself, is the judgment of God; and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that Being, to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Blessed is the man, indeed, then, as the author of the book of Ecclesiasticus expresses it, who is not pricked with the multitude of his sins: Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemned him; whether he be rich, or whether he be poor, if he have a good heart (a heart thus guided and informed) he shall at all times rejoice in a chearful countenance; his mind shall tell him more than seven watch-men that sit above upon a tower on high.'\u2014(A tower has no strength, quoth my uncle Toby, unless 'tis flank'd.)\u2014'in the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand casuists, and give the state he lives in, a better security for his behaviour than all the causes and restrictions put together, which law-makers are forced to multiply:\u2014Forced, I say, as things stand; human laws not being a matter of original choice, but of pure necessity, brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law unto themselves; well intending, by the many provisions made,\u2014that in all such corrupt and misguided cases, where principles and the checks of conscience will not make us upright,\u2014to supply their force, and, by the terrors of gaols and halters, oblige us to it.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(I see plainly, said my father, that this sermon has been composed to be preached at the Temple,\u2014or at some Assize.\u2014I like the reasoning,\u2014and am sorry that Dr. Slop has fallen asleep before the time of his conviction:\u2014for it is now clear, that the Parson, as I thought at first, never insulted St. Paul in the least;\u2014nor has there been, brother, the least difference between them.\u2014A great matter, if they had differed, replied my uncle Toby,\u2014the best friends in the world may differ sometimes.\u2014True,\u2014brother Toby quoth my father, shaking hands with him,\u2014we'll fill our pipes, brother, and then Trim shall go on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well,\u2014what dost thou think of it?

He read on as follows:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'To have the fear of God before our eyes, and, in our mutual dealings with each other, to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrong:\u2014The first of these will comprehend the duties of religion;\u2014the second, those of morality, which are so inseparably connected together, that you cannot divide these two tables, even in imagination, (tho' the attempt is often made in practice) without breaking and mutually destroying them both.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I said the attempt is often made; and so it is;\u2014there being nothing more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion, and indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none, who would take it as the bitterest affront, should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral character,\u2014or imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'When there is some appearance that it is so,\u2014tho' one is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty, yet were we to look into the grounds of it, in the present case, I am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of his motive.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject, it will be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest, his pride, his ease, or some such little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great distress.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I will illustrate this by an example.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I know the banker I deal with, or the physician I usually call in,'\u2014(There is no need, cried Dr. Slop, (waking) to call in any physician in this case)\u2014'to be neither of them men of much religion: I hear them make a jest of it every day, and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn, as to put the matter past doubt. Well;\u2014notwithstanding this, I put my fortune into the hands of the one:\u2014and what is dearer still to me, I trust my life to the honest skill of the other.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence. Why, in the first place, I believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power I put into their hands to my disadvantage;\u2014I consider that honesty serves the purposes of this life:\u2014I know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their characters.\u2014In a word, I'm persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'But put it otherwise, namely, that interest lay, for once, on the other side; that a case should happen, wherein the one, without stain to his reputation, could secrete my fortune, and leave me naked in the world;\u2014or that the other could send me out of it, and enjoy an estate by my death, without dishonour to himself or his art:\u2014In this case, what hold have I of either of them?\u2014Religion, the strongest of all motives, is out of the question;\u2014Interest, the next most powerful motive in the world, is strongly against me:\u2014What have I left to cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptation?\u2014Alas! I have nothing,\u2014nothing but what is lighter than a bubble\u2014I must lie at the mercy of Honour, or some such capricious principle\u2014Strait security for two of the most valuable blessings!\u2014my property and myself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'As, therefore, we can have no dependence upon morality without religion;\u2014so, on the other hand, there is nothing better to be expected from religion without morality; nevertheless, 'tis no prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low, who yet entertains the highest notion of himself in the light of a religious man.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'He shall not only be covetous, revengeful, implacable,\u2014but even wanting in points of common honesty; yet inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the age,\u2014is zealous for some points of religion,\u2014goes twice a day to church,\u2014attends the sacraments,\u2014and amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religion,\u2014shall cheat his conscience into a judgment, that, for this, he is a religious man, and has discharged truly his duty to God: And you will find that such a man, through force of this delusion, generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affectation of piety,\u2014though, perhaps, ten times more real honesty than himself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'This likewise is a sore evil under the sun; and I believe, there is no one mistaken principle, which, for its time, has wrought more serious mischiefs.\u2014For a general proof of this,\u2014examine the history of the Romish church;'\u2014(Well what can you make of that? cried Dr. Slop)\u2014'see what scenes of cruelty, murder, rapine, bloodshed,'\u2014(They may thank their own obstinacy, cried Dr. Slop)\u2014have all been sanctified by a religion not strictly governed by morality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'In how many kingdoms of the world'\u2014(Here Trim kept waving his right-hand from the sermon to the extent of his arm, returning it backwards and forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this misguided saint-errant, spared neither age or merit, or sex, or condition?\u2014and, as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity, he shewed none; mercilessly trampled upon both,\u2014heard neither the cries of the unfortunate, nor pitied their distresses.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(I have been in many a battle, an' please your Honour, quoth Trim, sighing, but never in so melancholy a one as this,\u2014I would not have drawn a tricker in it against these poor souls,\u2014to have been made a general officer.\u2014Why? what do you understand of the affair? said Dr. Slop, looking towards Trim, with something more of contempt than the Corporal's honest heart deserved.\u2014What do you know, friend, about this battle you talk of?\u2014I know, replied Trim, that I never refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for it;\u2014but to a woman or a child, continued Trim, before I would level my musket at them, I would loose my life a thousand times.\u2014Here's a crown for thee, Trim, to drink with Obadiah to-night, quoth my uncle Toby, and I'll give Obadiah another too.\u2014God bless your Honour, replied Trim,\u2014I had rather these poor women and children had it.\u2014thou art an honest fellow, quoth my uncle Toby.\u2014My father nodded his head, as much as to say\u2014and so he is.\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But prithee, Trim, said my father, make an end,\u2014for I see thou hast but a leaf or two left.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corporal Trim read on.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'If the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficient,\u2014consider at this instant, how the votaries of that religion are every day thinking to do service and honour to God, by actions which are a dishonour and scandal to themselves.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'To be convinced of this, go with me for a moment into the prisons of the Inquisition.'\u2014(God help my poor brother Tom.)\u2014'Behold Religion, with Mercy and Justice chained down under her feet,\u2014there sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal, propped up with racks and instruments of torment.

I should have read it ten times better, Sir, answered Trim, but that my heart was so full.\u2014That was the very reason, Trim, replied my father, which has made thee read the sermon as well as thou hast done; and if the clergy of our church, continued my father, addressing himself to Dr. Slop, would take part in what they deliver as deeply as this poor fellow has done,\u2014as their compositions are fine;\u2014(I deny it, quoth Dr. Slop)\u2014I maintain it,\u2014that the eloquence of our pulpits, with such subjects to enflame it, would be a model for the whole world:\u2014But alas! continued my father, and I own it, Sir, with sorrow, that, like French politicians in this respect, what they gain in the cabinet they lose in the field.\u2014'Twere a pity, quoth my uncle, that this should be lost. I like the sermon well, replied my father,\u2014'tis dramatick,\u2014and there is something in that way of writing, when skilfully managed, which catches the attention.\u2014We preach much in that way with us, said Dr. Slop.\u2014I know that very well, said my father,\u2014but in a tone and manner which disgusted Dr. Slop, full as much as his assent, simply, could have pleased him.\u2014But in this, added Dr. Slop, a little piqued,\u2014our sermons have greatly the advantage, that we never introduce any character into them below a patriarch or a patriarch's wife, or a martyr or a saint.\u2014There are some very bad characters in this, however, said my father, and I do not think the sermon a jot the worse for 'em.\u2014But pray, quoth my uncle Toby,\u2014who's can this be?\u2014How could it get into my Stevinus? A man must be as great a conjurer as Stevinus, said my father, to resolve the second question:\u2014The first, I think, is not so difficult;\u2014for unless my judgment greatly deceives me,\u2014I know the author, for 'tis wrote, certainly, by the parson of the parish.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The similitude of the stile and manner of it, with those my father constantly had heard preached in his parish-church, was the ground of his conjecture,\u2014proving it as strongly, as an argument a priori could prove such a thing to a philosophic mind, That it was Yorick's and no one's else:\u2014It was proved to be so, a posteriori, the day after, when Yorick sent a servant to my uncle Toby's house to enquire after it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seems that Yorick, who was inquisitive after all kinds of knowledge, had borrowed Stevinus of my uncle Toby, and had carelesly popped his sermon, as soon as he had made it, into the middle of Stevinus; and by an act of forgetfulness, to which he was ever subject, he had sent Stevinus home, and his sermon to keep him company.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ill-fated sermon! Thou wast lost, after this recovery of thee, a second time, dropped thru' an unsuspected fissure in thy master's pocket, down into a treacherous and a tattered lining,\u2014trod deep into the dirt by the left hind-foot of his Rosinante inhumanly stepping upon thee as thou falledst;\u2014buried ten days in the mire,\u2014raised up out of it by a beggar,\u2014sold for a halfpenny to a parish-clerk,\u2014transferred to his parson,\u2014lost for ever to thy own, the remainder of his days,\u2014nor restored to his restless Manes till this very moment, that I tell the world the story.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can the reader believe, that this sermon of Yorick's was preached at an assize, in the cathedral of York, before a thousand witnesses, ready to give oath of it, by a certain prebendary of that church, and actually printed by him when he had done,\u2014and within so short a space as two years and three months after Yorick's death?\u2014Yorick indeed, was never better served in his life;\u2014but it was a little hard to maltreat him after, and plunder him after he was laid in his grave.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, as the gentleman who did it was in perfect charity with Yorick,\u2014and, in conscious justice, printed but a few copies to give away;\u2014and that I am told he could moreover have made as good a one himself, had he thought fit,\u2014I declare I would not have published this anecdote to the world;\u2014nor do I publish it with an intent to hurt his character and advancement in the church;\u2014I leave that to others;\u2014but I find myself impelled by two reasons, which I cannot withstand.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first is, That in doing justice, I may give rest to Yorick's ghost;\u2014which\u2014as the country-people, and some others believe,\u2014still walks.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second reason is, That, by laying open this story to the world, I gain an opportunity of informing it,\u2014That in case the character of parson Yorick, and this sample of his sermons, is liked,\u2014there are now in the possession of the Shandy family, as many as will make a handsome volume, at the world's service,\u2014and much good may they do it.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8, "api_path": "/songs/549883", "artist_names": "Spacehog", "full_title": "In the Meantime by\u00a0Spacehog",

artes.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ovid, Metamorphoses, VIII., 18.\nOnce upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...\n\nHis father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.\n\nHe was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O, the wild rose blossoms\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the little green place.\nHe sang that song. That was his song.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O, the green wothe botheth.\n\nWhen you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold. His mother put on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell.\n\nHis mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played on the piano the sailor's hornpipe for him to dance. He danced:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tralala lala,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tralala tralaladdy,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tralala lala,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tralala lala.\n\nUncle Charles and Dante clapped. They were older than his father and mother but uncle Charles was older than Dante.\n\nDante had two brushes in her press. The brush with the maroon velvet back was for Michael Davitt and the brush with the green velvet back was for Parnell. Dante gave him a cachou every time he brought her a piece of tissue paper.\n\nThe Vances lived in number seven. They had a different father and mother. They were Eileen's father and mother. When they were grown up he was going to marry Eileen. He hid under the table. His mother said:\n\n\u2014O, Stephen will apologize.\n\nDante said:\n\u2014O, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pull out his eyes,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apologize,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apologize,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pull out his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apologize,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pull out his eyes,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pull out his eyes,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apologize.\n\n\nThe wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey light. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak and watery. Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the third line all the fellows said.\n\nRody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche was a stink. Rody Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper in the refectory. Nasty Roche had big hands. He called the Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. And one day he had asked:\n\n\u2014What is your name?\n\nStephen had answered: Stephen Dedalus.\n\nThen Nasty Roche had said:\n\n\u2014What kind of a name is that?\n\nAnd when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty Roche had asked:\n\u2014What is your father?\n\nStephen had answered:\n\n\u2014A gentleman.\n\nThen Nasty Roche had asked:\n\n\u2014Is he a magistrate?\n\nHe crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish with cold. He kept his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit. That was a belt round his pocket. And belt was also to give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow said to Cantwell:\n\n\u2014I'd give you such a belt in a second.\n\nCantwell had answered:\n\n\u2014Go and fight your match. Give Cecil Thunder a belt. I'd like to see you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself.\n\nThat was not a nice expression. His mother had told him not to speak with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! The first day in the hall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him: and her nose and eyes were red. But he had pretended not to see that she was going to cry. She was a nice mother but she was not so nice when she cried. And his father had given him two five-shilling pieces for pocket money. And his father had told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother, his soutane fluttering in the breeze, and the car had driven off with his father and mother on it. They had cried to him from the car, waving their hands:\n\n\u2014Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye!\n\n\u2014Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye!\n\nHe was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of the flashing eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through the legs. The fellows were struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then Jack Lawton's yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going home for the holidays. After supper in the study hall he would change the number pasted up inside his desk from seventy-seven to seventy-six.\n\nIt would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle. He wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the ha-ha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows. One day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wolsey died in Leicester Abbey\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the abbots buried him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Canker is a disease of plants,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cancer one of animals.\n\nIt would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That was mean of Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuff box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell! Dante knew a lot of things. She had taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a well-read woman. And when Dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.\n\nA voice cried far out on the playground:\n\n\u2014All in!\n\nThen other voices cried from the lower and third lines:\n\n\u2014All in! All in!\n\nThe players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went among them, glad to go in. Rody Kickham held the ball by its greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he walked on without even answering the fellow. Simon Moonan told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow turned to Simon Moonan and said:\n\n\u2014We all know why you speak. You are McGlade's suck.\n\nSuck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only louder.\n\nTo remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing.\n\nAnd the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it.\n\nIt was the hour for sums. Father Arnall wrote a hard sum on the board and then said:\n\n\u2014Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, Lancaster!\n\nStephen tried his best, but the sum was too hard and he felt confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was no good at sums, but he tried his best so that York might not lose. Father Arnall's face looked very black, but he was not in a wax: he was laughing. Then Jack Lawton cracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said:\n\n\u2014Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on now, York! Forge ahead!\n\nJack Lawton looked over from his side. The little silk badge with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue sailor top on. Stephen felt his own face red too, thinking of all the bets about who would get first place in elements, Jack Lawton or he. Some weeks Jack Lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard Father Arnall's voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.\n\nThe bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white things were cold and damp. Nasty Roche and Saurin drank cocoa that their people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fellows said.\n\nAll the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fathers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed to be at home and lay his head on his mother's lap. But he could not: and so he longed for the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed.\n\nHe drank another cup of hot tea and Fleming said:\n\n\u2014What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you?\n\n\u2014I don't know, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014Sick in your breadbasket, Fleming said, because your face looks white. It will go away.\n\n\u2014O yes, Stephen said.\n\nBut he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his heart if you could be sick in that place. Fleming was very decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a tunnel. That night at Dalkey the train had roared like that and then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping; roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.\n\nThen the higher line fellows began to come down along the matting in the middle of the refectory, Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every single fellow had a different way of walking.\n\nHe sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a game of dominoes and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door with some boys and Simon Moonan was knotting his false sleeves. He was telling them something about Tullabeg.\n\nThen he went away from the door and Wells came over to Stephen and said:\n\n\u2014Tell us, Dedalus, do you kiss your mother before you go to bed?\n\nStephen answered:\n\n\u2014I do.\n\nWells turned to the other fellows and said:\n\n\u2014O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every night before he goes to bed.\n\nThe other fellows stopped their game and turned round, laughing. Stephen blushed under their eyes and said:\n\n\u2014I do not.\n\nWells said:\n\n\u2014O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother before he goes to bed.\n\nThey all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to the question? He had given two and still Wells laughed. But Wells must know the right answer for he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of Wells's mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wells's face. He did not like Wells's face. It was Wells who had shouldered him into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his little snuff box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was. And how cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.\n\nThe cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say good night and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?\n\nSitting in the study hall he opened the lid of his desk and changed the number pasted up inside from seventy-seven to seventy-six. But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but one time it would come because the earth moved round always.\n\nThere was a picture of the earth on the first page of his geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. Fleming had a box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two brushes in Dante's press, the brush with the green velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet back for Michael Davitt. But he had not told Fleming to colour them those colours. Fleming had done it himself.\n\nHe opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could not learn the names of places in America. Still they were all different places that had different names. They were all in different countries and the countries were in continents and the continents were in the world and the world was in the universe.\n\nHe turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he had written there: himself, his name and where he was.\n\nStephen Dedalus\nClass of Elements\nClongowes Wood College\nSallins\nCounty Kildare\nIreland\nEurope\nThe World\nThe Universe\n\nThat was in his writing: and Fleming one night for a cod had written on the opposite page:\n\nStephen Dedalus is my name,\nIreland is my nation.\nClongowes is my dwellingplace\nAnd heaven my expectation.\n\nHe read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry. Then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came to his own name. That was he: and he read down the page again. What was after the universe?\n\nNothing. But was there anything round the universe to show where it stopped before the nothing place began?\n\nIt could not be a wall; but there could be a thin thin line there all round everything. It was very big to think about everything and everywhere. Only God could do that. He tried to think what a big thought that must be; but he could only think of God. God was God's name just as his name was Stephen. Dieu was the French for God and that was God's name too; and when anyone prayed to God and said Dieu then God knew at once that it was a French person that was praying. But, though there were different names for God in all the different languages in the world and God understood what all the people who prayed said in their different languages, still God remained always the same God and God's real name was God.\n\nIt made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds. He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the maroon, because Dante had ripped the green velvet back off the brush that was for Parnell one day with her scissors and had told him that Parnell was a bad man. He wondered if they were arguing at home about that. That was called politics. There were two sides in it: Dante was on one side and his father and Mr Casey were on the other side but his mother and uncle Charles were on no side. Every day there was something in the paper about it.\n\nIt pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.\n\nThe bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the study hall after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping. There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and night: but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under the seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the hob to make punch.\n\nThe prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his memory knew the responses:\n\nO Lord open our lips\nAnd our mouths shall announce Thy praise.\nIncline unto our aid, O God!\nO Lord make haste to help us!\n\nThere was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peasants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the half-door of a cottage with a child in her arms as the cars had come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, air and rain and turf and corduroy. But O, the road there between the trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It made him afraid to think of how it was.\n\nHe heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last prayers. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the trees.\n\nVisit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace and may Thy blessing be always upon us through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.\n\nHis fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory. He told his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the gas was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died. He rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers quickly, fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his shoulders shaking as he murmured:\n\nGod bless my father and my mother and spare them to me!\nGod bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me!\nGod bless Dante and uncle Charles and spare them to me!\n\nHe blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop. A voice bade the boys in the dormitory good night. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The light was lowered quietly.\n\nThe prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase and along the corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the dark. Was it true about the black dog that walked there at night with eyes as big as carriage-lamps? They said it was the ghost of a murderer. A long shiver of fear flowed over his body. He saw the dark entrance hall of the castle. Old servants in old dress were in the ironing-room above the staircase. It was long ago. The old servants were quiet. There was a fire there, but the hall was still dark. A figure came up the staircase from the hall. He wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale and strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw their master's face and cloak and knew that he had received his death-wound. But only the dark was where they looked: only dark silent air. Their master had received his death-wound on the battlefield of Prague far away over the sea. He was standing on the field; his hand was pressed to his side; his face was pale and strange and he wore the white cloak of a marshal.\n\nO how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark was cold and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great eyes like carriage-lamps. They were the ghosts of murderers, the figures of marshals who had received their death-wound on battlefields far away over the sea. What did they wish to say that their faces were so strange?\n\nVisit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive away from it all...\n\n\nGoing home for the holidays! That would be lovely: the fellows had told him. Getting up on the cars in the early wintry morning outside the door of the castle. The cars were rolling on the gravel. Cheers for the rector!\n\nHurray! Hurray! Hurray!\n\nThe cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised. They drove merrily along the country roads. The drivers pointed with their whips to Bodenstown. The fellows cheered. They passed the farmhouse of the Jolly Farmer. Cheer after cheer after cheer. Through Clane they drove, cheering and cheered. The peasant women stood at the half-doors, the men stood here and there. The lovely smell there was in the wintry air: the smell of Clane: rain and wintry air and turf smouldering and corduroy.\n\nThe train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train with cream facings. The guards went to and fro opening, closing, locking, unlocking the doors. They were men in dark blue and silver; they had silvery whistles and their keys made a quick music: click, click: click, click.\n\nAnd the train raced on over the flat lands and past the Hill of Allen. The telegraph poles were passing, passing. The train went on and on. It knew. There were lanterns in the hall of his father's house and ropes of green branches. There were holly and ivy round the pierglass and holly and ivy, green and red, twined round the chandeliers. There were red holly and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls. Holly and ivy for him and for Christmas.\n\nLovely...\n\nAll the people. Welcome home, Stephen! Noises of welcome. His mother kissed him. Was that right? His father was a marshal now: higher than a magistrate. Welcome home, Stephen!\n\nNoises...\n\nThere was a noise of curtain-rings running back along the rods, of water being splashed in the basins. There was a noise of rising and dressing and washing in the dormitory: a noise of clapping of hands as the prefect went up and down telling the fellows to look sharp. A pale sunlight showed the yellow curtains drawn back, the tossed beds. His bed was very hot and his face and body were very hot.\n\nHe got up and sat on the side of his bed. He was weak. He tried to pull on his stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The sunlight was queer and cold.\n\nFleming said:\n\n\u2014Are you not well?\n\nHe did not know; and Fleming said:\n\n\u2014Get back into bed. I'll tell McGlade you're not well.\n\n\u2014He's sick.\n\n\u2014Who is?\n\n\u2014Tell McGlade.\n\n\u2014Get back into bed.\n\n\u2014Is he sick?\n\nA fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking clinging to his foot and climbed back into the hot bed.\n\nHe crouched down between the sheets, glad of their tepid glow. He heard the fellows talk among themselves about him as they dressed for mass. It was a mean thing to do, to shoulder him into the square ditch, they were saying.\n\nThen their voices ceased; they had gone. A voice at his bed said:\n\n\u2014Dedalus, don't spy on us, sure you won't?\n\nWells's face was there. He looked at it and saw that Wells was afraid.\n\n\u2014I didn't mean to. Sure you won't?\n\nHis father had told him, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. He shook his head and answered no and felt glad.\n\nWells said:\n\n\u2014I didn't mean to, honour bright. It was only for cod. I'm sorry.\n\nThe face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was afraid. Afraid that it was some disease. Canker was a disease of plants and cancer one of animals: or another different. That was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening light, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line, a heavy bird flying low through the grey light. Leicester Abbey lit up. Wolsey died there. The abbots buried him themselves.\n\nIt was not Wells's face, it was the prefect's. He was not foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead warm and damp against the prefect's cold damp hand. That was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and cold. Every rat had two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet tucked up to jump, black slimy eyes to look out of. They could understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.\n\nThe prefect was there again and it was his voice that was saying that he was to get up, that Father Minister had said he was to get up and dress and go to the infirmary. And while he was dressing himself as quickly as he could the prefect said:\n\n\u2014We must pack off to Brother Michael because we have the collywobbles!\n\nHe was very decent to say that. That was all to make him laugh. But he could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were all shivery: and then the prefect had to laugh by himself.\n\nThe prefect cried:\n\n\u2014Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot!\n\nThey went together down the staircase and along the corridor and past the bath. As he passed the door he remembered with a vague fear the warm turf-coloured bogwater, the warm moist air, the noise of plunges, the smell of the towels, like medicine.\n\nBrother Michael was standing at the door of the infirmary and from the door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell like medicine. That came from the bottles on the shelves. The prefect spoke to Brother Michael and Brother Michael answered and called the prefect sir. He had reddish hair mixed with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he would always be a brother. It was queer too that you could not call him sir because he was a brother and had a different kind of look. Was he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?\n\nThere were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a fellow: and when they went in he called out:\n\n\u2014Hello! It's young Dedalus! What's up?\n\n\u2014The sky is up, Brother Michael said.\n\nHe was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while Stephen was undressing, he asked Brother Michael to bring him a round of buttered toast.\n\n\u2014Ah, do! he said.\n\n\u2014Butter you up! said Brother Michael. You'll get your walking papers in the morning when the doctor comes.\n\n\u2014Will I? the fellow said. I'm not well yet.\n\nBrother Michael repeated:\n\n\u2014You'll get your walking papers. I tell you.\n\nHe bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the long back of a tramhorse. He shook the poker gravely and nodded his head at the fellow out of third of grammar.\n\nThen Brother Michael went away and after a while the fellow out of third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell asleep.\n\nThat was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written home to tell his mother and father? But it would be quicker for one of the priests to go himself to tell them. Or he would write a letter for the priest to bring.\n\nDear Mother,\n\nI am sick. I want to go home. Please come and take me home.\nI am in the infirmary.\n\nYour fond son,\nStephen\n\nHow far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces. Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. And Wells would be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll slowly.\n\nHe could hear the tolling. He said over to himself the song that Brigid had taught him.\n\nDingdong! The castle bell!\nFarewell, my mother!\nBury me in the old churchyard\nBeside my eldest brother.\nMy coffin shall be black,\nSix angels at my back,\nTwo to sing and two to pray\nAnd two to carry my soul away.\n\nHow beautiful and sad that was! How beautiful the words were where they said Bury me in the old churchyard! A tremor passed over his body. How sad and how beautiful! He wanted to cry quietly but not for himself: for the words, so beautiful and sad, like music. The bell! The bell! Farewell! O farewell!\n\nThe cold sunlight was weaker and Brother Michael was standing at his bedside with a bowl of beef-tea. He was glad for his mouth was hot and dry. He could hear them playing in the playgrounds. And the day was going on in the college just as if he were there.\n\nThen Brother Michael was going away and the fellow out of the third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell him all the news in the paper. He told Stephen that his name was Athy and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a good tip to Brother Michael any time he wanted it because Brother Michael was very decent and always told him the news out of the paper they got every day up in the castle. There was every kind of news in the paper: accidents, shipwrecks, sports, and politics.\n\n\u2014Now it is all about politics in the papers, he said. Do your people talk about that too?\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014Mine too, he said.\n\nThen he thought for a moment and said:\n\n\u2014You have a queer name, Dedalus, and I have a queer name too, Athy. My name is the name of a town. Your name is like Latin.\n\nThen he asked:\n\n\u2014Are you good at riddles?\n\nStephen answered:\n\n\u2014Not very good.\n\nThen he said:\n\n\u2014Can you answer me this one? Why is the county of Kildare like the leg of a fellow's breeches?\n\nStephen thought what could be the answer and then said:\n\n\u2014I give it up.\n\n\u2014Because there is a thigh in it, he said. Do you see the joke? Athy is the town in the county Kildare and a thigh is the other thigh.\n\n\u2014Oh, I see, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014That's an old riddle, he said.\n\nAfter a moment he said:\n\n\u2014I say!\n\n\u2014What? asked Stephen.\n\n\u2014You know, he said, you can ask that riddle another way.\n\n\u2014Can you? said Stephen.\n\n\u2014The same riddle, he said. Do you know the other way to ask it?\n\n\u2014No, said Stephen.\n\n\u2014Can you not think of the other way? he said.\n\nHe looked at Stephen over the bedclothes as he spoke. Then he lay back on the pillow and said:\n\n\u2014There is another way but I won't tell you what it is.\n\nWhy did he not tell it? His father, who kept the racehorses, must be a magistrate too like Saurin's father and Nasty Roche's father. He thought of his own father, of how he sang songs while his mother played and of how he always gave him a shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him that he was not a magistrate like the other boys' fathers. Then why was he sent to that place with them? But his father had told him that he would be no stranger there because his granduncle had presented an address to the liberator there fifty years before. You could know the people of that time by their old dress. It seemed to him a solemn time: and he wondered if that was the time when the fellows in Clongowes wore blue coats with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of rabbitskin and drank beer like grown-up people and kept greyhounds of their own to course the hares with.\n\nHe looked at the window and saw that the daylight had grown weaker. There would be cloudy grey light over the playgrounds. There was no noise on the playgrounds. The class must be doing the themes or perhaps Father Arnall was reading out of the book.\n\nIt was queer that they had not given him any medicine. Perhaps Brother Michael would bring it back when he came. They said you got stinking stuff to drink when you were in the infirmary. But he felt better now than before. It would be nice getting better slowly. You could get a book then. There was a book in the library about Holland. There were lovely foreign names in it and pictures of strange looking cities and ships. It made you feel so happy.\n\nHow pale the light was at the window! But that was nice. The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was the noise of the waves. Or the waves were talking among themselves as they rose and fell.\n\nHe saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and falling, dark under the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude of people gathered by the waters' edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour. A tall man stood on the deck, looking out towards the flat dark land: and by the light at the pierhead he saw his face, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael.\n\nHe saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him say in a loud voice of sorrow over the waters:\n\n\u2014He is dead. We saw him lying upon the catafalque. A wail of sorrow went up from the people.\n\n\u2014Parnell! Parnell! He is dead!\n\nThey fell upon their knees, moaning in sorrow.\n\nAnd he saw Dante in a maroon velvet dress and with a green velvet mantle hanging from her shoulders walking proudly and silently past the people who knelt by the water's edge.\n\n\nA great fire, banked high and red, flamed in the grate and under the ivy-twined branches of the chandelier the Christmas table was spread. They had come home a little late and still dinner was not ready: but it would be ready in a jiffy his mother had said. They were waiting for the door to open and for the servants to come in, holding the big dishes covered with their heavy metal covers.\n\nAll were waiting: uncle Charles, who sat far away in the shadow of the window, Dante and Mr Casey, who sat in the easy-chairs at either side of the hearth, Stephen, seated on a chair between them, his feet resting on the toasted boss. Mr Dedalus looked at himself in the pierglass above the mantelpiece, waxed out his moustache ends and then, parting his coat-tails, stood with his back to the glowing fire: and still from time to time he withdrew a hand from his coat-tail to wax out one of his moustache ends. Mr Casey leaned his head to one side and, smiling, tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers. And Stephen smiled too for he knew now that it was not true that Mr Casey had a purse of silver in his throat. He smiled to think how the silvery noise which Mr Casey used to make had deceived him. And when he had tried to open Mr Casey's hand to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seen that the fingers could not be straightened out: and Mr Casey had told him that he had got those three cramped fingers making a birthday present for Queen Victoria. Mr Casey tapped the gland of his neck and smiled at Stephen with sleepy eyes: and Mr Dedalus said to him:\n\n\u2014Yes. Well now, that's all right. O, we had a good walk, hadn't we, John? Yes... I wonder if there's any likelihood of dinner this evening. Yes... O, well now, we got a good breath of ozone round the Head today. Ay, bedad.\n\nHe turned to Dante and said:\n\n\u2014You didn't stir out at all, Mrs Riordan?\n\nDante frowned and said shortly:\n\n\u2014No.\n\nMr Dedalus dropped his coat-tails and went over to the sideboard. He brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from the locker and filled the decanter slowly, bending now and then to see how much he had poured in. Then replacing the jar in the locker he poured a little of the whisky into two glasses, added a little water and came back with them to the fireplace.\n\n\u2014A thimbleful, John, he said, just to whet your appetite.\n\nMr Casey took the glass, drank, and placed it near him on the mantelpiece. Then he said:\n\n\u2014Well, I can't help thinking of our friend Christopher manufacturing...\n\nHe broke into a fit of laughter and coughing and added:\n\n\u2014...manufacturing that champagne for those fellows.\n\nMr Dedalus laughed loudly.\n\n\u2014Is it Christy? he said. There's more cunning in one of those warts on his bald head than in a pack of jack foxes.\n\nHe inclined his head, closed his eyes, and, licking his lips profusely, began to speak with the voice of the hotel keeper.\n\n\u2014And he has such a soft mouth when he's speaking to you, don't you know. He's very moist and watery about the dewlaps, God bless him.\n\nMr Casey was still struggling through his fit of coughing and laughter. Stephen, seeing and hearing the hotel keeper through his father's face and voice, laughed.\n\nMr Dedalus put up his eyeglass and, staring down at him, said quietly and kindly:\n\n\u2014What are you laughing at, you little puppy, you?\n\nThe servants entered and placed the dishes on the table. Mrs Dedalus followed and the places were arranged.\n\n\u2014Sit over, she said.\n\nMr Dedalus went to the end of the table and said:\n\n\u2014Now, Mrs Riordan, sit over. John, sit you down, my hearty.\n\nHe looked round to where uncle Charles sat and said:\n\n\u2014Now then, sir, there's a bird here waiting for you.\n\nWhen all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover and then said quickly, withdrawing it:\n\n\u2014Now, Stephen.\n\nStephen stood up in his place to say the grace before meals:\n\nBless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts which through Thy bounty we are about to receive through Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nAll blessed themselves and Mr Dedalus with a sigh of pleasure lifted from the dish the heavy cover pearled around the edge with glistening drops.\n\nStephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain, trussed and skewered, on the kitchen table. He knew that his father had paid a guinea for it in Dunn's of D'Olier Street and that the man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how good it was: and he remembered the man's voice when he had said:\n\n\u2014Take that one, sir. That's the real Ally Daly.\n\nWhy did Mr Barrett in Clongowes call his pandybat a turkey? But Clongowes was far away: and the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from the plates and dishes and the great fire was banked high and red in the grate and the green ivy and red holly made you feel so happy and when dinner was ended the big plum pudding would be carried in, studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of holly, with bluish fire running around it and a little green flag flying from the top.\n\nIt was his first Christmas dinner and he thought of his little brothers and sisters who were waiting in the nursery, as he had often waited, till the pudding came. The deep low collar and the Eton jacket made him feel queer and oldish: and that morning when his mother had brought him down to the parlour, dressed for mass, his father had cried. That was because he was thinking of his own father. And uncle Charles had said so too.\n\nMr Dedalus covered the dish and began to eat hungrily. Then he said:\n\n\u2014Poor old Christy, he's nearly lopsided now with roguery.\n\n\u2014Simon, said Mrs Dedalus, you haven't given Mrs Riordan any sauce.\n\nMr Dedalus seized the sauceboat.\n\n\u2014Haven't I? he cried. Mrs Riordan, pity the poor blind. Dante covered her plate with her hands and said:\n\n\u2014No, thanks.\n\nMr Dedalus turned to uncle Charles.\n\n\u2014How are you off, sir?\n\n\u2014Right as the mail, Simon.\n\n\u2014You, John?\n\n\u2014I'm all right. Go on yourself.\n\n\u2014Mary? Here, Stephen, here's something to make your hair curl.\n\nHe poured sauce freely over Stephen's plate and set the boat again on the table. Then he asked uncle Charles was it tender. Uncle Charles could not speak because his mouth was full; but he nodded that it was.\n\n\u2014That was a good answer our friend made to the canon. What? said Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014I didn't think he had that much in him, said Mr Casey.\n\n\u2014I'll pay your dues, father, when you cease turning the house of God into a pollingbooth.\n\n\u2014A nice answer, said Dante, for any man calling himself a catholic to give to his priest.\n\n\u2014They have only themselves to blame, said Mr Dedalus suavely. If they took a fool's advice they would confine their attention to religion.\n\n\u2014It is religion, Dante said. They are doing their duty in warning the people.\n\n\u2014We go to the house of God, Mr Casey said, in all humility to pray to our Maker and not to hear election addresses.\n\n\u2014It is religion, Dante said again. They are right. They must direct their flocks.\n\n\u2014And preach politics from the altar, is it? asked Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014Certainly, said Dante. It is a question of public morality. A priest would not be a priest if he did not tell his flock what is right and what is wrong.\n\nMrs Dedalus laid down her knife and fork, saying:\n\n\u2014For pity sake and for pity sake let us have no political discussion on this day of all days in the year.\n\n\u2014Quite right, ma'am, said uncle Charles. Now, Simon, that's quite enough now. Not another word now.\n\n\u2014Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus quickly.\n\nHe uncovered the dish boldly and said:\n\n\u2014Now then, who's for more turkey?\n\nNobody answered. Dante said:\n\n\u2014Nice language for any catholic to use!\n\n\u2014Mrs Riordan, I appeal to you, said Mrs Dedalus, to let the matter drop now.\n\nDante turned on her and said:\n\n\u2014And am I to sit here and listen to the pastors of my church being flouted?\n\n\u2014Nobody is saying a word against them, said Mr Dedalus, so long as they don't meddle in politics.\n\n\u2014The bishops and priests of Ireland have spoken, said Dante, and they must be obeyed.\n\n\u2014Let them leave politics alone, said Mr Casey, or the people may leave their church alone.\n\n\u2014You hear? said Dante, turning to Mrs Dedalus.\n\n\u2014Mr Casey! Simon! said Mrs Dedalus, let it end now.\n\n\u2014Too bad! Too bad! said uncle Charles.\n\n\u2014What? cried Mr Dedalus. Were we to desert him at the bidding of the English people?\n\n\u2014He was no longer worthy to lead, said Dante. He was a public sinner.\n\n\u2014We are all sinners and black sinners, said Mr Casey coldly.\n\n\u2014Woe be to the man by whom the scandal cometh! said Mrs Riordan. It would be better for him that a millstone were tied about his neck and that he were cast into the depths of the sea rather than that he should scandalise one of these, my least little ones. That is the language of the Holy Ghost.\n\n\u2014And very bad language if you ask me, said Mr Dedalus coolly.\n\n\u2014Simon! Simon! said uncle Charles. The boy.\n\n\u2014Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus. I meant about the... I was thinking about the bad language of the railway porter. Well now, that's all right. Here, Stephen, show me your plate, old chap. Eat away now. Here.\n\nHe heaped up the food on Stephen's plate and served uncle Charles and Mr Casey to large pieces of turkey and splashes of sauce. Mrs Dedalus was eating little and Dante sat with her hands in her lap. She was red in the face. Mr Dedalus rooted with the carvers at the end of the dish and said:\n\n\u2014There's a tasty bit here we call the pope's nose. If any lady or gentleman...\n\nHe held a piece of fowl up on the prong of the carving fork. Nobody spoke. He put it on his own plate, saying:\n\n\u2014Well, you can't say but you were asked. I think I had better eat it myself because I'm not well in my health lately.\n\nHe winked at Stephen and, replacing the dish-cover, began to eat again.\n\nThere was a silence while he ate. Then he said:\n\n\u2014Well now, the day kept up fine after all. There were plenty of strangers down too.\n\nNobody spoke. He said again:\n\n\u2014I think there were more strangers down than last Christmas.\n\nHe looked round at the others whose faces were bent towards their plates and, receiving no reply, waited for a moment and said bitterly:\n\n\u2014Well, my Christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow.\n\n\u2014There could be neither luck nor grace, Dante said, in a house where there is no respect for the pastors of the church.\n\nMr Dedalus threw his knife and fork noisily on his plate.\n\n\u2014Respect! he said. Is it for Billy with the lip or for the tub of guts up in Armagh? Respect!\n\n\u2014Princes of the church, said Mr Casey with slow scorn.\n\n\u2014Lord Leitrim's coachman, yes, said Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014They are the Lord's anointed, Dante said. They are an honour to their country.\n\n\u2014Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a handsome face, mind you, in repose. You should see that fellow lapping up his bacon and cabbage of a cold winter's day. O Johnny!\n\nHe twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality and made a lapping noise with his lips.\n\n\u2014Really, Simon, you should not speak that way before Stephen. It's not right.\n\n\u2014O, he'll remember all this when he grows up, said Dante hotly\u2014the language he heard against God and religion and priests in his own home.\n\n\u2014Let him remember too, cried Mr Casey to her from across the table, the language with which the priests and the priests' pawns broke Parnell's heart and hounded him into his grave. Let him remember that too when he grows up.\n\n\u2014Sons of bitches! cried Mr Dedalus. When he was down they turned on him to betray him and rend him like rats in a sewer. Low-lived dogs! And they look it! By Christ, they look it!\n\n\u2014They behaved rightly, cried Dante. They obeyed their bishops and their priests. Honour to them!\n\n\u2014Well, it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one day in the year, said Mrs Dedalus, can we be free from these dreadful disputes!\n\nUncle Charles raised his hands mildly and said:\n\n\u2014Come now, come now, come now! Can we not have our opinions whatever they are without this bad temper and this bad language? It is too bad surely.\n\nMrs Dedalus spoke to Dante in a low voice but Dante said loudly:\n\n\u2014I will not say nothing. I will defend my church and my religion when it is insulted and spit on by renegade catholics.\n\nMr Casey pushed his plate rudely into the middle of the table and, resting his elbows before him, said in a hoarse voice to his host:\n\n\u2014Tell me, did I tell you that story about a very famous spit?\n\n\u2014You did not, John, said Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014Why then, said Mr Casey, it is a most instructive story. It happened not long ago in the county Wicklow where we are now.\n\nHe broke off and, turning towards Dante, said with quiet indignation:\n\n\u2014And I may tell you, ma'am, that I, if you mean me, am no renegade catholic. I am a catholic as my father was and his father before him and his father before him again, when we gave up our lives rather than sell our faith.\n\n\u2014The more shame to you now, Dante said, to speak as you do.\n\n\u2014The story, John, said Mr Dedalus smiling. Let us have the story anyhow.\n\n\u2014Catholic indeed! repeated Dante ironically. The blackest protestant in the land would not speak the language I have heard this evening.\n\nMr Dedalus began to sway his head to and fro, crooning like a country singer.\n\n\u2014I am no protestant, I tell you again, said Mr Casey, flushing.\n\nMr Dedalus, still crooning and swaying his head, began to sing in a grunting nasal tone:\n\nO, come all you Roman catholics That never went to mass.\n\nHe took up his knife and fork again in good humour and set to eating, saying to Mr Casey:\n\n\u2014Let us have the story, John. It will help us to digest.\n\nStephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies. Perhaps that made her severe against Parnell. And she did not like him to play with Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed Virgin. Tower of Ivory, they used to say, House of Gold! How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold? Who was right then? And he remembered the evening in the infirmary in Clongowes, the dark waters, the light at the pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard.\n\nEileen had long white hands. One evening when playing tig she had put her hands over his eyes: long and white and thin and cold and soft. That was ivory: a cold white thing. That was the meaning of Tower of Ivory.\n\n\u2014The story is very short and sweet, Mr Casey said. It was one day down in Arklow, a cold bitter day, not long before the chief died. May God have mercy on him!\n\nHe closed his eyes wearily and paused. Mr Dedalus took a bone from his plate and tore some meat from it with his teeth, saying:\n\n\u2014Before he was killed, you mean.\n\nMr Casey opened his eyes, sighed and went on:\n\n\u2014It was down in Arklow one day. We were down there at a meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our way to the railway station through the crowd. Such booing and baaing, man, you never heard. They called us all the names in the world. Well there was one old lady, and a drunken old harridan she was surely, that paid all her attention to me. She kept dancing along beside me in the mud bawling and screaming into my face: Priesthunter! The Paris Funds! Mr Fox! Kitty O'Shea!\n\n\u2014And what did you do, John? asked Mr Dedalus.\n\n\u2014I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a cold day and to keep up my heart I had (saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of Tullamore in my mouth and sure I couldn't say a word in any case because my mouth was full of tobacco juice.\n\n\u2014Well, John?\n\n\u2014Well. I let her bawl away, to her heart's content, Kitty O'Shea and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name that I won't sully this Christmas board nor your ears, ma'am, nor my own lips by repeating.\n\nHe paused. Mr Dedalus, lifting his head from the bone, asked:\n\n\u2014And what did you do, John?\n\n\u2014Do! said Mr Casey. She stuck her ugly old face up at me when she said it and I had my mouth full of tobacco juice. I bent down to her and Phth! says I to her like that.\n\nHe turned aside and made the act of spitting.\n\n\u2014Phth! says I to her like that, right into her eye.\n\nHe clapped his hand to his eye and gave a hoarse scream of pain.\n\n\u2014O Jesus, Mary and Joseph! says she. I'm blinded! I'm blinded and drownded!\n\nHe stopped in a fit of coughing and laughter, repeating:\n\n\u2014I'm blinded entirely.\n\nMr Dedalus laughed loudly and lay back in his chair while uncle Charles swayed his head to and fro.\n\nDante looked terribly angry and repeated while they laughed:\n\n\u2014Very nice! Ha! Very nice!\n\nIt was not nice about the spit in the woman's eye.\n\nBut what was the name the woman had called Kitty O'Shea that Mr Casey would not repeat? He thought of Mr Casey walking through the crowds of people and making speeches from a wagonette. That was what he had been in prison for and he remembered that one night Sergeant O'Neill had come to the house and had stood in the hall, talking in a low voice with his father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap. And that night Mr Casey had not gone to Dublin by train but a car had come to the door and he had heard his father say something about the Cabinteely road.\n\nHe was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father: and so was Dante too for one night at the band on the esplanade she had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because he had taken off his hat when the band played God save the Queen at the end.\n\nMr Dedalus gave a snort of contempt.\n\n\u2014Ah, John, he said. It is true for them. We are an unfortunate priest-ridden race and always were and always will be till the end of the chapter.\n\nUncle Charles shook his head, saying:\n\n\u2014A bad business! A bad business!\n\nMr Dedalus repeated:\n\n\u2014A priest-ridden Godforsaken race!\n\nHe pointed to the portrait of his grandfather on the wall to his right.\n\n\u2014Do you see that old chap up there, John? he said. He was a good Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was condemned to death as a whiteboy. But he had a saying about our clerical friends, that he would never let one of them put his two feet under his mahogany.\n\nDante broke in angrily:\n\n\u2014If we are a priest-ridden race we ought to be proud of it! They are the apple of God's eye.  Touch them not, says Christ, for they are the apple of My eye.\n\n\u2014And can we not love our country then? asked Mr Casey. Are we not to follow the man that was born to lead us?\n\n\u2014A traitor to his country! replied Dante. A traitor, an adulterer! The priests were right to abandon him. The priests were always the true friends of Ireland.\n\n\u2014Were they, faith? said Mr Casey.\n\nHe threw his fist on the table and, frowning angrily, protruded one finger after another.\n\n\u2014Didn't the bishops of Ireland betray us in the time of the union when Bishop Lanigan presented an address of loyalty to the Marquess Cornwallis? Didn't the bishops and priests sell the aspirations of their country in 1829 in return for catholic emancipation? Didn't they denounce the fenian movement from the pulpit and in the confession box? And didn't they dishonour the ashes of Terence Bellew MacManus?\n\nHis face was glowing with anger and Stephen felt the glow rise to his own cheek as the spoken words thrilled him. Mr Dedalus uttered a guffaw of coarse scorn.\n\n\u2014O, by God, he cried, I forgot little old Paul Cullen! Another apple of God's eye!\n\nDante bent across the table and cried to Mr Casey:\n\n\u2014Right! Right! They were always right! God and morality and religion come first.\n\nMrs Dedalus, seeing her excitement, said to her:\n\n\u2014Mrs Riordan, don't excite yourself answering them.\n\n\u2014God and religion before everything! Dante cried. God and religion before the world.\n\nMr Casey raised his clenched fist and brought it down on the table with a crash.\n\n\u2014Very well then, he shouted hoarsely, if it comes to that, no God for Ireland!\n\n\u2014John! John! cried Mr Dedalus, seizing his guest by the coat sleeve.\n\nDante stared across the table, her cheeks shaking. Mr Casey struggled up from his chair and bent across the table towards her, scraping the air from before his eyes with one hand as though he were tearing aside a cobweb.\n\n\u2014No God for Ireland! he cried. We have had too much God In Ireland. Away with God!\n\n\u2014Blasphemer! Devil! screamed Dante, starting to her feet and almost spitting in his face.\n\nUncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into his chair again, talking to him from both sides reasonably. He stared before him out of his dark flaming eyes, repeating:\n\n\u2014Away with God, I say!\n\nDante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table, upsetting her napkin-ring which rolled slowly along the carpet and came to rest against the foot of an easy-chair. Mrs Dedalus rose quickly and followed her towards the door. At the door Dante turned round violently and shouted down the room, her cheeks flushed and quivering with rage:\n\n\u2014Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to death! Fiend!\n\nThe door slammed behind her.\n\nMr Casey, freeing his arms from his holders, suddenly bowed his head on his hands with a sob of pain.\n\n\u2014Poor Parnell! he cried loudly. My dead king!\n\nHe sobbed loudly and bitterly.\n\nStephen, raising his terror-stricken face, saw that his father's eyes were full of tears.\n\n\nThe fellows talked together in little groups.\n\nOne fellow said:\n\n\u2014They were caught near the Hill of Lyons.\n\n\u2014Who caught them?\n\n\u2014Mr Gleeson and the minister. They were on a car. The same fellow added:\n\n\u2014A fellow in the higher line told me.\n\nFleming asked:\n\n\u2014But why did they run away, tell us?\n\n\u2014I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had fecked cash out of the rector's room.\n\n\u2014Who fecked it?\n\n\u2014Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it.\n\n\u2014But that was stealing. How could they have done that?\n\n\u2014A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! Wells said. I know why they scut.\n\n\u2014Tell us why.\n\n\u2014I was told not to, Wells said.\n\n\u2014O, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We won't let it out.\n\nStephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked round to see if anyone was coming. Then he said secretly:\n\n\u2014You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sacristy?\n\n\u2014Yes.\n\n\u2014Well, they drank that and it was found out who did it by the smell. And that's why they ran away, if you want to know.\n\nAnd the fellow who had spoken first said:\n\n\u2014Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher line.\n\nThe fellows all were silent. Stephen stood among them, afraid to speak, listening. A faint sickness of awe made him feel weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the dark silent sacristy. There were dark wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the Procession to the little altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. The boy that held the censer had swung it lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting. That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. And then when all were vested he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the red coals.\n\nThe fellows were talking together in little groups here and there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He had been thrown by the fellow's machine lightly on the cinder path and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth.\n\nThat was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up. But there was no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes would be prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the cricket bats through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack, pock, puck: little drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in the brimming bowl.\n\nAthy, who had been silent, said quietly:\n\n\u2014You are all wrong.\n\nAll turned towards him eagerly.\n\n\u2014Why?\n\n\u2014Do you know?\n\n\u2014Who told you?\n\n\u2014Tell us, Athy.\n\nAthy pointed across the playground to where Simon Moonan was walking by himself kicking a stone before him.\n\n\u2014Ask him, he said.\n\nThe fellows looked there and then said:\n\n\u2014Why him?\n\n\u2014Is he in it?\n\nAthy lowered his voice and said:\n\n\u2014Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but you must not let on you know.\n\n\u2014Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know.\n\nHe paused for a moment and then said mysteriously:\n\n\u2014They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in the square one night.\n\nThe fellows looked at him and asked:\n\n\u2014Caught?\n\n\u2014What doing?\n\nAthy said:\n\n\u2014Smugging.\n\nAll the fellows were silent: and Athy said:\n\n\u2014And that's why.\n\nStephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was at the door. It was the night of the match against the Bective Rangers; and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets. And one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was always at his nails, paring them.\n\nEileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a girl. They were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of Tower of Ivory but protestants could not understand it and made fun of it. One day he had stood beside her looking into the hotel grounds. A waiter was running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket where his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: and then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing down the sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed out behind her like gold in the sun. Tower of Ivory. House of Gold. By thinking of things you could understand them.\n\nBut why in the square? You went there when you wanted to do something. It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled all day out of tiny pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale water there. And behind the door of one of the closets there was a drawing in red pencil of a bearded man in a Roman dress with a brick in each hand and underneath was the name of the drawing:\n\nBalbus was building a wall.\n\nSome fellow had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny face but it was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall of another closet there was written in backhand in beautiful writing:\n\nJulius Caesar wrote The Calico Belly.\n\nPerhaps that was why they were there because it was a place where some fellows wrote things for cod. But all the same it was queer what Athy said and the way he said it. It was not a cod because they had run away. He looked with the others across the playground and began to feel afraid.\n\nAt last Fleming said:\n\n\u2014And we are all to be punished for what other fellows did?\n\n\u2014I won't come back, see if I do, Cecil Thunder said. Three days' silence in the refectory and sending us up for six and eight every minute.\n\n\u2014Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett has a new way of twisting the note so that you can't open it and fold it again to see how many ferulae you are to get. I won't come back too.\n\n\u2014Yes, said Cecil Thunder, and the prefect of studies was in second of grammar this morning.\n\n\u2014Let us get up a rebellion, Fleming said. Will we?\n\nAll the fellows were silent. The air was very silent and you could hear the cricket bats but more slowly than before: pick, pock.\n\nWells asked:\n\n\u2014What is going to be done to them?\n\n\u2014Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, Athy said, and the fellows in the higher line got their choice of flogging or being expelled.\n\n\u2014And which are they taking? asked the fellow who had spoken first.\n\n\u2014All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy answered. He's going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson.\n\n\u2014I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and the other fellows are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit but a fellow that has been expelled from college is known all his life on account of it. Besides Gleeson won't flog him hard.\n\n\u2014It's best of his play not to, Fleming said.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker Cecil Thunder said. But I don't believe they will be flogged. Perhaps they will be sent up for twice nine.\n\n\u2014No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital spot. Wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice:\n\n\u2014Please, sir, let me off!\n\nAthy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, saying:\n\nIt can't be helped;\nIt must be done.\nSo down with your breeches\nAnd out with your bum.\n\nThe fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid. In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from here and from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat made a sound too but not like that. The fellows said it was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he wondered what was the pain like. There were different kinds of sounds. A long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like. It made him shivery to think of it and cold: and what Athy said too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It made him shivery: but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down, the master or the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it that way?\n\nHe looked at Athy's rolled-up sleeves and knuckly inky hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed nails. So long and cruel they were, though the white fattish hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish hands, clean and strong and gentle. And he thought of what Cecil Thunder had said: that Mr Gleeson would not flog Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was best of his play not to. But that was not why\n\nA voice from far out on the playground cried:\n\n\u2014All in!\n\nAnd other voices cried:\n\n\u2014All in! All in!\n\nDuring the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listening to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting beside the boy to show him how to hold his pen. He had tried to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already what it was for it was the last of the book. Zeal without prudence is like a ship adrift. But the lines of the letters were like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right eye tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make out the full curves of the capital.\n\nBut Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the faint smell of the rector's breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. But he said:\n\n\u2014Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on which I made my first holy communion.\n\nFather Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he remained still, leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father Arnall gave out the theme-books and he said that they were scandalous and that they were all to be written out again with the corrections at once. But the worst of all was Fleming's theme because the pages were stuck together by a blot: and Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an insult to any master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked Jack Lawton to decline the noun mare and Jack Lawton stopped at the ablative singular and could not go on with the plural.\n\n\u2014You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall sternly. You, the leader of the class!\n\nThen he asked the next boy and the next and the next. Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and more quiet as each boy tried to answer it and could not. But his face was black-looking and his eyes were staring though his voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said that the word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the book and shouted at him:\n\n\u2014Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of the idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of you.\n\nFleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between the two last benches. The other boys bent over their theme-books and began to write. A silence filled the classroom and Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's dark face, saw that it was a little red from the wax he was in.\n\nWas that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he allowed to get into a wax when the boys were idle because that made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a wax? It was because he was allowed, because a priest would know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps he would go to confession to the minister. And if the minister did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the provincial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were all clever men. They could all have become high-up people in the world if they had not become jesuits. And he wondered what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett would have become and what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson would have become if they had not become jesuits. It was hard to think what because you would have to think of them in a different way with different coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches and different kinds of hats.\n\nThe door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran through the class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant of dead silence and then the loud crack of a pandybat on the last desk. Stephen's heart leapt up in fear.\n\n\u2014Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the prefect of studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class?\n\nHe came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his knees.\n\n\u2014Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees? What is your name, boy?\n\n\u2014Fleming, sir.\n\n\u2014Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see it in your eye. Why is he on his knees, Father Arnall?\n\n\u2014He wrote a bad Latin theme, Father Arnall said, and he missed all the questions in grammar.\n\n\u2014Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies, of course he did! A born idler! I can see it in the corner of his eye.\n\nHe banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried:\n\n\u2014Up, Fleming! Up, my boy!\n\nFleming stood up slowly.\n\n\u2014Hold out! cried the prefect of studies.\n\nFleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down on it with a loud smacking sound: one, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n\u2014Other hand!\n\nThe pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks.\n\n\u2014Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies.\n\nFleming knelt down, squeezing his hands under his armpits, his face contorted with pain; but Stephen knew how hard his hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into them. But perhaps he was in great pain for the noise of the pandybat was terrible. Stephen's heart was beating and fluttering.\n\n\u2014At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. We want no lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At your work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day. Father Dolan will be in tomorrow.\n\nHe poked one of the boys in the side with his pandybat, saying:\n\n\u2014You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again?\n\n\u2014Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice.\n\n\u2014Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the prefect of studies. Make up your minds for that. Every day Father Dolan. Write away. You, boy, who are you?\n\nStephen's heart jumped suddenly.\n\n\u2014Dedalus, sir.\n\n\u2014Why are you not writing like the others?\n\n\u2014I...my...\n\nHe could not speak with fright.\n\n\u2014Why is he not writing, Father Arnall?\n\n\u2014He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I exempted him from work.\n\n\u2014Broke? What is this I hear? What is this your name is! said the prefect of studies.\n\n\u2014Dedalus, sir.\n\n\u2014Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in your face. Where did you break your glasses?\n\nStephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by fear and haste.\n\n\u2014Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect of studies.\n\n\u2014The cinder-path, sir.\n\n\u2014Hoho! The cinder-path! cried the prefect of studies. I know that trick.\n\nStephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment Father Dolan's white-grey not young face, his baldy white-grey head with fluff at the sides of it, the steel rims of his spectacles and his no-coloured eyes looking through the glasses. Why did he say he knew that trick?\n\n\u2014Lazy idle little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. Broke my glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this moment!\n\nStephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling hand with the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies touch it for a moment at the fingers to straighten it and then the swish of the sleeve of the soutane as the pandybat was lifted to strike. A hot burning stinging tingling blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the pain scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled burning livid hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let off. But though the tears scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with pain and fright he held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his throat.\n\n\u2014Other hand! shouted the prefect of studies.\n\nStephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and held out his left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass. The scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry come from his throat and the scalding tears falling out of his eyes and down his flaming cheeks.\n\n\u2014Kneel down, cried the prefect of studies.\n\nStephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his sides. To think of them beaten and swollen with pain all in a moment made him feel so sorry for them as if they were not his own but someone else's that he felt sorry for. And as he knelt, calming the last sobs in his throat and feeling the burning tingling pain pressed into his sides, he thought of the hands which he had held out in the air with the palms up and of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied the shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of palm and fingers that shook helplessly in the air.\n\n\u2014Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies from the door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any boy, any lazy idle little loafer wants flogging. Every day. Every day.\n\nThe door closed behind him.\n\nThe hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father Arnall rose from his seat and went among them, helping the boys with gentle words and telling them the mistakes they had made. His voice was very gentle and soft. Then he returned to his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen:\n\n\u2014You may return to your places, you two.\n\nFleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat down. Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly with one weak hand and bent down upon it, his face close to the page.\n\nIt was unfair and cruel because the doctor had told him not to read without glasses and he had written home to his father that morning to send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had said that he need not study till the new glasses came. Then to be called a schemer before the class and to be pandied when he always got the card for first or second and was the leader of the Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know that it was a trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they had steadied his hand and at first he had thought he was going to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: but then in an instant he had heard the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash. It was cruel and unfair to make him kneel in the middle of the class then: and Father Arnall had told them both that they might return to their places without making any difference between them. He listened to Father Arnall's low and gentle voice as he corrected the themes. Perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and cruel. The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and unfair. And his white-grey face and the no-coloured eyes behind the steel-rimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had steadied the hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and louder.\n\n\u2014It's a stinking mean thing, that's what it is, said Fleming in the corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the refectory, to pandy a fellow for what is not his fault.\n\n\u2014You really broke your glasses by accident, didn't you? Nasty Roche asked.\n\nStephen felt his heart filled by Fleming's words and did not answer.\n\n\u2014Of course he did! said Fleming. I wouldn't stand it. I'd go up and tell the rector on him.\n\n\u2014Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the pandy-bat over his shoulder and he's not allowed to do that.\n\n\u2014Did they hurt you much? Nasty Roche asked.\n\n\u2014Very much, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't stand it, Fleming repeated, from Baldyhead or any other Baldyhead. It's a stinking mean low trick, that's what it is. I'd go straight up to the rector and tell him about it after dinner.\n\n\u2014Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder.\n\n\u2014Yes, do. Yes, go up and tell the rector on him, Dedalus, said Nasty Roche, because he said that he'd come in tomorrow again and pandy you.\n\n\u2014Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said.\n\nAnd there were some fellows out of second of grammar listening and one of them said:\n\n\u2014The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus had been wrongly punished.\n\nIt was wrong; it was unfair and cruel; and, as he sat in the refectory, he suffered time after time in memory the same humiliation until he began to wonder whether it might not really be that there was something in his face which made him look like a schemer and he wished he had a little mirror to see. But there could not be; and it was unjust and cruel and unfair.\n\nHe could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on Wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told him. He would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly punished. A thing like that had been done before by somebody in history, by some great person whose head was in the books of history. And the rector would declare that he had been wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people always declared that the men who did that had been wrongly punished. Those were the great men whose names were in Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about those men and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's Tales about Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley himself was on the first page in a picture. There was a road over a heath with grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a broad hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walking fast along the road to Greece and Rome.\n\nIt was easy what he had to do. All he had to do was when the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of grammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.\n\nWhat would happen?\n\nHe heard the fellows of the higher line stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was big Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. That was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders and big hanging black head passing in the file. But he had done something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him hard: and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the bath. He had skin the same colour as the turf-coloured bogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs shook a little because he was fat.\n\nThe refectory was half empty and the fellows were still passing out in file. He could go up the staircase because there was never a priest or a prefect outside the refectory door. But he could not go. The rector would side with the prefect of studies and think it was a schoolboy trick and then the prefect of studies would come in every day the same, only it would be worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any fellow going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to go but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all about it. No, it was best to forget all about it and perhaps the prefect of studies had only said he would come in. No, it was best to hide out of the way because when you were small and young you could often escape that way.\n\nThe fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed out among them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming near the door. If he went on with the fellows he could never go up to the rector because he could not leave the playground for that. And if he went and was pandied all the same all the fellows would make fun and talk about young Dedalus going up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies.\n\nHe was walking down along the matting and he saw the door before him. It was impossible: he could not. He thought of the baldy head of the prefect of studies with the cruel no-coloured eyes looking at him and he heard the voice of the prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was. Why could he not remember the name when he was told the first time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun out of the name? The great men in the history had names like that and nobody made fun of them. It was his own name that he should have made fun of if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: it was like the name of a woman who washed clothes.\n\nHe had reached the door and, turning quickly up to the right, walked up the stairs and, before he could make up his mind to come back, he had entered the low dark narrow corridor that led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold of the door of the corridor he saw, without turning his head to look, that all the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by.\n\nHe passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and thought that those must be portraits. It was dark and silent and his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not see. But he thought they were the portraits of the saints and great men of the order who were looking down on him silently as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book and pointing to the words Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam in it; saint Francis Xavier pointing to his chest; Lorenzo Ricci with his berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines, the three patrons of holy youth\u2014saint Stanislaus Kostka, saint Aloysius Gonzago, and Blessed John Berchmans, all with young faces because they died when they were young, and Father Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak.\n\nHe came out on the landing above the entrance hall and looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it was there that the old servants had seen the ghost in the white cloak of a marshal.\n\nAn old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He asked him where was the rector's room and the old servant pointed to the door at the far end and looked after him as he went on to it and knocked.\n\nThere was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and his heart jumped when he heard a muffled voice say:\n\n\u2014Come in!\n\nHe turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for the handle of the green baize door inside. He found it and pushed it open and went in.\n\nHe saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a skull on the desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old leather of chairs.\n\nHis heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he was in and the silence of the room: and he looked at the skull and at the rector's kind-looking face.\n\n\u2014Well, my little man, said the rector, what is it?\n\nStephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said:\n\n\u2014I broke my glasses, sir.\n\nThe rector opened his mouth and said:\n\n\u2014O!\n\nThen he smiled and said:\n\n\u2014Well, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new pair.\n\n\u2014I wrote home, sir, said Stephen, and Father Arnall said I am not to study till they come.\n\n\u2014Quite right! said the rector.\n\nStephen swallowed down the thing again and tried to keep his legs and his voice from shaking.\n\n\u2014But, sir\u2014\n\n\u2014Yes?\n\n\u2014Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because I was not writing my theme.\n\nThe rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the blood rising to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes.\n\nThe rector said:\n\n\u2014Your name is Dedalus, isn't it?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir...\n\n\u2014And where did you break your glasses?\n\n\u2014On the cinder-path, sir. A fellow was coming out of the bicycle house and I fell and they got broken. I don't know the fellow's name.\n\nThe rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled and said:\n\n\u2014O, well, it was a mistake; I am sure Father Dolan did not know.\n\n\u2014But I told him I broke them, sir, and he pandied me.\n\n\u2014Did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair? the rector asked.\n\n\u2014No, sir.\n\n\u2014O well then, said the rector, Father Dolan did not understand. You can say that I excuse you from your lessons for a few days.\n\nStephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent him:\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow to pandy me again for it.\n\n\u2014Very well, the rector said, it is a mistake and I shall speak to Father Dolan myself. Will that do now?\n\nStephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured:\n\n\u2014O yes sir, thanks.\n\nThe rector held his hand across the side of the desk where the skull was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment, felt a cool moist palm.\n\n\u2014Good day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and bowing.\n\n\u2014Good day, sir, said Stephen.\n\nHe bowed and walked quietly out of the room, closing the doors carefully and slowly.\n\nBut when he had passed the old servant on the landing and was again in the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk faster and faster. Faster and faster he hurried on through the gloom excitedly. He bumped his elbow against the door at the end and, hurrying down the staircase, walked quickly through the two corridors and out into the air.\n\nHe could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds. He broke into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran across the cinderpath and reached the third line playground, panting.\n\nThe fellows had seen him running. They closed round him in a ring, pushing one against another to hear.\n\n\u2014Tell us! Tell us!\n\n\u2014What did he say?\n\n\u2014Did you go in?\n\n\u2014What did he say?\n\n\u2014Tell us! Tell us!\n\nHe told them what he had said and what the rector had said and, when he had told them, all the fellows flung their caps spinning up into the air and cried:\n\n\u2014Hurroo!\n\nThey caught their caps and sent them up again spinning sky-high and cried again:\n\n\u2014Hurroo! Hurroo!\n\nThey made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him up among them and carried him along till he struggled to get free. And when he had escaped from them they broke away in all directions, flinging their caps again into the air and whistling as they went spinning up and crying:\n\n\u2014Hurroo!\n\nAnd they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three cheers for Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector that was ever in Clongowes.\n\nThe cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He was happy and free; but he would not be anyway proud with Father Dolan. He would be very quiet and obedient: and he wished that he could do something kind for him to show him that he was not proud.\n\nThe air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming. There was the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the fields in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them and eat them when they went out for a walk to Major Barton's, the smell there was in the little wood beyond the pavilion where the gallnuts were.\n\nThe fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and slow twisters.

skinned nigga with braids, he'll fuck you up\nLet's go\n[Verse]\nI'm a straight up menace\nI ain't talking 'bout Dennis\nFuck a slingshot\nThing cock it's a nickel plated beam Glock\nStraight out the bricks I'm with the business\nIn the hood making a killing on that cash route\nI ain't got time for chilling\nI ain't a chump, test if you want\nI'll light your ass up like the tip of a blunt\nAnd your mouth on the tip of the pump\nPull the trigger then, watch your top open like the back of a trunk\nPouring hot shit through your back and your front meat\nWon't stop dumping 'till you slumped in the front seat\nGun speak, talk's cheap, that's how it is where I be\n[?] around the corner pistol in my hand when I sleep\nBodies steady dropping every day of the week\nDog it's nothing new that's how it it is on these streets\nThe AR, that'll knock your ass off your feet\nSo gone body left for the pastor to preach\nNiggas dying life seem worthless\nBeen to more funerals, than a church service\nRed and blue raggers ride for the purpose\nBanging never played out like [?]\nCome to the hood, see Glocks jerkin'\nKids sling chrome nigga, one time swervin'\nGangbanging shit never coming to an ending\nWhoever started it, that nigga can't finish it\nReal talk, gotta watch where you walk\nGotta a maroon colour, your body outlined in chalk\nTrunk full of guns, for whoever want drama\nGotta a lot of hand pistols and a lot of Llamas\nGot the inf beam on top of the black revolver\nGet you 6 shots at a bar like an alcoholic\nNiggas scheming and they hate when a nigga balling\nMy dollar's rising and they funds is steady falling\nFuck em with raps, I'm strapped with a lot of condoms\nHIV, that's an uncurable problem\nYou got a gat, it don't take nothing to pop it\nOne shot to the head guaranteed to drop 'em\nDot, he'll put five in your face and leave ya\n(Chopped and screwed like a Houston mixtape)\nNiggas gotta wear bulletproof vests\nNiggas wasn't born with a bulletproof chest\nTeams getting better so they cutting more cheques\nNiggas be hating so we buying more TECs\nYou bitch niggas, y'all better act right\nYeah my gun's steady smoking like a crack pipe\nWoah, my heart cold as popsicle\nAnd I'll [?] your block on a bicycle\nDoom Dog, he the captain nigga call me skipper\nI'm Gilligan with a gat, I'll leave you crippled\nI stay on a mission 187 plenty ammunition\nThat'll leave a bitch nigga missin', listen huh\nI can throw them things, I ain't a punk B\nAnd I roll the dope leave your face all lumpy\nGot ballers that shoot straighter than Ginobili\nThat'll leave you bleeding son, like a ho on a monthly\nYeah, we spending grands monthly\nIn the trunk, that's where the Mossberg pump be\nWe got cars roll heavy like tanks\nY'all guns all

lawn\nChicken George become Dead George\nStealin' chickens from my farm\nDamn, another dead pigeon\nIf you're mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians\nNobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade\nGirl bled to death while she was tongue-kissin' a razor blade\nThat sounds sick, maybe one day I'll write a horror\nBlackula comes to the ghetto (Stick 'em up), jacks an Acura\nStevie Wonder sees crack babies\nBecomin' enemies of their own families\n[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]\nArmageddon come, you know-a we soon done\nGun by my side just in case I gotta rump\nA boy on the side of

She'll have to tell.\n\nJIMMY: Well, like they say in Silicon Valley, \"it's not a bug it's a feature!\" Did you ever hear of a bargaining chip? What we have right here is the mother of all bargaining chips.\n\nBETSY: Um, as in you expect us to give this back? We are not giving this back. Uh, we are not guilty. This money belongs to us. We well, I mean, Craig earned it.\n\nCRAIG: I worked very hard You know, weekends, holiday\n\nBETSY: Yep, all unpaid, always. And, really, just because you're salaried, doesn't mean you don't deserve overtime. I think that's only fair\n\nCRAIG: I mean, really, that's what this is about, right? Fairness.\n\nBETSY: Fairness, right. I mean, not just what's legal. If you want to talk about legal, slavery That used to be legal. Human slavery.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, this is right up there with that.\n\nBetsy takes $30,000 out of the bag and offers it to Jimmy.\n\nBETSY: Please, just don't tell anyone about the money.\n\nJIMMY: I can't take a bribe.\n\nBETSY: Who would know?\n\nCRAIG: We won't tell anyone.\n\nBETSY: Yeah, take it.\n\nJIMMY: I can't take it.\n\nCRAIG: Please, didn't you say that you wanted to help us?\n\nBETSY: So just pretend you never saw the money. How hard is that? Take it. Take it.\n\nJIMMY: I can't... I can't take a bribe. But you know what? I can take a retainer\n\nBETSY: A retainer?\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, for my services as your lawyer?\n\nCRAIG: You're not our lawyer.\n\nJIMMY: Well, not yet. Look I know that HHM is shiny and it's slick. It's chock-full of lawyers and, compared to them, I'm like a a kiddy lemonade stand trying to compete with Wal-Mart. But here's the thing. What are you gonna get from me that you're not gonna get from those other guys? Passion, commitment. Ask yourself this who found you? I don't see Howard Hamlin ruining his $300 Gucci loafers out here. If you're with me, you're my number-one client. Morning, noon, or night, you call me I'm there. I would be singularly devoted to you.\n\nBetsy and Craig both shake their heads.\n\nJIMMY: But why not?\n\nBETSY: I'm sorry. You're just\n\nJIMMY: Just I'm what?\n\nBETSY: You're the kind of lawyer guilty people hire.\nBetsy offers Jimmy the money again.\n\nEXT.

Jimmy drives into the parking lot.\n\nINT. ALBUQUERQUE POLICE STATION\n\nJimmy stands with his hand on the wall, waiting. Nacho comes through the door in handcuffs with a detective.\n\nJIMMY: Whoa, whoa. Why is my client in handcuffs? This man is innocent. He's a victim. why why on earth would he be cuffed? Just go go ahead. Take them off. There you go. Free at last! Hey, did he tell you the good news? Never even kidnapped how about that? A family can't go on a little vacation without the whole city going on lockdown? By the way, where is your partner? What? Did you lose the coin toss? Because we expect an apology from him, as well as you.\n\nDETECTIVE: You really don't want to push your luck with me, scumbag. (to Nacho) We got eyes on you, asshole. One little slip just one.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, well, you're you're both very pretty, so...\n\nThe detective leaves.\n\nJIMMY: Well, I believe I did more than what you asked of me, so, uh, that would make us square, yes? Great. You need a ride?\n\nNACHO: Camping? You expect me to believe that shit?\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, I know it. The things people do, huh?\n\nNACHO: They decide to go camping right after I run my little offer by you?\n\nJIMMY: Could be argued that all of life is one great coincidence.\n\nNACHO: Somebody told those people to, um, go camping. Somebody warned them.\n\nJIMMY: They're very woodsy. And between you and me, They're pretty rash when it comes to the decision-making. I mean, they're not really the plan-ahead types.\n\nNACHO: Yeah, I'd cut the cute attitude right about now If I were you. You ratted on me. There will be consequences.\n\nNacho looks Jimmy in the eyes before turning and starting to walk off.\n\nJIMMY: Hey, if somebody warned the Kettlemans, it was probably somebody who was worried about those kids.\n\nNacho turns around and walks back towards Jimmy.\n\nNACHO: You know how much trouble you caused me?\n\nJIMMY: You didn't need any help getting caught, okay? The neighbor ID'd you. You were sloppy. Any trouble you might have that's on you. Not to mention the blood in your van. Here's a thought Ajax, formula 409! You have no idea the tap-dance I had to give those cops To get you out of here. You gave them probable cause out the wazoo. Now, and whoever the somebody is who may have warned the Kettlemans got them out of there before you did anything even more stupid. You should be thanking this good Samaritan. Because whoever he is, he did you a favor.\n\nEXT. NAIL SALON - NIGHT\nWe watch from outside the salon as Jimmy makes his way into his office, turning off the lights\nINT.

Anyway, uh, \"The Thing\" is playing downtown on Saturday. Thought you might be up for some Kurt Russell action. I owe you one, so why don't we just grab some dinner first? My treat. And Uh, you know, if not, can you give me a call anyway? I really want to talk to you. Okay. Uh, bye.\n\nKim hangs up the phone. Howard knocks on the door of her office.\n\nKIM: Come in.\n\nHOWARD: Hey.\n\nKIM: Hey. Hey.\n\nHOWARD: How goes it?\n\nKIM: Uh, tricky, for sure. Craig and Betsy really put us in a corner with the police. Not to mention the press. But this camping story of theirs. They've been keeping it consistent, at least. If it's okay with you, I think I should try to talk them into hiring a PR firm. Certainly for the next couple of weeks.\n\nHOWARD: Mm-hmm.\n\nKIM: So, okay on the PR firm?\n\nHOWARD: Do you have a minute?\n\nKIM: Yeah, of course.

That's our logo. He's just straight-up copying us. I mean, what the hell is he thinking with this?\n\nKIM: I really h-h-he's, you know, a free spirit.\n\nHOWARD: Yeah, that's one way to put it. You two are still friends, right?\n\nKIM: I wouldn't exactly...\n\nHOWARD: You talk, though.\n\nKIM: Not really.\n\nHOWARD: Still, you're the one he called when he found the Kettlemans camped halfway up the Sandias.\n\nKIM: He was just looking out for his own client that's all.\n\nHOWARD: This isn't the third degree, Kim. I really don't care one way or the other. I just... he's really forcing my hand here.\n\nINT. NAIL SALON\nJimmy is relaxing in a chair in the salon. Knock! Knock!

Ah, give the old dogs a rest.\n\nKim sits down in the chair next to Jimmy.\n\nJIMMY: And go for the deep-tissue setting. Otherwise--\n\nKIM: Is that the small fist?\n\nJIMMY: Use the three arrows.\n\nKIM: I did. I pressed it.\n\nJIMMY: Just yeah. Now you feel it? Good.

Is this a cease and desist?\n\nKIM: Yeah.\n\nJIMMY: How pissed was he?\n\nKIM: Well, his head didn't actually explode, but, you know, pretty damn pissed, like \"this won't end well for you\" pissed.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah. How about that.\n\nKIM: Jimmy. This is serious.\n\nJIMMY: I know.\n\nKIM: Do you? I mean.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah.\n\nKIM: What the hell is with that billboard? I know you have a problem with Hamlin, but I I just don't get your angle here. Aren't you trying to build your own law practice? Instead, you're spending god knows how much money turning yourself into a little Hamlin clone. I mean why are you making this personal?\n\nJIMMY: It's not personal.\n\nKIM: It is so personal. It is completely and totally personal.\n\nJIMMY: No, no, no. It's not.\n\nKIM: Yes. Yes, it is. Stop trying to pretend.\n\nJIMMY: I can advertise, can't I? What, do I have to clear everything past the great and powerful Howard?\n\nKIM: Yes, you can advertise, Jimmy, all you want. That billboard is not advertising. That is a declaration of war.\n\nJIMMY: Declaration of war?\n\nKIM: It's right at Hamlin's exit. You know he drives by it every day.\n\nJIMMY: It's business. I'm building a brand.\n\nKIM: You're ripping off a brand. There is nothing original in that ad. It certainly doesn't represent Jimmy McGill.\n\nJIMMY: Hey, all right, now, he fired the first shot, okay? Trying to keep me from using my name, my own name, Kim?\n\nKIM: I get that. But this... you're better than this.\n\nJIMMY: I'm better than this?\n\nKIM: Yeah.\n\nJIMMY: I'm better than this?\n\nKIM: You are.\n\nJIMMY: Well, you're better than that schmuck Hamlin!\n\nKIM: Oh, come on, Jimmy.\n\nJIMMY: You could work anywhere. You could be somewhere where they appreciate you. You know, where they see how valuable you are, where, I don't know, maybe they care about you?\n\nSilence\n\nJIMMY: Forget it, okay? If Hamlin wants to come after me, he knows where I am. I'll be ready, guns blazing.\n\nKIM: The cease and desist is just the beginning. The next step is an injunction. You can't win this fight.\n\nKim picks up her bag and leaves the Salon\nINT. JUDGE'S OFFICE\n\nJIMMY: Your honor, I'm a humble solo practitioner, merely trying to ply my trade In an aggressive and evolving marketplace.\n\nHOWARD: As I've argued repeatedly, this is trademark infringement. Mr. McGill's new logo is an absolute copy of ours.\n\nJIMMY: I think it falls firmly under fair use.\n\nHOWARD: Fair use? You're clearly profiting, so fair use doesn't apply.\n\nJIMMY: There are only so many fonts out there. Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?\n\nHOWARD: No, but we've been using this particular font for 12 years now, and it, in concert with our tri-rectangle graphic\nand Hamlindigo Blue, constitutes a trademarked brand identifier.\n\nJIMMY: Whoa, whoa. Back up. Hamlindigo blue?\n\nHOWARD: Yes. That is our trademarked name.\n\nJIMMY: Holy crap. You seriously named a color \"Hamlindigo\"? That is yikes.\n\nHOWARD: \"Yikes\"? From the man dressed exactly like me. Your honor, I feel like I'm in the mirror routine with Groucho Marx, like we should be standing, waving our arms at each other.\n\nJIMMY: Really? I don't see it.\n\nHOWARD: In addition, the name McGill appears in both logos, which, I believe, Mr. McGill is hoping to further confuse potential clients.\n\nJIMMY: So I can't advertise under my own name now? I'm to be penalized 'cause I happen to share a name with one of HHM's partners? You can't take my name from me.\n\nJUDGE: The name is not the problem here, Mr. McGill.\n\nJIMMY: Hamlin certainly seems to think so. I mean, he wants me to change my name 'cause he claims that what, it's some kind of threat to his business?\n\nHOWARD: Your honor.\n\nJIMMY: This is restraint of trade, okay? Whatever happened to the free market, huh? No, Hamlin here wants you to tell\n\nJUDGE: Okay, okay, I've enough. Mr. McGill, I've heard enough. All right, yes, you are within your rights to advertise using your own name. However, in my estimation, the billboard clearly and intentionally duplicates elements of the Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill logo. You're actively copying their established brand for your own gain. I don't see any other reasonable explanation.\n\nJIMMY: Your honor.\n\nJUDGE: Jimmy, Jimmy. Wise up. The billboard must come down within 48 hours.\n\nINT. COURTHOUSE\nJimmy walks through the hallway on the phone\n\nJIMMY (over phone): This is a classic David vs. Goliath story. I mean, you got your gigantic law firm stomping all over the little guy. Yeah, but it's investigative journalism at its best. It's right up your alley. Uh-huh. Yeah, o-okay, well, let me give you my cell just in case. Uh yeah. Thank you.\n\nJimmy hangs up his cell phone and crosses off a name in his notepad. Howard walks past and glaces over at Jimmy, who starts calling other people listed on his notepad.\n\nJIMMY (over phone): Can I get the news desk, please? I got a hot tip.\n\nJIMMY (over phone): Don't you want to be the station that brought down big law? You could be like the reporters that brought down big tobacco.\n\nJIMMY (over phone): Look, I'm talking Woodward and Bernstein here.\n\nJIMMY (over phone): Hey, your exposa on predatory ATM fees that was... wow!\n\nJIMMY (over phone): Well, it's a miscarriage of justice, And I think your viewers would be very, very interested And, uh, grateful to you for exposing this injustice.\n\nJIMMY (over phone): I wouldn't characterize this as a community health risk, but it's definitely in the community interest.\n\nJIMMY (over phone): No, yes, HHM is a pillar of the community, yes--\n\nJIMMY (over phone): No, the war is an important story, as well.\n\nJIMMY (over phone): That's why this action is so egregious.\n\nJIMMY (over phone): Sure. Okay.\n\nJimmy looks down to his notepad and crosses off a second name\n\nJIMMY (over phone): Well, at least consider the human-interest angle here. Are you kidding? It's lawyer pulls himself up by his bootstraps, Only to be ground under the heel of the old-money megafirm? That's hearts and minds! hello?\n\nJimmy looks down to his notepad again and crosses off another name\n\nJIMMY (over phone): Yeah, I have your number, too, so Yeah, I see. Okay.\n\nJimmy crosses off the final name in his notepad. The elevator bell rings and a woman wearing a UNM shirt walks past. Jimmy takes a good look and pulls out his cell phone, dialing another number.\nEXT. ALBUQUERQUE - PARKING LOT\nA billboard worker starts to remove Jimmy's billboard. We then see Jimmy in the parking lot, with a student camera crew.\nJimmy goes to touch the camera.\n\nCAMERA GUY: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, man. Can't touch the goods. I signed the form only I can touch the camera.\n\nJIMMY: Fine, may I suggest you widen the frame to include-- the billboard is the story, okay? No, I'm also the story, so got to get me in there.\n\nCAMERA GUY: Okay, so, get on your mark.\n\nJIMMY: You know, uh, no offense to your minutes of experience, But I'd like to see what we got before we do this, okay? Other guy.\n\nJimmy points to the sound guy\n\nJIMMY: Other guy! Only other guy that's here, go stand where I was standing.\n\nSound guy walks over to where Jimmy was standing\n\nJIMMY: Uh Shrink down. Shrink down. You know, scrunch. Yeah. Okay, widen the frame.

Is he in the shot?\n\nCAMERA GUY: No. Dude, just go.\n\nJIMMY: How do I look?\n\nCAMERA GUY: Great.\n\nJIMMY: I'll, uh no, this is my good side. Is, uh is the billboard in?\n\nCAMERA GUY: Yes! Jesus, just you said $100 for one hour, not freaking 3.\n\nJIMMY: You clearly have a journalistic impulse. You're a real go-getter, you know that?\n\nCAMERA GUY: Go get this.\n\nJIMMY: All right, count me down. In 5, 4, 3 Gravitas.\n\nJimmy looks down at the ground and then up at the billboard and then back to the camera, taking a deep breath.\n\nJIMMY: I'm James McGill. Like most Americans, I'm a self-made man. I put myself through law school. Working in the courts as a public defender, I represented those with nowhere else to turn. I believe in service. It's what I've built my career on. But I've also had a dream, a dream that many of us have a dream to own my own business.\n\nJimmy looks up to billboard, which is being removed.\n\nJIMMY: Well, I-i scrimped and I saved, and finally, I was able to buy one billboard. A tiny foray into advertising for my fledgling law firm. I've always been told that America is the land of opportunity, and I believed it until today. Not 24 hours after my billboard went up, a large law firm came after me. They said that I was hurting their business. They're rich. They're powerful. I'm just one man. So, who do you think the courts sided with? So now my little billboard comes down. Let me tell you something If they want a fight, they're gonna get a fight, because I'm not giving up, not...\n\nThe worker who is removing the billboard slips and falls, held on only by his harness.\n\nCAMERA GUY: Holy shit! Dude, the dude! The worker guy!\n\nBILLBOARD WORKER: Help! Help!\n\nSOUND GUY: Holy shit.\n\nBILLBOARD WORKER: Please! Aah! Get me down!\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, okay, call 911!\n\nCAMERA GUY: You got a cell?\n\nSOUND GUY: Yeah, yeah.\n\nJimmy takes off his jacket and rushes up the ladder to help the worker.\n\nCAMERA GUY: Hey, man, I don't think that's very safe! You need to be, like, licensed for that!\n\nThe camera guy continues to capture the action.\n\nJIMMY: Not looking down. One rung at a time. Not looking down.\n\nPeople from nearby start to watch what's happening\nBILLBOARD WORKER: Hurry up! Come get me! Help!\n\nJimmy reaches the top of the ladder, and carefully makes his was across to the worker.\n\nJIMMY: Sir, I'm right here!\n\nBILLBOARD WORKER: Please! Please! Pull me up!\n\nJIMMY: Here, grab my hand!\n\nBILLBOARD WORKER: Pull me up! Pull me up!\n\nJimmy pulls the worker to safety while the public watches.\n\nJIMMY: You okay?\n\nBILLBOARD WORKER: Took you long enough.\n\nJimmy and the worker shake hands.\nINT. HHM CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nJIMMY (On TV): I was scared, yes. I mean, I'm not really a big fan of heights Let me tell you. But, you know, something inside me said, \"you have to do this.\" I'm sure our city's first responders would have been here momentarily.\n\nHOWARD: Can you believe this guy? This whole thing was a publicity stunt. It's got to be.\n\nJIMMY (On TV): I think that's kind of all anybody wants when they're in trouble. Of course I didn't think--\n\nHOWARD: (to Kim) You don't think anyone's gonna actually buy this?\n\nKIM: It's hard to say. People love a hero.\n\nJIMMY (On TV): You take it as it comes, right? The universe put me in that spot at that moment. Who am I to say no? You know, as a lawyer, while I help people every day--\n\nHOWARD: Whole thing's a damn stunt.\n\nJIMMY (On TV): But I think my clients know that when they're in trouble, I'm there. I was just a guy who was in the right.\n\nINT. JIMMY'S OFFICE\nJimmy checks his phone and finds that he has some new messages.\n\nFEMALE VOICE: You have seven new messages.

So, to what do you credit this sudden change?\n\nJIMMY: Well, I got to admit you were right. How so? Well, you told me to keep plugging and, uh, you know do good work, and the clients will come. You know, I'll admit. I almost lost faith a couple times, but the worm has turned.\n\nCHUCK: So, uh, what you've been getting referrals from your PD clients?\n\nJIMMY: Uh, yeah. You know, you work hard, show you got half a brain, and people come knocking, like you said. I just needed to get my face out there.\n\nCHUCK: Oh.

When I was starting out, she sent me a couple good ones.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, uh, it was It was someone on her team. You know? I mean, hey, just took some elbow grease and clean living.

Maybe they forgot to deliver it. Maybe some kids grabbed it.\n\nCHUCK: Because if there's one thing kids love, it's local print journalism.\n\nJIMMY: I don't know what to tell you. You got a ton of reading material there. Look, hey. Financial Times. You know, I know Albuquerque is a hub of global intrigue, but you think that'll tide you over?\n\nCHUCK: All right, fine. But if it's not here tomorrow, I'm gonna need you to call the subscription office for me.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, will do. Look, I got to go.

AT RIVEBELLE \u2014 ENTER ALBERTINE\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That day, as for some days past, Saint-Loup had been obliged to go to Donci\u00e8res, where, until his leave finally expired, he would be on duty now until late every afternoon. I was sorry that he was not at Balbec. I had seen alight from carriages and pass, some into the ball-room of the Casino, others into the ice-cream shop, young women who at a distance had seemed to me lovely. I was passing through one of those periods of our youth, unprovided with any one definite love, vacant, in which at all times and in all places \u2014 as a lover the woman by whose charms he is smitten \u2014 we desire, we seek, we see Beauty. Let but a single real feature \u2014 the little that one distinguishes of a woman seen from afar or from behind \u2014 enable us to project the form of beauty before our eyes, we imagine that we have seen her before, our heart beats, we hasten in pursuit, and will always remain half-persuaded that it was she, provided that the woman has vanished: it is only if we manage to overtake her that we realise our mistake\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, as I grew more and more delicate, I was inclined to overrate the simplest pleasures because of the difficulties that sprang up in the way of my attaining them. Charming women I seemed to see all round me, because I was too tired, if it was on the beach, too shy if it was in the Casino or at a pastry-cook\u2019s, to go anywhere near them. And yet if I was soon to die I should have liked first to know the appearance at close quarters, in reality of the prettiest girls that life had to offer, even although it should be another than myself or no one at all who was to take advantage of the offer. (I did not, in fact, appreciate the desire for possession that underlay my curiosity.) I should have had the courage to enter the ballroom if Saint-Loup had been with me. Left by myself, I was simply hanging about in front of the Grand Hotel until it was time for me to join my grandmother, when, still almost at the far end of the paved \u2018front\u2019 along which they projected in a discordant spot of colour, I saw coming towards me five or six young girls, as different in appearance and manner from all the people whom one was accustomed to see at Balbec as could have been, landed there none knew whence, a flight of gulls which performed with measured steps upon the sands \u2014 the dawdlers using their wings to overtake the rest \u2014 a movement the purpose of which seems as obscure to the human bathers, whom they do not appear to see, as it is clearly determined in their own birdish minds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of these strangers was pushing as she came, with one hand, her bicycle; two others carried golf-clubs; and their attire generally was in contrast to that of the other girls at Balbec, some of whom, it was true, went in for games, but without adopting any special outfit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the hour at which ladies and gentlemen came out every day for a turn on the \u2018front,\u2019 exposed to the merciless fire of the long glasses fastened upon them, as if they had each borne some disfigurement which she felt it her duty to inspect in its minutest details, by the chief magistrate\u2019s wife, proudly seated there with her back to the band-stand, in the middle of that dread line of chairs on which presently they too, actors turned critics, would come and establish themselves, to scrutinise in their turn those others who would then be filing past them. All these people who paced up and down the \u2018front,\u2019 tacking as violently as if it had been the deck of a ship (for they could not lift a leg without at the same time waving their arms, turning their heads and eyes, settling their shoulders, compensating by a balancing movement on one side for the movement they had just made on the other, and puffing out their faces), and who, pretending not to see so as to let it be thought that they were not interested, but covertly watching, for fear of running against the people who were walking beside or coming towards them, did, in fact, butt into them, became entangled with them, because each was mutually the object of the same secret attention veiled beneath the same apparent disdain; their love \u2014 and consequently their fear \u2014 of the crowd being one of the most powerful motives in all men, whether they seek to please other people or to astonish them, or to shew them that they despise them. In the case of the solitary, his seclusion, even when it is absolute and ends only with life itself, has often as its primary cause a disordered love of the crowd, which so far overrules every other feeling that, not being able to win, when he goes out, the admiration of his hall-porter, of the passers-by, of the cabman whom he hails, he prefers not to be seen by them at all, and with that object abandons every activity that would oblige him to go out of doors\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among all these people, some of whom were pursuing a train of thought, but if so betrayed its instability by spasmodic gestures, a roving gaze as little in keeping as the circumspect titubation of their neighbours, the girls whom I had noticed, with that mastery over their limbs which comes from perfect bodily condition and a sincere contempt for the rest of humanity, were advancing straight ahead, without hesitation or stiffness, performing exactly the movements that they wished to perform, each of their members in full independence of all the rest, the greater part of their bodies preserving that immobility which is so noticeable in a good waltzer. They were now quite near me. Although each was a type absolutely different from the others, they all had beauty; but to tell the truth I had seen them for so short a time, and without venturing to look them straight in the face, that I had not yet individualised any of them. Save one, whom her straight nose, her dark complexion pointed in contrast among the rest, like (in a renaissance picture of the Epiphany) a king of Arab cast, they were known to me only, one by a pair of eyes, hard, set and mocking; another by cheeks in which the pink had that coppery tint which makes one think of geraniums; and even of these points I had not yet indissolubly attached any one to one of these girls rather than to another; and when (according to the order in which their series met the eye, marvellous because the most different aspects came next one another, because all scales of colours were combined in it, but confused as a piece of music in which I should not have been able to isolate and identify at the moment of their passage the successive phrases, no sooner distinguished than forgotten) I saw emerge a pallid oval, black eyes, green eyes, I knew not if these were the same that had already charmed me a moment ago, I could not bring them home to any one girl whom I might thereby have set apart from the rest and so identified. And this want, in my vision, of the demarcations which I should presently establish between them sent flooding over the group a wave of harmony, the continuous transfusion of a beauty fluid, collective and mobile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not perhaps, in this life of ours, mere chance that had, in forming this group of friends, chosen them all of such beauty; perhaps these girls (whose attitude was enough to reveal their nature, bold, frivolous and hard), extremely sensitive to everything that was ludicrous or ugly, incapable of yielding to an intellectual or moral attraction, had naturally felt themselves, among companions of their own age, repelled by all those in whom a pensive or sensitive disposition was betrayed by shyness, awkwardness, constraint, by what, they would say,\u2018didn\u2019t appeal\u2019 to them, and from such had held aloof; while they attached themselves, on the other hand, to others to whom they were drawn by a certain blend of grace, suppleness, and physical neatness, the only form in which they were able to picture the frankness of a seductive character and the promise of pleasant hours in one another\u2019s company. Perhaps, too, the class to which they belonged, a class which I should not have found it easy to define, was at that point in its evolution at which, whether thanks to its growing wealth and leisure, or thanks to new athletic habits, extended now even to certain plebeian elements, and a habit of physical culture to which had not yet been added the culture of the mind, a social atmosphere, comparable to that of smooth and prolific schools of sculpture, which have not yet gone in for tortured expressions, produces naturally and in abundance fine bodies with fine legs, fine hips, wholesome and reposeful faces, with an air of agility and guile. And were they not noble and calm models of human beauty that I beheld there, outlined against the sea, like statues exposed to the sunlight upon a Grecian shore?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as if, in the heart of their band, which progressed along the \u2018front\u2019 like a luminous comet, they had decided that the surrounding crowd was composed of creatures of another race whose sufferings even could not awaken in them any sense of fellowship, they appeared not to see them, forced those who had stopped to talk to step aside, as though from the path of a machine that had been set going by itself, so that it was no good waiting for it to get out of their way, their utmost sign of consciousness being when, if some old gentleman of whom they did not admit the existence and thrust from them the contact, had fled with a frightened or furious, but a headlong or ludicrous motion, they looked at one another and smiled. They had, for whatever did not form part of their group, no affectation of contempt; their genuine contempt was sufficient. But they could not set eyes on an obstacle without amusing themselves by crossing it, either in a running jump or with both feet together, because they were all filled to the brim, exuberant with that youth which we need so urgently to spend that even when we are unhappy or unwell, obedient rather to the necessities of our age than to the mood of the day, we can never pass anything that can be jumped over or slid down without indulging ourselves conscientiously, interrupting, interspersing our slow progress \u2014 as Chopin his most melancholy phrase \u2014 with graceful deviations in which caprice is blended with virtuosity. The wife of an elderly banker, after hesitating between various possible exposures for her husband, had settled him on a folding chair, facing the \u2018front,\u2019 sheltered from wind and sun by the band-stand. Having seen him comfortably installed there, she had gone to buy a newspaper which she would read aloud to him, to distract him \u2014 one of her little absences which she never prolonged for more than five minutes, which seemed long enough to him but which she repeated at frequent intervals so that this old husband on whom she lavished an attention that she took care to conceal, should have the impression that he was still quite alive and like other people and was in no need of protection. The platform of the band-stand provided, above his head, a natural and tempting springboard, across which, without a moment\u2019s hesitation, the eldest of the little band began to run; she jumped over the terrified old man, whose yachting cap was brushed by the nimble feet, to the great delight of the other girls, especially of a pair of green eyes in a \u2018dashing\u2019 face, which expressed, for that bold act, an admiration and a merriment in which I seemed to discern a trace of timidity, a shamefaced and blustering timidity which did not exist in the others. \u201cOh, the poor old man; he makes me sick; he looks half dead;\u201d said a girl with a croaking voice, but with more sarcasm than sympathy. They walked on a little way, then stopped for a moment in the middle of the road, with no thought whether they were impeding the passage of other people, and held a council, a solid body of irregular shape, compact, unusual and shrill, like birds that gather on the ground at the moment of flight; then they resumed their leisurely stroll along the \u2018front,\u2019 against a background of sea\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time their charming features had ceased to be indistinct and impersonal. I had dealt them like cards into so many heaps to compose (failing their names, of which I was still ignorant) the big one who had jumped over the old banker; the little one who stood out against the horizon of sea with her plump and rosy cheeks, her green eyes; the one with the straight nose and dark complexion, in such contrast to all the rest; another, with a white face like an egg on which a tiny nose described an arc of a circle like a chicken\u2019s beak; yet another, wearing a hooded cape (which gave her so poverty-stricken an appearance, and so contradicted the smartness of the figure beneath that the explanation which suggested itself was that this girl must have parents of high position who valued their self-esteem so far above the visitors to Balbec and the sartorial elegance of their own children that it was a matter of the utmost indifference to them that their daughter should stroll on the \u2018front\u2019 dressed in a way which humbler people would have considered too modest); a girl with brilliant, laughing eyes and plump, colourless cheeks, a black polo-cap pulled down over her face, who was pushing a bicycle with so exaggerated a movement of her hips, with an air borne out by her language, which was so typically of the gutter and was being shouted so loud, when I passed her (although among her expressions I caught that irritating \u2018live my own life\u2019) that, abandoning the hypothesis which her friend\u2019s hooded cape had made me construct, I concluded instead that all these girls belonged to the population which frequents the racing-tracks, and must be the very juvenile mistresses of professional bicyclists. In any event, in none of my suppositions was there any possibility of their being virtuous. At first sight \u2014 in the way in which they looked at one another and smiled, in the insistent stare of the one with the dull cheeks \u2014 I had grasped that they were not. Besides, my grandmother had always watched over me with a delicacy too timorous for me not to believe that the sum total of the things one ought not to do was indivisible or that girls who were lacking in respect for their elders would suddenly be stopped short by scruples when there were pleasures at stake more tempting than that of jumping over an octogenarian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though they were now separately identifiable, still the mutual response which they gave one another with eyes animated by self-sufficiency and the spirit of comradeship, in which were kindled at every moment now the interest now the insolent indifference with which each of them sparkled according as her glance fell on one of her friends or on passing strangers, that consciousness, moreover, of knowing one another intimately enough always to go about together, by making them a \u2018band apart\u2019 established between their independent and separate bodies, as slowly they advanced, a bond invisible but harmonious, like a single warm shadow, a single atmosphere making of them a whole as homogeneous in its parts as it was different from the crowd through which their procession gradually wound\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For an instant, as I passed the dark one with the fat cheeks who was wheeling a bicycle, I caught her smiling, sidelong glance, aimed from the centre of that inhuman world which enclosed the life of this little tribe, an inaccessible, unknown world to which the idea of what I was could certainly never attain nor find a place in it. Wholly occupied with what her companions were saying, this young girl in her polo-cap, pulled down very low over her brow, had she seen me at the moment in which the dark ray emanating from her eyes had fallen on me? In the heart of what universe did she distinguish me? It would have been as hard for me to say as, when certain peculiarities are made visible, thanks to the telescope, in a neighbouring planet, it is difficult to arrive at the conclusion that human beings inhabit it, that they can see us, or to say what ideas the sight of us can have aroused in their minds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If we thought that the eyes of a girl like that were merely two glittering sequins of mica, we should not be athirst to know her and to unite her life to ours. But we feel that what shines in those reflecting discs is not due solely to their material composition; that it is, unknown to us, the dark shadows of the ideas that the creature is conceiving, relative to the people and places that she knows \u2014 the turf of racecourses, the sand of cycling tracks over which, pedalling on past fields and woods, she would have drawn me after her, that little peri, more seductive to me than she of the Persian paradise \u2014 the shadows, too, of the home to which she will presently return, of the plans that she is forming or that others have formed for her; and above all that it is she, with her desires, her sympathies, her revulsions, her obscure and incessant will. I knew that I should never possess this young cyclist if I did not possess also what there was in her eyes. And it was consequently her whole life that filled me with desire; a sorrowful desire because I felt that it was not to be realised, but exhilarating, because what had hitherto been my life, having ceased of a sudden to be my whole life, being no more now than a little part of the space stretching out before me, which I was burning to cover and which was composed of the lives of these girls, offered me that prolongation, that possible multiplication of oneself which is happiness. And no doubt the fact that we had, these girls and I, not one habit \u2014 as we had not one idea \u2014 in common, was to make it more difficult for me to make friends with them and to please them. But perhaps, also, it was thanks to those differences, to my consciousness that there did not enter into the composition of the nature and actions of these girls a single element that I knew or possessed, that there came in place of my satiety a thirst \u2014 like that with which a dry land burns \u2014 for a life which my soul, because it had never until now received one drop of it, would absorb all the more greedily in long draughts, with a more perfect imbibition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had looked so closely at the dark cyclist with the bright eyes that she seemed to notice my attention, and said to the biggest of the girls something that I could not hear. To be honest, this dark one was not the one that pleased me most, simply because she was dark and because (since the day on which, from the little path by Tansonville, I had seen Gilberte) a girl with reddish hair and a golden skin had remained for me the inaccessible ideal. But Gilberte herself, had I not loved her principally because she had appeared to me haloed with that aureole of being the friend of Bergotte, of going with him to look at old cathedrals? And in the same way could I not rejoice at having seen this dark girl look at me (which made me hope that it would be easier for me to get to know her first), for she would introduce me to the others, to the pitiless one who had jumped over the old man\u2019s head, to the cruel one who had said \u201cHe makes me sick, poor old man!\u201d\u2014 to all of them in turn, among whom, moreover, she had the distinction of being their inseparable companion? And yet the supposition that I might some day be the friend of one or other of these girls, that their eyes, whose incomprehensible gaze struck me now and again, playing upon me unawares, like the play of sunlight upon a wall, might ever, by a miraculous alchemy, allow to interpenetrate among their ineffable particles the idea of my existence, some affection for my person, that I myself might some day take my place among them in the evolution of their course by the sea\u2019s edge \u2014 that supposition appeared to me to contain within it a contradiction as insoluble as if, standing before some classical frieze or a fresco representing a procession, I had believed it possible for me, the spectator, to take my place, beloved of them, among the godlike hierophants\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The happiness of knowing these girls was, then, not to be realised. Certainly it would not have been the first of its kind that I had renounced. I had only to recall the numberless strangers whom, even at Balbec, the carriage bowling away from them at full speed had forced me for ever to abandon. And indeed the pleasure that was given me by the little band, as noble as if it had been composed of Hellenic virgins, came from some suggestion that there was in it of the flight of passing figures along a road. This fleetingness of persons who are not known to us, who force us to put out from the harbour of life, in which the women whose society we frequent have all, in course of time, laid bare their blemishes, urges us into that state of pursuit in which there is no longer anything to arrest the imagination. But to strip our pleasures of imagination is to reduce them to their own dimensions, that is to say to nothing. Offered me by one of those procuresses (whose good offices, all the same, the reader has seen that I by no means scorned), withdrawn from the element which gave them so many fine shades and such vagueness, these girls would have enchanted me less. We must have imagination, awakened by the uncertainty of being able to attain our object, to create a goal which hides our other goal from us, and by substituting for sensual pleasures the idea of penetrating into a life prevents us from recognising that pleasure, from tasting its true savour, from restricting it to its own range\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There must be, between us and the fish which, if we saw it for the first time cooked and served on a table, would not appear worth the endless trouble, craft and stratagem that are necessary if we are to catch it, interposed, during our afternoons with the rod, the ripple to whose surface come wavering, without our quite knowing what we intend to do with them, the burnished gleam of flesh, the indefiniteness of a form, in the fluidity of a transparent and flowing azure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These girls benefited also by that alteration of social values characteristic of seaside life. All the advantages which, in our ordinary environment, extend and magnify our importance, we there find to have become invisible, in fact to be eliminated; while on the other hand the people whom we suppose, without reason, to enjoy similar advantages appear to us amplified to artificial dimensions. This made it easy for strange women generally, and to-day for these girls in particular, to acquire an enormous importance in my eyes, and impossible to make them aware of such importance as I might myself possess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if there was this to be said for the excursion of the little band, that it was but an excerpt from the innumerable flight of passing women, which had always disturbed me, their flight was here reduced to a movement so slow as to approach immobility. Now, precisely because, in a phase so far from rapid, faces no longer swept past me in a whirlwind, but calm and distinct still appeared beautiful, I was prevented from thinking as I had so often thought when Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s carriage bore me away that, at closer quarters, if I had stopped for a moment, certain details, a pitted skin, drooping nostrils, a silly gape, a grimace of a smile, an ugly figure might have been substituted, in the face and body of the woman, for those that I had doubtless imagined; for there had sufficed a pretty outline, a glimpse of a fresh complexion, for me to add, in entire good faith, a fascinating shoulder, a delicious glance of which I carried in my mind for ever a memory or a preconceived idea, these rapid decipherings of a person whom we see in motion exposing us thus to the same errors as those too rapid readings in which, on a single syllable and without waiting to identify the rest, we base instead of the word that is in the text a wholly different word with which our memory supplies us. It could not be so with me now. I had looked well at them all; each of them I had seen, not from every angle and rarely in full face, but all the same in two or three aspects different enough to enable me to make either the correction or the verification, to take a \u2018proof of the different possibilities of line and colour that are hazarded at first sight, and to see persist in them, through a series of expressions, something unalterably material. I could say to myself with conviction that neither in Paris nor at Balbec, in the most favourable hypotheses of what might have happened, even if I had been able to stop and talk to them, the passing women who had caught my eye, had there ever been one whose appearance, followed by her disappearance without my having managed to know her, had left me with more regret than would these, had given me the idea that her friendship might be a thing so intoxicating. Never, among actresses nor among peasants nor among girls from a convent school had I beheld anything so beautiful, impregnated with so much that was unknown, so inestimably precious, so apparently inaccessible. They were, of the unknown and potential happiness of life, an illustration so delicious and in so perfect a state that it was almost for intellectual reasons that I was desperate with the fear that I might not be able to make, in unique conditions which left no room for any possibility of error, proper trial of what is the most mysterious thing that is offered to us by the beauty which we desire and console ourselves for never possessing, by demanding pleasure \u2014 as Swann had always refused to do before Odette\u2019s day \u2014 from women whom we have not desired, so that, indeed, we die without having ever known what that other pleasure was. No doubt it was possible that it was not in reality an unknown pleasure, that on a close inspection its mystery would dissipate and vanish, that it was no more than a projection, a mirage of desire. But in that case I could blame only the compulsion of a law of nature \u2014 which if it applied to these girls would apply to all \u2014 and not the imperfection of the object. For it was that which I should have chosen above all others, feeling quite certain, with a botanist\u2019s satisfaction, that it was not possible to find collected anywhere rarer specimens than these young flowers who were interrupting at this moment before my eyes the line of the sea with their slender hedge, like a bower of Pennsylvania roses adorning a garden on the brink of a cliff, between which is contained the whole tract of ocean crossed by some steamer, so slow in gliding along the blue and horizontal line that stretches from one stem to the next that an idle butterfly, dawdling in the cup of a flower which the moving hull has long since passed, can, if it is to fly and be sure of arriving before the vessel, wait until nothing but the tiniest slice of blue still separates the questing prow from the first petal of the flower towards which it is steering\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went indoors because I was to dine at Rivebelle with Robert, and my grandmother insisted that on those evenings, before going out, I must lie down for an hour on my bed, a rest which the Balbec doctor presently ordered me to extend to the other evenings also\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, there was no need, when one went indoors, to leave the \u2018front\u2019 and to enter the hotel by the hall, that is to say from behind. By virtue of an alteration of the clock which reminded me of those Saturdays when, at Combray, we used to have luncheon an hour earlier, now with summer at the full the days had become so long that the sun was still high in the heavens, as though it were only tea-time, when the tables were being laid for dinner in the Grand Hotel. And so the great sliding windows were kept open from the ground. I had but to step across a low wooden sill to find myself in the dining-room, through which I walked and straight across to the lift\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I passed the office I addressed a smile to the manager, and with no shudder of disgust gathered one for myself from his face which, since I had been at Balbec, my comprehensive study of it was injecting and transforming, little by little, like a natural history preparation. His features had become familiar to me, charged with a meaning that was of no importance but still intelligible, like a script which one can read, and had ceased in any way to resemble these queer, intolerable characters which his face had presented to me on that first day, when I had seen before me a personage now forgotten, or, if I succeeded in recalling him, unrecognisable, difficult to identify with this insignificant and polite personality of which the other was but a caricature, a hideous and rapid sketch. Without either the shyness or the sadness of the evening of my arrival I rang for the attendant, who no longer stood in silence while I rose by his side in the lift as in a mobile thoracic cage propelled upwards along its ascending pillar, but repeated:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere aren\u2019t the people now there were a month back. They\u2019re beginning to go now; the days are drawing in.\u201d He said this not because there was any truth in it but because, having an engagement, presently, for a warmer part of the coast, he would have liked us all to leave, so that the hotel could be shut up and he have a few days to himself before \u2018rejoining\u2019 in his new place. \u2018Rejoin\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 were not, by the way, incompatible terms, since, for the lift-boy,\u2018rejoin\u2019 was the usual form of the verb \u2018to join.\u2019 The only thing that surprised me was that he condescended to say \u2018place,\u2019 for he belonged to that modern proletariat which seeks to efface from our language every trace of the rule of domesticity. A moment later, however, he informed me that in the \u2018situation\u2019 which he was about to \u2018rejoin,\u2019 he would have a smarter \u2018tunic\u2019 and a better \u2018salary,\u2019 the words \u2018livery\u2019 and \u2018wages\u2019 sounding to him obsolete and unseemly. And as, by an absurd contradiction, the vocabulary has, through thick and thin, among us \u2018masters,\u2019 survived the conception of inequality, I was always failing to understand what the lift-boy said. For instance, the only thing that interested me was to know whether my grandmother was in the hotel. Now, forestalling my questions, the lift-boy would say to me: \u201cThat lady has just gone out from your rooms.\u201d I was invariably taken in; I supposed that he meant my grandmother. \u201cNo, that lady; I think she\u2019s an employee of yours.\u201d As in the old speech of the middle classes, which ought really to be done away with, a cook is not called an employee, I thought for a moment: \u201cBut he must be mistaken. We don\u2019t own a factory; we haven\u2019t any employees.\u201d Suddenly I remembered that the title of \u2018employee\u2019 is, like the wearing of a moustache among waiters, a sop to their self-esteem given to servants, and realised that this lady who had just gone out must be Fran\u00e7oise (probably on a visit to the coffee-maker, or to watch the Belgian lady\u2019s little maid at her sewing), though even this sop did not satisfy the lift-boy, for he would say quite naturally, speaking pityingly of his own class, \u2018with the working man\u2019 or \u2018the small person,\u2019 using the same singular form as Racine when he speaks of \u2018the poor.\u2019 But as a rule, for my zeal and timidity of the first evening were now things of the past, I no longer spoke to the lift-boy. It was he now who stood there and received no answer during the short journey on which he threaded his way through the hotel, hollowed out inside like a toy, which extended round about us, floor by floor, the ramifications of its corridors in the depths of which the light grew velvety, lost its tone, diminished the communicating doors, the steps of the service stairs which it transformed into that amber haze, unsubstantial and mysterious as a twilight, in which Rembrandt picks out here and there a window-sill or a well-head. And on each landing a golden light reflected from the carpet indicated the setting sun and the lavatory window\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I asked myself whether the girls I had just seen lived at Balbec, and who they could be. When our desire is thus concentrated upon a little tribe of humanity which it singles out from the rest, everything that can be associated with that tribe becomes a spring of emotion and then of reflexion. I had heard a lady say on the \u2018front\u2019: \u201cShe is a friend of the little Simonet girl\u201d with that self-important air of inside knowledge, as who should say: \u201cHe is the inseparable companion of young La Rochefoucauld.\u201d And immediately she had detected on the face of the person to whom she gave this information a curiosity to see more of the favoured person who was \u2018a friend of the little Simonet.\u2019 A privilege, obviously, that did not appear to be granted to all the world. For aristocracy is a relative state. And there are plenty of inexpensive little holes and corners where the son of an upholsterer is the arbiter of fashion and reigns over a court like any young Prince of Wales. I have often since then sought to recall how it first sounded for me there on the beach, that name of Simonet, still quite indefinite as to its form, which I had failed to distinguish, and also as to its significance, to the designation by it of such and such a person, or perhaps of some one else; imprinted, in fact, with that vagueness, that novelty which we find so moving in the sequel, when the name whose letters are every moment engraved more deeply on our hearts by our incessant thought of them has become (though this was not to happen to me with the name of the \u2018little Simonet\u2019 until several years had passed) the first coherent sound that comes to our lips, whether on waking from sleep or on recovering from a swoon, even before the idea of what o\u2019clock it is or of where we are, almost before the word \u2018I,\u2019 as though the person whom it names were more \u2018we\u2019 even than we ourselves, and as though after a brief spell of unconsciousness the phase that is the first of all to dissolve is that in which we were not thinking of her. I do not know why I said to myself from the first that the name Simonet must be that of one of the band of girls; from that moment I never ceased to ask myself how I could get to know the Simonet family, get to know them, moreover, through people whom they considered superior to themselves (which ought not to be difficult if the girls were only common little \u2018bounders\u2019) so that they might not form a disdainful idea of me. For one cannot have a perfect knowledge, one cannot effect the complete absorption of a person who disdains one, so long as one has not overcome her disdain. And since, whenever the idea of women who are so different from us penetrates our senses, unless we are able to forget it or the competition of other ideas eliminates it, we know no rest until we have converted those aliens into something that is compatible with ourself, our heart being in this respect endowed with the same kind of reaction and activity as our physical organism, which cannot abide the infusion of any foreign body into its veins without at once striving to digest and assimilate it: the little Simonet must be the prettiest of them all \u2014 she who, I felt moreover, might yet become my mistress, for she was the only one who, two or three times half-turning her head, had appeared to take cognisance of my fixed stare. I asked the lift-boy whether he knew of any people at Balbec called Simonet. Not liking to admit that there was anything which he did not know, he replied that he seemed to have heard the name somewhere. As we reached the highest landing I told him to have the latest lists of visitors sent up to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I stepped out of the lift, but instead of going to my room I made my way farther along the corridor, for before my arrival the valet in charge of the landing, despite his horror of draughts, had opened the window at the end, which instead of looking out to the sea faced the hill and valley inland, but never allowed them to be seen, for its panes, which were made of clouded glass, were generally closed. I made a short \u2018station\u2019 in front of it, time enough just to pay my devotions to the view which for once it revealed over the hill against which the back of the hotel rested, a view that contained but a solitary house, planted in the middle distance, though the perspective and the evening light in which I saw it, while preserving its mass, gave it a sculptural beauty and a velvet background, as though to one of those architectural works in miniature, tiny temples or chapels wrought in gold and enamels, which serve as reliquaries and are exposed only on rare and solemn days for the veneration of the faithful. But this moment of adoration had already lasted too long, for the valet, who carried in one hand a bunch of keys and with the other saluted me by touching his verger\u2019s skull-cap, though without raising it, on account of the pure, cool evening air, came and drew together, like those of a shrine, the two sides of the window, and so shut off the minute edifice, the glistening relic from my adoring gaze. I went into my room. Regularly, as the season advanced, the picture that I found there in my window changed. At first it was broad daylight, and dark only if the weather was bad: and then, in the greenish glass which it distended with the curve of its round waves, the sea, set among the iron uprights of my window like a piece of stained glass in its leads, ravelled out over all the deep rocky border of the bay little plumed triangles of an unmoving spray delineated with the delicacy of a feather or a downy breast from Pisanello\u2019s pencil, and fixed in that white, unalterable, creamy enamel which is used to depict fallen snow in Gall\u00e9\u2018s glass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently the days grew shorter and at the moment when I entered my room the violet sky seemed branded with the stiff, geometrical, travelling, effulgent figure of the sun (like the representation of some miraculous sign, of some mystical apparition) leaning over the sea from the hinge of the horizon as a sacred picture leans over a high altar, while the different parts of the western sky exposed in the glass fronts of the low mahogany bookcases that ran along the walls, which I carried back in my mind to the marvellous painting from which they had been detached, seemed like those different scenes which some old master executed long ago for a. confraternity upon a shrine, whose separate panels are now exhibited side by side upon the wall of a museum gallery, so that the visitor\u2019s imagination alone can restore them to their place on the predella of the reredos. A few weeks later, when I went upstairs, the sun had already set. Like the one that I used to see at Combray, behind the Calvary, when I was coming home from a walk and looking forward to going down to the kitchen before dinner, a band of red sky over the sea, compact and clear-cut as a layer of aspic over meat, then, a little later, over a sea already cold and blue like a grey mullet, a sky of the same pink as the salmon that we should presently be ordering at Rivebelle reawakened the pleasure which I was to derive from the act of dressing to go out to dinner. Over the sea, quite near the shore, were trying to rise, one beyond another, at wider and wider intervals, vapours of a pitchy blackness but also of the polish and consistency of agate, of a visible weight, so much so that the highest among them, poised at the end of their contorted stem and overreaching the centre of gravity of the pile that had hitherto supported them, seemed on the point of bringing down in ruin this lofty structure already half the height of the sky, and of precipitating it into the sea. The sight of a ship that was moving away like a nocturnal traveller gave me the same impression that I had had in the train of being set free from the necessity of sleep and from confinement in a bedroom. Not that I felt myself a prisoner in the room in which I now was, since in another hour I should have left it and be getting into the carriage. I threw myself down on the bed; and, just as if I had been lying in a berth on board one of those steamers which I could see quite near to me and which, when night came, it would be strange to see stealing slowly out into the darkness, like shadowy and silent but unsleeping swans, I was on all sides surrounded by pictures of the sea\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But as often as not they were, indeed, only pictures; I forgot that below their coloured expanse was hollowed the sad desolation of the beach, travelled by the restless evening breeze whose breath I had so anxiously felt on my arrival at Balbec; besides, even in my room, being wholly taken up with thoughts of the girls whom I had seen go past, I was no longer in a state of mind calm or disinterested enough to allow the formation of any really deep impression of beauty. The anticipation of dinner at Rivebelle made my mood more frivolous still, and my mind, dwelling at such moments upon the surface of the body which I was going to dress up so as to try to appear as pleasing as possible in the feminine eyes which would be scrutinising me in the brilliantly lighted restaurant, was incapable of putting any depth behind the colour of things. And if, beneath my window, the unwearying, gentle flight of sea-martins and swallows had not arisen like a playing fountain, like living fireworks, joining the intervals between their soaring rockets with the motionless white streaming lines of long horizontal wakes of foam, without the charming miracle of this natural and local phenomenon, which brought into touch with reality the scenes that I had before my eyes, I might easily have believed that they were no more than a selection, made afresh every day, of paintings which were shewn quite arbitrarily in the place in which I happened to be and without having any necessary connexion with that place. At one time it was an exhibition of Japanese colour-prints: beside the neat disc of sun, red and round as the moon, a yellow cloud seemed a lake against which black swords were outlined like the trees upon its shore; a bar of a tender pink which I had never seen again after my first paint-box swelled out into a river on either bank of which boats seemed to be waiting high and dry for some one to push them down and set them afloat. And with the contemptuous, bored, frivolous glance of an amateur or a woman hurrying through a picture gallery between two social engagements, I would say to myself: \u201cCurious sunset, this; it\u2019s different from what they usually are but after all I\u2019ve seen them just as fine, just as remarkable as this.\u201d I had more pleasure on evenings when a ship, absorbed and liquefied by the horizon so much the same in colour as herself (an Impressionist exhibition this time) that it seemed to be also of the same matter, appeared as if some one had simply cut out with a pair of scissors her bows and the rigging in which she tapered into a slender filigree from the vaporous blue of the sky. Sometimes the ocean filled almost the whole of my window, when it was enlarged and prolonged by a band of sky edged at the top only by a line that was of the same blue as the sea, so that I supposed it all to be still sea, and the change in colour due only to some effect of light and shade. Another day the sea was painted only in the lower part of the window, all the rest of which was so filled with innumerable clouds, packed one against another in horizontal bands, that its panes seemed to be intended, for some special purpose or to illustrate a special talent of the artist, to present a \u2018Cloud Study,\u2019 while the fronts of the various bookcases shewing similar clouds but in another part of the horizon and differently coloured by the light, appeared to be offering as it were the repetition \u2014 of which certain of our contemporaries are so fond \u2014 of one and the same effect always observed at different hours but able now in the immobility of art to be seen all together in a single room, drawn in pastel and mounted under glass. And sometimes to a sky and sea uniformly grey a rosy touch would be added with an exquisite delicacy, while a little butterfly that had gone to sleep at the foot of the window seemed to be attaching with its wings at the corner of this \u2018Harmony in Grey and Pink\u2019 in the Whistler manner the favourite signature of the Chelsea master. The pink vanished; there was nothing now left to look at. I rose for a moment and before lying down again drew dose the inner curtains. Above them I could see from my bed the ray of light that still remained, growing steadily fainter and thinner, but it was without any feeling of sadness, without any regret for its passing that I thus allowed to die above the curtains the hour at which, as a rule, I was seated at table, for I knew that this day was of another kind than ordinary days, longer, like those arctic days which night interrupts for a few minutes only; I knew that from the chrysalis of the dusk was preparing to emerge, by a radiant metamorphosis, the dazzling light of the Rivebelle restaurant. I said to myself: \u201cIt is time\u201d; I stretched myself on the bed, and rose, and finished dressing; and I found a charm in these idle moments, lightened of every material burden, in which while down below the others were dining I was employing the forces accumulated during the inactivity of this last hour of the day only in drying my washed body, in putting on a dinner jacket, in tying my tie, in making all those gestures which were already dictated by the anticipated pleasure of seeing again some woman whom I had noticed, last time, at Rivebelle, who had seemed to be watching me, had perhaps left the table for a moment only in the hope that I would follow her; it was with joy that I enriched myself with all these attractions so as to give myself, whole, alert, willing, to a new life, free, without cares, in which I would lean my hesitations upon the calm strength of Saint-Loup, and would choose from among the different species of animated nature and the produce of every land those which, composing the unfamiliar dishes that my companion would at once order, might have tempted my appetite or my imagination. And then at the end of the season came the days when I could no longer pass indoors from the \u2018front\u2019 through the dining-room; its windows stood open no more, for it was night now outside and the swarm of poor folk and curious idlers, attracted by the blaze of light which they might not reach, hung in black clusters chilled by the north wind to the luminous sliding walls of that buzzing hive of glass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a knock at my door; it was Aim\u00e9 who had come upstairs in person with the latest lists of visitors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aim\u00e9 could not go away without telling me that Dreyfus was guilty a thousand times over. \u201cIt will all come out,\u201d he assured me, \u201cnot this year, but next. It was a gentleman who\u2019s very thick with the General Staff, told me. I asked him if they wouldn\u2019t decide to bring it all to light at once, before the year is out. He laid down his cigarette,\u201d Aim\u00e9 went on, acting the scene for my benefit, and, shaking his head and his forefinger as his informant had done, as much as to say: \u201cWe mustn\u2019t expect too much!\u201d\u2014\u201d\u2018Not this year, Aim\u00e9,\u2019 those were his very words, putting his hand on my shoulder, \u2018It isn\u2019t possible. But next Easter, yes!\u2019\u201d And Aim\u00e9 tapped me gently on my shoulder, saying, \u201cYou see, I\u2019m letting you have it exactly as he told me,\u201d whether because he was flattered at this act of familiarity by a distinguished person or so that I might better appreciate, with a full knowledge of the facts, the worth of the arguments and our grounds for hope\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not without a slight throb of the heart that on the first page of the list I caught sight of the words \u2018Simonet and family.\u2019 I had in me a store of old dream-memories which dated from my childhood, and in which all the tenderness (tenderness that existed in my heart, but, when my heart felt it, was not distinguishable from anything else) was wafted to me by a person as different as possible from myself. This person, once again I fashioned her, utilising for the purpose the name Simonet and the memory of the harmony that had reigned between the young bodies which I had seen displaying themselves on the beach, in a sportive procession worthy of Greek art or of Giotto. I knew not which of these girls was Mlle. Simonet, if indeed any of them were so named, but I did know that I was loved by Mlle. Simonet and that I was going, with Saint-Loup\u2019s help, to attempt to know her. Unfortunately, having on that condition only obtained an extension of his leave, he was obliged to report for duty every day at Donci\u00e8res: but to make him forsake his military duty I had felt that I might count, more even than on his friendship for myself, on that same curiosity, as a human naturalist, which I myself had so often felt \u2014 even without having seen the person mentioned, and simply on hearing some one say that there was a pretty cashier at a fruiterer\u2019s \u2014 to acquaint myself with a new variety of feminine beauty. But that curiosity I had been wrong in hoping to excite in Saint-Loup by speaking to him of my band of girls. For it had been and would long remain paralysed in him by his love for that actress whose lover he was. And even if he had felt it lightly stirring him he would have repressed it, from an almost superstitious belief that on his own fidelity might depend that of his mistress. And so it was without any promise from him that he would take an active interest in my girls that we started out to dine at Rivebelle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first, when we arrived there, the sun used just to have set, but it was light still; in the garden outside the restaurant, where the lamps had not yet been lighted, the heat of the day fell and settled, as though in a vase along the sides of which the transparent, dusky jelly of the air seemed of such consistency that a tall rose-tree fastened against the dim wall which it streaked with pink veins, looked like the arborescence that one sees at the heart of an onyx. Presently night had always fallen when we left the carriage, often indeed before we started from Balbec if the evening was wet and we had put off sending for the carriage in the hope of the weather\u2019s improving. But on those days it was without any sadness that I listened to the wind howling, I knew that it did not mean the abandonment of my plans, imprisonment in my bedroom; I knew that in the great dining-room of the restaurant, which we would enter to the sound of the music of the gypsy band, the innumerable lamps would triumph easily over darkness and chill, by applying to them their broad cauteries of molten gold, and I jumped light-heartedly after Saint-Loup into the closed carriage which stood waiting for us in the rain. For some time past the words of Bergotte, when he pronounced himself positive that, in spite of all I might say, I had been created to enjoy, pre-eminently, the pleasures of the mind, had restored to me, with regard to what I might succeed in achieving later on, a hope that was disappointed afresh every day by the boredom that I felt on setting myself down before a writing-table to start work on a critical essay or a novel. \u201cAfter all,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cpossibly the pleasure that its author has found in writing it is not the infallible test of the literary value of a page; it may be only an accessory, one that is often to be found superadded to that value, but the want of which can have no prejudicial effect on it. Perhaps some of the greatest masterpieces were written yawning.\u201d My grandmother set my doubts at rest by telling me that I should be able to work and should enjoy working as soon as my health improved. And, our doctor having thought it only prudent to warn me of the grave risks to which my state of health might expose me, and having outlined all the hygienic precaution that I ought to take to avoid any accident \u2014 I subordinated all my pleasures to an object which I judged to be infinitely more important than them, that of becoming strong enough to be able to bring into being the work which I had, possibly, within me; I had been exercising over myself, ever since I had come to Balbec, a scrupulous and constant control. Nothing would have induced me, there, to touch the cup of coffee which would have robbed me of the night\u2019s sleep that was necessary if I was not to be tired next day. But as soon as we reached Rivebelle, immediately, what with the excitement of a new pleasure, and finding myself in that different zone into which the exception to our rule of life takes us after it has cut the thread, patiently spun throughout so many days, that was guiding us towards wisdom \u2014 as though there were never to be any such thing as to-morrow, nor any lofty aims to be realised, vanished all that exact machinery of prudent hygienic measures which had been working to safeguard them. A waiter was offering to take my coat, whereupon Saint-Loup asked: \u201cYou\u2019re sure you won\u2019t be cold? Perhaps you\u2019d better keep it: it\u2019s not very warm in here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no,\u201d I assured him; and perhaps I did not feel the cold; but however that might be, I no longer knew the fear of falling ill, the necessity of not dying, the importance of work. I gave up my coat; we entered the dining-room to the sound of some warlike march played by the gipsies, we advanced between two rows of tables laid for dinner as along an easy path of glory, and, feeling a happy glow imparted to our bodies by the rhythms of the orchestra which rendered us its military honours, gave us this unmerited triumph, we concealed it beneath a grave and frozen mien, beneath a languid, casual gait, so as not to be like those music-hall \u2018mashers\u2019 who, having wedded a ribald verse to a patriotic air, come running on to the stage with the martial countenance of a victorious general\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that moment I was a new man, who was no longer my grandmother\u2019s grandson and would remember her only when it was time to get up and go, but the brother, for the time being, of the waiters who were going to bring us our dinner\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dose of beer \u2014 all the more, that of champagne \u2014 which at Balbec I should not have ventured to take in a week, albeit to my calm and lucid consciousness the flavour of those beverages represented a pleasure clearly appreciable, since it was also one that could easily be sacrificed, I now imbibed at a sitting, adding to it a few drops of port wine, too much distracted to be able to taste it, and I gave the violinist who had just been playing the two louis which I had been saving up for the last month with a view to buying something, I could not remember what. Several of the waiters, set going among the tables, were flying along at full speed, each carrying on his outstretched palms a dish which it seemed to be the object of this kind of race not to let fall. And in fact the chocolate souffl\u00e9s arrived at their destination unspilled, the potatoes \u00e0 l\u2019anglaise, in spite of the pace which ought to have sent them flying, came arranged as at the start round the Pauilhac lamb. I noticed one of these servants, very tall, plumed with superb black locks, his face dyed in a tint that suggested rather certain species of rare birds than a human being, who, running without pause (and, one would have said, without purpose) from one end of the room to the other, made me think of one of those macaws which fill the big aviaries in zoological gardens with their gorgeous colouring and incomprehensible agitation. Presently the spectacle assumed an order, in my eyes at least, growing at once more noble and more calm. All this dizzy activity became fixed in a quiet harmony. I looked at the round tables whose innumerable assemblage filled the restaurant like so many planets as planets are represented in old allegorical pictures. Moreover, there seemed to be some irresistibly attractive force at work among these divers stars, and at each table the diners had eyes only for the tables at which they were not sitting, except perhaps some wealthy amphitryon who, having managed to secure a famous author, was endeavouring to extract from him, thanks to the magic properties of the turning table, a few unimportant remarks at which the ladies marvelled. The harmony of these astral tables did not prevent the incessant revolution of the countless servants who, because instead of being seated like the diners they were on their feet, performed their evolutions in a more exalted sphere. No doubt they were running, one to fetch the hors d\u2019oeuvres, another to change the wine or with clean glasses. But despite these special reasons, their perpetual course among the round tables yielded, after a time, to the observer the law of its dizzy but ordered circulation. Seated behind a bank of flowers, two horrible cashiers, busy with endless calculations, seemed two witches occupied in forecasting by astrological signs the disasters that might from time to time occur in this celestial vault fashioned according to the scientific conceptions of the middle ages\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And I rather pitied all the diners because I felt that for them the round tables were not planets and that they had not cut through the scheme of things one of those sections which deliver us from the bondage of appearances and enable us to perceive analogies. They thought that they were dining with this or that person, that the dinner would cost roughly so much, and that to-morrow they would begin all over again. And they appeared absolutely unmoved by the progress through their midst of a train of young assistants who, having probably at that moment no urgent duty, advanced processionally bearing rolls of bread in baskets. Some of them, the youngest, stunned by the cuffs which the head waiters administered to them as they passed, fixed melancholy eyes upon a distant dream and were consoled only if some visitor from the Balbec hotel in which they had once been employed, recognising them, said a few words to them, telling them in person to take away the champagne which was not fit to drink, an order that filled them with pride\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could hear the twinging of my nerves, in which there was a sense of comfort independent of the external objects that might have produced it, a comfort which the least shifting of my body or of my attention was enough to make me feel, just as to a shut eye a slight pressure gives the sensation of colour. I had already drunk a good deal of port wine, and if I now asked for more it was not so much with a view to the comfort which the additional glasses would bring me as an effect of the comfort produced by the glasses that had gone before. I allowed the music itself to guide to each of its notes my pleasure which, meekly following, rested on each in turn. If, like one of those chemical industries by means of which are prepared in large quantities bodies which in a state of nature come together only by accident and very rarely, this restaurant at Rivebelle united at one and the same moment more women to tempt me with beckoning vistas of happiness than the hazard of walks and drives would have made me encounter in a year; on the other hand, this music that greeted our ears \u2014 arrangements of waltzes, of German operettas, of music-hall songs, all of them quite new to me \u2014 was itself like an ethereal resort of pleasure superimposed upon the other and more intoxicating still. For these tunes, each as individual as a woman, were not keeping, as she would have kept, for some privileged person, the voluptuous secret which they contained: they offered me their secrets, ogled me, came up to me with affected or vulgar movements, accosted me, caressed me as if I had suddenly become more seductive, more powerful and more rich; I indeed found in these tunes an element of cruelty; because any such thing as a disinterested feeling for beauty, a gleam of intelligence was unknown to them; for them physical pleasures alone existed. And they are the most merciless of hells, the most gateless and imprisoning for the jealous wretch to whom they present that pleasure \u2014 that pleasure which the woman he loves is enjoying with another \u2014 as the only thing that exists in the world for her who is all the world to him. But while I was humming softly to myself the notes of this tune, and returning its kiss, the pleasure peculiar to itself which it made me feel became so dear to me that I would have left my father and mother, to follow it through the singular world which it constructed in the invisible, in lines instinct with alternate languor and vivacity. Although such a pleasure as this is not calculated to enhance the value of the person to whom it comes, for it is perceived by him alone, and although whenever, in the course of our life, we have failed to attract a woman who has caught sight of us, she could not tell whether at that moment we possessed this inward and subjective felicity which, consequently, could in no way have altered the judgment that she passed on us, I felt myself more powerful, almost irresistible. It seemed to me that my love was no longer something unattractive, at which people might smile, but had precisely the touching beauty, the seductiveness of this music, itself comparable to a friendly atmosphere in which she whom I loved and I were to meet, suddenly grown intimate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This restaurant was the resort not only of light women; it was frequented also by people in the very best society, who came there for afternoon tea or gave big dinner-parties. The tea-parties were held in a long gallery, glazed and narrow, shaped like a funnel, which led from the entrance hall to the dining-room and was bounded on one side by the garden, from which it was separated (save for a few stone pillars) only by its wall of glass, in which panes would be opened here and there. The result of which, apart from ubiquitous draughts, was sudden and intermittent bursts of sunshine, a dazzling light that made it almost impossible to see the tea-drinkers, so that when they were installed there, at tables crowded pair after pair the whole way along the narrow gully, as they were shot with colours at every movement they made in drinking their tea or in greeting one another, you would have called it a reservoir, a stewpond in which the fisherman has collected all his glittering catch, and the fish, half out of water and bathed in sunlight, dazzle the eye as they mirror an ever-changing iridescence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few hours later, during dinner, which, naturally, was served in the dining-room, the lights would be turned on, although it was still quite light out of doors, so that one saw before one\u2019s eyes, in the garden, among summer-houses glimmering in the twilight, like pale spectres of evening, alleys whose greyish verdure was pierced by the last rays of the setting sun and, from the lamp-lit room in which we were dining, appeared through the glass \u2014 no longer, as one would have said of the ladies who had been drinking tea there in the afternoon, along the blue and gold corridor, caught in a glittering and dripping net \u2014 but like the vegetation of a pale and green aquarium of gigantic size seen by a supernatural light. People began to rise from table; and if each party while their dinner lasted, albeit they spent the whole time examining, recognising, naming the party at the next table, had been held in perfect cohesion about their own, the attractive force that had kept them gravitating round their host of the evening lost its power at the moment when, for coffee, they repaired to the same corridor that had been used for the tea-parties; it often happened that in its passage from place to place some party on the march dropped one or more of its human corpuscles who, having come under the irresistible attraction of the rival party, detached themselves for a moment from their own, in which their places were taken by ladies or gentlemen who had come across to speak to friends before hurrying off with an \u201cI really must fly: I\u2019m dining with M. So-and-So.\u201d And for the moment you would have been reminded, looking at them, of two separate nosegays that had exchanged a few of their flowers. Then the corridor too began to empty. Often, since even after dinner there was still a little light left outside, they left this long corridor unlighted, and, skirted by the trees that overhung it on the other side of the glass, it suggested a pleached alley in a wooded and shady garden. Here and there, in the gloom, a fair diner lingered. As I passed through this corridor one evening on my way out I saw, sitting among a group of strangers, the beautiful Princesse de Luxembourg. I raised my hat without stopping. She remembered me, and bowed her head with a smile; in the air, far above her bowed head, but emanating from the movement, rose melodiously a few words addressed to myself, which must have been a somewhat amplified good-evening, intended not to stop me but simply to complete the gesture, to make it a spoken greeting. But her words remained so indistinct and the sound which was all that I caught was prolonged so sweetly and seemed to me so musical that it seemed as if among the dim branches of the trees a nightingale had begun to sing. If it so happened that, to finish the evening with a party of his friends whom we had met, Saint-Loup decided to go on to the Casino of a neighbouring village, and, taking them with him, put me in a carriage by myself, I would urge the driver to go as fast as he possibly could, so that the minutes might pass less slowly which I must spend without having anyone at hand to dispense me from the obligation myself to provide my sensibility \u2014 reversing the engine, so to speak, and emerging from the passivity in which I was caught and held as in the teeth of a machine \u2014 with those modifications which, since my arrival at Rivebelle, I had been receiving from other people. The risk of collision with a carriage coming the other way along those lanes where there was barely room for one and it was dark as pitch, the insecurity of the soil, crumbling in many places, at the cliff\u2019s edge, the proximity of its vertical drop to the sea, none of these things exerted on me the slight stimulus that would have been required to bring the vision and the fear of danger within the scope of my reasoning. For just as it is not the desire to become famous but the habit of being laborious that enables us to produce a finished work, so it is not the activity of the present moment but wise reflexions from the past that help us to safeguard the future. But if already, before this point, on my arrival at Rivebelle, I had flung irretrievably away from me those crutches of reason and self-control which help our infirmity to follow the right road, if I now found myself the victim of a sort of moral ataxy, the alcohol that I had drunk, by unduly straining my nerves, gave to the minutes as they came a quality, a charm which did not have the result of leaving me more ready, or indeed more resolute to inhibit them, prevent their coming; for while it made me prefer them a thousand times to anything else in my life, my exaltation made me isolate them from everything else; I was confined to the present, as heroes are or drunkards; eclipsed for the moment, my past no longer projected before me that shadow of itself which we call our future; placing the goal of my life no longer in the realisation of the dreams of that past, but in the felicity of the present moment, I could see nothing now of what lay beyond it. So that, by a contradiction which, however, was only apparent, it was at the very moment in which I was tasting an unfamiliar pleasure, feeling that my life might yet be happy, in which it should have become more precious in my sight; it was at this very moment that, delivered from the anxieties which my life had hitherto contrived to suggest to me, I unhesitatingly abandoned it to the chance of an accident. After all, I was doing no more than concentrate in a single evening the carelessness that, for most men, is diluted throughout their whole existence, in which every day they face, unnecessarily, the dangers of a sea-voyage, of a trip in an aeroplane or motor-car, when there is waiting for them at home the creature whose life their death would shatter, or when there is still stored in the fragile receptacle of their brain that book the approaching publication of which is their one object, now, in life. And so too in the Rivebelle restaurant, on evenings when we just stayed there after dinner, if anyone had come in with the intention of killing me, as I no longer saw, save in a distant prospect too remote to have any reality, my grandmother, my life to come, the books that I was going to write, as I clung now, body and mind, wholly to the scent of the lady at the next table, the politeness of the waiters, the outline of the waltz that the band was playing, as I was glued to my immediate sensation, with no extension beyond its limits, nor any object other than not to be separated from it, I should have died in and with that sensation, I should have let myself be strangled without offering any resistance, without a movement, a bee drugged with tobacco smoke that had ceased to take any thought for preserving the accumulation of its labours and the hopes of its hive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ought here to add that this insignificance into which the most serious matters subsided, by contrast with the violence of my exaltation, came in the end to include Mlle. Simonet and her friends. The enterprise of knowing them seemed to me easy now but hardly worth the trouble, for my immediate sensation alone, thanks to its extraordinary intensity, to the joy that its slightest modifications, its mere continuity provoked, had any importance for me; all the rest \u2014 parents, work, pleasures, girls at Balbec weighed with me no more than does a flake of foam in a strong wind that will not let it find a resting place, existed no longer save in relation to this internal power: intoxication makes real for an hour or two a subjective idealism, pure phenomenism; nothing is left now but appearances, nothing exists save as a function of our sublime self. This is not to say that a genuine love, if we have one, cannot survive in such conditions. But we feel so unmistakably, as though in a new atmosphere, that unknown pressures have altered the dimensions of that sentiment that we can no longer consider it in the old way. It is indeed still there and we shall find it, but in a different place, no longer weighing upon us, satisfied by the sensation which the present affords it, a sensation that is sufficient for us, since for what is not actually present we take no thought. Unfortunately the coefficient which thus alters our values alters them only in the hour of intoxication. The people who had lost all their importance, whom we scattered with our breath like soap-bubbles, will to-morrow resume their density; we shall have to try afresh to settle down to work which this evening had ceased to have any significance. A more serious matter still, these mathematics of the morrow, the same as those of yesterday, in whose problems we shall find ourselves inexorably involved, it is they that govern us even in these hours, and we alone are unconscious of their rule. If there should happen to be, near us, a woman, virtuous or inimical, that question so difficult an hour ago \u2014 to know whether we should succeed in finding favour with her \u2014 seems to us now a million times easier of solution without having become easier in any respect, for it is only in our own sight, in our own inward sight, that we have altered. And she is as much annoyed with us at this moment as we shall be next day at the thought of our having given a hundred francs to the messenger, and for the same reason which in our case has merely been delayed in its operation, namely the absence of intoxication\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I knew none of the women who were at Rivebelle and, because they formed a part of my intoxication just as its reflexions form part of a mirror, appeared to me now a thousand times more to be desired than the less and less existent Mlle. Simonet. One of them, young, fair, by herself, with a sad expression on a face framed in a straw hat trimmed with field-flowers, gazed at me for a moment with a dreamy air and struck me as being attractive. Then it was the turn of another, and of a third; finally of a dark one with glowing cheeks. Almost all of them were known, if not to myself, to Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had, in fact, before he made the acquaintance of his present mistress, lived so much in the restricted world of amorous adventure that all the women who would be dining on these evenings at Rivebelle, where many of them had appeared quite by chance, having come to the coast some to join their lovers, others in the hope of finding fresh lovers there, there was scarcely one that he did not know from having spent \u2014 or if not he, one or other of his friends \u2014 at least one night in their company. He did not bow to them if they were with men, and they, albeit they looked more at him than at anyone else, for the indifference which he was known to feel towards every woman who was not his mistress gave him in their eyes an exceptional interest, appeared not to know him. But you could hear them whispering: \u201cThat\u2019s young Saint-Loup. It seems he\u2019s still quite gone on that girl of his. Got it bad, he has. What a dear boy! I think he\u2019s just wonderful; and what style! Some girls do have all the luck, don\u2019t they? And he\u2019s so nice in every way. I saw a lot of him when I was with d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. They were quite inseparable, those two. He was going the pace, that time. But he\u2019s given it all up now, she can\u2019t complain. She\u2019s had a good run of luck, that she can say. And I ask you, what in the world can he see in her? He must be a bit of a chump, when all\u2019s said and done. She\u2019s got feet like boats, whiskers like an American, and her undies are filthy. I can tell you, a little shop girl would be ashamed to be seen in her knickers. Do just look at his eyes a moment; you would jump into the fire for a man like that. Hush, don\u2019t say a word; he\u2019s seen me; look, he\u2019s smiling. Oh, he remembers me all right. Just you mention my name to him, and see what he says!\u201d Between these girls and him I surprised a glance of mutual understanding. I should have liked him to introduce me to them, so that I might ask them for assignations and they give them to me, even if I had been unable to keep them. For otherwise their appearance would remain for all time devoid, in my memory, of that part of itself \u2014 just as though it had been hidden by a veil \u2014 which varies in every woman, which we cannot imagine in any woman until we have actually seen it in her, and which is apparent only in the glance that she directs at us, that acquiesces in our desire and promises that it shall be satisfied. And yet, even when thus reduced, their aspect was for me far more than that of women whom I should have known to be virtuous, and it seemed to me not to be, like theirs, flat, with nothing behind it, fashioned in one piece with no solidity. It was not, of course, for me what it must be for Saint-Loup who, by an act of memory, beneath the indifference, transparent to him, of the motionless features which affected not to know him, or beneath the dull formality of the greeting that might equally well have been addressed to anyone else, could recall, could see, through dishevelled locks, a swooning mouth, a pair of half-closed eyes, a whole silent picture like those that painters, to cheat their visitors\u2019 senses, drape with a decent covering. Undoubtedly, for me who felt that nothing of my personality had penetrated the surface of this woman or that, or would be borne by her upon the unknown ways which she would tread through life, those faces remained sealed. But it was quite enough to know that they did open, for them to seem to me of a price which I should not have set on them had they been but precious medals, instead of lockets within which were hidden memories of love. As for Robert, scarcely able to keep in his place at table, concealing beneath a courtier\u2019s smile his warrior\u2019s thirst for action \u2014 when I examined him I could see how closely the vigorous structure of his triangular face must have been modelled on that of his ancestors\u2019 faces, a face devised rather for an ardent bowman than for a delicate student. Beneath his fine skin the bold construction, the feudal architecture were apparent. His head made one think of those old dungeon keeps on which the disused battlements are still to be seen, although inside they have been converted into libraries\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our way back to Balbec, of those of the fair strangers to whom he had introduced me I would repeat to myself without a moment\u2019s interruption, and yet almost unconsciously: \u201cWhat a delightful woman!\u201d as one chimes in with the refrain of a song. I admit that these words were prompted rather by the state of my nerves than by any lasting judgment. It was nevertheless true that if I had had a thousand francs on me and if there had still been a jeweller\u2019s shop open at that hour, I should have bought the lady a ring. When the successive hours of our life are thus displayed against too widely dissimilar backgrounds, we find that we give away too much of ourselves to all sorts of people who next day will not interest us in the least. But we feel that we are still responsible for what we said to them overnight, and that we must honour our promises\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As on these evenings I came back later than usual to the hotel, it was with joy that I recognised, in a room no longer hostile, the bed on which, on the day of my arrival, I had supposed that it would always be impossible for me to find any rest, whereas now my weary limbs turned to it for support; so that, in turn, thighs, hips, shoulders burrowed into, trying to adhere at every angle to, the sheets that covered its mattress, as if my fatigue, like a sculptor, had wished to take a cast of an entire human body. But I could not go to sleep; I felt the approach of morning; peace of mind, health of body, were no longer mine. In my distress it seemed that never should I recapture them. I should have had to sleep for a long time if I were to overtake them. But then, had I begun to doze, I must in any event be awakened in a couple of hours by the symphonic concert on the beach. Suddenly I was asleep, I had fallen into that deep slumber in which are opened to us a return to childhood, the recapture of past years, of lost feelings, the disincarnation, the transmigration of the soul, the evoking of the dead, the illusions of madness, retrogression towards the most elementary of the natural kingdoms (for we say that we often see animals in our dreams, but we forget almost always that we are ourself then an animal deprived of that reasoning power which projects upon things the light of certainty; we present on the contrary to the spectacle of life only a dubious vision, destroyed afresh every moment by oblivion, the former reality fading before that which follows it as one projection of a magic lantern fades before the next as we change the slide), all those mysteries which we imagine ourselves not to know and into which we are in reality initiated almost every night, as we are into the other great mystery of annihilation and resurrection. Rendered more vagabond by the difficulty of digesting my Rivebelle dinner, the successive and flickering illumination of shadowy zones of my past made of me a being whose supreme happiness would have been that of meeting Legrandin, with whom I had just been talking in my dream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, even my own life was entirely hidden from me by a new setting, like the \u2018drop\u2019 lowered right at the front of the stage before which, while the scene snifters are busy behind, actors appear in a fresh \u2018turn.\u2019 The turn in which I was now cast for a part was in the manner of an Oriental fairy-tale; I retained no knowledge of my past or of myself, on account of the intense proximity of this interpolated scenery; I was merely a person who received the bastinado and underwent various punishments for a crime the nature of which I could not distinguish, though it was actually that of having taken too much port wine. Suddenly I awoke and discovered that, thanks to a long sleep, I had not heard a note of the concert. It was already afternoon; I verified this by my watch after several efforts to sit up in bed, efforts fruitless at first and interrupted by backward falls on to my pillow, but those short falls which are a sequel of sleep as of other forms of intoxication, whether due to wine or to convalescence; besides, before I had so much as looked at the time, I was certain that it was past midday. Last night I had been nothing more than an empty vessel, without weight, and (since I must first have gone to bed to be able to keep still, and have been asleep to be able to keep silent) had been unable to refrain from moving about and talking; I had no longer any stability, any centre of gravity, I was set in motion and it seemed that I might have continued on my dreary course until I reached the moon. But if, while I slept, my eyes had not seen the time, my body had nevertheless contrived to calculate it, had measured the hours; not on a dial superficially marked and figured, but by the steadily growing weight of all my replenished forces which, like, a powerful clockwork, it had allowed, notch by notch, to descend from my brain into the rest of my body in which there had risen now to above my knees the unbroken abundance of their store. If it is true that the sea was once upon a time our native element, into which we must plunge our cooling blood if we are to recover our strength, it is the same with the oblivion, the mental non-existence of sleep; we seem then to absent ourselves for a few hours from Time, but the forces which we have gathered in that interval without expending them, measure it by their quantity as accurately as the pendulum of the clock or the crumbling pyramid of the sandglass. Nor does one emerge more easily from such sleep than from a prolonged spell of wakefulness, so strongly does everything tend to persist; and if it is true that certain narcotics make us sleep, to have slept for any time is an even stronger narcotic, after which we have great difficulty in making ourselves wake up. Like a sailor who sees plainly the harbour in which he can moor his vessel, still tossed by the waves, I had a quite definite idea of looking at the time and of getting up, but my body was at every moment cast back upon the tide of sleep; the landing was difficult, and before I attained a position in which I could reach my watch and confront with its time that indicated by the wealth of accumulated material which my stiffened limbs had at their disposal, I fell back two or three times more upon my pillow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At length I could reach and read it: \u201cTwo o\u2019clock in the afternoon!\u201d I rang; but at once I returned to a slumber which, this time, must have lasted infinitely longer, if I was to judge by the refreshment, the vision of an immense night overpassed, which I found on awakening. And yet as my awakening was caused by the entry of Fran\u00e7oise, and as her entry had been prompted by my ringing the bell, this second sleep which, it seemed to me, must have been longer than the other, and had brought me so much comfort and forgetfulness, could not have lasted for more than half a minute\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother opened the door of my bedroom; I asked her various questions about the Legrandin family\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not enough to say that I had returned to tranquillity and health, for it was more than a mere interval of space that had divided them from me yesterday, I had had all night long to struggle against a contrary tide, and now I not only found myself again in their presence, they had once more entered into me. At certain definite and still somewhat painful points beneath the surface of my empty head which would one day be broken, letting my ideas escape for all time, those ideas had once again taken their proper places and resumed that existence by which hitherto, alas, they had failed to profit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once again I had escaped from the impossibility of sleeping, from the deluge, the shipwreck of my nervous storms. I feared now not at all the menaces that had loomed over me the evening before, when I was dismantled of repose. A new life was opening before me; without making a single movement, for I was still shattered, although quite alert and well, I savoured my weariness with a light heart; it had isolated and broken asunder the bones of my legs and arms, which I could feel assembled before me, ready to cleave together, and which I was to raise to life merely by singing, like the builder in the fable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly I thought of the fair girl with the sad expression whom I had seen at Rivebelle, where she had looked at me for a moment. Many others, in the course of the evening, had seemed to me attractive; now she alone arose from the dark places of my memory. I had felt that she noticed me, had expected one of the waiters to come to me with a whispered message from her. Saint-Loup did not know her and fancied that she was respectable. It would be very difficult to see her, to see her constantly. But I was prepared to make any sacrifice, I thought now only of her. Philosophy distinguishes often between free and necessary acts. Perhaps there is none to the necessity of which we are more completely subjected than that which, by virtue of an ascending power held in check during the act itself, makes so unfailingly (once our mind is at rest) spring up a memory that was levelled with other memories by the distributed pressure of our indiffer-ance, and rush to the surface, because unknown to us it contained, more than any of the others, a charm of which we do not become aware until the following day. And perhaps there is not, either, any act so free, for it is still unprompted by habit, by that sort of mental hallucination which, when we are in love, facilitates the invariable reappearance of the image of one particular person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was the day immediately following that on which I had seen file past me against a background of sea the beautiful procession of young girls. I put questions about them to a number of the visitors in the hotel, people who came almost every year to Balbec. They could tell me nothing. Later on, a photograph shewed me why. Who could ever recognise now in them, scarcely and yet quite definitely beyond an age in which one changes so utterly, that amorphous, delicious mass, still wholly infantine, of little girls who, only a few years back, might have been seen sitting in a ring on the sand round a tent; a sort of white and vague constellation in which one would have distinguished a pair of eyes that sparkled more than the rest, a mischievous face, flaxen hair, only to lose them again and to confound them almost at once in the indistinct and milky nebula\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt, in those earlier years that were still so recent, it was not, as it had been yesterday when they appeared for the first time before me, one\u2019s impression of the group, but the group itself that had been lacking in clearness. Then those children, mere babies, had been still at that elementary stage in their formation when personality has not set its seal on every face. Like those primitive organisms in which the individual barely exists by itself, consists in the reef rather than in the coral insects that compose it, they were still pressed one against another. Sometimes one pushed her neighbour over, and then a wild laugh, which seemed the sole manifestation of their personal life, convulsed them all at once, obliterating, confounding those indefinite, grinning faces in the congealment of a single cluster, scintillating and tremulous. In an old photograph of themselves, which they were one day to give me, and which I have kept ever since, their infantile troop already presents the same number of participants as, later, their feminine procession; one can see from it that their presence must, even then, have made on the beach an unusual mark which forced itself on the attention; but one cannot recognise them individually in it save by a process of reasoning, leaving a clear field to all the transformations possible during girlhood, up to the point at which one reconstructed form would begin to encroach upon another individuality, which must be identified also, and whose handsome face, owing to the accessories of a large build and curly hair, may quite possibly have been, once, that wizened and impish little grin which the photograph album presents to us; and the distance traversed in a short interval of time by the physical characteristics of each of these girls making of them a criterion too vague to be of any use, whereas what they had in common and, so to speak, collectively, had at that early date been strongly marked, it sometimes happened that even their most intimate friends mistook one for another in this photograph, so much so that the question could in the last resort be settled only by some detail of costume which one of them could be certain that she herself, and not any of the others, had worn. Since those days, so different from the day on which I had just seen them strolling along the \u2018front,\u2019 so different and yet so close in time, they still gave way to fits of laughter, as I had observed that afternoon, but to laughter of a kind that was no longer the intermittent and almost automatic laughter of childhood, a spasmodic discharge which, in those days, had continually sent their heads dipping out of the circle, as the clusters of minnows in the Vivonne used to scatter and vanish only to gather again a moment later; each countenance was now mistress of itself, their eyes were fixed on the goal towards which they were marching; and it had taken, yesterday, the indecision and tremulousness of my first impression to make me confuse vaguely (as their childish hilarity and the old photograph had confused) the spores now individualised and disjoined of the pale madrepore\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Repeatedly, I dare say, when pretty girls went by, I had promised myself that I would see them again. As a rule, people do not appear a second time; moreover our memory, which speedily forgets their existence, would find it difficult to recall their appearance; our eyes would not recognise them, perhaps, and in the meantime we have seen new girls go by, whom we shall not see again either. But at other times, and this was what was to happen with the pert little band at Balbec, chance brings them back insistently before our eyes. Chance seems to us then a good and useful thing, for we discern in it as it were rudiments of organisation, of an attempt to arrange our life; and it makes easy to us, inevitable, and sometimes \u2014 after interruptions that have made us hope that we may cease to remember \u2014 cruel, the retention in our minds of images to the possession of which we shall come in time to believe that we were predestined, and which but for chance we should from the very first have managed to forget, like so many others, with so little difficulty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently Saint-Loup\u2019s visit drew to an end. I had not seen that party of girls again on the beach. He was too little at Balbec in the afternoons to have time to bother about them, or to attempt, in my interest, to make their acquaintance. In the evenings he was more free, and continued to take me constantly to Rivebelle. There are, in those restaurants, as there are in public gardens and railway trains, people embodied in a quite ordinary appearance, whose name astonishes us when, having happened to ask it, we discover that this is not the mere inoffensive stranger whom we supposed but nothing less than the Minister or Duke of whom we have so often heard. Two or three times already, in the Rivebelle restaurant, we had \u2014 Saint-Loup and I\u2014 seen come in and sit down at a table when everyone else was getting ready to go, a man of large stature, very muscular, with regular features and a grizzled beard, gazing, with concentrated attention, into the empty air. One evening, on our asking the landlord who was this obscure, solitary and belated diner, \u201cWhat!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cdo you mean to say you don\u2019t know the famous painter Elstir?\u201d Swann had once mentioned his name to me, I had entirely forgotten in what connexion; but the omission of a particular memory, like that of part of a sentence when we are reading, leads sometimes not to uncertainty but to a birth of certainty that is premature. \u201cHe is a friend of Swann, a very well known artist, extremely good,\u201d I told Saint-Loup. Whereupon there passed over us both, like a wave of emotion, the thought that Elstir was a great artist, a celebrated man, and that, confounding us with the rest of the diners, he had no suspicion of the ecstasy into which we were thrown by the idea of his talent. Doubtless, his unconsciousness of our admiration and of our acquaintance with Swann would not have troubled us had we not been at the seaside. But since we were still at an age when enthusiasm cannot keep silence, and had been transported into a life in which not to be known is unendurable, we wrote a letter, signed with both our names, in which we revealed to Elstir in the two diners seated within a few feet of him two passionate admirers of his talent, two friends of his great friend Swann, and asked to be allowed to pay our homage to him in person. A waiter undertook to convey this missive to the celebrity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A celebrity Elstir was, perhaps, not yet at this period quite to the extent claimed by the landlord, though he was to reach the height of his fame within a very few years. But he had been one of the first to frequent this restaurant when it was still only a sort of farmhouse, and had brought to it a whole colony of artists (who had all, as it happened, migrated elsewhere as soon as the farm-yard in which they used to feed in the open air, under a lean-to roof, had become a fashionable centre); Elstir himself had returned to Rivebelle this evening only on account of a temporary absence of his wife, from the house which he had taken in the neighbourhood. But great talent, even when its existence is not yet recognised, will inevitably provoke certain phenomena of admiration, such as the landlord had managed to detect in the questions asked by more than one English lady visitor, athirst for information as to the life led by Elstir, or in the number of letters that he received from abroad. Then the landlord had further remarked that Elstir did not like to be disturbed when he was working, that he would rise in the middle of the night and take a little model down to the water\u2019s edge to pose for him, nude, if the moon was shining; and had told himself that so much labour was not in vain, nor the admiration of the tourists unjustified when he had, in one of Elstir\u2019s pictures, recognised a wooden cross which stood by the roadside as you came into Rivebelle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s all right!\u201d he would repeat with stupefaction, \u201cthere are all the four beams! Oh, he does take a lot of trouble!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he did not know whether a little Sunrise Over the Sea which Elstir had given him might not be worth a fortune\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We watched him read our letter, put it in his pocket, finish his dinner, begin to ask for his things, get up to go; and we were so convinced that we had shocked him by our overture that we would now have hoped (as keenly as at first we had dreaded) to make our escape without his noticing us. We did not bear in mind for a single instant a consideration which should, nevertheless, have seemed to us most important, namely that our enthusiasm for Elstir, on the sincerity of which we should not have allowed the least doubt to be cast, which we could indeed have supported with the evidence of our breathing arrested by expectancy, our desire to do no matter what that was difficult or heroic for the great man, was not, as we imagined it to be, admiration, since neither of us had ever seen anything that he had painted; our feeling might have as its object the hollow idea of a \u2018great artist,\u2019 but not a body of work which was unknown to us. It was, at the most, admiration in the abstract, the nervous envelope, the sentimental structure of an admiration without content, that is to say a thing as indissolubly attached to boyhood as are certain organs which have ceased to exist in the adult man; we were still boys. Elstir meanwhile was reaching the door when suddenly he turned and came towards us. I was transported by a delicious thrill of terror such as I could not have felt a few years later, because, while age diminishes our capacity, familiarity with the world has meanwhile destroyed in us any inclination to provoke such strange encounters, to feel that kind of emotion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the course of the few words that Elstir had come back to say to us, sitting down at our table, he never gave any answer on the several occasions on which I spoke to him of Swann. I began to think that he did not know him. He asked me, nevertheless, to come and see him at his Balbec studio, an invitation which he did not extend to Saint-Loup, and which I had earned (as I might not, perhaps, from Swann\u2019s recommendation, had Elstir been intimate with him, for the part played by disinterested motives is greater than we are inclined to think in people\u2019s lives) by a few words which made him think that I was devoted to the arts. He lavished on me a friendliness which was as far above that of Saint-Loup as that was above the affability of a mere tradesman. Compared with that of a great artist, the friendliness of a great gentleman, charming as it may be, has the effect of an actor\u2019s playing a part, of being feigned. Saint-Loup sought to please; Elstir loved to give, to give himself. Everything that he possessed, ideas, work, and the rest which he counted for far less, he would have given gladly to anyone who could understand him. But, failing society that was endurable, he lived in an isolation, with a savagery which fashionable people called pose and ill-breeding, public authorities a recalcitrant spirit, his neighbours madness, his family selfishness and pride\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And no doubt at first he had thought, even in his solitude, with enjoyment that, thanks to his work, he was addressing, in spite of distance, he was giving a loftier idea of himself, to those who had misunderstood or hurt him. Perhaps, in those days, he lived alone not from indifference but from love of his fellows, and, just as I had renounced Gilberte to appear to her again one day in more attractive colours, dedicated his work to certain people as a way of approaching them again, by which without actually seeing him they would be made to love him, admire him, talk about him; a renunciation is not always complete from the start, when we decide upon it in our original frame of mind and before it has reacted upon us, whether it be the renunciation of an invalid, a monk, an artist or a hero. But if he had wished to produce with certain people in his mind, in producing he had lived for himself, remote from the society to which he had become indifferent; the practice of solitude had given him a love for it, as happens with every big thing which we have begun by fearing, because we knew it to be incompatible with smaller things to which we clung, and of which it does not so much deprive us as it detaches us from them. Before we experience it, our whole preoccupation is to know to what extent we can reconcile it with certain pleasures which cease to be pleasures as soon as we have experienced it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elstir did not stay long talking to us. I made up my mind that I would go to his studio during the next few days, but on the following afternoon, when I had accompanied my grandmother right to the point at which the \u2018front\u2019 ended, near the cliffs of Canapville, on our way back, at the foot of one of the little streets which ran down at right angles to the beach, we came upon a girl who, with lowered head like an animal that is being driven reluctant to its stall, and carrying golf-clubs, was walking in front of a person in authority, in all probability her or her friends\u2019 \u2018Miss,\u2019 who suggested a portrait of Jeffreys by Hogarth, with a face as red as if her favourite beverage were gin rather than tea, on which a dried smear of tobacco at the corner of her mouth prolonged the curve of a moustache that was grizzled but abundant. The girl who preceded her was like that one of the little band who, beneath a black polo-cap, had shewn in an inexpressive chubby face a pair of laughing eyes. Now, the girl who was now passing me had also a black polo-cap, but she struck me as being even prettier than the other, the line of her nose was straighter, the curve of nostril at its base fuller and more fleshy. Besides, the other had seemed a proud, pale girl, this one a child well-disciplined and of rosy complexion. And yet, as she was pushing a bicycle just like the other\u2019s, and was wearing the same reindeer gloves, I concluded that the differences arose perhaps from the angle and circumstances in which I now saw her, for it was hardly likely that there could be at Balbec a second girl, with a face that, when all was said, was so similar and with the same details in her accoutrements. She cast a rapid glance in my direction; for the next few days, when I saw the little band again on the beach, and indeed long afterwards when I knew all the girls who composed it, I could never be absolutely certain that any of them \u2014 even she who among them all was most like her, the girl with the bicycle \u2014 was indeed the one that I had seen that evening at the end of the \u2018front,\u2019 where a street ran down to the beach, a girl who differed hardly at all, but was still just perceptibly different from her whom I had noticed in the procession\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that moment, whereas for the last few days my mind had been occupied chiefly by the tall one, it was the one with the golf-clubs, presumed to be Mlle. Simonet, who began once more to absorb my attention. When walking with the others she would often stop, forcing her friends, who seemed greatly to respect her, to stop also. Thus it is, calling a halt, her eyes sparkling beneath her polo-cap, that I see her again to-day, outlined against the screen which the sea spreads out behind her, and separated from me by a transparent, azure space, the interval of time that has elapsed since then, a first impression, faint and fine in my memory, desired, pursued, then forgotten, then found again, of a face which I have many times since projected upon the cloud of the past to be able to say to myself, of a girl who was actually in my room: \u201cIt is she!\u201d But it was perhaps yet another, the one with geranium cheeks and green eyes, whom I should have liked most to know. And yet, whichever of them it might be, on any given day, that I preferred to see, the others, without her, were sufficient to excite my desire which, concentrated now chiefly on one, now on another, continued \u2014 as, on the first day, my confused vision \u2014 to combine and blend them, to make of them the little world apart, animated by a life in common, which for that matter they doubtless imagined themselves to form; and I should have penetrated, in becoming a friend of one of them \u2014 like a cultivated pagan or a meticulous Christian going among barbarians \u2014 into a rejuvenating society in which reigned health, unconsciousness of others, sensual pleasures, cruelty, unintellectuality and joy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother, who had been told of my meeting with Elstir, and rejoiced at the thought of all the intellectual profit that I might derive from his friendship, considered it absurd and none too polite of me not to have gone yet to pay him a visit. But I could think only of the little band, and being uncertain of the hour at which the girls would be passing along the front, I dared not absent myself. My grandmother was astonished, too, at the smartness of my attire, for I had suddenly remembered suits which had been lying all this time at the bottom of my trunk. I put on a different one every day, and had even written to Paris ordering new hats and neckties\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It adds a great charm to life in a watering-place like Balbec if the face of a pretty girl, a vendor of shells, cakes or flowers, painted in vivid colours in our mind, is regularly, from early morning, the purpose of each of those leisured, luminous days which we spend upon the beach. They become then, and for that reason, albeit unoccupied by any business, as alert as working-days, pointed, magnetised, raised slightly to meet an approaching moment, that in which, while we purchase sand-cakes, roses, ammonites, we will delight in seeing upon a feminine face its colours displayed as purely as on a flower. But at least, with these little traffickers, first of all we can speak to them, which saves us from having to construct with our imagination their aspects other than those with which the mere visual perception of them furnishes us, and to recreate their life, magnifying its charm, as when we stand before a portrait; moreover, just because we speak to them, we can learn where and at what time it will be possible to see them again. Now I had none of these advantages with respect to the little band. Their habits were unknown to me; when on certain days I failed to catch a glimpse of them, not knowing the cause of their absence I sought to discover whether it was something fixed and regular, if they were to be seen only every other day, or in certain states of the weather, or if there were days on which no one ever saw them. I imagined myself already friends with them, and saying: \u201cBut you weren\u2019t there the other day?\u201d \u201cWeren\u2019t we? Oh, no, of course not; that was because it was a Saturday. On Saturdays we don\u2019t ever come, because . . . \u201d If it were only as simple as that, to know that on black Saturday it was useless to torment oneself, that one might range the beach from end to end, sit down outside the pastry-cook\u2019s and pretend to be nibbling an \u00e9clair, poke into the curiosity shop, wait for bathing time, the concert, high tide, sunset, night, all without seeing the longed-for little band. But the fatal day did not, perhaps, come once a week. It did not, perhaps, of necessity fall on Saturdays. Perhaps certain atmospheric conditions influenced it or were entirely unconnected with it. How many observations, patient but not at all serene, must one accumulate of the movements, to all appearance irregular, of those unknown worlds before being able to be sure that one has not allowed oneself to be led astray by mere coincidence, that one\u2019s forecasts will not be proved wrong, before one elucidates the certain laws, acquired at the cost of so much painful experience, of that passionate astronomy. Remembering that I had not yet seen them on some particular day of the week, I assured myself that they would not be coming, that it was useless to wait any longer on the beach. And at that very moment I caught sight of them. And yet on another day which, so far as I could suppose that there were laws that guided the return of those constellations, must, I had calculated, prove an auspicious day, they did not come. But to this primary uncertainty whether I should see them or not that day, there was added another, more disquieting: whether I should ever set eyes on them again, for I had no reason, after all, to know that they were not about to sail for America, or to return to Paris. This was enough to make me begin to love them. One can feel an attraction towards a particular person. But to release that fount of sorrow, that sense of the irreparable, those agonies which prepare the way for love, there must be \u2014 and this is, perhaps, more than any person can be, the actual object which our passion seeks so anxiously to embrace \u2014 the risk of an impossibility. Thus there were acting upon me already those influences which recur in the course of our successive love-affairs, which can, for that matter, be provoked (but then rather in the life of cities) by the thought of little working girls whose half-holiday is we know not on what day, and whom we are afraid of having missed as they came out of the factory; or which at least have recurred in mine. Perhaps they are inseparable from love; perhaps everything that formed a distinctive feature of our first love attaches itself to those that come after, by recollection, suggestion, habit, and through the successive periods of our life gives to its different aspects a general character\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I seized every pretext for going down to the beach at the hours when I hoped to succeed in finding them there. Having caught sight of them once while we were at luncheon, I now invariably came in late for it, waiting interminably upon the \u2018front\u2019 for them to pass; devoting all the short time that I did spend in the dining-room to interrogating with my eyes its azure wall of glass; rising long before the dessert, so as not to miss them should they have gone out at a different hour, and chafing with irritation at my grandmother, when, with unwitting malevolence, she made me stay with her past the hour that seemed to me propitious. I tried to prolong the horizon by setting my chair aslant; if, by chance, I did catch sight of no matter which of the girls, since they all partook of the same special essence, it was as if I had seen projected before my face in a shifting, diabolical hallucination, a little of the unfriendly and yet passionately coveted dream which, but a moment ago, had existed only \u2014 where it lay stagnant for all time \u2014 in my brain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was in love with none of them, loving them all, and yet the possibility of meeting them was in my daily life the sole element of delight, alone made to burgeon in me those high hopes by which every obstacle is surmounted, hopes ending often in fury if I had not seen them. For the moment, these girls eclipsed my grandmother in my affection; the longest journey would at once have seemed attractive to me had it been to a place in which they might be found. It was to them that my thoughts comfortably clung when I supposed myself to be thinking of something else or of nothing. But when, even without knowing it, I thought of them, they, more unconsciously still, were for me the mountainous blue undulations of the sea, a troop seen passing in outline against the waves. Our most intensive love for a person is always the love, really, of something else as well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile my grandmother was shewing, because now I was keenly interested in golf and lawn-tennis and was letting slip an opportunity of seeing at work and hearing talk an artist whom she knew to be one of the greatest of his time, a disapproval which seemed to me to be based on somewhat narrow views. I had guessed long ago in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, and had since established to my own satisfaction, that when we are in love with a woman we simply project into her a state of our own soul, that the important thing is, therefore, not the worth of the woman but the depth of the state; and that the emotions which a young girl of no kind of distinction arouses in us can enable us to bring to the surface of our consciousness some of the most intimate parts of our being, more personal, more remote, more essential than would be reached by the pleasure that we derive from the conversation of a great man or even from the admiring contemplation of his work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was to end by complying with my grandmother\u2019s wishes, all the more reluctantly in that Elstir lived at some distance from the \u2018front\u2019 in one of the newest of Balbec\u2019s avenues. The heat of the day obliged me to take the tramway which passed along the Rue de la Plage, and I made an effort (so as still to believe that I was in the ancient realm of the Cimmerians, in the country it might be, of King Mark, or upon the site of the Forest of Broceliande) not to see the gimcrack splendour of the buildings that extended on either hand, among which Elstir\u2019s villa was perhaps the most sumptuously hideous, in spite of which he had taken it, because, of all that there were to be had at Balbec, it was the only one that provided him with a really big studio\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was also with averted eyes that I crossed the garden, which had a lawn \u2014 in miniature, like any little suburban villa round Paris \u2014 a statuette of an amorous gardener, glass balls in which one saw one\u2019s distorted reflexion, beds of begonias and a little arbour, beneath which rocking chairs were drawn up round an iron table. But after all these preliminaries hallmarked with philistine ugliness, I took no notice of the chocolate mouldings on the plinths once I was in the studio; I felt perfectly happy, for, with the help of all the sketches and studies that surrounded me, I foresaw the possibility of raising myself to a poetical understanding, rich in delights, of many forms which I had not, hitherto, isolated from the general spectacle of reality. And Elstir\u2019s studio appeared to me as the laboratory of a sort of new creation of the world in which, from the chaos that is all the things we see, he had extracted, by painting them on various rectangles of canvas that were hung everywhere about the room, here a wave of the sea crushing angrily on the sand its lilac foam, there a young man in a suit of white linen, leaning upon the rail of a vessel. His jacket and the spattering wave had acquired fresh dignity from the fact that they continued to exist, even although they were deprived of those qualities in which they might be supposed to consist, the wave being no longer able to splash nor the jacket to clothe anyone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the moment at which I entered, the creator was just finishing, with the brush which he had in his hand, the form of the sun at its setting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The shutters were closed almost everywhere round the studio, which was fairly cool and, except in one place where daylight laid against the wall its brilliant but fleeting decoration, dark; there was open only one little rectangular window embowered in honeysuckle, which, over a strip of garden, gave on an avenue; so that the atmosphere of the greater part of the studio was dusky, transparent and compact in the mass, but liquid and sparkling at the rifts where the golden clasp of sunlight banded it, like a lump of rock crystal of which one surface, already cut and polished, here and there, gleams like a mirror with iridescent rays. While Elstir, at my request, went on painting, I wandered about in the half-light, stopping to examine first one picture, then another\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most of those that covered the walls were not what I should chiefly have liked to see of his work, paintings in what an English art journal which lay about on the reading-room table in the Grand Hotel called his first and second manners, the mythological manner and the manner in which he shewed signs of Japanese influence, both admirably exemplified, the article said, in the collection of Mme. de Guermantes. Naturally enough, what he had in his studio were almost all seascapes done here, at Balbec. But I was able to discern from these that the charm of each of them lay in a sort of metamorphosis of the things represented in it, analogous to what in poetry we call metaphor, and that, if God the Father had created things by naming them, it was by taking away their names or giving them other names that Elstir created them anew. The names which denote things correspond invariably to an intellectual notion, alien to our true impressions, and compelling us to eliminate from them everything that is not in keeping with itself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes in my window in the hotel at Balbec, in the morning when Fran\u00e7oise undid the fastenings of the curtains that shut out the light, in the evening when I was waiting until it should be time to go out with Saint-Loup, I had been led by some effect of sunlight to mistake what was only a darker stretch of sea for a distant coastline, or to gaze at a belt of liquid azure without knowing whether it belonged to sea or sky. But presently my reason would re-establish between the elements that distinction which in my first impression I had overlooked. In the same way I used, in Paris, in my bedroom, to hear a dispute, almost a. riot, in the street below, until I had referred back to its cause \u2014 a carriage for instance that was rattling towards me \u2014 this noise, from which I now eliminated the shrill and discordant vociferations which my ear had really heard but which my reason knew that wheels did not produce. But the rare moments in which we see nature as she is, with poetic vision, it was from those that Elstir\u2019s work was taken. One of his metaphors that occurred most commonly in the seascapes which he had round him was precisely that which, comparing land with sea, suppressed every line of demarcation between them. It was this comparison, tacitly and untiringly repeated on a single canvas, which gave it that multiform and powerful unity, the cause (not always clearly perceived by themselves) of the enthusiasm which Elstir\u2019s work aroused in certain collectors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was, for instance, for a metaphor of this sort \u2014 in a picture of the harbour of Carquethuit, a picture which he had finished a few days earlier and at which I now stood gazing my fill \u2014 that Elstir had prepared the mind of the spectator by employing, for the little town, only marine terms, and urban terms for the sea. Whether its houses concealed a part of the harbour, a dry dock, or perhaps the sea itself came cranking in among the land, as constantly happened on the Balbec coast, on the other side of the promontory on which the town was built the roofs were overtopped (as it had been by mill-chimneys or church-steeples) by masts which had the effect of making the vessels to which they belonged appear town-bred, built on land, an impression which was strengthened by the sight of other boats, moored along the jetty but in such serried ranks that you could see men talking across from one deck to another without being able to distinguish the dividing line, the chink of water between them, so that this fishing fleet seemed less to belong to the water than, for instance, the churches of Criquebec which, in the far distance, surrounded by water on every side because you saw them without seeing the town, in a powdery haze of sunlight and crumbling waves, seemed to be emerging from the waters, blown in alabaster or in sea-foam, and, enclosed in the band of a particoloured rainbow, to form an unreal, a mystical picture. On the beach in the foreground the painter had arranged that the eye should discover no fixed boundary, no absolute line of demarcation between earth and ocean. The men who were pushing down their boats into the sea were running as much through the waves as along the sand, which, being wet, reflected their hulls as if they were already in the water. The sea itself did not come up in an even line but followed the irregularities of the shore, which the perspective of the picture increased still further, so that a ship actually at sea, half-hidden by the projecting works of the arsenal, seemed to be sailing across the middle of the town; women who were gathering shrimps among the rocks had the appearance, because they were surrounded by water and because of the depression which, after the ringlike barrier of rocks, brought the beach (on the side nearest the land) down to sea-level, of being in a marine grotto overhung by ships and waves, open yet unharmed in the path of a miraculously averted tide. If the whole picture gave this impression of harbours in which the sea entered into the land, in which the land was already subaqueous and the population amphibian, the strength of the marine element was everywhere apparent; and round about the rocks, at the mouth of the harbour, where the sea was rough, you felt from the muscular efforts of the fishermen and the obliquity of the boats leaning over at an acute angle, compared with the calm erect-ness of the warehouse on the harbour, the church, the houses of the town to which some of the figures were returning while others were coming out to fish, that they were riding bareback on the water, as it might be a swift and fiery animal whose rearing, but for their skill, must have unseated them. A party of holiday makers were putting gaily out to sea in a boat that tossed like a jaunting-car on a rough road; their boatman, blithe but attentive, also, to what he was doing, trimmed the bellying sail, every one kept in his place, so that the weight should not be all on one side of the boat, which might capsize, and so they went racing over sunlit fields into shadowy places, dashing down into the troughs of waves. It was a fine morning in spite of the recent storm. Indeed, one could still feel the powerful activities that must first be neutralized in order to attain the easy balance of the boats that lay motionless, enjoying sunshine and breeze, in parts where the sea was so calm that its reflexions had almost more solidity and reality than the floating hulls, vaporised by an effect of the sunlight, parts which the perspective of the picture dovetailed in among others. Or rather you would not have called them other parts of the sea. For between those parts there was as much difference as there was between one of them and the church rising from the water, or the ships behind the town. Your reason then set to work and made a single element of what was here black beneath a gathering storm, a little farther all of one colour with the sky and as brightly burnished, and elsewhere so bleached by sunshine, haze and foam, so compact, so terrestrial, so circumscribed with houses that you thought of some white stone causeway or of a field of snow, up the surface of which it was quite frightening to see a ship go climbing high and dry, as a carriage climbs dripping from a ford, but which a moment later, when you saw on the raised and broken surface of the solid plain boats drunkenly heaving, you understood, identical in all these different aspects, to be still the sea\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although we are justified in saying that there can be no progress, no discovery in art, but only in the sciences, and that the artist who begins afresh upon his own account an individual effort cannot be either helped or hindered by the efforts of all the others, we must nevertheless admit that, in so far as art brings into prominence certain laws, once an industry has taken those laws and vulgarised them, the art that was first in the field loses, in retrospect, a little of its originality. Since Elstir began to paint, we have grown familiar with what are called \u2018admirable\u2019 photographs of scenery and towns. If we press for a definition of what their admirers mean by the epithet, we shall find that it is generally applied to some unusual picture of a familiar object, a picture different from those that we are accustomed to see, unusual and yet true to nature, and for that reason doubly impressive to us because it startles us, makes us emerge from our habits and at the same time brings us back to ourselves by recalling to us an earlier impression. For instance, one of these \u2018magnificent\u2019 photographs will illustrate a law of perspective, will shew us some cathedral which we are accustomed to see in the middle of a town, taken instead from a selected point of view from which it will appear to be thirty times the height of the houses and to be thrusting a spur out from the bank of the river, from which it is actually a long way off. Now the effort made by Elstir to reproduce things not as he knew them to be but according to the optical illusions of which our first sight of them is composed, had led him exactly to this point; he gave special emphasis to certain of these laws of perspective, which were thus all the more striking, since his art had been their first interpreter. A river, because of the windings of its course, a bay because of the apparent contact of the cliffs on either side of it, would look as though there had been hollowed out in the heart of the plain or of the mountains a lake absolutely landlocked on every side. In a picture of a view from Balbec painted upon a scorching day in summer an inlet of the sea appeared to be enclosed in walls of pink granite, not to be the sea, which began farther out. The continuity of the ocean was suggested only by the gulls which, wheeling over what, when one looked at the picture, seemed to be solid rock, were as a matter of fact inhaling the moist vapour of the shifting tide. Other laws were discernible in the same canvas, as, at the foot of immense cliffs, the lilliputian grace of white sails on the blue mirror on whose surface they looked like butterflies asleep, and certain contrasts between the depth of the shadows and the pallidity of the light. This play of light and shade, which also photography has rendered commonplace, had interested Elstir so much that at one time he had painted what were almost mirages, in which a castle crowned with a tower appeared as a perfect circle of castle prolonged by a tower at its summit, and at its foot by an inverted tower, whether because the exceptional purity of the atmosphere on a fine day gave the shadow reflected in the water the hardness and brightness of the stone, or because the morning mists rendered the stone as vaporous as the shadow. And similarly, beyond the sea, behind a line of woods, began another sea roseate with the light of the setting sun, which was, in fact, the sky. The light, as it were precipitating new solids, thrust back the hull of the boat on which it fell behind the other hull that was still in shadow, and rearranged like the steps of a crystal staircase what was materially a plane surface, but was broken up by the play of light and shade upon the morning sea. A river running beneath the bridges of a town was caught from a certain point of view so that it appeared entirely dislocated, now broadened into a lake, now narrowed into a rivulet, broken elsewhere by the interruption of a hill crowned with trees among which the burgher would repair at evening to taste the refreshing breeze; and the rhythm of this disintegrated town was assured only by the inflexible uprightness of the steeples which did not rise but rather, following the plumb line of the pendulum marking its cadence as in a triumphal march, seemed to hold in suspense beneath them all the confused mass of houses that rose vaguely in the mist along the banks of the crushed, disjointed stream. And (since Elstir\u2019s earliest work belonged to the time in which a painter would make his landscape attractive by inserting a human figure), on the cliff\u2019s edge or among the mountains, the road, that half human part of nature, underwent, like river or ocean, the eclipses of perspective. And whether a sheer wall of mountain, or the mist blown from a torrent, or the sea prevented the eye from following the continuity of the path, visible to the traveller but not to us, the little human personage in old-fashioned attire seemed often to be stopped short on the edge of an abyss, the path which he had been following ending there, while, a thousand feet above him in those pine-forests, it was with a melting eye and comforted heart that we saw reappear the threadlike whiteness of its dusty surface, hospitable to the wayfaring foot, whereas from us the side of the mountain had hidden, where it turned to avoid waterfall or gully, the intervening bends\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The effort made by Elstir to strip himself, when face to face with reality, of every intellectual concept, was all the more admirable in that this man who, before sitting down to paint, made himself deliberately ignorant, forgot, in his honesty of purpose, everything that he knew, since what one knows ceases to exist by itself, had in reality an exceptionally cultivated mind. When I confessed to him the disappointment that I had felt upon seeing the porch at Balbec: \u201cWhat!\u201d he had exclaimed, \u201cyou were disappointed by the porch! Why, it\u2019s the finest illustrated Bible that the people have ever had. That Virgin, and all the bas-reliefs telling the story of her life, they are the most loving, the most inspired expression of that endless poem of adoration and praise in which the middle ages extolled the glory of the Madonna. If you only knew, side by side with the most scrupulous accuracy in rendering the sacred text, what exquisite ideas the old carver had, what profound thoughts, what delicious poetry!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA wonderful idea, that great sheet in which the angels are carrying the body of the Virgin, too sacred for them to venture to touch it with their hands\u201d; (I mentioned to him that this theme had been treated also at Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs; he had seen photographs of the porch there, and agreed, but pointed out that the bustling activity of those little peasant figures, all hurrying at once towards the Virgin, was not the same thing as the gravity of those two great angels, almost Italian, so springing, so gentle) \u201cthe angel who is carrying the Virgin\u2019s soul, to reunite it with her body; in the meeting of the Virgin with Elizabeth, Elizabeth\u2019s gestijre when she touches the Virgin\u2019s Womb and marvels to feel that it is great with child; and the bandaged arm of the midwife who had refused, unless she touched, to believe the Immaculate Conception; and the linen cloth thrown by the Virgin to Saint Thomas to give him a proof of the Resurrection; that veil, too, which the Virgin tears from her own bosom to cover the nakedness of her Son, from Whose Side the Church receives in a chalice the Wine of the Sacrament, while, on His other side the Synagogue, whose kingdom is at an end, has its eyes bandaged, holds a half-broken sceptre and lets fall, with the crown that is slipping from its head, the tables of the old law; and the husband who, on the Day of Judgment, as he helps his young wife to rise from her grave, lays her hand against his own heart to reassure her, to prove to her that it is indeed beating, is that such a trumpery idea, do you think, so stale and commonplace? And the angel who is taking away the sun and the moon, henceforth useless, since it is written that the Light of the Cross shall be seven times brighter than the light of the firmament; and the one who is dipping his hand in the water of the Child\u2019s bath, to see whether it is warm enough; and the one emerging from the clouds to place the crown upon the Virgin\u2019s brow, and all the angels who are leaning from the vault of heaven, between the balusters of the New Jerusalem, and throwing up their arms with terror or joy at the sight of the torments of the wicked or the bliss of the elect! For it is all the circles of heaven, a whole gigantic poem full of theology and symbolism that you have before you there. It is fantastic, mad, divine, a thousand times better than anything you will see in Italy, where for that matter this very tympanum has been carefully copied by sculptors with far less genius. There never was a time when genius was universal; that is all nonsense; it would be going beyond the age of gold. The fellow who carved that front, you may make up your mind that he was every bit as great, that he had just as profound ideas as the men you admire most at the present day. I could shew you what I mean if we went there together. There are certain passages from the Office of the Assumption which have been rendered with a subtilty of expression that Redon himself has never equalled.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This vast celestial vision of which he spoke to me, this gigantic theological poem which, I understood, had been inscribed there in stone, yet when my eyes, big with desire, had opened to gaze upon the front of Balbec church, it was not these things that I had seen. I spoke to him of those great statues of saints, which, mounted on scaffolds, formed a sort of avenue on either side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt starts from the mists of antiquity to end in Jesus Christ,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou see on one side His ancestors after the spirit, on the other the Kings of Judah, His ancestors after the flesh. All the ages are there. And if you had looked more closely at what you took for scaffolds you would have been able to give names to the figures standing on them. At the feet of Moses you would have recognised the calf of gold, at Abraham\u2019s the ram and at Joseph\u2019s the demon counselling Potiphar\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I told him also that I had gone there expecting to find an almost Persian building, and that this had doubtless been one of the chief factors in my disappointment. \u201cIndeed, no,\u201d he assured me, \u201cit is perfectly true. Some parts of it are quite oriental; one of the capitals reproduces so exactly a Persian subject that you cannot account for it by the persistence of Oriental traditions. The carver must have copied some casket brought from the East by explorers.\u201d And he did indeed shew me, later on, the photograph of a capital on which I saw dragons that were almost Chinese devouring one another, but at Balbec this little piece of carving had passed unnoticed by me in the general effect of the building which did not conform to the pattern traced in my mind by the words, \u2018an almost Persian church.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The intellectual pleasures which I enjoyed in this studio did not in the least prevent me from feeling, although they enveloped us as it were in spite of ourselves, the warm polish, the sparkling gloom of the place itself and, through the little window framed in honeysuckle, in the avenue that was quite rustic, the resisting dryness of the sun-parched earth, screened only by the diaphanous gauze woven of distance and of a tree-cast shade. Perhaps the unaccountable feeling of comfort which this summer day was giving me came like a tributary to swell the flood of joy that had surged in me at the sight of Elstir\u2019s Carquethuit Harbour.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had supposed Elstir to be a modest man, but I realised my mistake on seeing his face cloud with melancholy when, in a little speech of thanks, I uttered the word \u2018fame.\u2019 Men who believe that their work will last \u2014 as was the case with Elstir \u2014 form the habit of placing that work in a period when they themselves will have crumbled into dust. And thus, by obliging them to reflect on their own extinction, the thought of fame saddens them because it is inseparable from the thought of death. I changed the conversation in the hope of driving away the cloud of ambitious melancholy with which unwittingly I had loaded Elstir\u2019s brow. \u201cSome one advised me once,\u201d I began, thinking of the conversation we had had with Legrandin at Combray, as to which I was glad of an opportunity of learning Elstir\u2019s views, \u201cnot to visit Brittany, because it would not be wholesome for a mind with a natural tendency to dream.\u201d \u201cNot at all;\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen the mind has a tendency to dream, it is a mistake to keep dreams away from it, to ration its dreams. So long as you distract your mind from its dreams, it will not know them for what they are; you will always be being taken in by the appearance of things, because you will not have grasped their true nature. If a little dreaming is dangerous, the cure for it is not to dream less but to dream more, to dream all the time. One must have a thorough understanding of one\u2019s dreams if one is not to be troubled by them; there is a way of separating one\u2019s dreams from one\u2019s life which so often produces good results that I ask myself whether one ought not, at all costs, to try it, simply as a preventive, just as certain surgeons make out that we ought, to avoid the risk of appendicitis later on, to have all our appendices taken out when we are children.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elstir and I had meanwhile been walking about the studio, and had reached the window that looked across the garden on to a narrow avenue, a side-street that was almost a country lane. We had gone there to breathe the cooler air of the late afternoon. I supposed myself to be nowhere near the girls of the little band, and it was only by sacrificing for once the hope of seeing them that I had yielded to my grandmother\u2019s prayers and had gone to see Elstir. For where the thing is to be found that we are seeking we never know, and often we steadily, for a long time, avoid the place to which, for quite different reasons, everyone has been asking us to go. But we never suspect that we shall there see the very person of whom we are thinking. I looked out vaguely over the country road which, outside the studio, passed quite close to it but did not belong to Elstir. Suddenly there appeared on it, coming along it at a rapid pace, the young bicyclist of the little band, with, over her dark hair, her polo-cap pulled down towards her plump cheeks, her eyes merry and almost importunate; and on that auspicious path, miraculously filled with promise of delights, I saw her beneath the trees throw to Elstir the smiling greeting of a friend, a rainbow that bridged the gulf for me between our terraqueous world and regions which I had hitherto regarded as inaccessible. She even came up to give her hand to the painter, though without stopping, and I could see that she had a tiny beauty spot on her chin. \u201cDo you know that girl, sir?\u201d I asked Elstir, realising that he could if he chose make me known to her, could invite us both to the house. And this peaceful studio with its rural horizon was at once filled with a surfeit of delight such as a child might feel in a house where he was already happily playing when he learned that, in addition, out of that bounteousness which enables lovely things and noble hosts to increase their gifts beyond all measure, there was being prepared for him a sumptuous repast. Elstir told me that she was called Albertine Simonet, and gave me the names also of her friends, whom I described to him with sufficient accuracy for him to identify them almost without hesitation. I had, with regard to their social position, made a mistake, but not the mistake that I usually made at Balbec. I was always ready to take for princes the sons of shopkeepers when they appeared on horseback. This time I had placed in an interloping class the daughters of a set of respectable people, extremely rich, belonging to the world of industry and business. It was the class which, on first thoughts, interested me least, since it held for me neither the mystery of the lower orders nor that of a society such as the Guermantes frequented. And no doubt if an inherent quality, a rank which they could never forfeit, had not been conferred on them, in my dazzled eyes, by the glaring vacuity of the seaside life all round them, I should perhaps not have succeeded in resisting and overcoming the idea that they were the daughters of prosperous merchants. I could not help marvelling to see how the French middle class was a wonderful studio full of sculpture of the noblest and most varied kind. What unimagined types, what richness of invention in the character of their faces, what firmness, what freshness, what simplicity in their features. The shrewd old moneychangers from whose loins these Dianas and these nymphs had sprung seemed to me to have been the greatest of statuaries. Before I had time to register the social metamorphosis of these girls \u2014 so are these discoveries of a mistake, these modifications of the notion one has of a person instantaneous as a chemical combination \u2014 there was already installed behind their faces, so street-arab in type that I had taken them for the mistresses of racing bicyclists, of boxing champions, the idea that they might easily be connected with the family of some lawyer or other whom we knew. I was barely conscious of what was meant by Albertine Simonet; she had certainly no conception of what she was one day to mean to me. Even the name, Simonet, which I had already heard spoken on the beach, if I had been asked to write it down I should have spelt with a double \u2018n,\u2019 never dreaming of the importance which this family attached to there being but one in their name. In proportion as we descend the social scale our snobbishness fastens on to mere nothings which are perhaps no more null than the distinctions observed by the aristocracy, but, being more obscure, more peculiar to the individual, take us more by surprise. Possibly there had been Simonnets who had done badly in business, or something worse still even. The fact remains that the Simonets never failed, it appeared, to be annoyed if anyone doubled their \u2018n.\u2019 They wore the air of being the only Simonets in the world with one \u2018n\u2019 instead of two, and were as proud of it, perhaps, as the Montmorency family were of being the premier barons of France. I asked Elstir whether these girls lived at Balbec; yes, he told me, some of them at any rate. The villa in which one of them lived was at that very spot, right at the end of the beach, where the cliffs of Canapville began. As this girl was a great friend of Albertine Simonet, this was another reason for me to believe that it was indeed the latter whom I had met that day when I was with my grandmother. There were of course so many of those little streets running down to the beach, and all at the same angle, that I could not have pointed out exactly which of them it had been. One would like always to remember a thing accurately, but at the time one\u2019s vision was clouded. And yet that Albertine and the girl whom I had seen going to her friend\u2019s house were one and the same person was a practical certainty. In spite of which, whereas the countless images that have since been furnished me by the dark young golfer, however different they may have been from one another, have overlaid one another (because I now know that they all belong to her), and if I retrace the thread of my memories I can, under cover of that identity, and as though along a tunnelled passage, pass through all those images in turn without losing my consciousness of the same person behind them all, if, on the other hand, I wish to revert to the girl whom I passed that day when I was with my grandmother, I must escape first into freer air. I am convinced that it is Albertine whom I find there, the same girl as her who would often stop dead among her moving comrades, in her walk along the foreground of the sea; but all those more recent images remain separate from that earlier one because I am unable to confer on her retrospectively an identity which she had not for me at the moment in which she caught my eye; whatever assurance I may derive from the law of probabilities, that girl with plump cheeks who stared at me so boldly from the angle of the little street and the beach, and by whom I believe that I might have been loved, I have never, in the strict sense of the words, seen again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My hesitation between the different girls of the little band, all of whom retained something of the collective charm which had at first disturbed me, combined with the reasons already given to allow me later on, even at the time of my greater \u2014 my second \u2014 passion for Albertine, a sort of intermittent and very brief liberty to abstain from loving her. From having strayed among all her friends before it finally concentrated itself on her, my love kept, now and then, between itself and the image of Albertine a certain \u2018play\u2019 of light and shade which enabled it, like a badly fitted lamp, to flit over the surface of each of the others before settling its focus upon her; the connexion between the pain which I felt in my heart and the memory of Albertine did not seem to me necessary; I might perhaps have managed to co-ordinate it with the image of another person, Which enabled me, in a momentary flash, to banish reality altogether, not only external reality, as in my love for Gilberte (which I had recognised to be an internal state in which I drew from myself alone the particular quality, the special character of the person whom I loved, everything that rendered her indispensable to my happiness), but even the other reality, internal and purely subjective\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot a day passes but one or the other of them comes by here, and looks in for a minute or two,\u201d Elstir told me, plunging me in despair when I thought that if I had gone to see him at once, when my grandmother had begged me to do so, I should, in all probability, long since have made Albertine\u2019s acquaintance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had passed on; from the studio she was no longer in sight. I supposed that she had gone to join her friends on the \u2018front.\u2019 Could I have appeared there suddenly with Elstir, I should have got to know them all. I thought of endless pretexts for inducing him to take a turn with me on the beach. I had no longer the same peace of mind as before the apparition of the girl in the frame of the little window; so charming until then in its fringe of honeysuckle, and now so drearily empty. Elstir caused me a joy that was tormenting also when he said that he would go a little way with me, but that he must first finish the piece of work on which he was engaged. It was a flower study but not one of any of the flowers, portraits of which I would rather have commissioned him to paint than the portrait of a person, so that I might learn from the revelation of his genius what I had so often sought in vain from the flowers themselves \u2014 hawthorn white and pink, cornflowers, apple-blossom. Elstir as he worked talked botany to me, but I scarcely listened; he was no longer sufficient in himself, he was now only the necessary intermediary between these girls and me; the distinction which, only a few moments ago, his talent had still given him in my eyes was now worthless save in so far as it might confer a little on me also in the eyes of the little band to whom I should be presented by him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I paced up and down the room, impatient for him to finish what he was doing; I picked up and examined various sketches, any number of which were stacked against the walls. In this way I happened to bring to light a water-colour which evidently belonged to a much earlier period in Elstir\u2019s life, and gave me that particular kind of enchantment which is diffused by works of art not only deliriously executed but representing a subject so singular and so seductive that it is to it that we attribute a great deal of their charm, as if the charm were something that the painter had merely to uncover, to observe, realised already in a material form by nature, and to reproduce in art. That such objects can exist, beautiful quite apart from the painter\u2019s interpretation of them, satisfies a sort of innate materialism in us, against which our reason contends and acts as a counterpoise to the abstractions of aesthetics. It was \u2014 this water-colour \u2014 the portrait of a young woman, by no means beautiful but of a curious type, in a close-fitting mob-cap not unlike a \u2018billy-cock\u2019 hat, trimmed with a ribbon of cherry-coloured silk; in one of her mittened hands was a lighted cigarette, while the other held, level with her knee, a sort of broad-brimmed garden hat, nothing more than a fire screen of plaited straw to keep off the sun. On a table by her side, a tall vase filled with pink carnations. Often (and it was the case here) the singularity of such works is due principally to their having been executed in special conditions for which we do not at first sight make proper allowance, if, for instance, the strange attire of a feminine model is her costume for a masked ball, or conversely the scarlet cloak which an elderly man looks as though he had put on to humour some whim in the painter is his gown as a professor or alderman or his cardinal\u2019s cassock. The ambiguous character of the person whose portrait now confronted me arose, without my understanding it, from the fact that she was a young actress of an earlier generation half dressed for a part. But the cap or hat, beneath which the hair stuck out but was cut short, the velvet coat opening without lapels over a white shirt-front, made me hesitate as to the period of the clothes and the sex of the model, so that I did not know what it was exactly that I was holding before my eyes, unless simply the brightest coloured of these scraps of painting. And the pleasure which it afforded me was disturbed only by the fear that Elstir, by delaying further, would make me miss the girls, for the sun was now declining and hung low in the little window. Nothing in this water-colour was merely stated there as a fact and painted because of its utility to the composition, the costume because the young woman must be wearing something, the vase to hold the flowers. The glass of the vase, cherished for its own sake, seemed to be holding the water in which the stems of the carnations were dipped in something as limpid, almost as liquid as itself; the woman\u2019s dress encompassed her in a manner that had an independent, a brotherly charm, and, if the works of man can compete in charm with the wonders of nature, as delicate, as pleasing to the touch of the eye, as freshly painted as the fur of a cat, the petals of a flower, the feathers of a dove. The whiteness of the shirt-front, fine as driven rain, with its gay pleats gathered into little bells like lilies of the valley, was starred with bright gleams of light from the room, as sharply edged and as finely shaded as though they had been posies of flowers stitched on the woven lawn. And the velvet of the coat, brilliant with a milky sheen, had here and there a roughness, a scoring, a shagginess on its surface which made one think of the crumpled brightness of the carnations in the vase. But above all one felt that Elstir, sublimely indifferent to whatever immoral suggestion there might be in this disguise of a young actress for whom the talent with which she would play her part on the stage was doubtless of less importance than the irritant attraction which she would offer to the jaded or depraved senses of some of her audience, had on the contrary fastened upon those ambiguous points as on an aesthetic element which deserved to be brought into prominence, and which he had done everything in his power to emphasise. Along the lines of the face, the latent sex seemed to be on the point of confessing itself to be that of a somewhat boyish girl, then vanished and farther on reappeared with a suggestion rather of an effeminate youth, vicious and pensive, then fled once more to remain uncapturable. The dreamy sadness in the expression of her eyes, by the mere fact of its contrast with the accessories belonging to the world of love-making and play-acting, was not the least disturbing element in the picture. One imagined moreover that it must be feigned, and that the young person who seemed ready to submit to caresses in this provoking costume had probably thought it effective to enhance the provocation with this romantic expression of a secret longing, an unspoken grief. At the foot of the picture was inscribed \u201cMiss Sacripant: October, 1872.\u201d I could not contain my admiration. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing, only a rough sketch I did when I was young; it was a costume for a variety show. It\u2019s all ages ago now.\u201d \u201cAnd what has become of the model?\u201d A bewilderment provoked by my words preceded on Elstir\u2019s face the indifferent, absent-minded air which, a moment later, he displayed there. \u201cQuick, give it to me!\u201d he cried, \u201cI hear Madame Elstir coming, and, though, I assure you, the young person in the billy-cock hat never played any part in my life, still there\u2019s no point in my wife\u2019s coming in and finding it staring her in the face. I have kept it only as an amusing sidelight on the theatre of those days.\u201d And, before putting it away behind the pile, Elstir, who perhaps had not set eyes on the sketch for years, gave it his careful scrutiny. \u201cI must keep just the head,\u201d he murmured, \u201cthe lower part is really too shockingly bad, the hands are a beginner\u2019s work.\u201d I was miserable at the arrival of Mme. Elstir, who could only delay us still further. The window sill was already aglow. Our excursion would be a pure waste of time. There was no longer the slightest chance of our seeing the girls, consequently it mattered now not at all how soon Mme. Elstir left us or how long she stayed. Not that she did stay for any length of time. I found her most tedious; she might have been beautiful, once, at twenty, driving an ox in the Roman Campagna, but her dark hair was streaked with grey and she was common without being simple, because she believed that a pompous manner and majestic attitudes were required by her statuesque beauty, which, however, advancing age had robbed of all its charm. She was dressed with the utmost simplicity. And it was touching, but at the same time surprising to hear Elstir, whenever he opened his mouth, and with a respectful gentleness, as if merely uttering the words moved him to tenderness and veneration, repeat: \u201cMy beautiful Gabrielle!\u201d Later on, when I had become familiar with Elstir\u2019s mythological paintings, Mme. Elstir acquired beauty in my eyes also. I understood then that to a certain ideal type illustrated by certain lines, certain arabesques which reappeared incessantly throughout his work, to a certain canon of art he had attributed a character that was almost divine, since the whole of his time, all the mental effort of which he was capable, in a word his whole life he had consecrated to the task of distinguishing those lines as clearly and of reproducing them as faithfully as possible. What such an ideal inspired in Elstir was indeed a cult so solemn, so exacting that it never allowed him to be satisfied with what he had achieved; was the most intimate part of himself, and so he had never been able to look at it from a detached standpoint, to extract emotion from it, until the day on which he encountered it realised outside, apart from himself, in the body of a woman, the body of her who in due course became Mme. Elstir and in whom he had been able (as one is able only with something that is not oneself) to find it meritorious, moving, god-like. How comforting, moreover, to let his lips rest upon that Beauty which hitherto he had been obliged with so great labour to extract from ^ within himself, whereas now, mysteriously incarnate, it offered itself to him in a series of communions, filled with saving grace. Elstir at this period was no longer in that early youth in which we look only to the power of our own mind for the realisation of our ideal. He was nearing the age at which we count on bodily satisfactions to stimulate the forces of the brain, at which the exhaustion of the brain inclining us to materialism and the diminution of our activity to the possibility of influences passively received, begin to make us admit that there may indeed be certain bodies, certain callings, certain rhythms that are privileged, realising so naturally our ideal that even without genius, merely by copying the movement of a shoulder, the tension of a throat, we can achieve a masterpiece, it is the age at which we like to caress Beauty with our eyes objectively, outside ourselves, to have it near us, in a tapestry, in a lovely sketch by Titian picked up in a second-hand shop, in a mistress as lovely as Titian\u2019s sketch. When I understood this I could no longer look without pleasure at Mme. Elstir, and her body began to lose its heaviness, for I filled it with an idea, the idea that she was an immaterial creature, a portrait by Elstir. She was one for me, and for him also I dare say. The facts of life have no meaning for the artist, they are to him merely an opportunity for exposing the naked blaze of his genius. One feels unmistakably, when one sees side by side ten portraits of different people painted by Elstir, that they are all, first and foremost, Elstirs. Only, after this rising tide of genius, which sweeps over and submerges a man\u2019s life, when the brain begins to tire, gradually the balance is upset and, like a river that resumes its course after the counter-flow of a spring tide, it is life that once more takes the upper hand. While the first period lasted, the artist has gradually evolved the law, the formula of his unconscious gift. He knows what situations, should he be a novelist \u2014 if a painter, what scenes \u2014 furnish him with the subject matter, which may be anything in the world but, whatever it is, is essential to his researches as a laboratory might be of a workshop. He knows that he has created his masterpieces out of effects of attenuated light, the action of remorse upon consciousness of guilt, out of women posed beneath trees or half-immersed in water, like statues. A day will come when, owing to the exhaustion of his brain, he will no longer have the strength, when provided with those materials which his genius was won't to use, to make the intellectual effort which alone can produce his work, and will yet continue to seek them out, happy when he finds himself in their presence, because of the spiritual pleasure, the allurement to work that they arouse in him; and, surrounding them besides with a kind of hedge of superstition as if they were superior to all things else, as if in them already dwelt a great part of the work of art which they might be said to carry within them ready made, he will confine himself to the company, to the adoration of his models. He will hold endless conversations with the repentant criminals whose remorse, whose regeneration formed, when he still wrote, the subject of his novels; he will buy a country house in a district where mists attenuate the light, he will spend long hours gazing at the limbs of bathing women; will collect sumptuous stuffs. And thus the beauty of life, a phase that has to some extent lost its meaning, a stage beyond the boundaries of art at which I had already seen Swann come to rest, was that also which, by a slackening of the creative ardour, idolatry of the forms which had inspired it, desire to avoid effort, must ultimately arrest an Elstir\u2019s progress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At last he had applied the final brush-stroke to his flowers; I sacrificed a minute to look at them; I acquired no merit by the act, for I knew that there was no chance now of our finding the girls on the beach; and yet, had I believed them to be still there, and that these wasted moments would make me miss them, I should have stopped to look none the less, for I should have told myself that Elstir was more interested in his flowers than in my meeting with the girls. My grandmother\u2019s nature, a nature that was the exact counterpart of my complete egoism, was nevertheless reflected in certain aspects of my own. In circumstances in which someone to whom I was indifferent, for whom I had always made a show of affection or respect, ran the risk merely of some unpleasantness whereas I was in real danger, I could not have done otherwise than commiserate with him on his annoyance as though it had been something important, and treat my own danger as nothing, because I would feel that these were the proportions in which he must see things. To be quite accurate, I would go even further, and not only not complain of the danger in which I myself stood but go half-way to meet it, and with that which involved other people try, on the contrary, were I to increase the risk of my being caught myself, to avert it from them. The reasons for this are several, none of which does me the slightest credit. One is that if, while only my reason was employed, I have always believed in self-preservation, whenever in the course of my existence I have found myself obsessed by moral anxieties, or merely by nervous scruples, so puerile often that I dare not enumerate them here, if an unforeseen circumstance then arose, involving for me the risk of being killed, this new preoccupation was so trivial in comparison with the others that I welcomed it with a sense of relief, almost of hilarity. Thus I find myself, albeit the least courageous of men, to have known that feeling which has always seemed to me, in my reasoning moods, so foreign to my nature, so inconceivable, the intoxication of danger. But even although I were, when any, even a deadly peril threatened me, passing through an entirely calm and happy phase, I could not, were I with another person, refrain from sheltering him behind me and choosing for myself the post of danger. When a sufficient store of experience had taught me that I invariably acted, and enjoyed acting, thus, I discovered \u2014 and was deeply ashamed by the discovery \u2014 that it was because, in contradiction of what I had always believed and asserted, I was extremely sensitive to the opinions of others. Not that this kind of unconfessed self-esteem is in any sense vanity or conceit. For what might satisfy one or other of those failings would give me no pleasure, and I have always refrained from indulging them. But with the people in whose company I have succeeded in concealing most effectively the slight advantages a knowledge of which might have given them a less derogatory idea of myself, I have never been able to deny myself the pleasure of shewing them that I take more trouble to avert the risk of death from their path than from my own. As my motive is then self-esteem and not valour, I find it quite natural that in any crisis they should act differently. I am far from blaming them for it, as I should perhaps if I had been moved by a sense of duty, a duty which would seem to me, in that case, to be as incumbent upon them as upon myself. On the contrary, I feel that it is eminently sensible of them to safeguard their lives, though at the same time I cannot prevent my own safety from receding into the background, which is particularly silly and culpable of me since I have come to realise that the lives of many of the people in front of whom I plant myself when a bomb bursts are more valueless even than my own. However, on the day of this first visit to Elstir, the time was still distant at which I was to become conscious of this difference in value, and there was no question of danger, but simply \u2014 a harbinger this of that pernicious self-esteem \u2014 the question of my not appearing to attach to the pleasure which I so ardently desired more importance than to the work which the painter had still to finish. It was finished at last. And, once we were out of doors, I discovered that \u2014 so long were the days still at this season \u2014 it was not so late as I had supposed; we strolled down to the \u2018front.\u2019 What stratagems I employed to keep Elstir standing at the spot where I thought that the girls might still come past. Pointing to the cliffs that towered beside us, I kept on asking him to tell me about them, so as to make him forget the time and stay there a little longer. I felt that we had a better chance of waylaying the little band if we moved towards the end of the beach. \u201cI should like to look at those cliffs with you from a little nearer,\u201d I said to him, having noticed that one of the girls was in the habit of going in that direction. \u201cAnd as we go, do tell me about Carquethuit. I should so like to see Carquethuit,\u201d I went on, without thinking that the so novel character which manifested itself with such force m Elstir\u2019sCarquethuit Harbour, might belong perhaps rather to the painter\u2019s vision than to any special quality in the place itself. \u201cSince I\u2019ve seen your picture, I think that is where I should most like to go, there and to the Pointe du Raz, but of course that would be quite a journey from here.\u201d \u201cYes, and besides, even if it weren\u2019t nearer, I should advise you perhaps all the same to visit Carquethuit,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe Pointe du Raz is magnificent, but after all it is simply the high cliff of Normandy or Brittany which you know already. Carquethuit is quite different, with those rocks bursting from a level shore. I know nothing in France like it, it reminds me rather of what one sees in some parts of Florida. It is most interesting, and for that matter extremely wild too. It is between Clitourps and Nehomme; you know how desolate those parts are; the sweep of the coast-line is delicious. Here, the coast-line is like anywhere else; but along there I can\u2019t tell you what charm it has, what softness.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Night was falling; it was time to be turning homewards; I was escorting Elstir in the direction of his villa when suddenly, as it were Mephistopheles springing up before Faust, there appeared at the end of the avenue \u2014 like simply an objectification, unreal, diabolical, of the temperament diametrically opposed to my own, of the semi-barbarous and cruel vitality of which I, in my weakness, my excess of tortured sensibility and intellectuality was so destitute \u2014 a few spots of the essence impossible to mistake for anything else in the world, a few spores of the zoophytic band of girls, who wore an air of not having seen me but were unquestionably, for all that, proceeding as they advanced to pass judgment on me in their ironic vein. Feeling that a collision between them and us was now inevitable, and that Elstir would be certain to call me, I turned my back, like a bather preparing to meet the shock of a wave; I stopped dead and, leaving my eminent companion to pursue his way, remained where I was, stooping, as if I had suddenly become engrossed in it, towards the window of the curiosity shop which we happened to be passing at the moment. I was not sorry to give the appearance of being able to think of something other than these girls, and I was already dimly aware that when Elstir did call me up to introduce me to them I should wear that sort of challenging expression which betokens not surprise but the wish to appear as though one were surprised \u2014 so far is every one of us a bad actor, or everyone else a good thought-reader; \u2014 that I should even go so far as to point a finger to my breast, as who should ask \u201cIt is me, really, that you want?\u201d and then run to join him, my head lowered in compliance and docility and my face coldly masking my annoyance at being torn from the study of old pottery in order to be introduced to people whom I had no wish to know. Meanwhile I explored the window and waited for the moment in which my name, shouted by Elstir, would come to strike me like an expected and innocuous bullet. The certainty of being introduced to these girls had had the result of making me not only feign complete indifference to them, but actually to feel it. Inevitable from this point, the pleasure of knowing them began at once to shrink, became less to me than the pleasure of talking to Saint-Loup, of dining with my grandmother, of making, in the neighbourhood of Balbec, excursions which I would regret the probability, in consequence of my having to associate with people who could scarcely be much interested in old buildings, of my being forced to abandon. Moreover, what diminished the pleasure which I was about to feel was not merely the imminence but the incoherence of its realisation. Laws as precise as those of hydrostatics maintain the relative position of the images which we form in a fixed order, which the coming event at once upsets. Elstir was just about to call me. This was not at all the fashion in which I had so often, on the beach, in my bedroom, imagined myself making these girls\u2019 acquaintance. What was about to happen was a different event, for which I was not prepared. I recognised neither my desire nor its object; I regretted almost that I had come out with Elstir. But, above all, the shrinking of the pleasure that I expected to feel was due to the certainty that nothing, now, could take that pleasure from me. And it resumed, as though by some latent elasticity in itself, its whole extent when it ceased to be subjected to the pressure of that certainty, at the moment when, having decided to turn my head, I saw Elstir, standing where he had stopped a few feet away with the girls, bidding them good-bye. The face of the girl who stood nearest to him, round and plump and glittering with the light in her eyes, reminded me of a cake on the top of which a place has been kept for a morsel of blue sky. Her eyes, even when fixed on an object, gave one the impression of motion, just as on days of high wind the air, although invisible, lets us perceive the speed with which it courses between us and the unchanging azure. For a moment her gaze intersected mine, like those travelling skies on stormy days which hurry after a rain-cloud that moves less rapidly than they, overtake, touch, cover, pass it and are gone; but they do not know one another, and are soon driven far apart. So our eyes were for a moment confronted, neither pair knowing what the celestial continent that lay before their gaze held of future blessing or disaster. Only at the moment when her gaze was directly coincident with mine, without slackening its movement it grew perceptibly duller. So on a starry night the wind-swept moon passes behind a cloud and veils her brightness for a moment, but soon will shine again. But Elstir had already said goodbye to the girls, and had never summoned me. They disappeared down a cross street; he came towards me. My whole plan was spoiled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have said that Albertine had not seemed to me that day to be the same as on previous days and that afterwards, each time I saw her, she was to appear different. But I felt at that moment that certain modifications in the appearance, the importance, the stature of a person may also be due to the variability of certain states of consciousness interposed between that person and us. One of those that play an important part in such transformations is belief; that evening my belief, then the vanishing of my belief, that I was about to know Albertine had, with a few seconds\u2019 interval only, rendered her almost insignificant, then infinitely precious in my sight; some years later, the belief, then the disappearance of the belief, that Albertine was faithful to me brought about similar changes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, long ago, at Combfay, I had seen shrink or stretch, according to the time of day, according as I was entering one or the other of the two dominant moods that governed my sensibility in turn, my grief at not having my mother with me, as imperceptible all afternoon as is the moon\u2019s light when the sun is shining, and then, when night had come, reigning alone in my anxious heart in the place of recent memories now obliterated. But on that day at Balbec, when I saw that Elstir was leaving the girls and had not called me, I learned for the first time that the variations in the importance which a pleasure or a pain has in our eyes may depend not merely on this alternation of two moods, but on the displacement of invisible beliefs, such, for example, as make death seem to us of no account because they bathe it in a glow of unreality, and thus enable us to attach importance to our attending an evening party, which would lose much of its charm for if, on the announcement that we were sentenced to die by the guillotine, the belief that had bathed the party in its warm glow was instantly shattered; and this part that belief plays, it is true that something in me was aware of it; this was my will; but its knowledge is vain if the mind, the heart continue in ignorance; these last act in good faith when they believe that we are anxious to forsake a mistress to whom our will alone knows that we are still attached. This is because they are clouded by the belief that we shall see her again at any moment. But let this belief be shattered, let them suddenly become aware that this mistress is gone from us for ever, then the mind and heart, having lost their focus, are driven like mad things, the meanest pleasure becomes infinitely great\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Variance of a belief, annulment also of love, which, pre-existent and mobile, comes to rest at the image of any one woman simply because that woman will be almost impossible of attainment. Thenceforward we think not so much of the woman of whom we find difficult in forming an exact picture, as of the means of getting to know her. A whole series of agonies develops and is sufficient to fix our love definitely upon her who is its almost unknown object. Our love becomes immense; we never dream how small a place in it the real woman occupies. And if suddenly, as at the moment when I had seen Elstir stop to talk to the girls, we cease to be uneasy, to suffer pain, since it is this pain that is the whole of our love, it seems to us as though love had abruptly vanished at the moment when at length we grasp the prey to whose value we had not given enough thought before. What did I know of Albertine? One or two glimpses of a profile against the sea, less beautiful, assuredly, than those of Veronese\u2019s women whom I ought, had I been guided by purely aesthetic reasons, to have preferred to her. By what other reasons could I be guided, since, my anxiety having subsided, I could recapture only those mute profiles; I possessed nothing of her besides. Since my first sight of Albertine I had meditated upon her daily, a thousandfold, I had carried on with what I called by her name an interminable unspoken dialogue in which I made her question me, answer me, think and act, and in the infinite series of imaginary Albertines who followed one after the other in my fancy, hour after hour, the real Albertine, a glimpse caught on the beach, figured only at the head, just as the actress who creates a part, the star, appears, out of a long series of performances, in the few first alone. That Albertine was scarcely more than a silhouette, all that was superimposed being of my own growth, so far when we are in love does the contribution that we ourself make outweigh \u2014 even if we consider quantity only \u2014 those that come to us from the beloved object. And the same is true of love that is given its full effect. There are loves that manage not only to be formed but to subsist around a very little core \u2014 even among those whose prayer has been answered after the flesh. An old drawing-master who had taught my grandmother had been presented by some obscure mistress with a daughter. The mother died shortly after the birth of her child, and the drawing-master was so broken-hearted that he did not long survive her. In the last months of his life my grandmother and some of the Combray ladies, who had never liked to make any allusion in the drawing-master\u2019s presence to the woman, with whom, for that matter, he had not officially \u2018lived\u2019 and had had comparatively slight relations, took it into their heads to ensure the little girl\u2019s future by combining to purchase an annuity for her. It was my grandmother who suggested this; several of her friends made difficulties; after all was the child really such a very interesting case, was she even the child of her reputed father; with women like that, it was never safe to say. Finally, everything was settled. The child came to thank the ladies. She was plain, and so absurdly like the old drawing-master as to remove every shadow of doubt; her hair being the only nice thing about her, one of the ladies said to her father, who had come with her: \u201cWhat pretty hair she has.\u201d And thinking that now, the woman who had sinned being dead and the old man only half alive, a discreet allusion to that past of which they had always pretended to know nothing could do no harm, my grandmother added: \u201cIt runs in families. Did her mother have pretty hair like that?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d was the old man\u2019s quaint answer. \u201cI never saw her except with a hat on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I must not keep Elstir waiting. I caught sight of myself in a glass. To add to the disaster of my not having been introduced to the girls, I noticed that my necktie was all crooked, my hat left long wisps of hair shewing, which did not become me; but it was a piece of luck, all the same, that they should have seen me, even thus attired, in Elstir\u2019s company and so could not forget me; also that I should have put on, that morning, at my grandmother\u2019s suggestion, my smart waistcoat, when I might so easily have been wearing one that was simply hideous, and be carrying my best stick. For while an event for which we are longing never happens quite in the way we have been expecting, failing the advantages on which we supposed that we might count, others present themselves for which we never hoped, and make up for our disappointment; and we have been so dreading the worst that in the end we are inclined to feel that, taking one thing with another, chance has, on the whole, been rather kind to us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI did so much want to know them,\u201d I said as I reached Elstir. \u201cThen why did you stand a mile away?\u201d These were his actual words, not that they expressed what was in his mind, since, if his desire had been to grant mine, to call me up to him would have been quite easy, but perhaps because he had heard phrases of this sort, in familiar use among common people when they are in the wrong, and because even great men are in certain respects much the same as common people, take their everyday excuses from the same common stock just as they get their daily bread from the same baker; or it may be that such expressions (which ought, one might almost say, to be read \u2018backwards,\u2019 since their literal interpretation is the opposite of the truth) are the instantaneous effect, the negative exposure of a reflex action. \u201cThey were in a hurry.\u201d It struck me that of course they must have stopped him from summoning a person who did not greatly attract them; otherwise he would not have failed, after all the questions that I had put to him about them, and the interest which he must have seen that I took in them, to call me. \u201cWe were speaking just now of Carquethuit,\u201d he began, as we walked towards his villa. \u201cI have done a little sketch, in which you can see much better how the beach curves. The painting is not bad, but it is different. If you will allow me, just to cement our friendship, I would like to give you the sketch,\u201d he went on, for the people who refuse us the objects of our desire are always ready to offer us something else\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should very much like, if you have such a thing, a photograph of the little picture of Miss Sacripant. \u2018Sacripant\u2019\u2014 that\u2019s not a real name, surely?\u201d \u201cIt is the name of a character the sitter played in a stupid little musical comedy.\u201d \u201cBut, I assure you, sir, I have never set eyes on her; you look as though you thought that I knew her.\u201d Elstir was silent. \u201cIt isn\u2019t Mme. Swann, before she was married?\u201d I hazarded, in one of those sudden fortuitous stumblings upon the truth, which are rare enough in all conscience, and yet give, in the long run, a certain cumulative support to the theory of presentiments, provided that one takes care to forget all the wrong guesses that would invalidate it. Elstir did not reply. The portrait was indeed that of Odette de Cr\u00e9cy. She had preferred not to keep it for many reasons, some of them obvious. But there were others less apparent. The portrait dated from before the point at which Odette, disciplining her features, had made of her face and figure that creation the broad outlines of which her hairdressers, her dressmakers, she herself \u2014 in her way of standing, of speaking, of smiling, of moving her hands, her eyes, of thinking \u2014 were to respect throughout the years to come. It required the vitiated tastes of a surfeited lover to make Swann prefer to all the countless photographs of the \u2018sealed pattern\u2019 Odette which was his charming wife the little photographs which he kept in his room and in which, beneath a straw hat trimmed with pansies, you saw a thin young woman, not even good-looking, with bunched-out hair and drawn features\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But apart from this, had the portrait been not anterior like Swann\u2019s favourite photograph, to the syst\u00e9matisation of Odette\u2019s features in a fresh type, majestic and charming, but subsequent to it, Elstir\u2019s vision would alone have sufficed to disorganise that type. Artistic genius in its reactions is like those extremely high temperatures which have the power to disintegrate combinations of atoms which they proceed to combine afresh in a diametrically opposite order, following another type. All that artificially harmonious whole into which a woman has succeeded in bringing her limbs and features, the persistence of which every day, before going out, she studies in her glass, changing the angle of her hat, smoothing her hair, exercising the sprightliness in her eyes, so as to ensure its continuity, that harmony the keen eye of the great painter instantly destroys, substituting for it a rearrangement of the woman\u2019s features such as will satisfy a certain pictorial ideal of femininity which he carries in his head. Similarly it often happens that, after a certain age, the eye of a great seeker after truth will find everywhere the elements necessary to establish those relations which alone are of interest to him. Like those craftsmen, those players who, instead of making a fuss and asking for what they cannot have, content themselves with the instrument that comes to their hand, the artist might say of anything, no matter what, that it would serve his purpose. Thus a cousin of the Princesse de Luxembourg, a beauty of the most queenly type, having succumbed to a form of art which was new at that time, had asked the leading painter of the naturalist school to do her portrait. At once the artist\u2019s eye had found what he sought everywhere in life. And on his canvas there appeared, in place of the proud lady, a street-boy, and behind him a vast, sloping, purple background which made one think of the Place Pigalle. But even without going so far as that, not only will the portrait of a woman by a great artist not seek in the least to give satisfaction to various demands on the woman\u2019s part \u2014 such as for instance, when she begins to age, make her have herself photographed in dresses that are almost those of a young girl, which bring out her still youthful figure and make her appear like the sister, or even the daughter of her own daughter, who, if need be, is tricked out for the occasion as a \u2018perfect fright\u2019 by her side \u2014 it will, on the contrary, emphasise those very drawbacks which she seeks to hide, and which (as for instance a feverish, that is to say a livid complexion) are all the more tempting to him since they give his picture \u2018character\u2019; they are quite enough, however, to destroy all the illusions of the ordinary man who, when he sees the picture, sees crumble into dust the ideal which the woman herself has so proudly sustained for him, which has placed her in her unique, her unalterable form so far apart, so far above the rest of humanity. Fallen now, represented otherwise than in her own type in which she sat unassailably enthroned, she is become nothing more than just an ordinary woman, in the legend of whose superiority we have lost all faith. In this type we are so accustomed to regard as included not only the beauty of an Odette but her personality, her identity, that standing before the portrait which has thus transposed her from it we are inclined to protest not simply \u201cHow plain he has made her!\u201d but \u201cWhy, it isn\u2019t the least bit like her!\u201d We find it hard to believe that it can be she. We do not recognise her. And yet there is a person there on the canvas whom we are quite conscious of having seen before. But that person is not Odette; the face of the person, her body, her general appearance seem familiar. They recall to us not this particular woman who never held herself like that, whose natural pose had no suggestion of any such strange and teasing arabesque in its outlines, but other women, all the women whom Elstir has ever painted, women whom invariably, however they may differ from one another, he has chosen to plant thus on his canvas facing you, with an arched foot thrust out from under the skirt, a large round hat in one hand, symmetrically corresponding at the level of the knee which it hides to what also appears as a disc, higher up in the picture: the face. And furthermore, not only does a portrait by the hand of genius disintegrate and destroy a woman\u2019s type, as it has been denned by her coquetry and her selfish conception of beauty, but if it is also old, it is not content with ageing the original in the same way as a photograph ages its sitter, by shewing her dressed in the fashions of long ago. In a portrait, it is not only the manner the woman then had of dressing that dates it, there is also the manner the artist had of painting. And this, Elstir\u2019s earliest manner, was the most damaging of birth certificates for Odette because it not only established her, as did her photographs of the same period, as the younger sister of various time-honoured courtesans, but made her portrait contemporary with the countless portraits that Manet or Whistler had painted of all those vanished models, models who already belonged to oblivion or to history\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was along this train of thought, meditated in silence by the side of Elstir as I accompanied him to his door, that I was being led by the discovery that I had just made of the identity of his model, when this original discovery caused me to make a second, more disturbing still, involving the identity of the artist. He had painted the portrait of Odette de Cr\u00e9cy. Could it possibly be that this man of genius, this sage, this eremite, this philosopher with his marvellous flow of conversation, who towered over everyone and everything, was the foolish, corrupt little painter who had at one time been \u2018taken up\u2019 by the Verdurins? I asked him if he had known them, whether by any chance it was he that they used to call M. Biche. He answered me in the affirmative, with no trace of embarrassment, as if my question referred to a period in his life that was ended and already somewhat remote, with no suspicion of what a cherished illusion his words were shattering in me, until looking up he read my disappointment upon my face. His own assumed an expression of annoyance. And, as we were now almost at the gate of his house, a man of less outstanding eminence, in heart and brain, might simply have said \u2018good-bye\u2019 to me, a trifle dryly, and taken care to avoid seeing me again. This however was not Elstir\u2019s way with me; like the master that he was \u2014 and this was, perhaps, from the point of view of sheer creative genius, his one fault, that he was a master in that sense of the word, for an artist if he is to live the true life of the spirit in its full extent, must be alone and not bestow himself with profusion, even upon disciples \u2014 from every circumstance, whether involving himself or other people, he sought to extract, for the better edification of the young, the element of truth that it contained. He chose therefore, rather than say anything that might have avenged the injury to his pride, to say what he thought would prove instructive to me. \u201cThere is no man,\u201d he began, \u201chowever wise, who has not at some period of his youth said things, or lived in a way the consciousness of which is so unpleasant to him in later life that he would gladly, if he could, expunge it from his memory. And yet he ought not entirely to regret it, because he cannot be certain that he has indeed become a wise man \u2014 so far as it is possible for any of us to be wise \u2014 unless he has passed through all the fatuous or unwholesome incarnations by which that ultimate stage must be preceded. I know that there are young fellows, the sons and grandsons of famous men, whose masters have instilled into them nobility of mind and moral refinement in their schooldays. They have, perhaps, when they look back upon their past lives, nothing to retract; they can, if they choose, publish a signed account of everything they have ever said or done; but they are poor creatures, feeble descendants of doctrinaires, and their wisdom is negative and sterile. We are not provided with wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can take for us, an effort which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. The lives that you admire, the attitudes that seem noble to you are not the result of training at home, by a father, or by masters at school, they have sprung from beginnings of a very different order, by reaction from the influence of everything evil or commonplace that prevailed round about them. They represent a struggle and a victory. I can see that the picture of what we once were, in early youth, may not be recognisable and cannot, certainly, be pleasing to contemplate in later life. But we must not deny the truth of it, for it is evidence that we have really lived, that it is in accordance with the laws of life and of the mind that we have, from the common elements of life, of the life of studios, of artistic groups \u2014 assuming that one is a painter \u2014 extracted something that goes beyond them.\u201d Meanwhile we had reached his door. I was disappointed at not having met the girls. But after all there was now the possibility of meeting them again later on; they had ceased to do no more than pass beyond a horizon on which I had been ready to suppose that I should never see them reappear. Around them no longer swirled that sort of great eddy which had separated me from them, which had been merely the expression of the perpetually active desire, mobile, compelling, fed ever on fresh anxieties, which was aroused in me by their inaccessibility, their flight from me, possibly for ever. My desire for them, I could now set it at rest, hold it in reserve, among all those other desires the realisation of which, as soon as I knew it to be possible, I would cheerfully postpone. I took leave of Elstir; I was alone once again. Then all of a sudden, despite my recent disappointment, I saw in my mind\u2019s eye all that chain of coincidence which I had not supposed could possibly come about, that Elstir should be a friend of those very girls, that they who only that morning had been to me merely figures in a picture with the sea for background had seen me, had seen me walking in friendly intimacy with a great painter, who was now informed of my secret longing and would no doubt do what he could to assuage it. All this had been a source of pleasure to me, but that pleasure had remained hidden; it was one of those visitors who wait before letting us know that they are in the room until all the rest have gone and we are by ourselves. Then only do we catch sight of them, and can say to them, \u201cI am at your service,\u201d and listen to what they have to tell us. Sometimes between the moment at which these pleasures have entered our consciousness and the moment at which we are free to entertain them, so many hours have passed, we have in the interval seen so many people that we are afraid lest they should have grown tired of waiting. But they are patient, they do not grow tired, and as soon as the crowd has gone we find them there ready for us. Sometimes it is then we who are so exhausted that it seems as though our weary mind will not have the strength left to seize and retain those memories, those impressions for which our frail self is the one habitable place, the sole means of realisation. And we should regret that failure, for existence to us is hardly interesting save on the days on which the dust of realities is shot with magic sand, on which some trivial incident of life becomes a spring of romance. Then a whole promontory of the inaccessible world rises clear in the light of our dream, and enters into our life, our life in which, like the sleeper awakened, we actually see the people of whom we have been so ardently dreaming that we came to believe that we should never behold them save in our dreams\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sense of comfort that I drew from the probability of my now being able to meet the little band whenever I chose was all the more precious to me because I should not have been able to keep watch for them during the next few days, which would be taken up with preparations for Saint-Loup\u2019s departure. My grandmother was anxious to offer my friend some proof of her gratitude for all the kindnesses that he had shewn to her and myself. I told her that he was a great admirer of Proudhon, and this put it into her head to send for a collection of autograph letters by that philosopher which she had once bought; Saint-Loup came to her room to look at them on the day of their arrival, which was also his last day at Balbec. He read them eagerly, fingering each page with reverence, trying to get the sentences by heart; and then, rising from the table, was beginning to apologise to my grandmother for having stayed so long, when he heard her say: \u201cNo, no; take them with you; they are for you to keep; that was why I sent for them, to give them to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was overpowered by a joy which he could no more control than we can a physical condition that arises without the intervention of our will. He blushed scarlet as a child who has just been whipped, and my grandmother was a great deal more touched to see all the efforts that he was making (without success) to control the joy that convulsed him than she would have been to hear any words of thanks that he could have uttered. But he, fearing that he had failed to shew his gratitude properly, begged me to make his excuses to her again, next day, leaning from the window of the little train of the local railway company which was to take him back to his regiment. The distance was, as a matter of fact, nothing. He had thought of going, as he had frequently done that summer, when he was to return the same evening and was not encumbered with luggage, by road. But this time he would have had, anyhow, to put all his heavy luggage in the train. And he found it simpler to take the train himself also, following the advice of the manager who, on being consulted, replied that \u201cCarriage or train, it was more or less equivocal.\u201d He meant us to understand that they were equivalent (in fact, very much what Fran\u00e7oise would have expressed as \u201ccoming to as near as made no difference\u201d). \u201cVery well,\u201d Saint-Loup had decided, \u201cI will take the \u2018little crawler.\u2019\u201d I should have taken it too, had I not been tired, and gone with my friend to Donci\u00e8res; failing this I kept on promising, all the time that we waited in the Balbec station \u2014 the time, that is to say, which the driver of the little train spent in waiting for unpunctual friends, without whom he refused to start, and also in seeking some refreshment for himself \u2014 to go over there and see him several times a week. As Bloch had come to the station also \u2014 much to Saint-Loup\u2019s disgust \u2014 the latter, seeing that our companion could hear him begging me to come to luncheon, to dinner, to stay altogether at Donci\u00e8res, finally turned to him and, in the most forbidding tone, intended to counteract the forced civility of the invitation and to prevent Bloch from taking it seriously: \u201cIf you ever happen to be passing through Donci\u00e8res any afternoon when I am off duty, you might ask for me at the barracks; but I hardly ever am off duty.\u201d Perhaps, also, Robert feared lest, if left to myself, I might not come, and, thinking that I was more intimate with Bloch than I made out, was providing me in this way with a travelling companion, one who would urge me on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was afraid that this tone, this way of inviting a person while warning him not to come, might have wounded Bloch, and felt that Saint-Loup would have done better, saying nothing. But I was mistaken, for after the train had gone, while we were walking back together as far as the crossroads at which we should have to part, one road going to the hotel, the other to the Blochs\u2019 villa, he never ceased from asking me on what day we should go to Donci\u00e8res, for after \u201call the civilities that Saint-Loup had shewn\u201d him, it would be \u2018too unmannerly\u2019 on his part not to accept the invitation. I was glad that he had not noticed, or was so little displeased as to wish to let it be thought that he had not noticed on how far from pressing, how barely polite a note the invitation had been sounded. At the same time I should have liked Bloch, for his own sake, to refrain from making a fool of himself by going over at once to Donci\u00e8res. But I dared not offer a piece of advice which could only have offended him by hinting that Saint-Loup had been less pressing than himself impressed. He was a great deal too ready to respond, and even if all his faults of this nature were atoned for by remarkable qualities which others, with more reserve than he, would not possess, he carried indiscretion to a pitch that was almost maddening. The week must not, to hear him speak, pass without our going to Donci\u00e8res (he said \u2018our\u2019 for I think that he counted to some extent on my presence there as an excuse for his own). All the way home, opposite the gymnasium, in its grove of trees, opposite the lawn-tennis courts, the mayor\u2019s office, the shell-fish stall, he stopped me, imploring me to fix a day, and, as I did not, left me in a towering rage, saying: \u201cAs your lordship pleases. For my part, I\u2019m obliged to go since he has invited me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup was still so much afraid of not having thanked my grandmother properly that he charged me once again to express his gratitude to her a day or two later in a letter I received from him from the town in which he was quartered, a town which seemed, on the envelope where the post-mark had stamped its name, to be hastening to me across country, to tell me that within its walls, in the Louis XVI cavalry barracks, he was thinking of me. The paper was embossed with the arms of Marsantes, in which I could make out a lion, surmounted by a coronet formed by the cap of a Peer of France\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAfter a journey which,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpassed pleasantly enough, with a book I bought at the station, by Arv\u00e8de Barine (a Russian author, I fancy; it seemed to me remarkably well written for a foreigner, but you shall give me your critical opinion, you are bound to know all about it, you fount of knowledge who have read everything), here I am again in the thick of this debased existence, where, alas, I feel a sad exile, not having here what I had to leave at Balbec; this life in which I cannot discover one affectionate memory, any intellectual attraction; an environment on which you would probably look with contempt \u2014 and yet it has a certain charm. Everything seems to have changed since I was last here, for in the interval one of the most important periods in my life, that from which our friendship dates, has begun. I hope that it may never come to an end. I have spoken of our friendship, of you, to one person only, to the friend I told you of, who has just paid me a surprise visit here. She would like immensely to know you, and I feel that you would get on well together, for she too is extremely literary. I, on the other hand, to go over in my mind all our talk, to live over again those hours which I never shall forget, have shut myself off from my comrades, excellent fellows, but altogether incapable of understanding that sort of thing. This remembrance of moments spent with you I should almost have preferred, on my first day here, to call up for my own solitary enjoyment, without writing. But I was afraid lest you, with your subtle mind and ultra-sensitive heart, might, if you did not hear from me, needlessly torment yourself, if, that is to say, you still condescend to occupy your thoughts with this blunt trooper whom you will have a hard task to polish and refine, and make a little more subtle and worthier of your company.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the whole this letter, in its affectionate spirit, was not at all unlike those which, when I did not yet know Saint-Loup, I had imagined that he would write to me, in those daydreams from which the coldness of his first greeting had shaken me by bringing me face to face with an icy reality which was not, however, to endure. Once I had received this letter, whenever, at luncheon-time, the post was brought in, I could tell at once when it was from him that a letter came, for it had always that second face which a person assumes when he is absent, in the features of which (the characters of his script) there is no reason why we should not suppose that we are tracing an individual soul just as much as in the line of a nose or the inflexions of a voice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would now gladly remain at the table while it was being cleared, and, if it was not a moment at which the girls of the little band might be passing, it was no longer solely towards the sea that I would turn my eyes. Since I had seen such things depicted in water-colours by Elstir, I sought to find again in reality, I cherished, as though for their poetic beauty, the broken gestures of the knives still lying across one another, the swollen convexity of a discarded napkin upon which the sun would patch a scrap of yellow velvet, the half-empty glass which thus shewed to greater advantage the noble sweep of its curved sides, and, in the heart of its translucent crystal, clear as frozen daylight, a dreg of wine, dusky but sparkling with reflected lights, the displacement of solid objects, the transmutation of liquids by the effect of light and shade, the shifting colour of the plums which passed from green to blue and from blue to golden yellow in the half-plundered dish, the chairs, like a group of old ladies, that came twice daily to take their places round the white cloth spread on the table as on an altar at which were celebrated the rites of the palate, where in the hollows of oyster-shells a few drops of lustral water had gathered as in tiny holy water stoups of stone; I tried to find beauty there where I had never imagined before that it could exist, in the most ordinary things, in the profundities of \u2018still life.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, some days after Saint-Loup\u2019s departure, I had succeeded in persuading Elstir to give a small tea-party, at which I was to meet Albertine, that freshness of appearance, that smartness of attire, both (alas) fleeting, which were to be observed in me at the moment of my starting out from the Grand Hotel, and were due respectively to a longer rest than usual and to special pains over my toilet, I regretted my inability to reserve them (and also the credit accruing from Elstir\u2019s friendship) for the captivation of some other, more interesting person; I regretted having to use them all up on the simple pleasure of making Albertine\u2019s acquaintance. My brain assessed this pleasure at a very low value now that it was assured me. But, inside, my will did not for a moment share this illusion, that will which is the persevering and unalterable servant of our successive personalities; hiding itself in secret places, despised, downtrodden, untiringly faithful, toiling without intermission and with no thought for the variability of the self, its master, if only that master may never lack what he requires. Whereas at the moment when we are just about to start on a long-planned and eagerly awaited holiday, our brain, our nerves begin to ask themselves whether it is really worth all the trouble involved, the will, knowing that those lazy masters would at once begin to consider their journey the most wonderful experience, if it became impossible for them to take it, the will leaves them explaining their difficulties outside the station, multiplying their hesitations; but busies itself with taking the tickets and putting us into the carriage before the train starts. It is as invariable as brain and nerves are fickle, but as it is silent, gives no account of its actions, it seems almost non-existent; it is by its dogged determination that the other constituent parts of our personality are led, but without seeing it, while they distinguish clearly all their own uncertainties. My nerves and brain then started a discussion as to the real value of the pleasure that there would be in knowing Albertine, while I studied in the glass vain and perishable attractions which nerves and brain would have preserved intact for use on some other occasion. But my will would not let the hour pass at which I must start, and \u2018it was Elstir\u2019s address that it called out to the driver. Brain and nerves were at liberty, now that the die was cast, to think this \u2018a pity.\u2019 If my will had given the man a different address, they would have been finely \u2018sold.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I arrived at Elstir\u2019s, a few minutes later, my first impression was that Mlle. Simonet was not in the studio. There was certainly a girl sitting there in a silk frock, bareheaded, but one whose marvellous hair, whose nose, meant nothing to me, in whom I did not recognise the human entity that I had formed out of a young cyclist strolling past, in a polo-cap, between myself and the sea. It was Albertine, nevertheless. But even when I knew it to be she, I gave her no thought. On entering any social gathering, when we are young, we lose consciousness of our old self, we become a different man, every drawing-room being a fresh universe, in which, coming under the sway of a new moral perspective, we fasten our attention, as if they were to matter to us for all time, on people, dances, card-tables, all of which we shall have forgotten by the morning. Obliged to follow, if I was to arrive at the goal of conversation with Albertine, a road in no way of my own planning, which first brought me to a halt at Elstir, passed by other groups of guests to whom I was presented, then along the table, at which I was offered, and ate, a strawberry tart or two, while I listened, motionless, to the music that was beginning in another part of the room, I found myself giving to these various incidents the same importance as to my introduction to Mlle. Simonet, an introduction which was now nothing more than one among several such incidents, having entirely forgotten that it had been, but a few minutes since, my sole object in coming there that day. But is it not ever thus in the bustle of daily life, with every true happiness, every great sorrow? In a room full of other people we receive from her whom we love the answer, propitious or fatal, which we have been awaiting for the last year. But we must go on talking, ideas come, one after another, forming a smooth surface which is pricked, at the very most, now and then by a dull throb from within of the memory, deep-rooted enough but of very slender growth, that misfortune has come upon us. If, instead of misfortune, it is happiness, it may be that not until many years have elapsed will we recall that the most important event in our sentimental life occurred without our having time to give it any prolonged attention, or even to become aware of it almost, at a social gathering, it may have been, to which we had gone solely in expectation of that event\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Elstir asked me to come with him so that he might introduce me to Albertine, who was sitting a little farther down the room, I first of all finished eating a coffee \u00e9clair and, with a show of keen interest, asked an old gentleman whose acquaintance I had just made (and thought that I might, perhaps, offer him the rose in my buttonhole which he had admired) to tell me more about the old Norman fairs. This is not to say that the introduction which followed did not give me any pleasure, nor assume a definite importance in my eyes. But so far as the pleasure was concerned, I was not conscious of it, naturally, until some time later, when, once more in the hotel, and in my room alone, I had become myself again. Pleasure in this respect is like photography. What we take, in the presence of the beloved object, is merely a negative film; we develop it later, when we are at home, and have once again found at our disposal that inner darkroom, the entrance to which is barred to us so long as we are with other people\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If my consciousness of the pleasure it had brought me was thus retarded by a few hours, the importance of this introduction I felt immediately. At such moments of introduction, for all that we feel ourselves to have been suddenly enriched, to have been furnished with a pass that will admit us henceforward to pleasures which we have been pursuing for weeks past, but in vain, we realise only too clearly that this acquisition puts an end for us not merely to hours of toilsome search \u2014 a relief that could only fill us with joy \u2014 but also to the very existence of a certain person, her whom our imagination had wildly distorted, our anxious fear that we might never become known to her enlarged. At the moment when our name sounds on the lips of the person introducing us, especially if he amplifies it, as Elstir was now doing, with a flattering account of us \u2014 in that sacramental moment, as when in a fairy tale the magician commands a person suddenly to become someone else, she to whose presence we have been longing to attain vanishes; how could she remain the same when, for one thing \u2014 owing to the attention which the stranger is obliged to pay to the announcement of our name and the sight of our person \u2014 in the eyes that only yesterday were situated at an infinite distance (where we supposed that our eyes, wandering, uncontrolled, desperate, divergent, would never succeed in meeting them) the conscious gaze, the incommunicable thought which we have been seeking have been miraculously and quite simply replaced by our own image, painted in them as though behind the glass of a smiling mirror. If this incarnation of ourself in the person who seems to differ most from us is what does most to modify the appearance of the person to whom we have just been introduced, the form of that person still remains quite vague; and we are free to ask ourself whether she will turn out to be a god, a table or a basin. But, as nimble as the wax-modellers who will fashion a bust before our eyes in five minutes, the few words which the stranger is now going to say to us will substantiate her form, will give her something positive and final that will exclude all the hypotheses by which, a moment ago, our desire, our imagination were being tempted. Doubtless, even before her coming to this party, Albertine had ceased to be to me simply that sole phantom worthy to haunt our life which is what remains of a passing stranger, of whom we know nothing and have caught but the barest glimpse. Her relation to Mme. Bontemps had already restricted the scope of those marvellous hypotheses, by stopping one of the channels along which they might have spread. As I drew closer to the girl, and began to know her better, my knowledge of her underwent a process of subtraction, all the factors of imagination and desire giving place to a notion which was worth infinitely less, a notion to which, it must be admitted, there was added presently what was more or less the equivalent, in the domain of real life, of what joint stock companies give one, after paying interest on one\u2019s capital, and call a bonus. Her name, her family connexions had been the original limit set to my suppositions. Her friendly greeting while, standing close beside her, I saw once again the tiny mole on her cheek, below her eye, marked another stage; last of all, I was surprised to hear her use the adverb \u2018perfectly\u2019 (in place of \u2018quite\u2019) of two people whom she mentioned, saying of one: \u201cShe is perfectly mad, but very nice for all that,\u201d and of the other, \u201cHe is a perfectly common man, a perfect bore.\u201d However little to be commended this use of \u2018perfectly\u2019 may be, it indicates a degree of civilisation and culture which I could never have imagined as having been attained by the bacchante with the bicycle, the frenzied muse of the golf-course. Nor did it mean that after this first transformation Albertine was not to change again for me, many times. The good and bad qualities which a person presents to us, exposed to view on the surface of his or her face, rearrange themselves in a totally different order if we approach them from another angle \u2014 just as, in a town, buildings that appear strung irregularly along a single line, from another aspect retire into a graduated distance, and their relative heights are altered. To begin with, Albertine now struck me as not implacable so much as almost frightened; she seemed to me rather respectably than ill bred, judging by the description, \u2018bad style,\u2019 \u2018a comic manner\u2019 which she applied to each in turn of the girls of whom I spoke to her; finally, she presented as a target for my line of sight a temple that was distinctly flushed and hardly attractive to the eye, and no longer the curious gaze which I had always connected with her until then. But this was merely a second impression and there were doubtless others through which I was successively to pass. Thus it can be only after one has recognised, not without having had to feel one\u2019s way, the optical illusions of one\u2019s first impression that one can arrive at an exact knowledge of another person, supposing such knowledge to be ever possible. But it is not; for while our original impression of him undergoes correction, the person himself, not being an inanimate object, changes in himself, we think that we have caught him, he moves, and, when we imagine that at last we are seeing him clearly, it is only the old impressions which we had already formed of him that we have succeeded in making clearer, when they no longer represent him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, whatever the inevitable disappointments that it must bring in its train, this movement towards what we have only half seen, what we have been free to dwell upon and imagine at our leisure, this movement is the only one that is wholesome for the senses, that whets the appetite. How dreary a monotony must pervade those people\u2019s lives who, from indolence or timidity, drive in their carriages straight to the doors of friends whom they have got to know without having first dreamed of knowing them, without ever daring, on the way, to stop and examine what arouses their desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I returned home, my mind full of the party, the coffee \u00e9clair which I had finished eating before I let Elstir take me up to Albertine, the rose which I had given the old gentleman, all the details selected without our knowledge by the circumstances of the occasion, which compose in a special and quite fortuitous order the picture that we retain of a first meeting. But this picture, I had the impression that I was seeing it from a fresh point of view, a long way remote from myself, realising that it had not existed only for me, when some months later, to my great surprise, on my speaking to Albertine on the day on which I had first met her, she reminded me of the \u00e9clair, the flower that I had given away, all those things which I had supposed to have been \u2014 I will not say of importance only to myself but \u2014 perceived only by myself, and which I now found thus transcribed, in a version the existence of which I had never suspected, in the mind of Albertine. On this first day itself, when, on my return to the hotel, I was able to visualise the memory which I had brought away with me, I realised the consummate adroitness with which the sleight of hand had been performed, and how I had talked for a moment or two with a person who, thanks to the skill of the conjurer, without actually embodying anything of that other person whom I had for so long been following as she paced beside the sea, had been effectively substituted for her. I might, for that matter, have guessed as much in advance, since the girl of the beach was a fabrication invented by myself. In spite of which, as I had, in my conversations with Elstir, identified her with this other girl, I felt myself in honour bound to fulfil to the real the promises of love made to the imagined Albertine. We betroth ourselves by proxy, and think ourselves obliged, in the sequel, to marry the person who has intervened. Moreover, if there had disappeared, provisionally at any rate, from my life, an anguish that found adequate consolation in the memory of polite manners, of that expression \u2018perfectly common\u2019 and of the glowing temple, that memory awakened in me desire of another kind which, for all that it was placid and not at all painful, resembling rather brotherly love, might in the long run become fully as dangerous by making me feel at every moment a compelling need to kiss this new person, whose charming ways, shyness, unlooked-for accessibility, arrested the futile process of my imagination but gave birth to a sentimental gratitude. And then, since memory begins at once to record photographs independent of one another, eliminates every link, any kind of sequence from between the scenes portrayed in the collection which it exposes to our view, the most recent does not necessarily destroy or cancel those that came before. Confronted with the commonplace though appealing Albertine to whom I had spoken that afternoon, I still saw the other, mysterious Albertine outlined against the sea. These were now memories, that is to say pictures neither of which now seemed to me any more true than the other. But, to make an end of this first afternoon of my introduction to Albertine, when trying to recapture that little mole on her cheek, just under the eye, I remembered that, looking from Elstir\u2019s window, when Albertine had gone by, I had seen the mole on her chin. In fact, whenever I saw her I noticed that she had a mole, but my inaccurate memory made it wander about the face of Albertine, fixing it now in one place, now in another\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whatever my disappointment in finding in Mlle. Simonet a girl so little different from those that I knew already, just as my rude awakening when I saw Balbec Church did not prevent me from wishing still to go to Quimperl\u00e9, Pont-Aven and Venice, I comforted myself with the thought that through Albertine at any rate, even if she herself was not all that I had hoped, I might make the acquaintance of her comrades of the little band\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought at first that I should fail. As she was to be staying (and I too) for a long time still at Balbec, I had decided that the best thing was not to make my efforts to meet her too apparent, but to wait for an accidental encounter. But should this occur every day, even, it was greatly to be feared that she would confine herself to acknowledging my bow from a distance, and such meetings, repeated day after day throughout the whole season, would benefit me not at all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after this, one morning when it had been raining and was almost cold, I was accosted on the \u2018front\u2019 by a girl wearing a close-fitting toque and carrying a muff, so different from the girl whom I had met at Elstir\u2019s party that to recognise in her the same person seemed an operation beyond the power of the human mind; mine was, nevertheless, successful in performing it, but after a momentary surprise which did not, I think, escape Albertine\u2019s notice. On the other hand, when I instinctively recalled the good breeding which had so impressed me before, she filled me with a converse astonishment by her rude tone and manners typical of the \u2018little band.\u2019 Apart from these, her temple had ceased to be the optical centre, on which the eye might comfortably rest, of her face, either because I was now on her other side, or because her toque hid it, or else possibly because its inflammation was not a constant thing. \u201cWhat weather!\u201d she began. \u201cReally the perpetual summer of Balbec is all stuff and nonsense. You don\u2019t go in for anything special here, do you? We don\u2019t ever see you playing golf, or dancing at the Casino. You don\u2019t ride, either. You must be bored stiff. You don\u2019t find it too deadly, staying about on the beach all day? I see, you just bask in the sun like a lizard; you enjoy that. You must have plenty of time on your hands. I can see you\u2019re not like me; I simply adore all sports. You weren\u2019t at the Sogne races! We went in the \u2018tram,\u2019 and I can quite believe you don\u2019t see the fun of going in an old \u2018tin-pot\u2019 like that. It took us two whole hours! I could have gone there and back three times on my bike.\u201d I, who had been lost in admiration of Saint-Loup when he, in the most natural manner in the world, called the little local train the \u2018crawler,\u2019 because of the ceaseless windings of its line, was positively alarmed by the glibness with which Albertine spoke of the \u2018tram,\u2019 and called it a \u2018tin-pot.\u2019 I could feel her mastery of a form of speech in which I was afraid of her detecting and scorning my inferiority. And yet the full wealth of the synonyms that the little band possessed to denote this railway had not yet been revealed to me. In speaking, Albertine kept her head motionless, her nostrils closed, allowing only the corners of her lips to move. The result of this was a drawling, nasal sound, into the composition of which there entered perhaps a provincial descent, a juvenile affectation of British phlegm, the teaching of a foreign governess and a congestive hypertrophy of the mucus of the nose. This enunciation which, as it happened, soon disappeared when she knew people better, giving place to a natural girlish tone, might have been thought unpleasant. But it was peculiar to herself, and delighted me. Whenever I had gone for several days without seeing her, I would refresh my spirit by repeating to myself: \u201cWe don\u2019t ever see you playing golf,\u201d with the nasal intonation in which she had uttered the words, point blank, without moving a muscle of her face. And I thought then that there could be no one in the world so desirable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We formed that morning one of those couples who dotted the \u2018front\u2019 here and there with their conjunction, their stopping together for time enough just to exchange a few words before breaking apart, each to resume separately his or her divergent stroll. I seized the opportunity, while she stood still, to look again and discover once and for all where exactly the little mole was placed. Then, just as a phrase of Vinteuil which had delighted me in the sonata, and which my recollection allowed to wander from the andante to the finale, until the day when, having the score in my hands, I was able to find it, and to fix it in my memory in its proper place, in the scherzo, so this mole, which I had visualised now on her cheek, now on her chin, came to rest for ever on her upper lip, just below her nose. In the same way, too, do we come with amazement upon lines that we know by heart in a poem in which we never dreamed that they were to be found\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment, as if in order that against the sea there might multiply in freedom, in the variety of its forms, all the rich decorative whole which was the lovely unfolding of the train of maidens, at once golden and rosy, baked by sun and wind, Albertine\u2019s friends, with their shapely limbs, their supple figures, but so different one from another, came into sight in a cluster that expanded as it approached, advancing towards us, but keeping closer to the sea, along a parallel line. I asked Albertine\u2019s permission to walk for a little way with her. Unfortunately, all she did was to wave her hand to them in greeting. \u201cBut your friends will be disappointed if you don\u2019t go with them,\u201d I hinted, hoping that we might all walk together. A young man with regular features, carrying a bag of golf-clubs, sauntered up to us. It was the baccarat-player, whose fast ways so enraged the chief magistrate\u2019s wife. In a frigid, impassive tone, which he evidently regarded as an indication of the highest refinement, he bade Albertine good day. \u201cBeen playing golf, Octave?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow did the game go? Were you in form?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s too sickening; I can\u2019t play for nuts,\u201d he replied. \u201cWas Andr\u00e9e playing?\u201d \u201cYes, she went round in seventy-seven.\u201d \u201cWhy, that\u2019s a record!\u201d \u201cI went round in eighty-two yesterday.\u201d He was the son of an immensely rich manufacturer who was to take an important part in the organisation of the coming World\u2019s Fair. I was struck by the extreme degree to which, in this young man and in the other by no means numerous male friends of the band of girls, the knowledge of everything that pertained to clothes and how to wear them, cigars, English drinks, horses, a knowledge which he possessed in its minutest details with a haughty infallibility that approached the reticent modesty of the true expert, had been developed in complete isolation, unaccompanied by the least trace of any intellectual culture. He had no hesitation as to the right time and place for dinner-jacket or pyjamas, but neither had he any suspicion of the circumstances in which one might or might not employ this or that word, or even of the simplest rules of grammar. This disparity between the two forms of culture must have existed also in his father, the President of the Syndicate that \u2018ran\u2019 Balbec, for, in an open letter to the electors which he had recently had posted on all the walls, he announced: \u201cI desired to see the Mayor, to speak to him of the matter; he would not listen to my righteous plaint.\u201d Octave, at the Casino, took prizes in all the dancing competitions, for bostons, tangos and what-not, an accomplishment that would entitle him, if he chose, to make a fine marriage in that seaside society where it is not figuratively but in sober earnest that the young women \u2018marry their dancing-partners.\u2019 He lighted a cigar with a \u201cD\u2019you mind?\u201d to Albertine, as one who asks permission to finish, while going on talking, an urgent piece of work. For he was one of those people who can never be \u2018doing nothing,\u2019 although there was nothing, for that matter, that he could ever be said to do. And as complete inactivity has the same effect on us, in the end, as prolonged overwork, and on the character as much as on the life of body and muscles, the unimpaired nullity of intellect that was enshrined behind Octave\u2019s meditative brow had ended by giving him, despite his air of unruffled calm, ineffectual longings to think which kept him awake at night, for all the world like an overwrought philosopher\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Supposing that if I knew their male friends I should have more opportunities of seeing the girls, I had been on the point of asking for an introduction to Octave. I told Albertine this, as soon as he had left us, still muttering, \u201cI couldn\u2019t play for nuts!\u201d I thought I would thus put into her head the idea of doing it next time. \u201cBut I can\u2019t,\u201d she cried, \u201cintroduce you to a tame cat like that. This place simply swarms with them. But what on earth would they have to say to you? That one plays golf quite well, and that\u2019s all there is to it. I know what I\u2019m talking about; you\u2019d find he wasn\u2019t at all your sort.\u201d \u201cYour friends will be cross with you if you desert them like this,\u201d I repeated, hoping that she would then suggest my joining the party. \u201cOh, no, they don\u2019t want me.\u201d We ran into Bloch, who directed at me a subtle, insinuating smile, and, embarrassed by the presence of Albertine, whom he did not know, or, rather, knew \u2018without knowing\u2019 her, bent his head with a stiff, almost irritated jerk. \u201cWhat\u2019s he called, that Ostrogoth?\u201d Albertine asked. \u201cI can\u2019t think why he should bow to me; he doesn\u2019t know me. And I didn\u2019t bow to him, either.\u201d I had no time to explain to her, for, bearing straight down upon us, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he began, \u201cfor interrupting you, but I must tell you that I am going to Don-ci\u00e8res to-morrow. I cannot put it off any longer without discourtesy; indeed, I ask myself, what must de Saint-Loup-en-Bray think of me. I just came to let you know that I shall take the two o\u2019clock train. At your service.\u201d But I thought now only of seeing Albertine again, and of trying to get to know her friends, and Donci\u00e8res, since they were not going there, and my going would bring me back too late to see them still on the beach, seemed to me to be situated at the other end of the world. I told Bloch that it was impossible. \u201cOh, very well, I shall go alone. In the fatuous words of Master Arouet, I shall say to Saint-Loup, to beguile his clericalism:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018My duty stands alone, by his in no way bound;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though he should choose to fail, yet faithful I\u2019ll be found.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI admit he\u2019s not a bad looking boy,\u201d was Albertine\u2019s comment, \u201cbut he makes me feel quite sick.\u201d I had never thought that Bloch might be \u2018not a bad looking boy\u2019; and yet, when one came to think of it, so he was. With his rather prominent brow, very aquiline nose, and his air of extreme cleverness and of being convinced of his cleverness, he had a pleasing face. But he could not succeed in pleasing Albertine. This was perhaps due, to some extent, to her own disadvantages, the harshness, the want of feeling of the little band, its rudeness towards everything that was not itself. And later on, when I introduced them, Albertine\u2019s antipathy for him grew no less. Bloch belonged to a section of society in which, between the free and easy customs of the \u2018smart set\u2019 and the regard for good manners which a man is supposed to shew who \u2018does not soil his hands,\u2019 a sort of special compromise has been reached which differs from the manners of the world and is nevertheless a peculiarly unpleasant form of worldliness. When he was introduced to anyone he would bow with a sceptical smile, and at the same time with an exaggerated show of respect, and, if it was to a man, would say: \u201cPleased to meet you, sir,\u201d in a voice which ridiculed the words that it was uttering, though with a consciousness of belonging to some one who was no fool. Having sacrificed this first moment to a custom which he at once followed and derided (just as on the first of January he would greet you with a \u2018Many happy!\u2019) he would adopt an air of infinite cunning, and would \u2018proffer subtle words\u2019 which were often true enough but \u2018got on\u2019 Albertine\u2019s nerves. When I told her on this first day that his name was Bloch, she exclaimed: \u201cI would have betted anything he was a Jew-boy. Trust them to put their foot in it!\u201d Moreover, Bloch was destined to give Albertine other grounds for annoyance later on. Like many intellectuals, he was incapable of saying a simple thing in a simple way. He would find some precious qualification for every statement, and would sweep from particular to general. It vexed Albertine, who was never too well pleased at other people\u2019s shewing an interest in what she was doing, that when she had sprained her ankle and was keeping quiet, Bloch said of her: \u201cShe is outstretched on her chair, but in her ubiquity has not ceased to frequent simultaneously vague golf-courses and dubious tennis-courts.\u201d He was simply being \u2018literary,\u2019 of course, but this, in view of the difficulties which Albertine felt that it might create for her with friends whose invitations she had declined on the plea that she was unable to move, was quite enough to disgust her with the face, the sound of the voice, of the young man who could say such things about her. We parted, Albertine and I, after promising to take a walk together later. I had talked to her without being any more conscious of where my words were falling, of what became of them, than if I were dropping pebbles into a bottomless pit. That our words are, as a general rule, filled, by the person to whom we address them, with a meaning which that person derives from her own substance, a meaning widely different from that which we had put into the same words when we uttered them, is a fact which the daily round of life is perpetually demonstrating. But if we find ourselves as well in the company of a person whose education (as Albertine\u2019s was to me) is inconceivable, her tastes, her reading, her principles unknown, we cannot tell whether our words have aroused in her anything that resembles their meaning, any more than in an animal, although there are things that even an animal may be made to understand. So that to attempt any closer friendship with Albertine seemed to me like placing myself in contact with the unknown, if not the impossible, an occupation as arduous as breaking a horse, as reposeful as keeping bees or growing roses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had thought, a few hours before, that Albertine would acknowledge my bow but would not speak to me. We had now parted, after planning to make some excursion soon together. I vowed that when I next met Albertine I would treat her with greater boldness, and I had sketched out in advance a draft of all that I would say to her, and even (being now quite convinced that she was not strait-laced) of all the favours that I would demand of her. But the mind is subject to external influences, as plants are, and cells and chemical elements, and the medium in which its immersion alters it is a change of circumstances, or new surroundings. Grown different by the mere fact of her presence, when I found myself once again in Albertine\u2019s company, what I said to her was not at all what I had meant to say. Remembering her flushed temple, I asked myself whether she might not appreciate more keenly a polite attention which she knew to be disinterested. Besides, I was embarrassed by certain things in her look, in her smile. They might equally well signify a laxity of morals and the rather silly merriment of a girl who though full of spirits was at heart thoroughly respectable. A single expression, on a face as in speech, is susceptible of divers interpretations, and I stood hesitating like a schoolboy faced by the difficulties of a piece of Greek prose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On this occasion we met almost immediately the tall one, Andr\u00e9e, the one who had jumped over the old banker, and Albertine was obliged to introduce me. Her friend had a pair of eyes of extraordinary brightness, like, in a dark house, a glimpse through an open door of a room into which the sun is shining with a greenish reflexion from the glittering sea\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A party of five were passing, men whom I had come to know very well by sight during my stay at Balbec. I had often wondered who they could be. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing very wonderful,\u201d said Albertine with a sneering laugh. \u201cThe little old one with dyed hair and yellow gloves has a fine touch; he knows how to draw all right, he\u2019s the Balbec dentist; he\u2019s a good sort. The fat one is the Mayor, not the tiny little fat one, you must have seen him before, he\u2019s the dancing master; he\u2019s rather a beast, you know; he can\u2019t stand us, because we make such a row at the Casino; we smash his chairs, and want to have the carpet up when we dance; that\u2019s why he never gives us prizes, though we\u2019re the only girls there who can dance a bit. The dentist is a dear, I would have said how d\u2019ye do to him, just to make the dancing master swear, but I couldn\u2019t because they\u2019ve got M. de Sainte-Croix with them; he\u2019s on the General Council; he comes of a very good family, but he\u2019s joined the Republicans, to make more money. No nice people ever speak to him now. He knows my uncle, because they\u2019re both in the Government, but the rest of my family always cut him. The thin one in the waterproof is the bandmaster. You know him, of course. You don\u2019t? Oh, he plays divinely. You haven\u2019t been to Cavalleria Rusticana? I thought it too lovely! He\u2019s giving a concert this evening, but we can\u2019t go because it\u2019s to be in the town hall. In the Casino it wouldn\u2019t matter, but in the town hall, where they\u2019ve taken down the crucifix. Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mother would have a fit if we went there. You\u2019re going to say that my aunt\u2019s husband is in the Government. But what difference does that make? My aunt is my aunt. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m fond of her. The only thing she has ever wanted has been to get rid of me. No, the person who has really been a mother to me, and all the more credit to her because she\u2019s no relation at all, is a friend of mine whom I love just as much as if she was my mother. I will let you see her \u2018photo.\u2019\u201d We were joined for a moment by the golf champion and baccarat plunger, Octave. I thought that I had discovered a bond between us, for I learned in the course of conversation that he was some sort of relative, and even more a friend of the Verdurins. But he spoke contemptuously of the famous Wednesdays, adding that M. Verdurin had never even heard of a dinner-jacket, which made it a horrid bore when one ran into him in a music-hall, where one would very much rather not be greeted with \u201cWell, you young rascal,\u201d by an old fellow in a frock coat and black tie, for all the world like a village lawyer. Octave left us, and soon it was Andr\u00e9e\u2019s turn, when we came to her villa, into which she vanished without having uttered a single word to me during the whole of our walk. I regretted her departure, all the more in that, while I was complaining to Albertine how chilling her friend had been with me, and was comparing in my mind this difficulty which Albertine seemed to find in making me know her friends with the hostility that Elstir, when he might have granted my desire, seemed to have encountered on that first afternoon, two girls came by to whom I lifted my hat, the young Ambresacs, whom Albertine greeted also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I felt that, in Albertine\u2019s eyes, my position would be improved by this meeting. They were the daughters of a kinswoman of Mme. de Ville-parisis, who was also a friend of Mme. de Luxembourg. M. and Mme. d\u2019Ambresac, who had a small villa at Balbec and were immensely rich, led the simplest of lives there, and always went about dressed he in an unvarying frock coat, she in a dark gown. Both of them used to make sweeping bows to my grandmother, which never led to anything further. The daughters, who were very pretty, were dressed more fashionably, but in a fashion suited rather to Paris than to the seaside. With their long skirts and large hats, they had the look of belonging to a different race from Albertine. She, I discovered, knew all about them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, so you know the little d\u2019Ambresacs, do you? Dear me, you have some swagger friends. After all, they\u2019re very simple souls,\u201d she went on as though this might account for it. \u201cThey\u2019re very nice, but so well brought up that they aren\u2019t allowed near the Casino, for fear of us \u2014 we\u2019ve such a bad tone. They attract you, do they? Well, it all depends on what you like. They\u2019re just little white rabbits, really. There may be something in that, of course. If little white rabbits are what appeals to you, they may supply a long-felt want. It seems, there must be some attraction, because one of them has got engaged already to the Marquis de Saint-Loup. Which is a cruel blow to the younger one, who is madly in love with that young man. I\u2019m sure, the way they speak to you with their lips shut is quite enough for me. And then they dress in the most absurd way. Fancy going to play golf in silk frocks! At their age, they dress more showily than grown-up women who really know about clothes. Look at Mme. Elstir; there\u2019s a well dressed woman if you like.\u201d I answered that she had struck me as being dressed with the utmost simplicity. Albertine laughed. \u201cShe does put on the simplest things, I admit, but she dresses wonderfully, and to get what you call simplicity costs her a fortune.\u201d Mme. Elstir\u2019s gowns passed unnoticed by any one who had not a sober and unerring taste in matters of attire. This was lacking in me. Elstir possessed it in a supreme degree, or so Albertine told me. I had not suspected this, nor that the beautiful but quite simple objects which littered his studio were treasures long desired by him which he had followed from sale room to sale room, knowing all their history, until he had made enough money to be able to acquire them. But as to this Albertine, being as ignorant as myself, could not enlighten me. Whereas when it came to clothes, prompted by a coquettish instinct, and perhaps by the regretful longing of a penniless girl who is able to appreciate with greater disinterestedness, more delicacy of feeling, in other, richer people the things that she will never be able to afford for herself, she expressed herself admirably on the refinement of Elstir\u2019s taste, so hard to satisfy that all women appeared to him badly dressed, while, attaching infinite importance to right proportions and shades of colour, he would order to be made for his wife, at fabulous prices, the sunshades, hats and cloaks which he had learned from Albertine to regard as charming, and which a person wanting in taste would no more have noticed than myself. Apart from this, Albertine, who had done a little painting, though without, she confessed, having any \u2018gift\u2019 for it, felt a boundless admiration for Elstir, and, thanks to his precept and example, shewed a judgment of pictures which was in marked contrast to her enthusiasm for Cavalleria Rusticana. The truth was, though as yet it was hardly apparent, that she was highly intelligent, and that in the things that she said the stupidity was not her own but that of her environment and age. Elstir\u2019s had been a good but only a partial influence. All the branches of her intelligence had not reached the same stage of development. The taste for pictures had almost caught up the taste for clothes and all forms of smartness, but had not been followed by the taste for music, which was still a long way behind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Albertine might know all about the Ambresacs; but as he who can achieve great things is not necessarily capable of small, I did not find her, after I had bowed to those young ladies, any better disposed to make me known to her friends. \u201cIt\u2019s too good of you to attach any importance to them. You shouldn\u2019t take any notice of them; they don\u2019t count. What on earth can a lot of kids like them mean to a man like you? Now Andr\u00e9e, I must say, is remarkably clever. She is a good girl, that, though she is perfectly fantastic at times, but the others are really dreadfully stupid.\u201d When I had left Albertine, I felt suddenly a keen regret that Saint-Loup should have concealed his engagement from me and that he should be doing anything so improper as to choose a wife before breaking with his mistress. And then, shortly afterwards, I met Andr\u00e9e, and as she went on talking to me for some time I seized the opportunity to tell her that I would very much like to see her again next day, but she replied that this was impossible, because her mother was not at all well, and she would have to stay beside her. The next day but one, when I was at Elstir\u2019s, he told me how greatly Andr\u00e9e had been attracted by me; on my protesting: \u201cBut it was I who was attracted by her from the start; I asked her to meet me again yesterday, but she could not.\u201d \u201cYes, I know; she told me all about that,\u201d was his reply, \u201cshe was very sorry, but she had promised to go to a picnic, somewhere miles from here. They were to drive over in a break, and it was too late for her to get out of it.\u201d Albeit this falsehood (Andr\u00e9e knowing me so slightly) was of no real importance, I ought not to have continued to seek the company of a person who was capable of uttering it. For what people have once done they will do again indefinitely, and if you go every year to see a friend who, the first time, was not able to meet you at the appointed place, or was in bed with a chill, you will find him in bed with another chill which he has just caught, you will miss him again at another meeting-place at which he has failed to appear, for a single and unalterable reason in place of which he supposes himself to have various reasons, drawn from the circumstances. One morning, not long after An-dree\u2019s telling me that she would be obliged to stay beside her mother, I was taking a short stroll with Albertine, whom I had found on the beach tossing up and catching again on a cord an oddly shaped implement which gave her a look of Giotto\u2019s \u2018Idolatry\u2019; it was called, for that matter, \u2018Diabolo,\u2019 and is so fallen into disuse now that, when they come upon the picture of a girl playing with one, the critics of future generations will solemnly discuss, as it might be over one of the allegorical figures in the Arena, what it is that she is holding. A moment later their friend with the penurious and harsh appearance, the same one who on that first day had sneered so malevolently: \u201cI do feel sorry for him, poor old man,\u201d when, she saw the old gentleman\u2019s head brushed by the flying feet of Andr\u00e9e, came up to Albertine with \u201cGood morning,\u2018m I disturbing you?\u201d She had taken off her hat, for comfort, and her hair, like a strange and fascinating-plant, lay over her brow, displaying all the delicate tracery of its foliation^ Albertine, perhaps because she resented seeing the other bare-headed, made-no reply, preserved a frigid silence in spite of which the girl stayed with us, kept apart from myself by Albertine, who arranged at one moment to be-alone with her, at another to walk with me leaving her to follow. I was obliged, to secure an introduction, to ask for it in the girl\u2019s hearing. Then, as Albertine was uttering my name, on the face and in the blue eyes of this girl, whose expression I had thought so cruel when I heard her say: \u201cPoor old man, I do feel so sorry for him,\u201d I saw gather and gleam a cordial, friendly smile, and she held out her hand. Her hair was golden, and not her hair only; for if her cheeks were pink and her eyes blue it was like the still roseate morning sky which sparkles everywhere with dazzling points of gold\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At once kindled by her flame, I said to myself that this was a child who when in love grew shy, that it was for my sake, from love for me that she had remained with us, despite Albertine\u2019s rebuffs, and that she must have rejoiced in the opportunity to confess to me at last, by that smiling, friendly gaze, that she would be as kind to me as she was terrible to other people. Doubtless she had noticed me on the beach, when I still knew nothing of her, and had been thinking of me ever since; perhaps it had been to win my admiration that she mocked at the old gentleman, and because she had not succeeded in getting to know me that on the following days she appeared so morose. From the hotel I had often seen her, in the evenings, walking by herself on the beach. Probably in the hope of meeting me. And now, hindered as much by Albertine\u2019s presence as she would have been by that of the whole band, she had evidently attached herself to us, braving the increasing coldness of her friend\u2019s attitude, only in the hope of outstaying her, of being left alone with me, when she might make an appointment with me for some time when she would find an excuse to slip away without either her family\u2019s or her friends\u2019 knowing that she had gone, and would meet me in some safe place before church or after golf. It was all the more difficult to see her because Andr\u00e9e had quarrelled with her and now detested her. \u201cI have put up far too long with her terrible dishonesty,\u201d she explained to me, \u201cher baseness; I can\u2019t tell you all the vile insults she has heaped on me. I have stood it all because of the others. But her latest effort was really too much!\u201d And she told me of some foolish thing that this girl had done, which might indeed have injurious consequences to Andr\u00e9e herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But those private words promised me by Gis\u00e8le\u2019s confiding eyes for the moment when Albertine should have left us by ourselves, were destined never to be spoken, because after Albertine, stubbornly planted between us, had answered with increasing curtness, and finally had ceased to respond at all to her friend\u2019s remarks, Gis\u00e8le at length abandoned the attempt and turned back. I found fault with Albertine for having been so disagreeable. \u201cIt will teach her to be more careful how she behaves. She\u2019s not a bad kid, but she\u2019d talk the head off a donkey. She\u2019s no business, either, to go poking her nose into everything. Why should she fasten herself on to us without being asked? In another minute, I\u2019d have told her to go to blazes. Besides I can\u2019t stand her going about with her hair like that; it\u2019s such bad form.\u201d I gazed at Albertine\u2019s cheeks as she spoke, and asked myself what might be the perfume, the taste of them: this time they were not cool, but glowed with a uniform pink, violet-tinted, creamy, like certain roses whose petals have a waxy gloss. I felt a passionate longing for them such as one feels sometimes for a particular flower. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed it,\u201d was all that I said. \u201cYou stared at her hard enough; anyone would have said you wanted to paint her portrait,\u201d she scolded, not at all softened by the fact that it was at herself that I was now staring so fixedly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you would care for her, all the same. She\u2019s not in the least a flirt. You like little girls who flirt with you, I know. Anyhow, she won\u2019t have another chance of fastening on to us and being sent about her business; she\u2019s going off to-day to Paris.\u201d \u201cAre the rest of your friends going too?\u201d \u201cNo; only she and \u2018Miss,\u2019 because she\u2019s got an exam, coming; she\u2019s got to stay at home and swot for it, poor kid. It\u2019s not much fun for her, I don\u2019t mind telling you. Of course, you may be set a good subject, you never know. But it\u2019s a tremendous risk. One girl I know was asked: Describe an accident that you have witnessed. That was a piece of luck. But I know another girl who got: State which you would rather have as a friend, Alceste or Philinte. I\u2019m sure I should have dried up altogether! Apart from everything else, it\u2019s not a question to set to girls. Girls go about with other girls; they\u2019re not supposed to have gentlemen friends.\u201d (This announcement, which shewed that I had but little chance of being admitted to the companionship of the band, froze my blood.) \u201cBut in any case, supposing it was set to boys, what on earth would you expect them to say to a question like that? Several parents wrote to the Gaulois, to complain of the difficult questions that were being set. The joke of it is that in a collection of prize-winning essays they gave two which treated the question in absolutely opposite ways. You see, it all depends on which examiner you get. One would like you to say that Philinte was a flatterer and a scoundrel, the other that you couldn\u2019t help admiring Alceste, but that he was too cantankerous, and that as a friend you ought to choose Philinte. How can you expect a lot of unfortunate candidates to know what to say when the professors themselves can\u2019t make up their minds. But that\u2019s nothing. They get more difficult every year. Gis\u00e8le will want all her wits about her if she\u2019s to get through.\u201d I returned to the hotel. My grandmother was not there. I waited for her for some time; when at last she appeared, I begged her to allow me, in quite unexpected circumstances, to make an expedition which might keep me away for a couple of days. I had luncheon with her, ordered a carriage and drove to the station. Gis\u00e8le would shew no surprise at seeing me there. After we had changed at Donci\u00e8res, in the. Paris train, there would be a carriage with a corridor, along which, while the governess dozed, I should be able to lead Gis\u00e8le into dark corners, and make an appointment to meet her on my return to Paris, which I would then try to put forward to the earliest possible date. I would travel with her as far as Caen or Evreux, whichever she preferred, and would take the next train back to Balbec. And yet, what would she have thought of me had she known that I had hesitated for a long time between her and her friends, that quite as much as with her I had contemplated falling in love with Albertine, with the bright-eyed girl, with Rosemonde. I felt a pang of remorse now that a bond of mutual affection was going to unite me with Gis\u00e8le. I could, moreover, truthfully have assured her that Albertine no longer interested me. I had seen her that morning as she swerved aside, almost turning her back on me, to speak to Gis\u00e8le. On her head, which was bent sullenly over her bosom, the hair that grew at the back, different from and darker even than the rest, shone as though she had just been bathing. \u201cLike a dying duck in a thunderstorm!\u201d I thought to myself, this view of her hair having let into Albertine\u2019s body a soul entirely different from that implied hitherto by her glowing complexion and mysterious gaze. That shining cataract of hair at the back of her head had been for a moment or two all that I was able to see of her, and continued to be all that I saw in retrospect. Our memory is like a shop in the window of which is exposed now one, now another photograph of the same person. And as a rule the most recent exhibit remains for some time the only one to be seen. While the coachman whipped on his horse I sat there listening to the words of gratitude and affection which Gis\u00e8le was murmuring in my ear, born, all of them, of her friendly smile and outstretched hand, the fact being that in those periods of my life in which I was not actually, but desired to be in love, I carried in my mind not only an ideal form of beauty once seen, which I recognised at a glance in every passing stranger who kept far enough from me for her confused features to resist any attempt at identification, but also the moral phantom \u2014 ever ready to be incarnate \u2014 of the woman who was \u2018going to fall in love with me, to take up her cues in the amorous comedy which I had had written out in my mind from my earliest boyhood, and in which every nice girl seemed to me to be equally desirous of playing, provided that she had also some of the physical qualifications required. In this play, whoever the new star might be whom I invited to create or to revive the leading part, the plot, the incidents, the lines themselves preserved an unalterable form\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Within the next few days, in spite of the reluctance that Albertine had shewn from introducing me to them, I knew all the little band of that first afternoon (except Gis\u00e8le, whom, owing to a prolonged delay at the level crossing by the station and a change in the time-table, I had not succeeded in meeting on the train, which had been gone some minutes before I arrived, and to whom as it happened I never gave another thought), and two or three other girls as well to whom at my request they introduced me. And thus, my expectation of the pleasure which I should find in a new girl springing from another girl through whom I had come to know her, the latest was like one of those new varieties of rose which gardeners get by using first a rose of another kind. And as I passed from blossom to blossom along this flowery chain, the pleasure of knowing one that was different would send me back to her to whom I was indebted for it, with a gratitude in which desire was mingled fully as much as in my new expectation. Presently I was spending all my time among these girls\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alas! in the freshest flower it is possible to discern those just perceptible signs which to the instructed mind indicate already what will be, by the desiccation or fructification of the flesh that is to-day in bloom, the ultimate form, immutable and already predestinate, of the autumnal seed. The eye rapturously follows a nose like a wavelet that deliriously curls the water\u2019s face at daybreak and seems not to move, to be capturable by the pencil, because the sea is so calm then that one does not notice its tidal flow. Human faces seem not to change while we are looking at them, because the revolution which they perform is too slow for us to perceive it. But we have only to see, by the side of any of those girls, her mother or her aunt, to realise the distance over which, obeying the gravitation of a type that is, generally speaking, deplorable, her features will have travelled in less than thirty years, and must continue to travel until the sunset hour, until her face, having vanished altogether below the horizon, catches the light no more. I knew that, as deep, as ineluctable as is their Jewish patriotism or Christian atavism in those who imagine themselves to be the most emancipated of their race, there dwelt beneath the rosy inflorescence of Albertine, Rosemonde, Andr\u00e9e, unknown to themselves, held in reserve until the circumstances should arise, a coarse nose, a protruding jaw, a bust that would create a sensation when it appeared, but was actually in the wings, ready to \u201ccome on,\u201d just as it might be a burst of Dreyfusism, or clericalism, sudden, unforeseen, fatal, some patriotic, some feudal form of heroism emerging suddenly when the circumstances demand it from a nature anterior to that of the man himself, by means of which he thinks, lives, evolves, gains strength himself or dies, without ever being able to distinguish that nature from the successive phases which in turn he takes for it. Even mentally, we depend a great deal more than we think upon natural laws, and our mind possesses already, like some cryptogamous plant, every little peculiarity that we imagine ourselves to be selecting. For we can see only the derived ideas, without detecting the primary cause (Jewish blood, French birth or whatever it may be) that inevitably produced them, and which at a given moment we expose. And perhaps, while the former appear to us to be the result of deliberate thought, the latter that of an imprudent disregard for our own health, we take from our family, as the papilionaceae take the form of their seed, as well the ideas by which we live as the malady from which we shall die\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As on a plant whose flowers open at different seasons, I had seen, expressed in the form of old ladies, on this Balbec shore, those shrivelled seed-pods, those flabby tubers which my friends would one day be. But what matter? For the moment it was their flowering-time. And so when Mme. de Villeparisis asked me to drive with her I sought an excuse to be prevented. I never went to see Elstir unless accompanied by my new friends. I could not even spare an afternoon to go to Donci\u00e8res, to pay the visit I had promised Saint-Loup. Social engagements, serious discussions, even a friendly conversation, had they usurped the place allotted to my walks with these girls, would have had the same effect on me as if, when the luncheon bell rang, I had been taken not to a table spread with food but to turn the pages of an album. The men, the youths, the women, old or mature, whose society we suppose that we shall enjoy, are borne by us only on an unsubstantial plane surface, because we are conscious of them only by visual perception restricted to its own limits; whereas it is as delegates from our other senses that our eyes dart towards young girls; the senses follow, one after another, in search of the various charms, fragrant, tactile, savoury, which they thus enjoy even without the aid of fingers and lips; and able, thanks to the art of transposition, the genius for synthesis in which desire excels, to reconstruct beneath the hue of cheeks or bosom the feel, the taste, the contact that is forbidden them, they give to these girls the same honeyed consistency as they create when they stand rifling the sweets of a rose-garden, or before a vine whose clusters their eyes alone devour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If it rained, although the weather had no power to daunt Albertine, who was often to be seen in her waterproof spinning on her bicycle through the driving showers, we would Spend the day in the Casino, where on such days it would have seemed to me impossible not to go. I had the greatest contempt for the young Ambresacs, who had never set foot in it. And I willingly joined my friends in playing tricks on the dancing master. As a rule we had to listen to admonition from the manager, or from some of his staff, usurping dictatorial powers, because my friends, even Andr\u00e9e herself, whom on that account I had regarded when I first saw her as so dionysiac a creature, whereas in reality she was delicate, intellectual, and this year far from well, in spite of which her actions were controlled less by the state of her health than by the spirit of that age which overcomes every other consideration and confounds in a general gaiety the weak with the strong, could not enter the outer hall of the rooms without starting to run, jumping over all the chairs, sliding back along the floor, their balance maintained by a graceful poise of their outstretched arms, singing the while, mingling all the arts, in that first bloom of youth, in the manner of those poets of ancient days for whom the different \u2018kinds\u2019 were not yet separate, so that in an epic poem they would introduce rules of agriculture with theological doctrine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This Andr\u00e9e who had struck me when I first saw them as the coldest of them all, was infinitely more refined, more loving, more sensitive than Albertine, to whom she displayed the caressing, gentle affection of an elder sister. At the Casino she would come across the floor to sit down by me, and knew instinctively, unlike Albertine, to refuse my invitation to dance, or even, if I was tired, to give up the Casino and come to me instead at the hotel. She expressed her friendship for me, for Albertine, in terms which were evidence of the most exquisite understanding of the things of the heart, which may have been partly due to the state of her health. She had always a merry smile of excuse for the childish behaviour of Albertine, who expressed with a crude violence the irresistible temptation held out to her by the parties and picnics to which she had not the sense, like Andr\u00e9e, resolutely to prefer staying and talking with me. When the time came for her to go off to a luncheon party at the golf-club, if we were all three together she would get ready to leave us, then, coming up to Andr\u00e9e: \u201cWell, Andr\u00e9e, what are you waiting for now? You know we are lunching at the golf-club.\u201d \u201cNo; I\u2019m going to stay and talk to him,\u201d replied Andr\u00e9e, pointing to me. \u201cBut you know, Mme. Durieux invited you,\u201d cried Albertine, as if Andree\u2019s intention to remain with me could be explained only by ignorance on her part where else and by whom she had been bidden. \u201cLook here, my good girl, don\u2019t be such an idiot,\u201d Andr\u00e9e chid her. Albertine did not insist, fearing a suggestion that she too should stay with me. She tossed her head. \u201cJust as you like,\u201d was her answer, uttered in the tone one uses to an invalid whose self-indulgence is killing him by inches, \u201cI must fly; I\u2019m sure your watch is slow,\u201d and off she went. \u201cShe is a dear girl, but quite impossible,\u201d said Andr\u00e9e, bathing her friend in a smile at once caressing and critical. If in this craze for amusement Albertine might be said to echo something of the old original Gilberte, that is because a certain similarity exists, although the type evolves, between all the women we love, a similarity that is due to the fixity of our own temperament, which it is that chooses them, eliminating all those who would not be at once our opposite and our complement, fitted that is to say to gratify our senses and to wring our heart. They are, these women, a product of our temperament, an image inversely projected, a negative of our sensibility. So that a novelist might, in relating the life of his hero, describe his successive love-affairs in almost exactly similar terms, and thereby give the impression not that he was repeating himself but that he was creating, since an artificial novelty is never so effective as a repetition that manages to suggest a fresh truth. He ought, moreover, to indicate in the character of the lover a variability which becomes apparent as the story moves into fresh regions, into different latitudes of life. And perhaps he would be stating yet another truth if while investing all the other persons of his story with distinct characters he refrained from giving any to the beloved. We understand the characters of people who do not interest us; how can we ever grasp that of a person who is an intimate part of our existence, whom after a little we no longer distinguish in any way from ourselves, whose motives provide us with an inexhaustible supply of anxious hypotheses which we perpetually reconstruct. Springing from somewhere beyond our understanding, our curiosity as to the woman whom we love overleaps the bounds of that woman\u2019s character, which we might if we chose but probably will not choose to stop and examine. The object of our uneasy investigation is something more essential than those details of character comparable to the tiny particles of epidermis whose varied combinations form the florid originality of human flesh. Our intuitive radiography pierces them, and the images which it photographs for us, so far from being those of any single face, present rather the joyless universality of a skeleton\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Andr\u00e9e, being herself extremely rich while the other was penniless and an orphan, with real generosity lavished on Albertine the full benefit of her wealth. As for her feelings towards Gis\u00e8le, they were not quite what I had been led to suppose. News soon reached us of the young student, and when Albertine handed round the letter she had received, a letter intended by Gis\u00e8le to give an account of her journey and to report her safe arrival to the little band, pleading laziness as an excuse for not having written yet to the rest, I was surprised to hear Andr\u00e9e (for I imagined an irreparable breach between them) say: \u201cI shall write to her to-morrow, because if I wait for her to write I may have to wait for years, she\u2019s such a slacker.\u201d And, turning to myself, she added: \u201cYou saw nothing much in her, evidently; but she\u2019s a jolly nice girl, and besides I\u2019m really very fond of her.\u201d From which I concluded that Andr\u00e9e\u2019s quarrels were apt not to last very long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Except on these rainy days, as we had always arranged to go on our bicycles along the cliffs, or on an excursion inland, an hour or so before it was time to start I would go upstairs to make myself smart and would complain if Fran\u00e7oise had not laid out all the things that I wanted. Now even in Paris she would proudly, angrily straighten a back which the years had begun to bend, at the first word of reproach, she so humble, she so modest and charming when her self-esteem was flattered. As this was the mainspring of her life: her satisfaction, her good humour were in direct ratio to the difficulty of the tasks imposed on her. Those which she had to perform at Balbec were so easy that she shewed almost all the time a discontent which was suddenly multiplied an hundredfold, with the addition of an ironic air of offended dignity when I complained, on my way down to join my friends, that my hat had not been brushed or my ties sorted. She who was capable of taking such endless pains, without in consequence assuming that she had done anything at all, on my simply remarking that a coat was not in its proper place, not only did she boast of the care with which she had \u201cput it past sooner than let it go gathering the dust,\u201d but, paying a formal tribute to her own labours, lamented that it was little enough of a holiday that she was getting at Balbec, and that we would not find another person in the whole world who would consent to put up with such treatment. \u201cI can\u2019t think how anyone can leave things lying about the way you do; you just try and get anyone else to find what you want in such a mix-up. The devil himself would give it up as a bad job.\u201d Or else she would adopt a regal mien, scorching me with her fiery glance, and preserve a silence that was broken as soon as she had fastened the door behind her and was outside in the passage, which would then reverberate with utterances which I guessed to be insulting, though they remained as indistinct as those of characters in a play whose opening lines are spoken in the wings, before they appear on the stage. And even if nothing was missing and Fran\u00e7oise was in a good temper, still she made herself quite intolerable when I was getting ready to go out with my friends. For, drawing upon a store of stale witticisms at their expense which, in my need to be talking about the girls, I had made in her hearing, she put on an air of being about to reveal to me things of which I should have known more than she had there been any truth in her statements, which there never was, Fran\u00e7oise having misunderstood what she had heard. She had, like most people, her own ways; a person is never like a straight highway, but surprises us with the strange, unavoidable windings of his course through life, by which, though some people may not notice them, we find it a perpetual annoyance to be stopped and hindered. Whenever I arrived at the stage of \u201cWhere is my hat?\u201d or uttered the name of Andr\u00e9e or Albertine, I was forced by Fran\u00e7oise to stray into endless and absurd side-tracks which greatly delayed my progress. So too when I asked her to cut me the sandwiches of cheese or salad, or sent her out for the cakes which I was to eat while we rested on the cliffs, sharing them with the girls, and which the girls \u201cmight very well have taken turns to provide, if they had not been so close,\u201d declared Fran\u00e7oise, to whose aid there came at such moments a whole heritage of atavistic peasant rapacity and coarseness, and for whom one would have said that the soul of her late enemy Eulalie had been broken into fragments and reincarnate, more attractively than it had ever been in Saint-Eloi\u2019s, in the charming bodies of my friends of the little band. I listened to these accusations with a dull fury at finding myself brought to a standstill at one of those places beyond which the well-trodden country path that was Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s character became impassable, though fortunately never for very long. Then, my hat or coat found and the sandwiches ready, I sailed out to find Albertine, Andr\u00e9e, Rosemonde, and any others there might be, and on foot or on our bicycles we would start\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the old days I should have preferred our excursion to be made in bad weather. For then I still looked to find in Balbec the \u2018Cimmerians\u2019 land,\u2019 and fine days were a thing that had no right to exist there, an intrusion of the vulgar summer of seaside holiday-makers into that ancient region swathed in eternal mist. But now, everything that I had hitherto despised, shut out of my field of vision, not only effects of sunlight upon sea and shore, but even the regattas, the race-meetings, I would have sought out with ardour, for the reason for which formerly I had wanted only stormy seas, which was that these were now associated in my mind, as the others had been, with an aesthetic idea. Because I had gone several times with my new friends to visit Elstir, and, on the days when the girls were there, what he had selected to shew us were drawings of pretty women in yachting dress, or else a sketch made on a race-course near Balbec. I had at first shyly admitted to Elstir that I had not felt inclined to go to the meetings that were being held there. \u201cYou were wrong,\u201d he told me, \u201cit is such a pretty sight, and so well worth seeing. For one thing, that peculiar animal, the jockey, on whom so many eager eyes are fastened, who in the paddock there looks so grim, a colourless face between his brilliant jacket and cap, one body and soul with the prancing horse he rides, how interesting to analyse his professional movements, the bright splash of colour he makes, with the horse\u2019s coat blending in it, as they stream down the course. What a transformation of every visible object in that luminous vastness of a racecourse where one is constantly surprised by fresh lights and shades which one sees only there. How charming the women can look there, too! The first day\u2019s racing was quite delightful, and there were women there exquisitely dressed, in the misty light of a Dutch landscape, in which one could feel rising to cloud the sun itself the penetrating coldness of the water. Never have I seen women arriving in carriages, or standing with glasses to their eyes in so extraordinary a light, which was due, I suppose, to the moisture from the sea. I should simply have loved to paint it. I came home from the races quite mad, and so keen to get to work! \u201cAfter which he became more enthusiastic still over the yacht-races, and I realised that regattas, social fixtures where well-dressed women might be seen bathed in the greenish light of a marine race-course, might be for a modern artist as interesting a subject as were the revels which they so loved to depict for a Veronese or Carpaccio. When I suggested this to Elstir, \u201cYour comparison is all the more true,\u201d he replied, \u201csince, from the position of the city in which they painted, those revels were to a great extent aquatic. Except that the beauty of the shipping in those days lay as a rule in its solidity, in the complication of its structure. They had water-tournaments, as we have here, held generally in honour of some Embassy, such as Carpaccio shews us in his Legend of Saint Ursula. The vessels were massive, built up like architecture, and seemed almost amphibious, like lesser Venices set in the heart of the greater, when, moored to the banks by hanging stages decked with crimson satin and Persian carpets, they bore their freight of ladies in cherry-red brocade and green damask close under the balconies incrusted with many-coloured marbles from which other ladies leaned to gaze at them, in gowns with black sleeves slashed with white, stitched with pearls or bordered with lace. You cannot tell where the land ends and the water begins, what is still the palace or already the vessel, the caravel, the galeas, the Bucintoro.\u201d Albertine had listened with the keenest interest to these details of costume, these visions of elegance that Elstir was describing to us. \u201cOh, I should so like to see that lace you speak of; it\u2019s so pretty, the Venice-point,\u201d she cried. \u201cBesides, I should love to see Venice.\u201d \u201cYou may, perhaps, before very long, be able,\u201d Elstir informed her, \u201cto gaze upon the marvellous stuffs which they used to wear. Hitherto one has seen them only in the works of the Venetian painters, or very rarely among the treasures of old churches, except now and then when a specimen has come into the sale-room. But I hear that a Venetian artist, called Fortuny, has recovered the secret of the craft, and that before many years have passed women will be able to walk abroad, and better still to sit at home in brocades as sumptuous as those that Venice adorned, for her patrician daughters, with patterns brought from the Orient. But I don\u2019t know that I should much care for that, that it wouldn\u2019t be too much of an anachronism for the women of to-day, even when they parade at regattas, for, to return to our modern pleasure-craft, the times have completely changed since \u2018Venice, Queen of the Adriatic.\u2019 The great charm of a yacht, of the furnishings of a yacht, of yachting dress, is their simplicity, as just things for the sea, and I do so love the sea. I must confess to you that I prefer the fashions of to-day to those of Veronese\u2019s and even of Carpaccio\u2019s time. What there is so attractive about our yachts \u2014 and the smaller yachts especially, I don\u2019t like the huge ones, they\u2019re too much like ships; yachts are like women\u2019s hats, you must keep within certain limits \u2014 is the unbroken surface, simple, gleaming, grey, which under a cloudy, leaden sky takes on a creamy softness. The cabin in which we live ought to make us think of a little caf\u00e9. And women\u2019s clothes on board a yacht are the same sort of thing; what really are charming are those light garments, uniformly white, of cloth or linen or nankeen or drill, which in the sunlight and against the blue of the sea shew up with as dazzling a whiteness as a spread sail. You very seldom see a woman, for that matter, who knows how to dress, and yet some of them are quite wonderful. At the races, Mlle. L\u00e9a had a little white hat and a little white sunshade, simply enchanting. I don\u2019t know what I wouldn\u2019t give for that little sunshade.\u201d I should have liked very much to know in what respect this little sunshade differed from any other, and for other reasons, reasons of feminine vanity, Albertine was still more curious. But, just as Fran\u00e7oise used to explain the excellence of her souffl\u00e9s by \u201cIt\u2019s the way you do them,\u201d so here the difference lay in the cut. \u201cIt was,\u201d Elstir explained, \u201cquite tiny, quite round, like a Chinese umbrella.\u201d I mentioned the sunshades carried by various ladies, but it was not like any of them. Elstir found them all quite hideous. A man of exquisite taste, singularly hard to please, he would isolate some minute detail which was the whole difference between what was worn by three-quarters of the women he saw, and horrified him, and a thing which enchanted him by its prettiness; and \u2014 in contrast to its effect on myself, whose mind any display of luxury at once sterilised \u2014 stimulated his desire to paint \u201cso as to make something as attractive.\u201d \u201cHere you see a young lady who has guessed what the hat and sunshade were like,\u201d he said to me, pointing to Albertine whose eyes shone with envy. \u201cHow I should love to be rich, to have a yacht!\u201d she said to the painter. \u201cI should come to you to tell me how to run it. What lovely trips I\u2019d take. And what fun it would be to go to Cowes for the races. And a motor-car! Tell me, do you think the ladies\u2019 fashions for motoring pretty?\u201d \u201cNo\u201d; replied Elstir, \u201cbut that will come in time. You see, there are very few firms at present, one or two only, Callot \u2014 although they go in rather too freely for lace \u2014 Doucet, Cheruit, Paquin sometimes. The others are all horrible.\u201d \u201cThen, is there a vast difference between a Callot dress and one from any ordinary shop?\u201d I asked Albertine. \u201cWhy, an enormous difference, my little man! I beg your pardon! Only, alas! what you get for three hundred francs in an ordinary shop will cost two thousand there. But there can be no comparison; they look the same only to people who know nothing at all about it.\u201d \u201cQuite so,\u201d put in Elstir; \u201cthough I should not go so far as to say that it is as profound as the difference between a statue from Rheims Cathedral and one from Saint-Augustin. By the way, talking of cathedrals,\u201d he went on, addressing himself exclusively to me, because what he was saying had reference to an earlier conversation in which the girls had not taken part, and which for that matter would not have interested them at all, \u201cI spoke to you the other day of Balbec Church as a great cliff, a huge breakwater built of the stone of the country; now look at this\u201d; he handed me a water-colour. \u201cLook at these cliffs (it\u2019s a sketch I did close to here, at the Creuniers); don\u2019t these rocks remind you of a cathedral?\u201d And indeed one would have taken them for soaring red arches. But, painted on a roasting hot day, they seemed to have crumbled into dust, made volatile by the heat which had drunk up half the sea, distilled over the whole surface of the picture almost into a gaseous state. On this day on which the sunlight had, so to speak, destroyed reality, reality concentrated itself in certain dusky and transparent creatures which, by contrast, gave a more striking, a closer impression of life: the shadows. Ravening after coolness, most of them, deserting the scorched open spaces, had fled for shelter to the foot of the rocks, out of reach of the sun; others, swimming gently upon the tide, like dolphins, kept close under the sides of the moving vessels, whose hulls they extended upon the pale surface of the water with their glossy blue forms. It was perhaps the thirst for coolness which they conveyed that did most to give me the sensation of the heat of this day and made me exclaim how much I regretted not knowing the Creuniers. Albertine and Andr\u00e9e were positive that I must have been there hundreds of times. If so I had been there without knowing it, never suspecting that one day the sight of these rocks was to inspire me with such a thirst for beauty, not perhaps exactly natural beauty such as I had been seeking hitherto among the cliffs of Balbec, but rather architectural. Above all, I who, having come here to visit the kingdom of the storm, had never found, on any of my drives with Mme. de Villeparisis, when often we saw it only from afar, painted in a gap between the trees, the ocean sufficiently real, sufficiently liquid, giving a sufficient impression that it was hurling its massed forces against the shore, and would have liked to see it lie motionless only under a wintry shroud of fog, I could never have believed that I should now be dreaming of a sea which was nothing more than a whitish vapour that had lost both consistency and colour. But of such a sea Elstir, like the people who sat musing on board those vessels drowsy with the heat, had so intensely felt the enchantment that he had succeeded in transcribing, in fixing for all time upon the painted sheet the imperceptible reflux of the tide, the throb of one happy moment; and one suddenly became so enamoured, at the sight of this magic portrait, that one could think of nothing else than to range the world over, seeking to recapture the vanished day in its instantaneous, slumbering beauty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So that if before these visits to Elstir, before I had set eyes on one of his sea-pictures in which a young woman in a dress of white serge or linen, on the deck of a yacht flying the American flag, had duplicated a white linen dress and coloured flag in my imagination which at once bred in me an insatiable desire to visit the spot and see there with my own eyes white linen dresses and flags against the sea, as though no such experience had ever yet befallen me, always until then I had taken care when I stood by the sea to expel from my field of vision, as well as the bathers in the foreground, the yachts with their too dazzling sails that were like seaside costumes, everything that prevented me from persuading myself that I was contemplating the immemorial flood of ocean which had been moving with the same mysterious life before the appearance of the human race; and had grudged even the days of radiant sunshine which seemed to me to invest with the trivial aspect of the world\u2019s universal summer this coast of fog and tempest, to mark simply an interruption, equivalent to what in music is known as a rest; now on the other hand it was the bad days that appeared to me to be some disastrous accident, a thing that could no longer find any place for itself in the world of beauty; I felt a keen desire to go out and recapture in reality what had so powerfully aroused my imagination, and I hoped that the weather would be propitious enough for me to see from the summit of the cliff the same blue shadows as were in Elstir\u2019s picture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nor, as I went along, did I still make a frame about my eyes with my hands as in the days when, conceiving nature to be animated by a life anterior to the first appearance of man, and inconsistent with all those wearisome perfections of industrial achievement which had hitherto made me yawn with boredom at Universal Exhibitions or in the milliners\u2019 windows, I endeavoured to include only that section of the sea over which there was no steamer passing, so that I might picture it to myself as immemorial, still contemporary with the ages in which it had been set apart from the land, or at least with the first dawn of life in Greece, which enabled me to repeat in their literal meaning the lines of \u2018Father Leconte\u2019 of which Bloch was so fond:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018Gone are the Kings, gone are their towering prows\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vanished upon the raging deep, alas\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The long-haired warrior heroes of Hellas.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I could no longer despise the milliners, now that Elstir had told me that the delicate touches by which they give a last refinement, a supreme caress to the ribbons or feathers of a hat after it is finished, would be as interesting to him to paint as the muscular action of the jockeys themselves (a statement which had delighted Albertine). But I must wait until I had returned \u2014 for milliners, to Paris \u2014 for regattas and races to Balbec, where there would be no more now until next year-. Even a yacht with women in white linen garments was not to be found\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Often we encountered Bloch\u2019s sisters, to whom I was obliged to bow since I had dined with their father. My new friends did not know them. \u201cI am not allowed to play with Israelites,\u201d Albertine explained. Her way of pronouncing the word \u2014\u2018Issraelites\u2019 instead of \u2018Izraelites\u2019\u2014 would in itself have sufficed to shew, even if one had not heard the rest of the sentence, that it was no feeling of friendliness towards the chosen race that inspired these young Frenchwomen, brought up in God-fearing homes, and quite ready to believe that the Jews were in the habit of massacring Christian children. \u201cBesides, they\u2019re shocking bad form, your friends,\u201d said Andr\u00e9e with a smile which implied that she knew very well that they were no friends of mine. \u201cLike everything to do with the tribe,\u201d went on Albertine, in the sententious tone of one who spoke from personal experience. To tell the truth, Bloch\u2019s sisters, at once overdressed and half naked, with their languishing, bold, blatant, sluttish air did not create the best impression. And one of their cousins, who was only fifteen, scandalised the Casino by her unconcealed admiration for Mlle. Lea, whose talent as an actress M. Bloch senior rated very high, but whose tastes were understood to lead her not exactly in the direction of the gentlemen\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some days we took our refreshment at one of the outlying farms which catered to visitors. These were the farms known as Les Ecorres, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, La Croix d\u2019Heuland, Bagatelle, Californie and Marie-Antoinette. It was the last that had been adopted by the little band\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But at other times, instead of going to a farm, we would climb to the highest point of the cliff, and, when we had reached it and were seated on the grass, would undo our parcel of sandwiches and cakes. My friends preferred the sandwiches, and were surprised to see me eat only a single chocolate cake, sugared with gothic tracery, or an apricot tart. This was because, with the sandwiches of cheese or of green-stuff, a form of food that was novel to me and knew nothing of the past, I had nothing in common. But the cakes understood, the tarts were gossips. There were in the former an insipid taste of cream, in the latter a fresh taste of fruit which knew all about Combray, and about Gilberte, not only the Gilberte of Combray but her too of Paris, at whose tea-parties I had found them again. They reminded me of those cake-plates of the Arabian Nights pattern, the subjects on which were such a distraction to my aunt L\u00e9onie when Fran\u00e7oise brought her up, one day, Aladdin or the Wonderful Lamp, another day Ali-Baba, or the Sleeper Awakes, or Sinbad the Sailor embarking at Bassorah with all his treasure. I should dearly have liked to see them again, but my grandmother did not know what had become of them, and thought moreover that they were just common plates that had been bought in the village. No matter, in that grey, midland Combray scene they and their pictures were set like many-coloured jewels, as in the dark church were the windows with their shifting radiance, as in the dusk of my bedroom were the projections cast by the magic-lantern, as in the foreground of the view of the railway-station and the little local line the buttercups from the Indies and the Persian lilacs, as were my great-aunt\u2019s shelves of old porcelain in the sombre dwelling of an elderly lady in a country town\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stretched out on the cliff I would see before me nothing but grassy meadows and beyond them not the seven heavens of the Christian cosmogony but two stages only, one of a deeper blue, the sea, and over it another more pale. We ate our food, and if I had brought with me also some little keepsake which might appeal to one or other of my friends, joy sprang with such sudden violence into her translucent face, flushed in an instant, that her lips had not the strength to hold it in, and to allow it to escape parted in a shout of laughter. They had gathered close round me, and between their faces which were almost touching one another the air that separated them traced azure pathways such as might have been cut by a gardener wishing to clear the ground a little so as to be able himself to move freely through a thicket of roses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When we had finished eating we would play games which until then I should have thought boring, sometimes such childish games as King of the Castle, or Who Laughs First; not for a kingdom would I have renounced them now; the rosy dawn of adolescence, with which the faces of these girls were still aglow, and from which I, young as I was, had already emerged, shed its light on everything round about them and, like the fluid painting of some of the Primitives, brought out the most insignificant details of their daily lives in relief against a golden background. Even the faces of the girls were, for the most part, clouded with this misty effulgence of a dawn from which their actual features had not yet emerged. One saw only a charming sheet of colour beneath which what in a few years\u2019 time would be a profile was not discernible. The profile of to-day had nothing definite about it, and could be only a momentary resemblance to some deceased member of the family to whom nature had paid this commemorative courtesy. It comes so soon, the moment when there is nothing left to wait for, when the body is fixed in an immobility which holds no fresh surprise in store, when one loses all hope on seeing \u2014 as on a tree in the height of summer leaves already brown \u2014 round a face still young hair that is growing thin or turning grey; it is so short, that radiant morning time that one comes to like only the very youngest girls, those in whom the flesh, like a precious leaven, is still at work. They are no more yet than a stream of ductile matter, moulded ever afresh by the fleeting impression of the moment. You would say that each of them was in turn a little statuette of childish gaiety, of a child grown earnest, coaxing, surprised, taking its pattern from an expression frank and complete, but fugitive. This plasticity gives a wealth of variety and charm to the pretty attentions which a little girl pays to us. Of course, such attentions are indispensable in the woman also, and she whom we do not attract, or who fails to let us see that we have attracted her, tends to assume in our eyes a somewhat tedious uniformity. But even these pretty attentions, after a certain age, cease to send gentle ripples over a face which the struggle for existence has hardened, has rendered unalterably militant or ecstatic. One \u2014 owing to the prolonged strain of the obedience that subjects wife to husband \u2014 will seem not so much a woman\u2019s face as a soldier\u2019s; another, carved by the sacrifices which a mother has consented to make, day after day, for her children, will be the face of an apostle. A third is, after a stormy passage through the years, the face of an ancient mariner, upon a body of which its garments alone indicate the sex. Certainly the attentions that a woman pays us can still, so long as we are in love with her, scatter fresh charms over the hours that we spend in her company. But she is not then for us a series of different women. Her gaiety remains external to an unchanging face. Whereas adolescence is anterior to this complete solidification; and from this it follows that we feel, in the company of young girls, the refreshing sense that is afforded us by the spectacle of forms undergoing an incessant process of change, a play of unstable forces which makes us think of that perpetual re-creation of the primordial elements of nature which we contemplate when we stand by the sea\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was not merely a social engagement, a drive with Mme. de Villeparisis, that I would have sacrificed to the \u2018Ferret\u2019 or \u2018Guessing Games\u2019 of my friends. More than once, Robert de Saint-Loup had sent word that, since I was not coming to see him at Donci\u00e8res, he had applied for twenty-four hours\u2019 leave, which he would spend at Balbec. Each time I wrote back that he was on no account to come, offering the excuse that I should be obliged to be away myself that very day, when I had some duty call to pay with my grandmother on family friends in the neighbourhood. No doubt I fell in his estimation when he learned from his aunt in what the \u2018duty call\u2019 consisted, and who the persons were who combined to play the part of my grandmother. And yet I had not been wrong, perhaps, after all, in sacrificing not only the vain pleasures of the world but the real pleasure of friendship to that of spending the whole day in this green garden. People who enjoy the capacity \u2014 it is true that such people are artists, and I had long been convinced that I should never be that \u2014 are also under an obligation to live for themselves. And friendship is a dispensation from this duty, an abdication of self. Even conversation, which is the mode of expression of friendship, is a superficial digression which gives us no new acquisition. We may talk for a lifetime without doing more than indefinitely repeat the vacuity of a minute, whereas the march of thought in the solitary travail of artistic creation proceeds downwards, into the depths, in the only direction that is not closed to us, along which we are free to advance \u2014 though with more effort, it is true \u2014 towards a goal of truth. And friendship is not merely devoid of virtue, like conversation, it is fatal to us as well. For the sense of boredom which it is impossible not to feel in a friend\u2019s company (when, that is to say, we must remain exposed on the surface of our consciousness, instead of pursuing our voyage of discovery into the depths) for those of us in whom the law of development is purely internal \u2014 that first impression of boredom our friendship impels us to correct when we are alone again, to recall with emotion the words uttered by our friend, to look upon them as a valuable addition to our substance, albeit we are not like buildings to which stones can be added from without, but like trees which draw from their own sap the knot that duly appears on their trunks, the spreading roof of their foliage. I was lying to myself, I was interrupting the process of growth in that direction in which I could indeed really be enlarged and made happy, when I congratulated myself on being liked, admired, by so good, so clever, so rare a creature as Saint-Loup, when I focussed my mind, not upon my own obscure impressions which duty bade me unravel, but on the words uttered by my friend, in which, when I repeated them to myself \u2014 when I had them repeated to me by that other self who dwells in us and on to whom we are always so ready to transfer the burden of taking thought \u2014 I strove to make myself find a beauty very different from that which I used to pursue in silence when I was really alone, but one that would enhance the merit of Robert, of myself, of my life. In the life which a friend like this provided for me, I seemed to myself to be comfortably preserved from solitude, nobly desirous of sacrificing myself for him, in fact quite incapable of realising myself. Among the girls, on the other hand, if the pleasure which I enjoyed was selfish, at least it was not based on the lie which seeks to make us believe that we are not irremediably alone, and which, when we talk to another person, prevents us from admitting that it is no longer we who speak, that we are fashioning ourselves in the likeness of strangers and not of our own ego, which is quite different from them. The words that passed between the girls of the little band and myself were not of any interest; they were, moreover, but few, broken by long spells of silence on my part. All of which did not prevent me from finding, in listening to them when they spoke to me, as much pleasure as in gazing at them, in discovering in the voice of each one of them a brightly coloured picture. It was with ecstasy that I caught their pipings. Love helps us to discern things, to discriminate. Standing in a wood, the lover of birds at once distinguishes the notes of the different species, which to ordinary people sound the same. The lover of girls knows that human voices vary even more. Each one possesses more notes than the richest instrument of music. And the combinations in which the voice groups those notes are as inexhaustible as the infinite variety of personalities. When I talked with any one of my friends I was conscious that the original, the unique portrait of her individuality had been skilfully traced, tyranically imposed on my mind as much by the inflexions of her voice as by those of her face, and that these were two separate spectacles which rendered, each in its own plane, the same single reality. No doubt the lines of the voice, like those of the face, were not yet definitely fixed; the voice had still to break, as the face to change. Just as children have a gland the secretion in which enables them to digest milk, a gland which is not found in grown men and women, so there were in the twitterings of these girls notes which women\u2019s voices no longer contain. And on this instrument with its greater compass they played with their lips, shewing all the application, the ardour of Bellini\u2019s little angel musicians, qualities which also are an exclusive appanage of youth. Later on these girls would lose that note of enthusiastic conviction which gave a charm to their simplest utterances, whether it were Albertine who, in a tone of authority, repeated puns to which the younger ones listened with admiration, until that wild impulse to laugh caught them all with the irresistible violence of a sneeze, or Andr\u00e9e who began to speak of their work in the schoolroom, work even more childish seemingly than the games they played, with a gravity essentially puerile; and their words changed in tone, like the lyrics of ancient times when poetry, still hardly differentiated from music, was declaimed upon the different notes of a scale. In spite of which, the girls\u2019 voices already gave a quite clear indication of the attitude that each of these little people had adopted towards life, an attitude so personal that it would be speaking in far too general terms to say of one: \u201cShe treats everything as a joke,\u201d of another: \u201cShe jumps from assertion to assertion,\u201d of a third: \u201cShe lives in a state of expectant hesitation.\u201d The features of our face are hardly more than gestures which force of habit has made permanent. Nature, like the destruction of Pompeii, like the metamorphosis of a nymph into a tree, has arrested us in an accustomed movement. Similarly, our intonations embody our philosophy of life, what a person says to himself about things at any given moment. No doubt these peculiarities were to be found not only in the girls. They were those of their parents. The individual is a part of something that is more generally diffused than himself. By this reckoning, our parents furnish us not only with those habitual gestures which are the outlines of our face and voice, but also with certain mannerisms in speech, certain favourite expressions, which, almost as unconscious as an intonation, almost as profound, indicate likewise a definite point of view towards life. It is quite true, since we are speaking of girls, that there are certain of these expressions which their parents do not hand on to them until they have reached a certain age, as a rule not before they are women. These are kept in reserve. Thus, for instance, if you were to speak of the pictures of one of Elstir\u2019s friends, Andr\u00e9e, whose hair was still \u2018down,\u2019 could not yet make use, personally, of the expression which her mother and elder sister employed: \u201cIt appears, the man is quite charming!\u201d But that would come in due course, when she was allowed to go to the Palais-Royal. And already, since her first communion, Albertine had begun to say, like a friend of her aunt: \u201cI\u2019m sure I should find that simply terrible!\u201d She had also had given to her, as a little present, the habit of repeating whatever you had just been saying to her, so as to appear to be interested, and to be trying to form an opinion of her own. If you said that an artist\u2019s work was good, or his house nice, \u201cOh, his work is good, is it?\u201d \u201cOh, his house is nice, is it?\u201d Last of all, and even more general than the family heritage, was the rich layer imposed by the native province from which they derived their voices and of which indeed their intonations smacked. When Andr\u00e9e sharply struck a solemn note she could not prevent the Perigordian string of her vocal instrument from giving back a resonant sound quite in harmony, moreover, with the Meridional purity of her features; while to the incessant pranks of Rosemonde the substance of her North-Country face and voice responded, whatever her mood at the time, in the accent of their province. Between that province and the temperament of the little girl who dictated these inflexions, I caught a charming dialogue. A dialogue, not in any sense a discord. It would not have been possible to separate the girl herself and her native place. She was herself; she was still it also. Moreover this reaction of locally procured materials on the genius who utilises them and to whose work their reaction imparts an added freshness, does not make the work any less individual, and whether it be that of an architect, a cabinet-maker or a composer, it reflects no less minutely the most subtle shades of the artist\u2019s personality, because he has been compelled to work in the millstone of Senlis or the red sandstone of Strasbourg, has respected the knots peculiar to the ash-tree, has borne in mind, when writing his score, the resources, the limitations, the volume of sound, the possibilities of flute or alto voice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All this I realised, and yet we talked so little. Whereas with Mme. de Villeparisis or Saint-Loup I should have displayed by my words a great deal more pleasure than I should actually have felt, for I used always to be worn out when I parted from them; when, on the other hand, I was lying on the grass among all these girls, the plenitude of what I was feeling infinitely outweighed the paucity, the infrequency of our speech, and brimmed over from my immobility and silence in floods of happiness, the waves of which rippled up to die at the feet of these young roses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For a convalescent who rests all day long in a flower-garden or orchard, a scent of flowers or fruit does not more completely pervade the thousand trifles that compose his idle hours than did for me that colour, that fragrance in search of which my eyes kept straying towards the girls, and the sweetness of which finally became incorporated in me. So it is that grapes grow sugary in sunshine. And by their slow continuity these simple little games had gradually wrought in me also, as in those who do nothing else all day but lie outstretched by the sea, breathing the salt air and growing sunburned, a relaxation, a blissful smile, a vague sense of dizziness that had spread from brain to eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now and then a pretty attention from one or another of them would stir in me vibrations which dissipated for a time my desire for the rest. Thus one day Albertine had suddenly asked: \u201cWho has a pencil?\u201d Andr\u00e9e had provided one, Rosemonde the paper; Albertine had warned them: \u201cNow, young ladies, you are not to look at what I write.\u201d After carefully tracing each letter, supporting the paper on her knee, she had passed it to me with: \u201cTake care no one sees.\u201d Whereupon I had unfolded it and read her message, which was: \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut we mustn\u2019t sit here scribbling nonsense,\u201d she cried, turning impetuously, with a sudden gravity of demeanour, to Andr\u00e9e and Rosemonde\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI ought to shew you the letter I got from Gis\u00e8le this morning. What an idiot I am; I\u2019ve had it all this time in my pocket \u2014 and you can\u2019t think how important it may be to us.\u201d Gis\u00e8le had been moved to copy out for her friend, so that it might be passed on to the others, the essay which she had written in her certificate examination. Albertine\u2019s fears as to the difficulty of the subjects set had been more than justified by the two from which Gis\u00e8le had had to choose. The first was: \u201cSophocles, from the Shades, writes to Racine to console him for the failure of Athalie\u201c; the other: \u201cSuppose that, after the first performance of Esther, Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 is writing to Mme. de La Fayette to tell her how much she regretted her absence.\u201d Now Gis\u00e8le, in an excess of zeal which ought to have touched the examiners\u2019 hearts, had chosen the former, which was also the more difficult of the two subjects, and had handled it with such remarkable skill that she had been given fourteen marks, and had been congratulated by the board. She would have received her \u2018mention\u2019 if she had not \u2018dried up\u2019 in the Spanish paper. The essay, a copy of which Gis\u00e8le had now sent her, was immediately read aloud to us by Albertine, for, having presently to pass the same examination, she was anxious to have an opinion from Andr\u00e9e, who was by far the cleverest of them all and might be able to give her some good \u2018tips.\u2019 \u201cShe did have a bit of luck!\u201d was Albertine\u2019s comment.\u201cIt\u2019s the very subject her French mistress made her swot up while she was here.\u201d The letter from Sophocles to Racine, as drafted by Gis\u00e8le, ran as follows: \u201cMy dear friend, You must pardon me the liberty of addressing you when I have not the honour of your personal acquaintance, but your latest tragedy, Athalie, shews, does it not, that you have made the most thorough study of my own modest works. You have not only put poetry in the mouths of the protagonists, or principal persons of the drama, but you have written other, and, let me tell you without flattery, charming verses for the choruses, a feature which was not too bad, according to all one hears, in Greek Tragedy, but is a complete novelty in France. Nay more, your talent always so fluent, so finished, so winning, so fine, so delicate, has here acquired an energy on which I congratulate you. Athalie, Joad \u2014 these are figures which your rival Corneille could have wrought no better. The characters are virile, the plot simple and strong. You have given us a tragedy in which love is not the keynote, and on this I must offer you my sincerest compliments. The most familiar proverbs are not always the truest. I will give you an example:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018This passion treat, which makes the poet\u2019s art\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fly, as on wings, straight to the listener\u2019s heart.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You have shewn us that the religious sentiment in which your choruses are steeped is no less capable of moving us. The general public may have been puzzled at first, but those who are best qualified to judge must give you your due. I have felt myself impelled to offer you all my congratulations, to which I would add, my dear brother poet, an expression of my very highest esteem.\u201d Albertine\u2019s eyes, while she was reading this to us, had not ceased to sparkle. \u201cReally, you\u2019d think she must have cribbed it somewhere!\u201d she exclaimed, as she reached the end. \u201cI should never have believed that Gis\u00e8le could hatch out anything like as good! And the poetry she brings in! Where on earth can she have got that from?\u201d Albertine\u2019s admiration, with a change, it is true, of object, but with no loss \u2014 an increase, rather \u2014 of intensity, combined with the closest attention to what was being said, continued to make her eyes \u2018start from her head\u2019 all the time that Andr\u00e9e (consulted as being the biggest of the band and more knowledgeable than the others) first of all spoke of Gis\u00e8le\u2019s essay with a certain irony, then with a levity of tone which failed to conceal her underlying seriousness proceeded to reconstruct the letter in her own way. \u201cIt is not badly done,\u201d she told Albertine, \u201cbut if I were you and had the same subject set me, which is quite likely, as they do very often set that, I shouldn\u2019t do it in that way. This is how I would tackle it. Well, first of all, if I had been Gis\u00e8le, I should not have let myself get tied up, I should have begun by making a rough sketch of what I was going to write on a separate piece of paper. On the top line I should state the question and give an account of the subject, then the general ideas to be worked into the development. After that, appreciation, style, conclusion. In that way, with a summary to refer to, you know where you are. But at the very start, where she begins her account of the subject, or, if you like, Titine, since it\u2019s a letter we\u2019re speaking of, where she comes to the matter, Gis\u00e8le has gone off the rails altogether. Writing to a person of the seventeenth century, Sophocles ought never to have said, \u2018My dear friend.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhy, of course, she ought to have said, \u2018My dear Racine,\u2019\u201d came impetuously from Albertine. \u201cThat would have been much better.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Andr\u00e9e, with a trace of mockery in her tone, \u201cshe ought to have put \u2018Sir.\u2019 In the same way, to end up, she ought to have thought of something like, \u2018Suffer me, Sir,\u2019 (at the very most, \u2018Dear Sir\u2019) to inform you of the sense of high esteem with which I have the honour to be your servant.\u2019 Then again, Gis\u00e8le says that the choruses in Athalie are a novelty. She is forgetting Esther, and two tragedies that are not much read now but happen to have been analysed this year by the Professor himself, so that you need only mention them, since he\u2019s got them on the brain, and you\u2019re bound to pass. I mean Les Juives, by Robert Gamier, and Montchrestien\u2019s L\u2019Aman.\u201d Andr\u00e9e quoted these titles without managing quite to conceal a secret sense of benevolent superiority, which found expression in a smile, quite a delightful smile, for that matter. Albertine could contain herself no \u2014 longer. \u201cAndr\u00e9e, you really are a perfect marvel,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou must write down those names for me. Just fancy, what luck it would be if I got on to that, even in the oral, I should bring them in at once and make a colossal impression.\u201d But in the days that followed, every time that Albertine begged Andr\u00e9e just to tell her again the names of those two plays so that she might write them down, her blue-stocking friend seemed most unfortunately to have forgotten them, and left her none the wiser. \u201cAnd another thing,\u201d Andr\u00e9e went on with the faintest note in her voice of scorn for companions so much younger than herself, though she relished their admiration and attached to the manner in which she herself would have composed the essay a greater importance than she wanted us to think, \u201cSophocles in the Shades must be kept well-informed of all that goes on. He must know, therefore, that it was not before the general public but before the King\u2019s Majesty and a few privileged courtiers that Athalie was first played. What Gis\u00e8le says in this connexion of the esteem of qualified judges is not at all bad, but she might have gone a little further. Sophocles, now that he is immortal, might quite well have the gift of prophecy and announce that, according to Voltaire,Athalie is to be the supreme achievement not of Racine merely but of the human mind.\u201d Albertine was drinking in every word. Her eyes blazed. And it was with the utmost indignation that she rejected Rosemonde\u2019s suggestion that they should begin to play. \u201cAnd so,\u201d Andr\u00e9e concluded, in the same easy, detached tone, blending a faint sneer with a certain warmth of conviction, \u201cif Gis\u00e8le had noted down properly, first of all, the general ideas that she was going to develop, it might perhaps have occurred to her to do what I myself should have done, point out what a difference there is between the religious inspiration of Sophocles\u2019s choruses and Racine\u2019s. I should have made Sophocles remark that if Racine\u2019s choruses are instinct with religious feeling like those of the Greek Tragedians, the gods are not the same. The God of Joad has nothing in common with the god of Sophocles. And that brings us quite naturally, when we have finished developing the subject, to our conclusion: What does it matter if their beliefs are different? Sophocles would hesitate to insist upon such a point. He would be afraid of wounding Racine\u2019s convictions, and so, slipping in a few appropriate words on his masters at Port-Royal, he prefers to congratulate his disciple on the loftiness of his poetic genius.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Admiration and attention had so heated Albertine that great drops were rolling down her cheeks. Andr\u00e9e preserved the unruffled calm of a female dandy. \u201cIt would not be a bad thing either to quote some of the opinions of famous critics,\u201d she added, before they began their game. \u201cYes,\u201d put in Albertine, \u201cso I\u2019ve been told. The best ones to quote, on the whole, are Sainte-Beuve and Merlet, aren\u2019t they?\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re not absolutely wrong,\u201d Andr\u00e9e told her, \u201cMerlet and Sainte-Beuve are by no means bad. But you certainly ought to mention Deltour and Gascq-Desfoss\u00e9s.\u201d She refused, however, despite Albertine\u2019s entreaties, to write down these two unfamiliar names\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile I had been thinking of the little page torn from a scribbling block which Albertine had handed me. \u201cI love you,\u201d she had written. And an hour later, as I scrambled down the paths which led back, a little too vertically for my liking, to Balbec, I said to myself that it was with her that I would have my romance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The state of being indicated by the presence of all the signs by which we are accustomed to recognise that we are in love, such as the orders which I left in the hotel not to awaken me whoever might ask to see me, unless it were one or other of the girls, the beating of my heart while I waited for her (whichever of them it might be that I was expecting) and on those mornings my fury if I had not succeeded in finding a barber to shave me, and must appear with the disfigurement of a hairy chin before Albertine, Rosemonde or Andr\u00e9e, no doubt this state, recurring indifferently at the thought of one or another, was as different from what we call love as is from human life the life of the zoophytes, where an existence, an individuality, if we may term it, is divided up among several organisms. But natural history teaches us that such an organization of animal life is indeed to be observed, and that our own life, provided only that we have outgrown the first phase, is no less positive as to the reality of states hitherto unsuspected by us, through which we have to pass, and can then abandon them altogether. Such was for me this state of love divided among several girls at once. Divided \u2014 say rather undivided, for more often than not what was so delicious to me, different from the rest of the world, what was beginning to become so precious to me that the hope of finding it again on the morrow was the greatest happiness in my life, was rather the whole of the group of girls, taken as they were all together on those afternoons on the cliffs, during those lifeless hours, upon that strip of grass on which were laid those forms, so exciting to my imagination, of Albertine, Rosemonde, Andr\u00e9e; and that without my being able to say which of them it was that made those scenes so precious to me, which of them I was most anxious to love. At the start of a new love as at its ending, we are not exclusively attached to the object of that love, but rather the desire to be loving from which it will presently emerge (and, later on, the memory which it leaves behind) wanders voluptuously through a zone of interchangeable charms \u2014 simply natural charms, it may be, gratification of appetite, enjoyment of one\u2019s surroundings \u2014 which are so far harmonised among themselves that it does not in the presence of any one of them feel itself out of place. Besides, as my perception of them was not yet dulled by familiarity, I had still the faculty of seeing them, that is to say of feeling a profound astonishment every time that I found myself in their presence. No doubt this astonishment is to some extent due to the fact that the other person on such occasions presents himself in a fresh aspect; but so great is the multiformity of each of us, so abundant the wealth of lines of face and body, lines so few of which leave any trace, once we have parted from the other person, on the arbitrary simplicity of our memory. As our mind has selected some peculiarity that had struck us, has isolated it, exaggerated it, making of a woman who has appeared to us tall, a sketch in which her figure is absurdly elongated, or of a woman who has seemed to be pink-cheeked and golden-haired a pure \u2018Harmony in pink and gold,\u2019 so, the moment that woman is once again standing before us, all the other forgotten qualities which restore the balance of that one remembered feature at once assail us, in their confused complexity, diminishing her height, paling her cheeks, and substituting for what we have come to her solely to seek other peculiarities which we remember now that we did notice the first time, and fail to understand how we can so far have forgotten to look out for again. We thought we remembered; it was a peahen, surely; we go to see it and find a peony. And this inevitable astonishment is not the only one; for, side by side with it comes another, born of the difference, not now between the stereotyped forms of memory and reality, but between the person whom we saw last time and him who appears to us to-day from another angle and shews us another aspect. The human face is indeed, like the face of the God of some Oriental theogony, a whole cluster of faces, crowded together but on different surfaces so that one does not see them all at once\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But to a great extent our astonishment springs from the other person\u2019s presenting to us also a face that is the same as before. It would require so immense an effort to reconstruct everything that has been imparted to us by things other than ourselves \u2014 were it only the taste of a fruit \u2014 that no sooner is the impression received than we begin imperceptibly to descend the slope of memory and, without noticing anything, in a very short time, we have come a long way from what we actually felt. So that every fresh encounter is a sort of rectification, which brings us back to what we really did see. We have no longer any recollection of this, to such an extent does what we call remembering a person consist really in forgetting him. But so long as we can still see at the moment when the forgotten aspect appears, we recognise it, we are obliged to correct the straying line; thus the perpetual and fruitful surprise which made so salutary and invigorating for me these daily outings with the charming damsels of the sea shore, consisted fully as much in recognition as in discovery. When there is added to this the agitation aroused by what these girls were to me, which was never quite what I had supposed, and meant that my expectancy of our next meeting resembled not so much my expectancy the time before as the still throbbing memory of our latest conversation, it will be realised that each of our excursions made a violent interruption in the course of my thoughts and moved them clean out of the direction which, in the solitude of my own room, I had been able to trace for them at my leisure. That plotted course was forgotten, had ceased to exist, when I returned home buzzing like a hive of bees with remarks which had disquieted me when I heard them and were still echoing in my brain. The other person is destroyed when we cease to see him; after which his next appearance means a fresh creation of him, different from that which immediately preceded it, if not from them all. For the minimum variation that is to be found in these creations is duality. If we have in mind a strong and searching glance, a bold manner, it is inevitably, next time, by a half-languid profile, a sort of dreamy gentleness, overlooked by us in our previous impression, that we shall be, on meeting him again, astonished, that is to say almost solely struck. In confronting our memory with the new reality it is this that will mark the extent of our disappointment or surprise, will appear to us like the revised version of an earlier reality warning us that we had not remembered it correctly. In its turn, the facial aspect neglected the time before, and for that very reason the most striking this time, the most real, the most documentary, will become a matter for dreams and memories. It is a languorous and rounded profile, a gentle, dreamy expression which we shall now desire to see again. And then, next time, such resolution, such strength of character as there may be in the piercing eyes, the pointed nose, the tight lips, will come to correct the discrepancy between our desire and the object to which it has supposed itself to correspond. It is understood, of course, that this loyalty to the first and purely physical impressions which I formed afresh at each encounter with my friends did not involve only their facial appearance, since the reader has seen that I was sensible also of their voices, more disquieting still, perhaps (for not only does a voice offer the same strange and sensuous surfaces as a face, it issues from that unknown, inaccessible region the mere thought of which sets the mind swimming with unattainable kisses), their voices each like the unique sound of a little instrument into which the player put all her artistry and which was found only in her possession. Traced by a casual inflexion, a sudden deep chord in one of their voices would astonish me when I recognised after having forgotten it. So much so that the corrections which after every fresh meeting I was obliged to make so as to ensure absolute accuracy were as much those of a tuner or singing-master as a draughtsman\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the harmonious cohesion in which had been neutralised for some time, by the resistance that each brought to bear against the expansion of the others, the several waves of sentiment set in motion in me by these girls, it was broken in Albertine\u2019s favour one afternoon when we were playing the game of \u2018ferret.\u2019 It was in a little wood on the cliff. Stationed between two girls, strangers to the little band, whom the band had brought in its train because we wanted that day to have a bigger party than usual, I gazed enviously at Albertine\u2019s neighbour, a young man, saying to myself that if I had been in his place I could have been touching my friend\u2019s hands all those miraculous moments which might perhaps never recur, and that this would have been but the first stage in a great advance. Already, by itself, and even without the consequences which it would probably have involved, the contact of Albertine\u2019s hands would have been delicious to me. Not that I had never seen prettier hands than hers. Even in the group of her friends, those of Andr\u00e9e, slender hands and much more finely modelled, had as it were a private life of their own, obedient to the commands of their mistress, but independent, and used often to strain out before her like a leash of thoroughbred greyhounds, with lazy pauses, long dreams, sudden stretchings of a joint, seeing which Elstir had made a number of studies of these hands. And in one of them, in which you saw Andr\u00e9e warming her hands at the fire, they had, with the light behind them, the gilded transparency of two autumn leaves. But, plumper than these, the hands of Albertine would yield for a moment, then resist the pressure of the hand that clasped them, giving a sensation that was quite peculiar to themselves. The act of pressing Albertine\u2019s hand had a sensual sweetness which was in keeping somehow with the rosy, almost mauve colouring of her skin. That pressure seemed to allow you to penetrate into the girl\u2019s being, to plumb the depths of her senses, like the ringing sound of her laughter, indecent as may be the cooing of doves or certain animal cries. She was the sort of woman with whom shaking hands affords so much pleasure that one feels grateful to civilisation for having made of the handclasp a lawful act between young men and girls when they meet. If the arbitrary code of good manners had replaced the clasp of hands by some other gesture, I should have gazed, day after day, at the unattainable hands of Albertine with a curiosity to know the feel of them as ardent as was my curiosity to learn the savour of her cheeks. But in the pleasure of holding her hand unrestrictedly in mine, had I been next to her at \u2018ferret\u2019 I did not envisage that pleasure alone; what avowals, declarations silenced hitherto by my bashfulness, I could have conveyed by certain pressures of hand on hand; on her side, how easy it would have been for her, in responding by other pressures, to shew me that she accepted; what complicity, what a vista of happiness stood open! My love would be able to make more advance in a few minutes spent thus by her side than it had yet made in all the time that I had known her. Feeling that they would last but a short time, were rapidly nearing their end, since presumably we were not going on much longer with this game, and that once it was over I should be too late, I could not keep in my place for another moment. I let myself deliberately be caught with the ring, and, having gone into the middle, when the ring passed I pretended not to see it but followed its course with my eyes, waiting for the moment when it should come into the hands of the young man next to Albertine, who herself, pealing with helpless laughter, and in the excitement and pleasure of the game, was blushing like a rose. \u201cWhy, we really are in the Fairy Wood!\u201d said Andr\u00e9e to me, pointing to the trees that grew all round, with a smile in her eyes which was meant only for me and seemed to pass over the heads of the other players, as though we two alone were clever enough to double our parts, and make, in connexion with the game we were playing, a remark of a poetic nature. She even carried the delicacy of her fancy so far as to sing half-unconsciously: \u201cThe Ferret of the Wood has passed this way, Sweet Ladies; he has passed by this way, the Ferret of Fairy Wood!\u201d like those people who cannot visit Trianon without getting up a party in Louis XVI costume, or think in effective to have a song sung to its original setting. I should no doubt have been sorry that I could see no charm in this piece of mimicry, had I had time to think of it. But my thoughts were all elsewhere. The players began to shew surprise at my stupidity in never getting the ring. I was looking at Albertine, so pretty, so indifferent, so gay, who, though she little knew it, was to be my neighbour when at last I should catch the ring in the right hands, thanks to a stratagem which she did not suspect, and would certainly have resented if she had. In the heat of the game her long hair had become loosened, and fell in curling locks over her cheeks on which it served to intensify, by its dry brownness, the carnation pink. \u201cYou have the tresses of Laura Dianti, of Eleanor of Guyenne, and of her descendant so beloved of Chateaubriand. You ought always to wear your hair half down like that,\u201d I murmured in her ear as an excuse for drawing close to her. Suddenly the ring passed to her neighbour. I sprang upon him at once, forced open his hands and seized it; he was obliged now to take my place inside the circle, while I took his beside Albertine. A few minutes earlier I had been envying this young man, when I saw that his hands as they slipped over the cord were constantly brushing against hers. Now that my turn was come, too shy to seek, too much moved to enjoy this contact, I no longer felt anything save the rapid and painful beating of my heart. At one moment Albertine leaned towards me, with an air of connivance, her round and rosy face, making a show of having the ring, so as to deceive the ferret, and keep him from looking in the direction in which she was just going to pass it. I realised at once that this was the sole object of Albertine\u2019s mysterious, confidential gaze, but I was a little shocked to see thus kindle in her eyes the image \u2014 purely fictitious, invented to serve the needs of the game \u2014 of a secret, an understanding between her and myself which did not exist, but which from that moment seemed to me to be possible and would have been divinely sweet. While I was still being swept aloft by this thought, I felt a slight pressure of Albertine\u2019s hand against mine, and her caressing finger slip under my finger along the cord, and I saw her, at the same moment, give me a wink which she tried to make pass unperceived by the others. At once, a mass of hopes, invisible hitherto by myself, crystallised within me. \u201cShe is taking advantage of the game to let me feel that she really does love me,\u201d I thought to myself, in an acme of joy, from which no sooner had I reached it than I fell, on hearing Albertine mutter furiously: \u201cWhy can\u2019t you take it? I\u2019ve been shoving it at you for the last hour.\u201d Stunned with grief, I let go the cord, the ferret saw that ring and swooped down on it, and I had to go back into the middle, where I stood helpless, in despair, looking at the unbridled rout which continued to circle round me, stung by the jeering shouts of all the players, obliged, in reply, to laugh when I had so little mind for laughter, while Albertine kept on repeating: \u201cPeople can\u2019t play if they don\u2019t pay attention, and spoil the game for the others. He shan\u2019t be asked again when we\u2019re going to play, Andr\u00e9e; if he is, I don\u2019t come.\u201d Andr\u00e9e, with a mind above the game, still chanting her \u2018Fairy Wood\u2019 which, in a spirit of imitation, Rosemonde had taken up too, but without conviction, sought to make a diversion from Albertine\u2019s reproaches by saying to me: \u201cWe\u2019re quite close to those old Creuniers you wanted so much to see. Look, I\u2019ll take you there by a dear little path, and we\u2019ll leave these silly idiots to go on playing like babies in the nursery.\u201d As Andr\u00e9e was extremely nice to me, as we went along I said to her everything about Albertine that seemed calculated to make me attractive to the latter. Andr\u00e9e replied that she too was very fond of Albertine, thought her charming; in spite of which the compliments that I was paying to her friend did not seem altogether to please her. Suddenly, in the little sunken path, I stopped short, touched to the heart by an exquisite memory of my childhood. I had just recognised, by the fretted and glossy leaves which it thrust out towards me, a hawthorn-bush, flowerless, alas, now that spring was over. Around me floated the atmosphere of far-off Months of Mary, of Sunday afternoons, of beliefs, or errors long ago forgotten. I wanted to stay it in its passage. I stood still for a moment, and Andr\u00e9e, with a charming divination of what was in my mind, left me to converse with the leaves of the bush. I asked them for news of the flowers, those hawthorn flowers that were like merry little girls, headstrong, provocative, pious. \u201cThe young ladies have been gone from here for a long time now,\u201d the leaves told me. And perhaps they thought that, for the great friend of those young ladies that I pretended to be, I seemed to have singularly little knowledge of their habits. A great friend, but one who had never been to see them again for all these years, despite his promises. And yet, as Gilberte had been my first love among girls, so these had been my first love among flowers. \u201cYes, I know all that, they leave about the middle of June,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut I am so delighted to see the place where they stayed when they were here. They came to see me, too, at Combray, in my room; my mother brought them when I was ill in bed. And we used to meet on Saturday evenings, too, at the Month of Mary devotions. Can they get to them from here?\u201d \u201cOh, of course! Why, they make a special point of having our young ladies at Saint-Denis du D\u00e9sert, the church near here.\u201d \u201cThen, if I want to see them now?\u201d \u201cOh, not before May, next year.\u201d \u201cBut I can be sure that they will be here?\u201d \u201cThey come regularly every year.\u201d \u201cOnly I don\u2019t know whether it will be easy to find the place.\u201d \u201cOh, dear, yes! They are so gay, the young ladies, they stop laughing only to sing hymns together, so that you can\u2019t possibly miss them, you can tell by the scent from the other end of the path.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I caught up Andr\u00e9e, and began again to sing Albertine\u2019s praises. It was inconceivable to me that she would not repeat what I said to her friend, seeing the emphasis that I put into it. And yet I never heard that Albertine had been told. Andr\u00e9e had, nevertheless, a far greater understanding of the things of the heart, a refinement of nice behaviour; finding the look, the word, the action that could most ingeniously give pleasure, keeping to herself a remark that might possibly cause pain, making a sacrifice (and making it as though it were no sacrifice at all) of an afternoon\u2019s play, or it might be an \u2018at home\u2019 or a garden party in order to stay beside a friend who was feeling sad, and thus shew him or her that she preferred the simple company of a friend to frivolous pleasures; these were her habitual delicacies. But when one knew her a little better one would have said that it was with her as with those heroic cravens who wish not to be afraid, and whose bravery is especially meritorious, one would have said that in her true character there was none of that generosity which she displayed at every moment out of moral distinction, or sensibility, or a noble desire to shew herself a true friend. When I listened to all the charming things she was saying to me about a possible affection between Albertine and myself it seemed as though she were bound to do everything in her power to bring it to pass. Whereas, by mere chance perhaps, not even of the least of the various minor opportunities which were at her disposal and might have proved effective in uniting me to Albertine did she ever make any use, and I would not swear that my effort to make myself loved by Albertine did not \u2014 if not provoke in her friend secret stratagems destined to bring it to nought \u2014 at any rate arouse in her an anger which however she took good care to hide and against which even, in her delicacy of feeling, she may herself have fought. Of the countless refinements of goodness which Andr\u00e9e shewed Albertine would have been incapable, and yet I was not certain of the underlying goodness of the former as I was to be, later on, of the latter\u2019s. Shewing herself always tenderly indulgent to the exuberant frivolity of Albertine, Andr\u00e9e would greet her with speeches, with smiles which were those of a friend, better still, she always acted towards her as a friend. I have seen her, day after day, in order to give the benefit of her own wealth, to bring some happiness to this penniless friend take, without any possibility of advantage to herself, more pains than a courtier would take who sought to win his sovereign\u2019s favour. She was charmingly gentle always, charming in her choice of sweet, pathetic expressions, when you said to her what a pity it was that Albertine was so poor, and took infinitely more trouble on her behalf than she would have taken for a wealthy friend. But if anyone were to hint that Albertine was perhaps not quite so poor as people made out, a just discernible cloud would veil the light of Andr\u00e9e\u2019s eyes and brow; she seemed out of temper. And if you went on to say that after all Albertine might perhaps be less difficult to marry off than people supposed, she would vehemently contradict you, repeating almost angrily: \u201cOh dear, no; she will never get married! I am quite certain of it; it is a dreadful worry to me!\u201d In so far as I myself was concerned, Andr\u00e9e was the only one of the girls who would never have repeated to me anything not very pleasant that might have been said about me by a third person; more than that, if it were I who told her what had been said she would make a pretence of not believing it, or would furnish some explanation which made the remark inoffensive; it is the aggregate of these qualities that goes by the name of tact. Tact is the attribute of those people who, if we have called a man out in a duel, congratulate us and add that there was no necessity, really; so as to enhance still further in our own eyes the courage of which we have given proof without having been forced to do lo. They are the opposite of the people who, in similar circumstances, say: \u201cIt must have been a horrid nuisance for you, fighting a duel, but on the other hand you couldn\u2019t possibly swallow an insult like that, there was nothing else to be done.\u201d But as there, is always something to be said on both sides, if the pleasure, or at least the indifference shewn by our friends in repeating something offensive that they have heard said about us, proves that they do not exactly put themselves in our skin at the moment of speaking, but thrust in the pin-point, turn the knife-blade as though it were gold-beater\u2019s skin and not human, the art of always keeping hidden from us what might be disagreeable to us in what they have heard said about our actions, or in the opinion which those actions have led the speakers themselves to form of us, proves that there is in the other kind of friends, in the friends who are so full of tact, a strong vein of dissimulation. It does no harm if indeed they are incapable of thinking evil, and if what is said by other people only makes them suffer as it would make us. I supposed this to be the case with Andr\u00e9e, without, however, being absolutely sure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We had left the little wood and had followed a network of overgrown paths through which Andr\u00e9e managed to find her way with great skill. Suddenly, \u201cLook now,\u201d she said to me, \u201cthere are your famous Creuniers, and, I say, you are in luck, it\u2019s just the time of day, and the light is the same as when Elstir painted them.\u201d But I was still too wretched at having fallen, during the game of \u2018ferret,\u2019 from such a pinnacle of hopes. And so it was not with the pleasure which otherwise I should doubtless have felt that I caught sight, almost below my feet, crouching among the rocks, where they had gone for protection from the heat, of marine goddesses for whom Elstir had lain in wait and surprised them there, beneath a dark glaze as lovely as Leonardo would have painted, the marvellous Shadows, sheltered and furtive, nimble and voiceless, ready at the first glimmer of light to slip behind the stone, to hide in a cranny, and prompt, once the menacing ray had passed, to return to rock or seaweed beneath the sun that crumbled the cliffs and the colourless ocean, over whose slumbers they seemed to be watching, motionless lightfoot guardians letting appear on the water\u2019s surface their viscous bodies and the attentive gaze of their deep blue eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We went back to the wood to pick up the other girls and go home together. I knew now that I was in love with Albertine; but, alas! I had no thought of letting her know it. This was because, since the days of our games in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, my conception of love had become different, even if the persons to whom my love was successively assigned remained practically the same. For one thing, the avowal, the declaration of my passion to her whom I loved no longer seemed to me one of the vital and necessary incidents of love, nor love itself an external reality, but simply a subjective pleasure. And as for this pleasure, I felt that Albertine would do everything necessary to furnish it, all the more since she would not know that I was enjoying it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As we walked home the image of Albertine, bathed in the light that streamed from the other girls, was not the only one that existed for me. But as the moon, which is no more than a tiny white cloud of a more definite and fixed shape than other clouds during the day, assumes her full power as soon as daylight dies, so when I was once more in the hotel it was Albertine\u2019s sole image that rose from my heart and began to shine. My room seemed to me to have become suddenly a new place. Of course, for a long time past, it had not been the hostile room of my first night in it. All our lives we go on patiently modifying the surroundings in which we dwell; and gradually, as habit dispenses us from feeling them, we suppress the noxious elements of colour, shape and smell which were at the root of our discomfort. Nor was it any longer the room, still potent enough over my sensibility, not certainly to make me suffer, but to give me joy, the fount of summer days, like a marble basin in which, half way up its polished sides, they mirrored an azure surface steeped in light over which glided for an instant, impalpable and white as a wave of heat, a shadowy and fleeting cloud; not the room, wholly aesthetic, of the pictorial evening hours; it was the room in which I had been now for so many days that I no longer saw it. And now I was just beginning again to open my eyes to it, but this time from the selfish angle which is that of love. I liked to feel that the fine big mirror across one corner, the handsome bookcases with their fronts of glass would give Albertine, if she came to see me, a good impression of myself. Instead of a place of transit in which I would stay for a few minutes before escaping to the beach or to Rivebelle, my room became real and dear to me, fashioned itself anew, for I looked at and appreciated each article of its furniture with the eyes of Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A few days after the game of \u2018ferret,\u2019 when, having allowed ourselves to wander rather too far afield, we had been fortunate in finding at Maine-ville a couple of little \u201ctubs\u201d with two seats in each which would enable us to be back in time for dinner, the keenness, already intense, of my love for Albertine, had the following effect, first of all, that it was Rosemonde and Andr\u00e9e in turn that I invited to be my companion, and never once Albertine, after which, in spite of my manifest preference for Andr\u00e9e or Rosemonde, I led everybody, by secondary considerations of time and distance, cloaks and so forth, to decide, as though against my wishes, that the most practical policy was that I should take Albertine, to whose company I pretended to resign myself for good or ill. Unfortunately, since love tends to the complete assimilation of another person, while other people are not comestible by way of conversation alone, Albertine might be (and indeed was) as friendly as possible to me on our way home; when I had deposited her at her own door she left me happy but more famished for her even than I had been at the start, and reckoning the moments that we had spent together as only \u00e0 prelude, of little importance in itself, to those that were still to come. And yet this prelude had that initial charm which is not to be found again. I had not yet asked anything of Albertine. She could imagine what I wanted, but, not being certain of it, would suppose that I was tending only towards relations without any definite purpose, in which my friend would find that delicious vagueness, rich in surprising fulfilments of expectations, which is true romance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the week that followed I scarcely attempted to see Albertine. I made a show of preferring Andr\u00e9e. Love is born; one would like to remain, for her whom one loves, the unknown whom she may love in turn, but one has need of her, one requires contact not so much with her body as with her attention, her heart. One slips into a letter some spiteful expression which will force the indifferent reader to ask for some little kindness in compensation, and love, following an unvarying procedure, sets going with an alternating movement the machinery in which one can no longer either refrain from loving or be loved. I gave to Andr\u00e9e the hours spent by the others at a party which I knew that she would sacrifice for my sake, with pleasure, and would have sacrificed even with reluctance, from a moral nicety, so as not to let either the others or herself think that she attached any importance to a relatively frivolous amusement. I arranged in this way to have her entirely to myself every evening, meaning not to make Albertine jealous, but to improve my position in her eyes, or at any rate not to imperil it by letting Albertine know that it was herself and not Andr\u00e9e that I loved. Nor did I confide this to Andr\u00e9e either, lest she should repeat it to her friend. When I spoke of Albertine to Andr\u00e9e I affected a coldness by which she was perhaps less deceived that I by her apparent credulity. She made a show of believing in my indifference to Albertine, of desiring the closest possible union between Albertine and myself. It is probable that, on the contrary, she neither believed in the one nor wished for the other. While I was saying to her that I did not care very greatly for her friend, I was thinking of one thing only, how to become acquainted with Mme. Bontemps, who was staying for a few days near Balbec, and to whom Albertine was going presently on a short visit. Naturally I did not let Andr\u00e9e become aware of this desire, and when I spoke to her of Albertine\u2019s people, it was in the most careless manner possible. Andr\u00e9e\u2019s direct answers did not appear to throw any doubt on my sincerity. Why then did she blurt out suddenly, about that time: \u201cOh, guess who\u2019 I\u2019ve just seen \u2014 Albertine\u2019s aunt!\u201d It is true that she had not said in so many words: \u201cI could see through your casual remarks all right that the one thing you were really thinking of was how you could make friends with Albertine\u2019s aunt.\u201d But it was clearly to the presence in Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mind of some such idea which she felt it more becoming to keep from me that the word \u2018just\u2019 seemed to point. It was of a kind with certain glances, certain gestures which, for all that they have not a form that is logical, rational, deliberately calculated to match the listener\u2019s intelligence, reach him nevertheless in their true significance, just as human speech, converted into electricity in the telephone, is turned into speech again when it strikes the ear. In order to remove from Andree\u2019s mind the idea that I was interested in Mme. Bontemps, I spoke of her from that time onwards not only carelessly but with downright malice, saying that I had once met that idiot of a woman, and trusted I should never have that experience again. Whereas I was seeking by every means in my power to meet her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 tried to induce Elstir (but without mentioning to anyone else that I had asked him) to speak to her about me and to bring us together. He promised to introduce me to her, though he seemed greatly surprised at my wishing it, for he regarded her as a contemptible woman, a born intriguer, as little interesting as she was disinterested. Reflecting that if I did see Mme. Bontemps, Andr\u00e9e would be sure to hear of it sooner or later, I thought it best to warn her in advance. \u201cThe things one tries hardest to avoid are what one finds one cannot escape,\u201d I told her. \u201cNothing in the world could bore me so much as meeting Mme. Bontemps again, and yet I can\u2019t get out of it, Elstir has arranged to invite us together.\u201d \u201cI have never doubted it for a single instant,\u201d exclaimed Andr\u00e9e in a bitter tone, while her eyes, enlarged and altered by her annoyance, focussed themselves upon some invisible object. These words of Andree\u2019s were not the most recent statement of a thought which might be expressed thus: \u201cI know that you are in love with Albertine, and that you are working day and night to get in touch with her people.\u201d But they were the shapeless fragments, easily pieced together again by me, of some such thought which I had exploded by striking it, through the shield of Andree\u2019s self-control. Like her \u2018just,\u2019 these words had no meaning save in the second degree, that is to say they were words of the sort which (rather than direct affirmatives) inspires in us respect or distrust for another person, and leads to a rupture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If Andr\u00e9e had not believed me when I told her that Albertine\u2019s relatives left me indifferent, that was because she thought that I was in love with Albertine. And probably she was none too happy in the thought\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She was generally present as a third party at my meetings with her friend. And yet there were days when I was to see Albertine by herself, days to which I looked forward with feverish impatience, which passed without bringing me any decisive result, without having, any of them, been that cardinal day whose part I immediately entrusted to the day that was to follow, which would prove no more apt to play it; thus there crumbled and collapsed, one after another, like waves of the sea, those peaks at once replaced by others\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About a month after the day on which we had played \u2018ferret\u2019 together, I learned that Albertine was going away next morning to spend a couple of days with Mme. Bontemps, and, since she would have to start early, was coming to sleep that night at the Grand Hotel, from which, by taking the omnibus, she would be able, without disturbing the friends with whom she was staying, to catch the first train in the morning. I mentioned this to Andr\u00e9e. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word of it,\u201d she replied, with a look of annoyance. \u201cAnyhow it won\u2019t help you at all, for I\u2019m quite sure Albertine won\u2019t want to see you if she goes to the hotel by herself. It wouldn\u2019t be \u2018regulation,\u2019\u201d she added, employing an epithet which had recently come into favour with her, in the sense of \u2018what is done.\u2019 \u201cI tell you this because I understand Albertine. What difference do you suppose it makes to me, whether you see her or not? Not the slightest, I can assure you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We were joined by Octave who had no hesitation in telling Andr\u00e9e the number of strokes he had gone round in, the day before, at golf, then by Albertine, counting her diabolo as she walked along, like a nun telling her beads. Thanks to this pastime she could be left alone for hours on end without growing bored. As soon as she joined us I became conscious of the obstinate tip of her nose, which I had omitted from my mental pictures of her during the last few days; beneath her dark hair the vertical front of her brow controverted \u2014 and not for the first time \u2014 the indefinite image that I had preserved of her, while its whiteness made a vivid splash in my field of vision; emerging from the dust of memory, Albertine was built up afresh before my eyes. Golf gives one a taste for solitary pleasures. The pleasure to be derived from diabolo is undoubtedly one of these. And yet, after she had joined us, Albertine continued to toss up and catch her missile, just as a lady on whom friends have come to call does not on their account stop working at her crochet. \u201cI hear that Mme. de Villeparisis,\u201d she remarked to Octave, \u201chas been complaining to your father.\u201d I could hear, underlying the word, one of those notes that were peculiar to Albertine; always, just as I had made certain that I had forgotten them, I would be reminded of a glimpse caught through them before of Albertine\u2019s determined and typically Gallic mien. I might have been blind, and yet have detected certain of her qualities, alert and slightly provincial, from those notes, just as plainly as from the tip of her nose. These were equivalent and might have been substituted for one another, and her voice was like what we are promised in the photo-telephone of the future; the visual image was clearly outlined in the sound. \u201cShe\u2019s not written only to your father, either, she wrote to the Mayor of Balbec at the same time, to say that we must stop playing diabolo on the \u2018front\u2019 as somebody hit her in the face with one.\u201d \u201cYes, I was hearing about that. It\u2019s too silly. There\u2019s little enough to do here as it is.\u201d Andr\u00e9e did not join in the conversation; she was not acquainted, any more than was Albertine or Octave, with Mme. de Villeparisis. She did, however, remark: \u201cI can\u2019t think why this lady should make such a song about it. O\u2019d Mme. de Cambremer got hit in the face, and she never complained.\u201d \u201cI will explain the difference,\u201d replied Octave gravely, striking a match as he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s my belief that Mme. de Cambremer is a woman of the world, and Mme. de Villeparisis is just an upstart. Are you playing golf this afternoon?\u201d And he left us, followed by Andr\u00e9e. I was alone now with Albertine. \u201cDo you see,\u201d she began, \u201cI\u2019m wearing my hair now the way you like \u2014 look at my ringlet. They all laugh at me and nobody knows who\u2019 I\u2019m doing it for. My aunt will laugh at me too. But I shan\u2019t tell her why, either.\u201d I had a sidelong view of Albertine\u2019s cheeks, which often appeared pale, but, seen thus, were flushed with a coursing stream of blood which lighted them up, gave them that dazzling clearness which certain winter mornings have when the stones sparkling in the sun seem blocks of pink granite and radiate joy. The joy that I was drawing at this moment from the sight of Albertine\u2019s cheeks was equally keen, but led to another desire on my part, which was not to walk with her but to take her in my arms. I asked her if the report of her plans which I had heard were correct. \u201cYes,\u201d she told me, \u201cI shall be sleeping at your hotel to-night, and in fact as I\u2019ve got rather a chill, I shall be going to bed before dinner. You can come and sit by my bed and watch me eat, if you like, and afterwards we\u2019ll play at anything you choose. I should have liked you to come to the station to-morrow morning, but I\u2019m afraid it might look rather odd, I don\u2019t say to Andr\u00e9e, who is a sensible person, but to the others who will be there; if my aunt got to know, I should never hear the last of it. But we can spend the evening together, at any rate. My aunt will know nothing about that. I must go and say good-bye to Andr\u00e9e. So long, then. Come early, so that we can have a nice long time together,\u201d she added, smiling. At these words I was swept back past the days in which I loved Gilberte to those in which love seemed to me not only an external entity but one that could be realised as a whole. Whereas the Gilberte whom I used to see in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es was a different Gilberte from the one whom I found waiting inside myself when I was alone again, suddenly in the real Albertine, her whom I saw every day, whom I supposed to be stuffed with middle-class prejudices and entirely open with her aunt, there was incarnate the imaginary Albertine, she whom, when I still did not know her, I had suspected of casting furtive glances at myself on the \u2018front,\u2019 she who had worn an air of being reluctant to go indoors when she saw me making off in the other direction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I went in to dinner with my grandmother. I felt within me a secret which she could never guess. Similarly with Albertine; to-morrow her friends would be with her, not knowing what novel experience she and I had in common; and when she kissed her niece on the brow Mme. Bontemps would never imagine that I stood between them, in that arrangement of Albertine\u2019s hair which had for its object, concealed from all the world, to give me pleasure, me who had until then so greatly envied Mme. Bontemps because, being related to the same people as her niece, she had the same occasions to don mourning, the same family visits to pay; and now I found myself meaning more to Albertine than did the aunt herself. When she was with her aunt, it was of me that she would be thinking. What was going to happen that evening, I scarcely knew. In any event, the Grand Hotel, the evening, would no longer seem empty to me; they contained my happiness. I rang for the lift-boy to take me up to the room which Albertine had engaged, a room that looked over the valley. The slightest movements, such as that of sitting down on the bench in the lift, were satisfying, because they were in direct relation to my heart; I saw in the ropes that drew the cage upwards, in the few steps that I had still to climb, only a materialisation of the machinery, the stages of my joy. I had only two or three steps to take now along the corridor before coming to that room in which was enshrined the precious substance of that rosy form \u2014 that room which, even if there were to be done in it delicious things, would keep that air of permanence, of being, to a chance visitor who knew nothing of its history, just like any other room, which makes of inanimate things the obstinately mute witnesses, the scrupulous confidants, the inviolable depositaries of our pleasure. Those few steps from the landing to Albertine\u2019s door, those few steps which no one now could prevent my taking, I took with delight, with prudence, as though plunged into a new and strange element, as if in going forward I had been gently displacing the liquid stream of happiness, and at the same time with a strange feeling of absolute power, and of entering at length into an inheritance which had belonged to me from all time. Then suddenly I reflected that it was wrong to be in any doubt; she had told me to come when she was in bed. It was as clear as daylight; I pranced for joy, I nearly knocked over Fran\u00e7oise who was standing in my way, I ran, with glowing eyes, towards my friend\u2019s room. I found Albertine in bed. Leaving her throat bare, her white nightgown altered the proportions of her face, which, flushed by being in bed or by her cold or by dinner, seemed pinker than before; I thought of the colours which I had had, a few hours earlier, displayed beside me, on the \u2018front,\u2019 the savour of which I was now at last to taste; her cheek was crossed obliquely by one of those long, dark, curling tresses, which, to please me, she had undone altogether. She looked at me and smiled. Beyond her, through the window, the valley lay bright beneath the moon. The sight of Albertine\u2019s bare throat, of those strangely vivid cheeks, had so intoxicated me (that is to say had placed the reality of the world for me no longer in nature, but in the torrent of my sensations which it was all I could do to keep within bounds), as to have destroyed the balance between the life, immense and indestructible, which circulated in my being, and the life of the universe, so puny in comparison. The sea, which was visible through the window as well as the valley, the swelling breasts of the first of the Maineville cliffs, the sky in which the moon had not yet climbed to the zenith, all of these seemed less than a featherweight on my eyeballs, which between their lids I could feel dilated, resisting, ready to bear very different burdens, all the mountains of the world upon their fragile surface. Their orbit no longer found even the sphere of the horizon adequate to fill it. And everything that nature could have brought me of life would have seemed wretchedly meagre, the sigh of the waves far too short a sound to express the enormous aspiration that was surging in my breast. I bent over Albertine to kiss her. Death might have struck me down in that moment; it would have seemed to me a trivial, or rather an impossible thing, for life was not outside, it was in me; I should have smiled pityingly had a philosopher then expressed the idea that some day, even some distant day, I should have to die, that the external forces of nature would survive me, the forces of that nature beneath whose godlike feet I was no more than a grain of dust; that, after me, there would still remain those rounded, swelling cliffs, that sea, that moonlight and that sky! How was that possible; how could the world last longer than myself, since it was it that was enclosed in me, in me whom it went a long way short of filling, in me, where, feeling that there was room to store so many other treasures, I flung contemptuously into a corner sky, sea and cliffs. \u201cStop that, or I\u2019ll ring the bell!\u201d cried Albertine, seeing that I was flinging myself upon her to kiss her. But I reminded myself that it was not for no purpose that a girl made a young man come to her room in secret, arranging that her aunt should not know \u2014 that boldness, moreover, rewards those who know how to seize their opportunities; in the state of exaltation in which I was, the round face of Albertine, lighted by an inner flame, like the glass bowl of a lamp, started into such prominence that, copying the rotation of a burning sphere, it seemed to me to be turning, like those faces of Michelangelo which are being swept past in the arrested headlong flight of a whirlwind. I was going to learn the fragrance, the flavour which this strange pink fruit concealed. I heard a sound, precipitous, prolonged, shrill. Albertine had pulled the bell with all her might\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had supposed that the love which I felt for Albertine was not based on the hope of carnal possession. And yet, when the lesson to be drawn from my experience that evening was, apparently, that such possession was impossible; when, after having had not the least doubt, that first day, on the beach, of Albertine\u2019s being unchaste, and having then passed through various intermediate assumptions, I seemed to have quite definitely reached the conclusion that she was absolutely virtuous; when, on her return from her aunt\u2019s, a week later, she greeted me coldly with: \u201cI forgive you; in fact I\u2019m sorry to have upset you, but you must never do it again,\u201d\u2014 then, in contrast to what I had felt on learning from Bloch that one could always have all the women one liked, and as if, in place of a real girl, I had known a wax doll, it came to pass that gradually there aetached itself from her my desire to penetrate into her life, to follow her through the places in which she had spent her childhood, to be initiated by her into the athletic life; my intellectual curiosity to know what were her thoughts on this subject or that did not survive my belief that I might take her in my arms if I chose. My dreams abandoned her, once they had ceased to be nourished by the hope of a possession of which I had supposed them to be independent. Thenceforward they found themselves once more at liberty to transmit themselves, according to the attraction that I had found in her on any particular day, above all according to the chances that I seemed to detect of my being, possibly, one day, loved by her \u2014 to one or another of Albertine\u2019s friends, and to Andr\u00e9e first of all. And yet, if Albertine had not existed, perhaps I should not have had the pleasure which I began to feel more and more strongly during the days that followed in the kindness that was shewn me by Andr\u00e9e. Albertine told no one of the check which I had received at her hands. She was one of those pretty girls who, from their earliest youth, by their beauty, but especially by an attraction, a charm which remains somewhat mysterious and has its source perhaps in reserves of vitality to which others less favoured by nature come to quench their thirst, have always \u2014 in their home circle, among their friends, in society \u2014 proved more attractive than other more beautiful and richer girls; she was one of those people from whom, before the age of love and ever so much more after it is reached, one asks more than they ask in return, more even than they are able to give. From her childhood Albertine had always had round her in an adoring circle four or five little girl friends, among them Andr\u00e9e who was so far her superior and knew it (and perhaps this attraction which Albertine exerted quite involuntarily had been the origin, had laid the foundations of the little band). This attraction was still potent even at a great social distance, in circles quite brilliant in comparison, where if there was a pavane to be danced, they would send for Albertine rather than have it danced by another girl of better family. The consequence was that, not having a penny to her name, living a hard enough life, moreover, on the hands of M. Bontemps, who was said to be \u2018on the rocks,\u2019 and was anyhow anxious to be rid of her, she was nevertheless invited, not only to dine but to stay, by people who, in Saint-Loup\u2019s sight, might not have had any distinction, but to Rosemonde\u2019s mother or Andr\u00e9e\u2019s, women who though very rich themselves did not know these other and richer people, represented something quite incalculable. Thus Albertine spent a few weeks every year with the family of one of the Governors of the Bank of France, who was also Chairman of the Board of Directors of a great Railway Company. The wife of this financier entertained people of importance, and had never mentioned her \u2018day\u2019 to Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mother, who thought her wanting in politeness, but was nevertheless prodigiously interested in everything that went on in her house. Accordingly she encouraged Andr\u00e9e every year to invite Albertine down to their villa, because, as she said, it was a real charity to offer a holiday by the sea to a girl who had not herself the means to travel and whose aunt did so little for her; Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mother was probably not prompted by the thought that the banker and his wife, learning that Albertine was made much of by her and her daughter, would form a high opinion of them both; still less did she hope that Albertine, good and clever as she was, would manage to get her invited, or at least to get Andr\u00e9e invited, to the financier\u2019s garden-parties. But every evening at the dinner-table, while she assumed an air of indifference slightly tinged with contempt, she was fascinated by Albertine\u2019s accounts of everything that had happened at the big house while she was staying there, and the names of the other guests, almost all of them people whom she knew by sight or by name. True, the thought that she knew them only in this indirect fashion, that is to say did not know them at all (she called this kind of acquaintance knowing people \u2018all my life\u2019), gave Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mother a touch of melancholy while she plied Albertine with questions about them in a lofty and distant tone, speaking with closed lips, and might have left her doubtful and uneasy as to the importance of her own social position had she not been able to reassure herself, to return safely to the \u2018realities of life,\u2019 by saying to the butler: \u201cPlease tell the chef that he has not made the peas soft enough.\u201d She then recovered her serenity. And she was quite determined that Andr\u00e9e was to marry nobody but a man \u2014 of the best family, of course \u2014 rich enough for her too to be able to keep a chef and a couple of coachmen. This was the proof positive, the practical indication of \u2018position.\u2019 But the fact that Albertine had dined at the banker\u2019s house in the country with this or that great lady, and that the said great lady had invited the girl to stay with her next winter, did not invalidate a sort of special consideration which Albertine shewed towards Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mother, which went very well with the pity, and even repulsion, excited by the tale of her misfortunes, a repulsion increased by the fact that M. Bontemps had proved a traitor to the cause (he was even, people said, vaguely Panamist) and had rallied to the Government. Not that this deterred Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mother, in her passion for abstract truth, from withering with her scorn the people who appeared to believe that Albertine was of humble origin. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you say? Why, they\u2019re one of the best families in the country. Simonet with a single \u2018n,\u2019 you know!\u201d Certainly, in view of the class of society in which all this went on, in which money plays so important a part, and mere charm makes people ask you out but not marry you, a \u2018comfortable\u2019 marriage did not appear to be for Albertine a practical outcome of the so distinguished patronage which she enjoyed but which would not have been held to compensate for her poverty. But even by themselves, and with no prospect of any matrimonial consequence, Albertine\u2019s \u2018successes\u2019 in society excited the envy of certain spiteful mothers, furious at seeing her received like one of the family by the banker\u2019s wife, even by Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mother, neither of whom they themselves really knew. They therefore went about telling common friends of those ladies and their own that both ladies would be very angry if they knew the facts, which were that Albertine repeated to each of them everything that the intimacy to which she was rashly admitted enabled her to spy out in the household of the other, a thousand little secrets which it must be infinitely unpleasant to the interested party to have made public. These envious women said this so that it might be repeated and might get Albertine into trouble with her patrons. But, as often happens, their machinations met with no success. The spite that prompted them was too apparent, and their only result was to make the women who had planned them appear rather more contemptible than before. Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mother was too firm in her opinion of Albertine to change her mind about her now. She looked upon her as a \u2018poor wretch,\u2019 but the best-natured girl living, and one who would do anything in the world to give pleasure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If this sort of select popularity to which Albertine had attained did not seem likely to lead to any practical result, it had stamped Andr\u00e9e\u2019s friend with the distinctive marks of people who, being always sought after, have never any need to offer themselves, marks (to be found also, and for analogous reasons, at the other end of the social scale among the leaders of fashion) which consist in their not making any display of the successes they have scored, but rather keeping them to themselves. She would never say to anyone: \u201cSo-and-so is anxious to meet me,\u201d would speak of everyone with the greatest good nature, and as if it had been she who ran after, who sought to know other people, and not they. If you spoke of a young man who, a few minutes earlier, had been, in private conversation with her, heaping the bitterest reproaches upon her because she had refused him an assignation, so far from proclaiming this in public, or betraying any resentment she would stand up for him: \u201cHe is such a nice boy!\u201d Indeed it quite annoyed her when she attracted people, because that compelled her to disappoint them, whereas her natural instinct was always to give pleasure. So much did she enjoy giving pleasure that she had come to employ a particular kind of falsehood, found among utilitarians and men who have \u2018arrived.\u2019 Existing besides in an embryonic state in a vast number of people, this form of insincerity consists in not being able to confine the pleasure arising out of a single act of politeness to a single person. For instance, if Albertine\u2019s aunt wished her niece to accompany her to a party which was not very lively, Albertine might have found it sufficient to extract from the incident the moral profit of having given pleasure to her aunt. But being courteously welcomed by her host and hostess, she thought it better to say to them that she had been wanting to see them for so long that she had finally seized this opportunity and begged her aunt to take her to their party. Even this was not enough: at the same party there happened to be one of Albertine\u2019s friends who was in great distress. \u201cI did not like the idea of your being here by yourself. I thought it might do you good to have me with you. If you would rather come away from here, go somewhere else, I am ready to do anything you like; all I want is to see you look not so sad.\u201d\u2014 Which, as it happened, was true also. Sometimes it happened however that the fictitious object destroyed the real. Thus, Albertine, having a favour to ask on behalf of one of her friends, went on purpose to see a certain lady who could help her. But on arriving at the house of this lady \u2014 a kind and sympathetic soul \u2014 the girl, unconsciously following the principle of utilising a single action in a number of ways, felt it to be more ingratiating to appear to have come there solely on account of the pleasure she knew she would derive from seeing the lady again. The lady was deeply touched that Albertine should have taken a long journey purely out of friendship for herself. Seeing her almost overcome by emotion, Albertine began to like the lady still better. Only, there was this awkward consequence: she now felt so keenly the pleasure of friendship which she pretended to have been her motive in coming, that she was afraid of making the lady suspect the genuineness of sentiments which were actually quite sincere if she now asked her to do the favour, whatever it may have been, for her friend. The lady would think that Albertine had come for that purpose, which was true, but would conclude also that Albertine had no disinterested pleasure in seeing her, which was not. With the result that she came away without having asked the favour, like a man sometimes who has been so good to a woman, in the hope of winning her, that he refrains from declaring his passion in order to preserve for his goodness an air of nobility. In other instances it would be wrong to say that the true object was sacrificed to the subordinate and subsequently conceived idea, but the two were so far incompatible that if the person to whom Albertine endeared herself by stating the second had known of the existence of the first, his pleasure would at once have been turned into the deepest annoyance. At a much later point in this story, we shall have occasion to see this kind of incompatibility expressed in clearer terms. Let us say for the present, borrowing an example of a completely different order, that they occur very frequently in the most divergent situations that life has to offer. A husband has established his mistress in the town where he is quartered with his regiment. His wife, left by herself in Paris, and with an inkling of the truth, grows more and more miserable, and writes her husband letters embittered by jealousy. Very well; the mistress is obliged to go up to Paris for the day. The husband cannot resist her entreaties that he will go with her, and applies for short leave, which is granted. But as he is a good-natured fellow, and hates to make his wife unhappy, he goes to her and tells her, shedding a few quite genuine tears, that, driven to desperation by her letters, he has found the means of getting away from his duties to come to her, to console her in his arms. He has thus contrived by a single journey to furnish wife and mistress alike with proofs of his affection. But if the wife were to learn the reason for which he has come to Paris, her joy would doubtless be turned into grief, unless her pleasure in seeing the faithless wretch outweighed, in spite of everything, the pain that his infidelities had caused her. Among the men who have struck me as practising with most perseverance this system of what might be called killing any number of birds with one stone, must be included M. de Norpois. He would now and then agree to act as intermediary between two of his friends who had quarrelled, which led to his being called the most obliging of men. But it was not sufficient for him to appear to be doing a service to the friend who had come to him to demand it; he would represent to the other the steps which he was taking to effect a reconciliation as undertaken not at the request of the first friend but in the interest of the second, an attitude of the sincerity of which he had never any difficulty in convincing a listener already influenced by the idea that he saw before him the \u2018most serviceable of men.\u2019 In this fashion, playing in two scenes turn about, what in stage parlance is called \u2018doubling\u2019 two parts, he never allowed his influence to be in the slightest degree imperilled, and the services which he rendered constituted not an expenditure of capital but a dividend upon some part of his credit. At the same time every service, seemingly rendered twice over, correspondingly enhanced his reputation as an obliging friend, and, better still, a friend whose interventions were efficacious, one who did not draw bows at a venture, whose efforts were always justified by success, as was shewn by the gratitude of both parties. This duplicity in rendering services was \u2014 allowing for disappointments such as are the lot of every human being \u2014 an important element of M. de Norpois\u2019s character. And often at the Ministry he would make use of my father, who was a simple soul, while making him believe that it was he, M. de Norpois, who was being useful to my father. Attracting people more easily than she wished, and having no need to proclaim her conquests abroad, Albertine kept silence with regard to the scene with myself by her bedside, which a plain girl would have wished the whole world to know. And yet of her attitude during that scene I could not arrive at any satisfactory explanation. Taking first of all the supposition that she was absolutely chaste (a supposition with which I had originally accounted for the violence with which Albertine had refused to let herself be taken in my arms and kissed, though it was by no means essential to my conception of the goodness, the fundamentally honourable character of my friend), I could not accept it without a copious revision of its terms. It ran so entirely counter to the hypothesis which I had constructed that day when I saw Albertine for the first time. Then ever so many different acts, all acts of kindness towards myself (a kindness that was caressing, at times uneasy, alarmed, jealous of my predilection for Andr\u00e9e) came up on all sides to challenge the brutal gesture with which, to escape from me, she had pulled the bell. Why then had she invited me to come and spend the evening by her bedside? Why had she spoken all the time in the language of affection? What object is there in your desire to see a friend, in your fear that he is fonder of another of your friends than of you; why seek to give him pleasure, why tell him, so romantically, that the others will never know that he has spent the evening in your room, if you refuse him so simple a pleasure and if to you it is no pleasure at all? I could not believe, all the same, that Albertine\u2019s chastity was carried to such a pitch as that, and I had begun to ask myself whether her violence might not have been due to some reason of coquetry, a disagreeable odour, for instance, which she suspected of lingering about her person, and by which she was afraid that I might be disgusted, or else of cowardice, if for instance she imagined, in her ignorance of the facts of love, that my state of nervous exhaustion was due to something contagious, communicable to her in a kiss. She was genuinely distressed by her failure to afford me pleasure, and gave me a little gold pencil-case, with that virtuous perversity which people shew who, moved by your supplications and yet not consenting to grant you what those supplications demand, are anxious all the same to bestow on you some mark of their affection; the critic, an article from whose pen would so gratify the novelist, asks him instead to dinner; the duchess does not take the snob with her to the theatre but lends him her box on an evening when she will not be using it herself. So far are those who do least for us, and might easily do nothing, driven by conscience to do something. I told Albertine that in giving me this pencil-case she was affording me great pleasure, and yet not so great as I should have felt if, on the night she had spent at the hotel, she had permitted me to embrace her. \u201cIt would have made me so happy; what possible harm could it have done you? I was simply astounded at your refusing to let me do it.\u201d \u201cWhat astounds me,\u201d she retorted, \u201cis that you should have thought it astounding. Funny sort of girls you must know if my behaviour surprises you.\u201d \u201cI am extremely sorry if I annoyed you, but even now I cannot say that I think I was in the wrong. What I feel is that all that sort of thing is of no importance, really, and I can\u2019t understand a girl who could so easily give pleasure not consenting to do so. Let us be quite clear about it,\u201d I went on, throwing a sop of sorts to her moral scruples, as I recalled how she and her friends had scarified the girl who went about with the actress Lea. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to say for a moment that a girl can behave exactly as she likes, or that there\u2019s no such thing as immorality. Take, let me see now, yes, what you were saying the other day about a girl who is staying at Balbec and her relations with an actress; I call that degrading, so degrading that I feel sure it must all have been made up by the girl\u2019s enemies, and that there can\u2019t be any truth in the story. It strikes me as improbable, impossible. But to let a friend kiss you, and go farther than that even \u2014 since you say that I am your friend . . . \u201d \u201cSo you are, but I have had friends before now, I have known lots of young men who were every bit as friendly, I can assure you. There wasn\u2019t one of them would ever have dared to do a thing like that. They knew they\u2019d get their ears boxed if they tried it on. Besides, they never dreamed of trying, we would shake hands in an open, friendly sort of way, like good pals, but there was never a word said about kissing, and yet we weren\u2019t any the less friends for that. Why, if it\u2019s my friendship you are after, you\u2019ve nothing to complain of; I must be jolly fond of you to forgive you. But I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t care two straws about me, really. Own up now, it\u2019s Andr\u00e9e you\u2019re in love with. After all, you\u2019re quite right; she is ever so much prettier than I am, and perfectly charming! Oh! You men!\u201d Despite my recent disappointment, these words so frankly uttered, by giving me a great respect for Albertine, made a very pleasant impression on me. And perhaps this impression was to have serious and vexatious consequences for me later on, for it was round it that there began to form that feeling almost of brotherly intimacy, that moral core which was always to remain at the heart of my love for Albertine. A feeling of this sort may be the cause of the keenest pain. For in order really to suffer at the hands of a woman one must have believed in her completely. For the moment, that embryo of moral esteem, of friendship, was left embedded in me like a stepping-stone in a stream. It could have availed nothing, by itself, against my happiness if it had remained there without growing, in an inertia which it was to retain the following year, and still more during the final weeks of this first visit to Balbec. It dwelt in me like one of those foreign bodies which it would be wiser when all is said to expel, but which we leave where they are without disturbing them, so harmless for the present does their weakness, their isolation amid a strange environment render them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My dreams were now once more at liberty to concentrate on one or another of Albertine\u2019s friends, and returned first of all to Andr\u00e9e, whose kindnesses might perhaps have appealed to me less strongly had I not been certain that they would come to Albertine\u2019s ears. Undoubtedly the preference that I had long been pretending to feel for Andr\u00e9e had furnished me \u2014 in the habit of conversation with her, of declaring my affection \u2014 with, so to speak, the material, prepared and ready, for a love of her which had hitherto lacked only the complement of a genuine sentiment, and this my heart being once more free was now in a position to supply. But for me really to love Andr\u00e9e, she was too intellectual, too neurotic, too sickly, too much like myself. If Albertine now seemed to me to be void of substance, Andr\u00e9e was filled with something which I knew only too well. I had thought, that first day, that what I saw on the beach there was the mistress of some racing cyclist, passionately athletic; and now Andr\u00e9e told me that if she had taken up athletic pastimes, it was under orders from her doctor, to cure her neurasthenia, her digestive troubles, but that her happiest hours were those which she spent in translating one of George Eliot\u2019s novels. The misunderstanding, due to an initial mistake as to what Andr\u00e9e was, had not, as a matter of fact, the slightest importance. But my mistake was one of the kind which, if they allow love to be born, and are not recognised as mistakes until it has ceased to be under control, become a cause of suffering. Such mistakes \u2014 which may be quite different from mine with regard to Andr\u00e9e, and even its exact opposite \u2014 are frequently due (and this was especially the case here) to our paying too much attention to the aspect, the manners of what a person is not but would like to be, in forming our first impression of that person. To the outward appearance affectation, imitation, the longing to be admired, whether by the good or by the wicked, add misleading similarities of speech and gesture. These are cynicisms and cruelties which, when put to the test, prove no more genuine than certain apparent virtues and generosities. Just as we often discover a vain miser beneath the cloak of a man famed for his bountiful charity, so her flaunting of vice leads us to suppose a Messalina a respectable girl with middle-class prejudices. I had thought to find in Andr\u00e9e a healthy, primitive creature, whereas she was merely a person in search of health, as were doubtless many of those in whom she herself had thought to find it, and who were in reality no more healthy than a burly arthritic with a red face and in white flannels is necessarily a Hercules. Now there are circumstances in which it is not immaterial to our happiness that the person whom we have loved because of what appeared to be so healthy about her is in reality only one of those invalids who receive such health as they possess from others, as the planets borrow their light, as certain bodies are only conductors of electricity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No matter, Andr\u00e9e, like Rosemonde and Gis\u00e8le, indeed more than they, was, when all was said, a friend of Albertine, sharing her life, imitating her conduct, so closely that, the first day, I had not at once distinguished them one from another. Over these girls, flowering sprays of roses whose principal charm was that they outlined themselves against the sea, the same undivided partnership prevailed as at the time when I did not know them, when the appearance of no matter which of them had caused me such violent emotion by its announcement that the little band was not far off. And even now the sight of one of them filled me with a pleasure into which there entered, to an extent which I should not have found it easy to define, the thought of seeing the others follow her in due course, and even if they did not come that day, speaking about them, and knowing that they would be told that I had been on the beach\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was no longer simply the attraction of those first days, it was a regular love-longing which hesitated among them all, so far was each the natural substitute for the others. My bitterest grief would not have been to be thrown over by whichever of the girls I liked best, but I should at once have liked best, because I should have fastened on to her the whole of the melancholy dream which had been floating vaguely among them all, her who had thrown me over. It would, moreover, in that event, be the loss of all her friends, in whose eyes I should speedily have forfeited whatever advantage I might possess, that I should, in losing her, have unconsciously regretted, having vowed to them that sort of collective love which the politician and the actor feel for the public for whose desertion of them after they have enjoyed all its favours they can never be consoled. Even those favours which I had failed to win from Albertine I would hope suddenly to receive from one or other who had parted from me in the evening with a word or glance of ambiguous meaning, thanks to which it was to her that, for the next day or so, my desire would turn. It strayed among them all the more voluptuously in that upon those volatile faces a comparative fixation of features had now begun, and had been carried far enough for the eye to distinguish \u2014 even if it were to change yet further \u2014 each malleable and floating effigy. To the differences that existed among them there was doubtless very little that corresponded in the no less marked differences in the length and breadth of those features, any of which might, perhaps, dissimilar as the girls appeared, almost have been lifted bodily from one face and imposed at random upon any other. But our knowledge of faces is not mathematical. In the first place, it does not begin with the measurement of the parts, it takes as its starting point an expression, a combination of the whole. In Andr\u00e9e, for instance, the fineness of her gentle eyes seemed to go with the thinness of her nose, as slender as a mere curve which one could imagine as having been traced in order to produce along a single line the idea of delicacy divided higher up between the dual smile of her twin gaze. A line equally fine was engraved in her hair, pliant and deep as the line with which the wind furrows the sand. And in her it must have been hereditary; for the snow-white hair of Andr\u00e9e\u2019s mother was driven in the same way, forming here a swelling, there a depression, like a snowdrift that rises or sinks according to the irregularities of the soil. Certainly, when compared with the fine delineation of Andr\u00e9e\u2019s, Rosemonde\u2019s nose seemed to present broad surfaces, like a high tower raised upon massive foundations. Albeit expression suffices to make us believe in enormous differences between things that are separated by infinitely little \u2014 albeit that infinitely little may by itself create an expression that is absolutely unique, an individuality \u2014 it was not only the infinitely little of its lines and the originality of its expression that made each of these faces appear irreducible to terms of any other. Between my friends\u2019 faces their colouring established a separation wider still, not so much by the varied beauty of the tones with which it provided them, so contrasted that I felt when I looked at Rosemonde \u2014 flooded with a sulphurous rose colour, with the further contrast of the greenish light in her eyes \u2014 and then at Andr\u00e9e \u2014 whose white cheeks received such an austere distinction from her black hair \u2014 the same kind of pleasure as if I had been looking alternately at a geranium growing by a sunlit sea and a camellia in the night; but principally because the infinitely little differences of their lines were enlarged out of all proportion, the relations between one and another surface entirely changed by this new element of colour which, in addition to being a dispenser of tints, is great at restoring, or rather at altering, dimensions. So that faces which were perhaps constructed on not dissimilar lines, according as they were lighted by the flaming torch of an auburn poll or high complexion, or by the white glimmer of a dull pallor, grew sharper or broader, became something else, like those properties used in the Russian ballet, consisting sometimes, when they are seen in the light of day, of a mere disc of paper, out of which the genius of a Bakst, according to the blood-red or moonlit effect in which he plunges his stage, makes a hard incrustation, like a turquoise on a palace well, or a swooning softness, as of a Bengal rose in an eastern garden. And so when acquiring a knowledge of faces we take careful measurements, but as painters, not as surveyors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So it was with Albertine as with her friends. On certain days, slim, with grey cheeks, a sullen air, a violet transparency falling obliquely from her such as we notice sometimes on the sea, she seemed to be feeling the sorrows of exile. On other days her face, more sleek, caught and glued my desires to its varnished surface and prevented them from going any farther; unless I caught a sudden glimpse of her from the side, for her dull cheeks, like white wax on the surface, were visibly pink beneath, which made me anxious to kiss them, to reach that different tint which thus avoided my touch. At other times happiness bathed her cheeks with a clarity so mobile that the skin, grown fluid and vague, gave passage to a sort of stealthy and subcutaneous gaze, which made it appear to be of another colour but not of another substance than her eyes; sometimes, instinctively, when one looked at her face punctuated with tiny brown marks among which floated what were simply two larger, bluer stains, it was like looking at the egg of a goldfinch \u2014 or often like an opalescent agate cut and polished in two places only, where, from the heart of the brown stone, shone like the transparent wings of a sky-blue butterfly her eyes, those features in which the flesh becomes a mirror and gives us the illusion that it allows us, more than through the other parts of the body, to approach the soul. But most often of all she shewed more colour, and was then more animated; sometimes the only pink thing in her white face was the tip of her nose, as finely pointed as that of a mischievous kitten with which one would have liked to stop and play; sometimes her cheeks were so glossy that one\u2019s glance slipped, as over the surface of a miniature, over their pink enamel, which was made to appear still more delicate, more private, by the enclosing though half-opened case of her black hair; or it might happen that the tint of her cheeks had deepened to the violet shade of the red cyclamen, and, at times, even, when she was flushed or feverish, with a suggestion of un-healthiness which lowered my desire to something more sensual and made her glance expressive of something more perverse and unwholesome, to the deep purple of certain roses, a red that was almost black; and each of these Albertines was different, as in every fresh appearance of the dancer whose colours, form, character, are transmuted according to the innumerably varied play of a projected limelight. It was perhaps because they were so different, the persons whom I used to contemplate in her at this period, that later on I became myself a different person, corresponding to the particular Albertine to whom my thoughts had turned; a jealous, an indifferent, a voluptuous, a melancholy, a frenzied person, created anew not merely by the accident of what memory had risen to the surface, but in proportion also to the strength of the belief that was lent to the support of one and the same memory by the varying manner in which I appreciated it. For this is the point to which we must always return, to these beliefs with which most of the time we are quite unconsciously filled, but which for all that are of more importance to our happiness than is the average person whom we see, for it is through them that we see him, it is they that impart his momentary greatness to the person seen. To be quite accurate I ought to give a different name to each of the \u2018me\u2019s\u2019 who were to think about Albertine in time to come; I ought still more to give a different name to each of the Albertines who appeared before me, never the same, like \u2014 called by me simply and for the sake of convenience \u2018the sea\u2019\u2014 those seas that succeeded one another on the beach, in front of which, a nymph likewise, she stood apart. But above all, in the same way as, in telling a story (though to far greater purpose here), one mentions what the weather was like on such and such a day, I ought always to give its name to the belief that, on any given day on which I saw Albertine, was reigning in my soul, creating its atmosphere, the appearance of people like that of seas being dependent on those clouds, themselves barely visible, which change the colour of everything by their concentration, their mobility, their dissemination, their flight \u2014 like that cloud which Elstir had rent one evening by not introducing me to these girls, with whom he had stopped to talk, whereupon their forms, as they moved away, had suddenly increased in beauty \u2014 a cloud that had formed again a few days later when I did get to know the girls, veiling their brightness, interposing itself frequently between my eyes and them, opaque and soft, like Virgil\u2019s Leucothea\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No doubt, all their faces had assumed quite new meanings for me since the manner in which they were to be read had been to some extent indicated to me by their talk, talk to which I could ascribe a value all the greater in that, by questioning them, I could prompt it whenever I chose, could vary it like an experimenter who seeks by corroborative proofs to establish the truth of his theory. And it is, after all, as good a way as any of solving the problem of existence to approach near enough to the things that have appeared to us from a distance to be beautiful and mysterious, to be able to satisfy ourselves that they have neither mystery nor beauty. It is one of the systems of hygiene among which we are at liberty to choose our own, a system which is perhaps not to be recommended too strongly, but it gives us a certain tranquillity with which to spend what remains of life, and also \u2014 since it enables us to regref nothing, by assuring us that we have attained to the best, and that the best was nothing out of the common \u2014 with which to resign ourselves to death\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had now substituted, in the brains of these girls, for their supposed contempt for chastity, their memories of daily \u2018incidents,\u2019 honest principles, liable, it might be, to relaxation, but principles which had hitherto kept unscathed the children who had acquired them in their own respectable homes. And yet, when one has been mistaken from the start, even in trifling details, when an error of assumption or recollection makes one seek for the author of a malicious slander, or for the place where one has lost something, in the wrong direction, it frequently happens that one discovers one\u2019s error only to substitute for it not the truth but a fresh error. I drew, so far as their manner of life and the proper way to behave with them went, all the possible conclusions from the word \u2018Innocence\u2019 which I had read, in talking familiarly with them, upon their faces. But perhaps I had been reading carelessly, with the inaccuracy born of a too rapid deciphering, and it was no more written there than was the name of Jules Ferry on the programme of the performance at which I had heard Berma for the first time, an omission which had not prevented me from maintaining to M. de Norpois that Jules Ferry, beyond any possibility of doubt, was a person who wrote curtain-raisers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No matter which it might be of my friends of the little band, was not inevitably the face that I had last seen the only face that I could recall, since, of our memories with respect to a person, the mind eliminates everything that does not agree with our immediate purpose of our daily relations (especially if those relations are quickened with an element of love which, ever unsatisfied, lives always in the moment that is about to come)? That purpose allows the chain of spent days to slip away, holding on only to the very end of it, often of a quite different metal from the links that have vanished in the night, and in the journey which we make through life, counts as real only in the place in which we at any given moment are. But all those earliest impressions, already so remote, could not find, against the blunting process that assailed them day after day, any remedy in my memory; during the long hours which I spent in talking, eating, playing with these girls, I did not remember even that they were the same ruthless, sensual virgins whom I had seen, as in a fresco, file past between me and the sea\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Geographers, archaeologists may conduct us over Calypso\u2019s island, may excavate the Palace of Minos. Only Calypso becomes then nothing more than a woman, Minos than a king with no semblance of divinity. Even the good and bad qualities which history teaches us to have been the attributes of those quite real personages, often differ widely from those which we had ascribed to the fabulous beings who bore the same names as they. Thus had there faded and vanished all the lovely mythology of Ocean which I had composed in those first days. But it is not altogether immaterial that we do succeed, at any rate now and then, in spending our time in familiar intercourse with what we have thought to be unattainable and have longed to possess. In our later dealings with people whom at first we found disagreeable there persists always, even among the artificial pleasure which we have come at length to enjoy in their society, the lingering taint of the defects which they have succeeded in hiding. But, in relations such as I was now having with Albertine and her friends, the genuine pleasure which was there at the start leaves that fragrance which no amount of skill can impart to hot-house fruits, to grapes that have not ripened in the sun. The supernatural creatures which for a little time they had been to me still introduced, even without any intention on my part, a miraculous element into the most commonplace dealings that I might have with them, or rather prevented such dealings from ever becoming commonplace at all. My desire had sought so ardently to learn the significance of the eyes which now knew and smiled to see me, but whose glances on the first day had crossed mine like rays from another universe; it had distributed so generously, so carefully, so minutely, colour and fragrance over the carnation surfaces of these girls who now, outstretched on the cliff-top, were simply offering me sandwiches or guessing riddles, that often, in the afternoon, while I lay there among them, like those painters who seek to match the grandeurs of antiquity in modern life, give to a woman cutting her toe-nail the nobility of the Spinario, or, like Rubens, make goddesses out of women whom they know, to people some mythological scene; at those lovely forms, dark and fair, so dissimilar in type, scattered around me in the grass, I would gaze without emptying them, perhaps, of all the mediocre contents with which my everyday experience had filled them, and at the same time without expressly recalling their heavenly origin, as if, like young Hercules or young Telemachus, I had been set to play amid a band of nymphs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then the concerts ended, the bad weather began, my friends left Balbec; not all at once, like the swallows, but all in the same week. Albertine was the first to go, abruptly, without any of her friends understanding, then or afterwards, why she had returned suddenly to Paris whither neither her work nor any amusement summoned her. \u201cShe said neither why nor wherefore, and with that she left!\u201d muttered Fran\u00e7oise, who, for that matter, would have liked us to leave as well. We were, she thought, inconsiderate towards the staff, now greatly reduced in number, but retained on account of the few visitors who were still staying on, and towards the manager who was \u2018just eating up money.\u2019 It was true that the hotel, which would very soon be closed for the winter, had long since seen most of its patrons depart, but never had it been so attractive. This view was not shared by the manager; from end to end of the rooms in which we sat shivering, and and at the doors of which no page now stood on guard, he paced the corridors, wearing a new frock coat, so well tended by the hairdresser that his insipid face appeared to be made of some composition in which, for one part of flesh, there were three of cosmetics, incessantly changing his neckties. (These refinements cost less than having the place heated and keeping on the staff, just as a man who is no longer able to subscribe ten thousand francs to a charity can still parade his generosity without inconvenience to himself by tipping the boy who brings him a telegram with five.) He appeared to be inspecting the empty air, to be seeking to give, by the smartness of his personal appearance, a provisional splendour to the desolation that could now be felt in this hotel where the season had not been good, and walked like the ghost of a monarch who returns to haunt the ruins of what was once his palace. He was particularly annoyed when the little local railway company, finding the supply of passengers inadequate, discontinued its trains until the following spring. \u201cWhat is lacking here,\u201d said the manager, \u201cis the means of commotion.\u201d In spite of the deficit which his books shewed, he was making plans for the future on a lavish scale. And as he was, after all, capable of retaining an exact memory of fine language when it was directly applicable to the hotel-keeping industry and had the effect of enhancing its importance: \u201cI was not adequately supported, although in the dining room I had an efficient squad,\u201d he explained; \u201cbut the pages left something to be desired. You will see, next year, what a phalanx I shall collect.\u201d In the meantime the suspension of the services of the B. C. B. obliged him to send for letters and occasionally to dispatch visitors in a light cart. I would often ask leave to sit by the driver, and in this way I managed to be out in all weathers, as in the winter that I had spent at Combray\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes, however, the driving rain kept my grandmother and me, the Casino being closed, in rooms almost completely deserted, as in the lowest hold of a ship when a storm is raging; and there, day by day, as in the course of a sea-voyage, a new person from among those in whose company we had spent three months without getting to know them, the chief magistrate from Caen, the leader of the Cherbourg bar, an American lady and her daughters, came up to us, started conversation, discovered some way of making the time pass less slowly, revealed some social accomplishment, taught us a new game, invited us to drink tea or to listen to music, to meet them at a certain hour, to plan together some of those diversions which contain the true secret of pleasure-giving, which is to aim not at giving pleasure but simply at helping us to pass the time of our boredom, in a word, formed with us, at the end of our stay at Balbec, ties of friendship which, in a day or two, their successive departures from the place would sever. I even made the acquaintance of the rich young man, of one of his pair of aristocratic friends and of the actress, who had reappeared for a few days; but their little society was composed now of three persons only, the other friend having returned to Paris. They asked me to come out to dinner with them at their restaurant. I think, they were just as well pleased that I did not accept. But they had given the invitation in the most friendly way imaginable, and albeit it came actually from the rich young man, since the others were only his guests, as the friend who was staying with him, the Marquis Maurice de Vaud\u00e9mont, came of a very good family indeed, instinctively the actress, in asking me whether I would not come, said, to flatter my vanity: \u201cMaurice will be so pleased.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And when in the hall of the hotel I met them all three together, it was M. de Vaud\u00e9mont (the rich young man effacing himself) who said to me: \u201cWon\u2019t you give us the pleasure of dining with us?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the whole I had derived very little benefit from Balbec, but this only strengthened my desire to return there. It seemed to me that I had not stayed there long enough. This was not what my friends at home were thinking, who wrote to ask whether I meant to stay there for the rest of my life. And when I saw that it was the name \u2018Balbec\u2019 which they were obliged to put on the envelope \u2014 just as my window looked out not over a landscape or a street but on to the plains of the sea, as I heard through the night its murmur to which I had before going to sleep entrusted my ship of dreams, I had the illusion that this life of promiscuity with the waves must effectively, without my knowledge, pervade me with the notion of their charm, like those lessons which one leams by heart while one is asleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The manager offered to reserve better rooms for me next year, but I had now become attached to mine, into which I went without ever noticing the scent of flowering grasses, while my mind, which had once found such difficulty in rising to fill its space had come now to take its measurements so exactly that I was obliged to submit it to a reverse process when I had to sleep in Paris, in my own room, the ceiling of which was low\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was high time, indeed, to leave Balbec, for the cold and damp had become too penetrating for us to stay any longer in a hotel which had neither fireplaces in the rooms nor a central furnace. Moreover, I forgot almost immediately these last weeks of our stay. What my mind\u2019s eye did almost invariably see when I thought of Balbec were the hours which, every morning during the fine weather, as I was going out in the afternoon with Albertine and her friends, my grandmother, following the doctor\u2019s orders, insisted on my spending lying down, with the room darkened. The manager gave instructions that no noise was to be made on my landing, and came up himself to see that they were obeyed. Because the light outside was so strong, I kept drawn for as long as possible the big violet curtains which had adopted so hostile an attitude towards me the first evening. But as, in spite of the pins with which, so that the light should not enter, Fran\u00e7oise fastened them every night, pins which she alone knew how to unfasten; as in spite of the rugs, the red cretonne table-cover, the various fabrics collected here and there which she fitted in to her defensive scheme, she never succeeded in making them meet exactly, the darkness was not complete, and they allowed to spill over the carpet as it were a scarlet shower of anemone-petals, among which I could not resist the temptation to plunge my bare feet for a moment. And on the wall which faced the window and so was partially lighted, a cylinder of gold with no visible support was placed vertically and moved slowly along like the pillar of fire which went before the Hebrews in the desert. I went back to bed; obliged to taste without moving, in imagination only, and all at once, the pleasures of games, bathing, walks which the morning prompted, joy made my heart beat thunderingly like a machine set going at full speed but fixed to the ground, which can spend its energy only by turning upon its own axis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I knew that my friends were on the \u2018front,\u2019 but I did not see them as they passed before the links of the sea\u2019s uneven chain, far at the back of which, and nestling amid its bluish peaks like an Italian citadel, one could occasionally, in a clear moment, make out the little town of Rivebelle, drawn in minutest detail by the sun. I did not see my friends, but (while there mounted to my belvedere the shout of the newsboy, the \u2018journalists\u2019 as Fran\u00e7oise used to call them, the shouts of the bathers and of children at play, punctuating like the cries of sea-birds the sound of the gently breaking waves) I guessed their presence, I heard their laughter enveloped like the laughter of the Nereids in the smooth tide of sound that rose to my ears. \u201cWe looked up,\u201d said Albertine in the evening, \u201cto see if you were coming down. But your shutters were still closed when the concert began.\u201d At ten o\u2019clock, sure enough, it broke out beneath my windows. In the intervals in the blare of the instruments, if the tide were high, would begin again, slurred and continuous, the gliding surge of a wave which seemed to enfold the notes of the violin in its crystal spirals and to be spraying its foam over echoes of a submarine music. I grew impatient because no one had yet come with my things, so that I might rise and dress. Twelve o\u2019clock struck, Fran\u00e7oise arrived at last. And for months on end, in this Balbec to which I had so looked forward because I imagined it only as battered by the storm and buried in fogs, the weather had been so dazzling and so unchanging that when she came to open the window I could always, without once being wrong, expect to see the same patch of sunlight folded in the corner of the outer wall, of an unalterable colour which was less moving as a sign of summer than depressing as the colour of a lifeless and composed enamel. And after Fran\u00e7oise had removed her pins from the mouldings of the window-frame, taken down her various cloths, and drawn back the curtains, the summer day which she disclosed seemed as dead, as immemorially ancient as would have been a sumptuously attired dynastic mummy from which our old servant had done no more than pre-cautionally unwind the linen wrappings before displaying it to my gaze, embalmed in its vesture of goldEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/317100", "artist_names": "Madonna", "full_title": "You'll See by\u00a0Madonna", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f578a117affc5e8bc928672683af44ae.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f578a117affc5e8bc928672683af44ae.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 317100, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 354382, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1625339901, "path": "/Madonna-youll-see-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Madonna-youll-see-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1995, "month": 10, "day": 30}, "release_date_for_display": "October 30, 1995", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Oct. 30, 1995", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/70a578f9e9a513268ac6e5a6d8d5a814.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/70a578f9e9a513268ac6e5a6d8d5a814.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 11886}, "title": "You\u2019ll See", "title_with_featured": "You'll See", "updated_by_human_at": 1652656432, "url": "https://genius.com/Madonna-youll-see-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/276", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/15198264b7ebda9dee9542a1eadd4055.1000x625x1.jpg", "id": 276, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/8f0c7a065cbcef37fb6a571ce3cc1d94.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Madonna", "slug": "Madonna", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Madonna"}, "artist": "Madonna", "lyrics": "TranslationsPortugu\u00easYou\u2019ll See Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou think that I can't live without your love\nYou'll see\nYou think I can't go on another day\nYou think I have nothing\nWithout you by my side\nYou'll see, somehow, some way\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou think that I can never laugh again\nYou'll see\nYou think that you destroyed my faith in love\nYou think after all you've done\nI'll never find my way back home\nYou'll see, somehow, someday\n[Chorus]\nAll by myself\nI don't need anyone at all\nI know I'll survive\nI know I'll stay alive\nAll on my own\nI don't need anyone this time\nIt will be mine\nNo one can take it from me\nYou'll see\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou think that you are strong, but you are weak\nYou'll see\nIt takes more strength to cry, admit defeat\nI have truth on my side\nYou only have deceit\nYou'll see, somehow, someday\n\n[Chorus]\nAll by myself\nI don't need anyone at all\nI know I'll survive\nI know I'll stay alive\nI'll stand on my own\nI won't need anyone this time\nIt will be mine\nNo one can take it from me\nYou'll see\nYou'll see\nYou'll see\nYou'll seeYou might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/933015", "artist_names": "Immature (Ft.

from the sky to light your darkest night\nI wouldn't let one drop of rain fall down into your life\nPut your heart in my hands\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBaby, believe me I could never do you wrong\nAnd I would never paint your world blue\nAnd if sometimes it seems I must have lost my mind\nI might be crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you\n[Chorus]\nI'd lie for you and that's the truth\nDo anything you asked me to\nI'd even sell my soul for you\nI'd do it all for you\nIf you'd just believe in me\n\n[Verse 2]\nJust take a look in my eyes, you'll see a love that's blind\nJust take a hold of my hand, I'll take you to paradise\nAin't a star that's too far\n\nYour every wish will be a wish that I will make come true\nAnd if you want the moon I swear I'll bring it down for you\nLet me into your heart\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBelieve me baby, got your name carved on my soul\n'Cause you're the only one that I'll give it too\nGo let'em say that I'm a fool to act this way\n'Cause if I'm crazy, I'm just crazy 'bout you\n\n[Chorus]\nI'd lie for you and that's the truth\nDo anything you ask me to\nI'll even sell my soul for you\nI'll do it all for you\nIf you just believe in me\nYou might also likeI'd lie for you and that's the truth\nMove mountains if you want me to\nI'd walk across the fire for you\nI'd walk on the wild for you\nIf you'd just believe in me\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd you will never see a day I'll ever break your heart\nYou'll see the sky fall down before it ever gets that far\nI'll show you heaven every second that you're in my arms\nBaby I'm crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you\n\n[Chorus]\nI'd lie for you and that's the truth\nMove mountains if you want me to\nI'd walk across the fire for you\nI'd walk on the wild for you\nIf you'd just believe in me\n\nI'd walk on the

Lyrics[Verse 1: Khujo]\nWhen the scene unfolds\nYoung girls, thirteen years old\nExpose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank\nGot more stretch marks than these hoes holl'in' they got rank\nSee SEGA ain't in this new world order\nDem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia\nUnited Nations, overseas, trained assassins\nDo search and seize, ain't knocking or asking\nThey're coming for niggas like me, poor white trash like they\nTricks like her back in slavery\nConcentration camps laced with gas pipelines\nInfernos outdoors like they had\nBack when Adolf Hitler was living in 1945\nListen to me now, believe me later on\nIn the future, look it up\nWhere they say it in the Constitution?\nThat in the event of a race war\nPlaces like Operation Heartbreak Hotel\nMoments tear until air tight vents sealed off despair\nDem say expect no mercy\nFool, you should be my least worries\nGot to deal with W-2's, 1099's\nUnmarked black helicopters swoop down\nAnd try to put missiles in mines\n[Chorus]\nWho's that peeking in my window?\nPow, nobody now (Nobody now)\nWho's that peeking in my window?\nPow, nobody now (Nobody now)\n\n[Verse 2: CeeLo Green]\nMe and my family moved in our apartment complex\nA gate with a serial code was put up next\nThe claim that this community is so drug-free\nBut it don't look that way to me\n'Cause I can see the young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7\nJunkies looking for a hit of the blow, it's powerful\nOh, you know what else they tryin' to do?\nMake a curfew especially for me and you\nThe traces of the New World Order, time is getting shorter\nIf we don't get prepared, people, it's gon' be a slaughter\nMy mind won't allow me to not be curious\nMy folk don't understand, so they don't take it serious\nBut every now and then, I wonder if the gate was put up\nTo keep crime out or keep our ass in\n\n[Chorus]\nWho's that peeking in my window?\nPow, nobody now (nobody now)\nWho's that peeking in my window?\nPow, nobody now (nobody now)\nYou might also like[Verse 3: T-Mo]\nListen up, lil' nigga\u2014I'm talking to you\nAbout what your little ass need to be going through\nI fall a victim, too\nAnd I know I shouldn't smoke so much, but I do\nWith the crew every day\u2014on the average, 'bout four or five\nI'm lucky to be alive at sunrise\nNow, I realize the cost after I lost my best friend, Bean\nI'm recognized as a kin, who am I to tell you to stop smokin'?\nNow, you open to disease and colds\nAnd ain't sixteen years old\u2014this shit has got to stop\nLet's take a walk through detox\nI want out of this hole, I'm in a cell\nUnder attack\u2014loc' up, folks, they in the hood\nGot an eye on every move I make\nOpen your face to info you ain't know 'cause it's kept low\nHow the New World Plan reach the planet without the Black man\n\n[Verse 4: Big Gipp]\nSo what's your aim?\nTryin' to separate me from the blood is disrespect\nLike coming in my home and not wiping your feet on the rug\nThe Citron Absolut has got me bucking\nNo hang with no phony (Phony)\nLook out for the man with the mask on the white pony\nOn my back are bills staying off my toes, always on my heels\nInsane, plain soldiers coming in the dark by plane\nTo enforce the new system by reign\nTag my skin with your computer chip (Chip)\nRun your hand over the scanner to buy your dish now (Now)\nNo more fishing for your fish (No more fishing for my fish)\nKiss the days of the old days, past ways, gone\nMind blown, conception, protection\nMy name on your selections but I caught you coming (Coming)\nPow!\n[Chorus]\nWho's that peeking in my window?\nPow, nobody now (Nobody now)\nWho's that peeking in my window?\nPow, nobody now (Nobody now)\nWho's that peeking in my window?\nPow, nobody now (Nobody now)\nWho's that peeking in my

arranged with a view to the dancing, the large oak table having been moved back till it stood as a breastwork to the fireplace. At each end, behind, and in the chimney-corner were grouped the guests, many of them being warm-faced and panting, among whom Eustacia cursorily recognized some well-to-do persons from beyond the heath. Thomasin, as she had expected, was not visible, and Eustacia recollected that a light had shone from an upper window when they were outside\u2014the window, probably, of Thomasin's room. A nose, chin, hands, knees, and toes projected from the seat within the chimney opening, which members she found to unite in the person of Grandfer Cantle, Mrs. Yeobright's occasional assistant in the garden, and therefore one of the invited. The smoke went up from an Etna of peat in front of him, played round the notches of the chimney-crook, struck against the salt-box, and got lost among the flitches.\n\nAnother part of the room soon riveted her gaze. At the other side of the chimney stood the settle, which is the necessary supplement to a fire so open that nothing less than a strong breeze will carry up the smoke. It is, to the hearths of old-fashioned cavernous fireplaces, what the east belt of trees is to the exposed country estate, or the north wall to the garden. Outside the settle candles gutter, locks of hair wave, young women shiver, and old men sneeze. Inside is Paradise. Not a symptom of a draught disturbs the air; the sitters' backs are as warm as their faces, and songs and old tales are drawn from the occupants by the comfortable heat, like fruit from melon plants in a frame.\n\nIt was, however, not with those who sat in the settle that Eustacia was concerned. A face showed itself with marked distinctness against the dark-tanned wood of the upper part. The owner, who was leaning against the settle's outer end, was Clement Yeobright, or Clym, as he was called here; she knew it could be nobody else. The spectacle constituted an area of two feet in Rembrandt's intensest manner. A strange power in the lounger's appearance lay in the fact that, though his whole figure was visible, the observer's eye was only aware of his face.\n\nTo one of middle age the countenance was that of a young man, though a youth might hardly have seen any necessity for the term of immaturity. But it was really one of those faces which convey less the idea of so many years as its age than of so much experience as its store. The number of their years may have adequately summed up Jared, Mahalaleel, and the rest of the antediluvians, but the age of a modern man is to be measured by the intensity of his history.\n\nThe face was well shaped, even excellently. But the mind within was beginning to use it as a mere waste tablet whereon to trace its idiosyncrasies as they developed themselves. The beauty here visible would in no long time be ruthlessly over-run by its parasite, thought, which might just as well have fed upon a plainer exterior where there was nothing it could harm. Had Heaven preserved Yeobright from a wearing habit of meditation, people would have said, \"A handsome man.\" Had his brain unfolded under sharper contours they would have said, \"A thoughtful man.\" But an inner strenuousness was preying upon an outer symmetry, and they rated his look as singular.\nHence people who began by beholding him ended by perusing him. His countenance was overlaid with legible meanings. Without being thought-worn he yet had certain marks derived from a perception of his surroundings, such as are not unfrequently found on men at the end of the four or five years of endeavour which follow the close of placid pupilage. He already showed that thought is a disease of flesh, and indirectly bore evidence that ideal physical beauty is incompatible with emotional development and a full recognition of the coil of things. Mental luminousness must be fed with the oil of life, even though there is already a physical need for it; and the pitiful sight of two demands on one supply was just showing itself here.\n\nWhen standing before certain men the philosopher regrets that thinkers are but perishable tissue, the artist that perishable tissue has to think. Thus to deplore, each from his point of view, the mutually destructive interdependence of spirit and flesh would have been instinctive with these in critically observing Yeobright.\n\nAs for his look, it was a natural cheerfulness striving against depression from without, and not quite succeeding. The look suggested isolation, but it revealed something more. As is usual with bright natures, the deity that lies ignominiously chained within an ephemeral human carcase shone out of him like a ray.\nThe effect upon Eustacia was palpable. The extraordinary pitch of excitement that she had reached beforehand would, indeed, have caused her to be influenced by the most commonplace man. She was troubled at Yeobright's presence.\n\nThe remainder of the play ended\u2014the Saracen's head was cut off, and Saint George stood as victor. Nobody commented, any more than they would have commented on the fact of mushrooms coming in autumn or snowdrops in spring. They took the piece as phlegmatically as did the actors themselves. It was a phase of cheerfulness which was, as a matter of course, to be passed through every Christmas; and there was no more to be said.\n\nThey sang the plaintive chant which follows the play, during which all the dead men rise to their feet in a silent and awful manner, like the ghosts of Napoleon's soldiers in the Midnight Review. Afterwards the door opened, and Fairway appeared on the threshold, accompanied by Christian and another. They had been waiting outside for the conclusion of the play, as the players had waited for the conclusion of the dance.\n\n\"Come in, come in,\" said Mrs. Yeobright; and Clym went forward to welcome them. \"How is it you are so late? Grandfer Cantle has been here ever so long, and we thought you'd have come with him, as you live so near one another.\"\n\n\"Well, I should have come earlier,\" Mr. Fairway said and paused to look along the beam of the ceiling for a nail to hang his hat on; but, finding his accustomed one to be occupied by the mistletoe, and all the nails in the walls to be burdened with bunches of holly, he at last relieved himself of the hat by ticklishly balancing it between the candle-box and the head of the clock-case. \"I should have come earlier, ma'am,\" he resumed, with a more composed air, \"but I know what parties be, and how there's none too much room in folks' houses at such times, so I thought I wouldn't come till you'd got settled a bit.\"\n\n\"And I thought so too, Mrs. Yeobright,\" said Christian earnestly, \"but Father there was so eager that he had no manners at all, and left home almost afore 'twas dark. I told him 'twas barely decent in a' old man to come so oversoon; but words be wind.\"\n\n\"Klk! I wasn't going to bide waiting about, till half the game was over! I'm as light as a kite when anything's going on!\" crowed Grandfer Cantle from the chimneyseat.\n\nFairway had meanwhile concluded a critical gaze at Yeobright. \"Now, you may not believe it,\" he said to the rest of the room, \"but I should never have knowed this gentleman if I had met him anywhere off his own he'th\u2014he's altered so much.\"\n\n\"You too have altered, and for the better, I think Timothy,\" said Yeobright, surveying the firm figure of Fairway.\n\n\"Master Yeobright, look me over too. I have altered for the better, haven't I, hey?\" said Grandfer Cantle, rising and placing himself something above half a foot from Clym's eye, to induce the most searching criticism.\n\n\"To be sure we will,\" said Fairway, taking the candle and moving it over the surface of the Grandfer's countenance, the subject of his scrutiny irradiating himself with light and pleasant smiles, and giving himself jerks of juvenility.\n\"You haven't changed much,\" said Yeobright.\n\n\"If there's any difference, Grandfer is younger,\" appended Fairway decisively.\n\n\"And yet not my own doing, and I feel no pride in it,\" said the pleased ancient. \"But I can't be cured of my vagaries; them I plead guilty to. Yes, Master Cantle always was that, as we know. But I am nothing by the side of you, Mister Clym.\"\n\n\"Nor any o' us,\" said Humphrey, in a low rich tone of admiration, not intended to reach anybody's ears.\n\n\"Really, there would have been nobody here who could have stood as decent second to him, or even third, if I hadn't been a soldier in the Bang-up Locals (as we was called for our smartness),\" said Grandfer Cantle. \"And even as 'tis we all look a little scammish beside him. But in the year four 'twas said there wasn't a finer figure in the whole South Wessex than I, as I looked when dashing past the shop-winders with the rest of our company on the day we ran out o' Budmouth because it was thoughted that Boney had landed round the point. There was I, straight as a young poplar, wi' my firelock, and my bagnet, and my spatterdashes, and my stock sawing my jaws off, and my accoutrements sheening like the seven stars! Yes, neighbours, I was a pretty sight in my soldiering days. You ought to have seen me in four!\"\n\n\"'Tis his mother's side where Master Clym's figure comes from, bless ye,\" said Timothy. \"I know'd her brothers well. Longer coffins were never made in the whole country of South Wessex, and 'tis said that poor George's knees were crumpled up a little e'en as 'twas.\"\n\n\"Coffins, where?\" inquired Christian, drawing nearer. \"Have the ghost of one appeared to anybody, Master Fairway?\"\n\n\"No, no. Don't let your mind so mislead your ears, Christian; and be a man,\" said Timothy reproachfully.\n\n\"I will.\" said Christian. \"But now I think o't my shadder last night seemed just the shape of a coffin. What is it a sign of when your shade's like a coffin, neighbours? It can't be nothing to be afeared of, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Afeared, no!\" said the Grandfer. \"Faith, I was never afeard of nothing except Boney, or I shouldn't ha' been the soldier I was. Yes, 'tis a thousand pities you didn't see me in four!\"\n\nBy this time the mummers were preparing to leave; but Mrs. Yeobright stopped them by asking them to sit down and have a little supper. To this invitation Father Christmas, in the name of them all, readily agreed.\n\nEustacia was happy in the opportunity of staying a little longer. The cold and frosty night without was doubly frigid to her. But the lingering was not without its difficulties. Mrs. Yeobright, for want of room in the larger apartment, placed a bench for the mummers halfway through the pantry door, which opened from the sitting-room. Here they seated themselves in a row, the door being left open\u2014thus they were still virtually in the same apartment. Mrs. Yeobright now murmured a few words to her son, who crossed the room to the pantry door, striking his head against the mistletoe as he passed, and brought the mummers beef and bread, cake pastry, mead, and elder-wine, the waiting being done by him and his mother, that the little maid-servant might sit as guest. The mummers doffed their helmets, and began to eat and drink.\n\n\"But you will surely have some?\" said Clym to the Turkish Knight, as he stood before that warrior, tray in hand. She had refused, and still sat covered, only the sparkle of her eyes being visible between the ribbons which covered her face.\n\"None, thank you,\" replied Eustacia.\n\n\"He's quite a youngster,\" said the Saracen apologetically, \"and you must excuse him. He's not one of the old set, but have jined us because t'other couldn't come.\"\n\n\"But he will take something?\" persisted Yeobright. \"Try a glass of mead or elder-wine.\"\n\n\"Yes, you had better try that,\" said the Saracen. \"It will keep the cold out going home-along.\"\n\nThough Eustacia could not eat without uncovering her face she could drink easily enough beneath her disguise. The elder-wine was accordingly accepted, and the glass vanished inside the ribbons.\n\nAt moments during this performance Eustacia was half in doubt about the security of her position; yet it had a fearful joy. A series of attentions paid to her, and yet not to her but to some imaginary person, by the first man she had ever been inclined to adore, complicated her emotions indescribably. She had loved him partly because he was exceptional in this scene, partly because she had determined to love him, chiefly because she was in desperate need of loving somebody after wearying of Wildeve. Believing that she must love him in spite of herself, she had been influenced after the fashion of the second Lord Lyttleton and other persons, who have dreamed that they were to die on a certain day, and by stress of a morbid imagination have actually brought about that event. Once let a maiden admit the possibility of her being stricken with love for someone at a certain hour and place, and the thing is as good as done.\n\nDid anything at this moment suggest to Yeobright the sex of the creature whom that fantastic guise inclosed, how extended was her scope both in feeling and in making others feel, and how far her compass transcended that of her companions in the band? When the disguised Queen of Love appeared before Aeneas a preternatural perfume accompanied her presence and betrayed her quality. If such a mysterious emanation ever was projected by the emotions of an earthly woman upon their object, it must have signified Eustacia's presence to Yeobright now. He looked at her wistfully, then seemed to fall into a reverie, as if he were forgetting what he observed. The momentary situation ended, he passed on, and Eustacia sipped her wine without knowing what she drank. The man for whom she had pre-determined to nourish a passion went into the small room, and across it to the further extremity.\n\nThe mummers, as has been stated, were seated on a bench, one end of which extended into the small apartment, or pantry, for want of space in the outer room. Eustacia, partly from shyness, had chosen the midmost seat, which thus commanded a view of the interior of the pantry as well as the room containing the guests. When Clym passed down the pantry her eyes followed him in the gloom which prevailed there. At the remote end was a door which, just as he was about to open it for himself, was opened by somebody within; and light streamed forth.\n\nThe person was Thomasin, with a candle, looking anxious, pale, and interesting. Yeobright appeared glad to see her, and pressed her hand. \"That's right, Tamsie,\" he said heartily, as though recalled to himself by the sight of her, \"you have decided to come down. I am glad of it.\"\n\n\"Hush\u2014no, no,\" she said quickly. \"I only came to speak to you.\"\n\n\"But why not join us?\"\n\n\"I cannot. At least I would rather not. I am not well enough, and we shall have plenty of time together now you are going to be home a good long holiday.\"\n\n\"It isn't nearly so pleasant without you. Are you really ill?\"\n\n\"Just a little, my old cousin\u2014here,\" she said, playfully sweeping her hand across her heart.\n\n\"Ah, Mother should have asked somebody else to be present tonight, perhaps?\"\n\n\"O no, indeed. I merely stepped down, Clym, to ask you\u2014\" Here he followed her through the doorway into the private room beyond, and, the door closing, Eustacia and the mummer who sat next to her, the only other witness of the performance, saw and heard no more.\n\nThe heat flew to Eustacia's head and cheeks. She instantly guessed that Clym, having been home only these two or three days, had not as yet been made acquainted with Thomasin's painful situation with regard to Wildeve; and seeing her living there just as she had been living before he left home, he naturally suspected nothing. Eustacia felt a wild jealousy of Thomasin on the instant. Though Thomasin might possibly have tender sentiments towards another man as yet, how long could they be expected to last when she was shut up here with this interesting and travelled cousin of hers? There was no knowing what affection might not soon break out between the two, so constantly in each other's society, and not a distracting object near. Clym's boyish love for her might have languished, but it might easily be revived again.\n\nEustacia was nettled by her own contrivances. What a sheer waste of herself to be dressed thus while another was shining to advantage! Had she known the full effect of the encounter she would have moved heaven and earth to get here in a natural manner. The power of her face all lost, the charm of her emotions all disguised, the fascinations of her coquetry denied existence, nothing but a voice left to her; she had a sense of the doom of Echo. \"Nobody here respects me,\" she said. She had overlooked the fact that, in coming as a boy among other boys, she would be treated as a boy. The slight, though of her own causing, and self-explanatory, she was unable to dismiss as unwittingly shown, so sensitive had the situation made her.\n\nWomen have done much for themselves in histrionic dress. To look far below those who, like a certain fair personator of Polly Peachum early in the last century, and another of Lydia Languish early in this, (1) have won not only love but ducal coronets into the bargain, whole shoals of them have reached to the initial satisfaction of getting love almost whence they would. But the Turkish Knight was denied even the chance of achieving this by the fluttering ribbons which she dared not brush aside.\n\n(1) Written in 1877.\n\nYeobright returned to the room without his cousin. When within two or three feet of Eustacia he stopped, as if again arrested by a thought. He was gazing at her. She looked another way, disconcerted, and wondered how long this purgatory was to last. After lingering a few seconds he passed on again.\n\nTo court their own discomfiture by love is a common instinct with certain perfervid women. Conflicting sensations of love, fear, and shame reduced Eustacia to a state of the utmost uneasiness. To escape was her great and immediate desire. The other mummers appeared to be in no hurry to leave; and murmuring to the lad who sat next to her that she preferred waiting for them outside the house, she moved to the door as imperceptibly as possible, opened it, and slipped out.\n\nThe calm, lone scene reassured her. She went forward to the palings and leant over them, looking at the moon. She had stood thus but a little time when the door again opened. Expecting to see the remainder of the band Eustacia turned; but no\u2014Clym Yeobright came out as softly as she had done, and closed the door behind him.\n\nHe advanced and stood beside her. \"I have an odd opinion,\" he said, \"and should like to ask you a question. Are you a woman\u2014or am I wrong?\"\n\n\"I am a woman.\"\n\nHis eyes lingered on her with great interest. \"Do girls often play as mummers now? They never used to.\"\n\n\"They don't now.\"\n\n\"Why did you?\"\n\n\"To get excitement and shake off depression,\" she said in low tones.\n\n\"What depressed you?\"\n\n\"Life.\"\n\n\"That's a cause of depression a good many have to put up with.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA long silence. \"And do you find excitement?\" asked Clym at last.\n\n\"At this moment, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Then you are vexed at being discovered?\"\n\n\"Yes; though I thought I might be.\"\n\n\"I would gladly have asked you to our party had I known you wished to come. Have I ever been acquainted with you in my youth?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Won't you come in again, and stay as long as you like?\"\n\n\"No. I wish not to be further recognized.\"\n\n\"Well, you are safe with me.\" After remaining in thought a minute he added gently, \"I will not intrude upon you longer. It is a strange way of meeting, and I will not ask why I find a cultivated woman playing such a part as this.\" She did not volunteer the reason which he seemed to hope for, and he wished her good night, going thence round to the back of the house, where he walked up and down by himself for some time before re-entering.\n\nEustacia, warmed with an inner fire, could not wait for her companions after this. She flung back the ribbons from her face, opened the gate, and at once struck into the heath. She did not hasten along. Her grandfather was in bed at this hour, for she so frequently walked upon the hills on moonlight nights that he took no notice of her comings and goings, and, enjoying himself in his own way, left her to do likewise. A more important subject than that of getting indoors now engrossed her. Yeobright, if he had the least curiosity, would infallibly discover her name. What then? She first felt a sort of exultation at the way in which the adventure had terminated, even though at moments between her exultations she was abashed and blushful. Then this consideration recurred to chill her: What was the use of her exploit? She was at present a total stranger to the Yeobright family. The unreasonable nimbus of romance with which she had encircled that man might be her misery. How could she allow herself to become so infatuated with a stranger? And to fill the cup of her sorrow there would be Thomasin, living day after day in inflammable proximity to him; for she had just learnt that, contrary to her first belief, he was going to stay at home some considerable time.\n\nShe reached the wicket at Mistover Knap, but before opening it she turned and faced the heath once more. The form of Rainbarrow stood above the hills, and the moon stood above Rainbarrow. The air was charged with silence and frost. The scene reminded Eustacia of a circumstance which till that moment she had totally forgotten. She had promised to meet Wildeve by the Barrow this very night at eight, to give a final answer to his pleading for an elopement.\n\nShe herself had fixed the evening and the hour. He had probably come to the spot, waited there in the cold, and been greatly disappointed.\n\"Well, so much the better\u2014it did not hurt him,\" she said serenely. Wildeve had at present the rayless outline of the sun through smoked glass, and she could say such things as that with the greatest facility.\n\nShe remained deeply pondering; and Thomasin's winning manner towards her cousin arose again upon Eustacia's mind.\n\n\"O that she had been married to Damon before this!\" she said. \"And she would if it hadn't been for me! If I had only known\u2014if I had only known!\"\n\nEustacia once more lifted her deep stormy eyes to the moonlight, and, sighing that tragic sigh of hers which was so much like a shudder, entered the shadow of the roof. She threw off her trappings in the outhouse, rolled them up, and went indoors to her chamber.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/1490379", "artist_names": "The Outhere Brothers", "full_title": "Boom Boom Boom by\u00a0The\u00a0Outhere Brothers", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/40ec072febf53e84c4662c8fbafc5f94.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/40ec072febf53e84c4662c8fbafc5f94.761x761x1.jpg", "id": 1490379, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 10635720, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1587700268, "path": "/The-outhere-brothers-boom-boom-boom-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-outhere-brothers-boom-boom-boom-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1995, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1995", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1995", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/40ec072febf53e84c4662c8fbafc5f94.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/40ec072febf53e84c4662c8fbafc5f94.761x761x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 2, "hot": false, "pageviews": 102942}, "title": "Boom Boom Boom", "title_with_featured": "Boom Boom Boom", "updated_by_human_at": 1667676584, "url": "https://genius.com/The-outhere-brothers-boom-boom-boom-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/377280", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/63945ff5b50c9f70a3c58164fd00798a.695x330x1.jpg", "id": 377280, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6ed22e456f819fe2569b8ce770cc837b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "o", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Outhere Brothers", "slug": "The-outhere-brothers", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-outhere-brothers"}, "artist": "The Outhere Brothers", "lyrics": "Boom Boom Boom LyricsI say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo\nI say boom boom boom now everybody say wayo\nI say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo\nI say boom boom boom now everybody say wayo\nI say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo\nI say boom boom boom now everbody say wayo\n\nNow hear dis\nThis is da outhere brothers\nBk in da room\nReady to rock the world wiv a boom\nSo I hope u can stand the vibration\nCoz we're bout to rock the entire nation\nAlrite?\nHear we go\nI say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo\nI say boom boom boom now everybody say wayo\nI say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo\nI say boom boom boom now everybody say wayo\nI say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo\nI say boom boom boom now everbody say wayo\nI say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo\nI say boom boom boom now everybody say wayo\n\nGirl ur booty is so round\nLet me look u up and down\nCan I take u one more time\nI won't stop until ur mine\nBut if I cannot b wiv u\nMayb I cud hav a taste\nPut ur arms around me girl\nAnd ur kisses on my face\n\nI say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo\nI say boom boom boom now everybody say wayo\nI say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo\nI say boom boom boom now everybody say wayo\n\nGirl ur booty is so round\nLet me look u up and down\nCan I take u one more time\nI won't stop until ur mine\nBut if I cannot b wiv u\nMaybe I cud hav a taste\nPut ur arms around me girl\nAnd ur kisses on my face\nYou might also likeGeronimo\nLook out below\nHere comes the Brother with the offbeat flow\n\nI just fell from the mothership\nOuthere Brothers 'bout to rip it on another tip, slip\nDon't trip, check out how i do it\nMalik is in the house I turn your body into fluid\nAs i come from the depths of Doom\nI snap back at you ow!

could've had in you, honey\n\nNow that you're gone\n(Oooooooh ooooh ooooh)\nI want you more\nI said\nIt slapped me in my face\nAnd then my friends don't understand\nBecause I had the chance\nI don't know why\n\n[Chorus:]\nI'm going crazy alone in a daze\nAnd my heart ain't the same\nAnd I don't even think unless\nI think about you\n\nThat's the only time\nI get sentimental\nThat's the reason why baby\nI can't let go of you\nYeah, that's the only time\nI get sentimental\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI miss you day and night\nSeems like you're still here\nI'd rather be together, honey\n\nNow that I'm lost for words\nI can't believe I'm on my own\nI should've been looking at love\nYou might also likeNow that you're gone\nI want you\n(Oooh ooh oooh)\n\nI said it slapped me on my face\nAnd now my friends

yachts\nGuzzlin' straight shots of scotch\nFormulatin' up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot\n'Cause it's scorchin' hot\nMakin' it hard tryin' to figure who's out to trap me \u2014 Pataki\nGot all kinds of undercovers that's comin' at me\nPerhaps he, won't be happy 'til they snatch me\nAnd place me where half us blacks be, sittin' in Coxsackie\nBut never me, see, my destiny's to be forever free\nIn ecstasy, on a hill that awaits for me\nSo plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush\nVivid enough to make livin' this a must, plus, it's real...\n[Chorus: Miss Jones]\nI wanna chill

grands up in rubber bands\nI'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands\nSuburban places got me seekin' for oasis\nCristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces\nSex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas\nThough this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old-timers\nI want a villa in a Costa Rica\nSo I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life's supposed to treat ya\nLaid in the shades of the Everglades, finally forever paid\nWearin' the finest fabrics tailors ever made\nMe and my team, Caribbean cuisines\nI guess bein' down for so long, I'm all in-store to see my dreams\nYou might also like[Chorus: Miss Jones]\nI wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill\n(It\u2019s so lovely, so lovely)\nAZ\u2019s for real\n(Oh, he's for real)\nHe's for real\n(It's so lovely, sippin' on bubbly)\n\n[Verse 3: AZ]\nSo until I see past the green pasture\nMe bein' supreme master, ain't much more of life I fiend after\nBut another chapter, a new way of life to adapt to\n'Cause these streets'll gas ya, and have ya caught up in the rapture\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, I could vision my killer crew more hospitable\nConsciously aware, plus political (Political)\n'Cause though they claim every man's created equal\nUs as native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through\nBut once established, we eatin' lovely, livin' lavish\nLike the House of Versailles in Paris, I gotta have

is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

have seen the end of summer in your eyes\nI should have listened when you said good night\nYou really meant good bye\nBaby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?\nYou're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall\nBut only fools are \"know-it-alls\" and I played that fool for you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby\nI tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby\n[Chorus]\nIf the love that I've got for you is gone\nAnd if the river I\u2019ve cried ain\u2019t that long\nThen I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong\nThis ain't a love song\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time\nLike we got away with the perfect crime\nBut we were just a legend in my mind\nI guess that I was blind\nRemember those nights dancing at the masquerade\nThe clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade\nBut you and I were the renegades, some things never change\nIt made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby\nAnd now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving\n\n[Chorus]\nIf the love that I've got for you is gone\nAnd if the river I\u2019ve cried ain\u2019t that long\nThen I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong\nThis ain't a love song\nIf the pain that I'm feeling so strong\nIs the reason I'm holding on\nThen I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong\nThis ain't a love song\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI

bionical lyric\nLyrically splittin', dismissin'\nI'm on a mission of just hittin'\nNow it's written in kitten, hittin' with mittens\nI'm missin', wishin', man, listen\nI glisten like sun and water while fishin'\nBust the move and then swerve\nServe words with nerve, embedded, I said it, word\nDamn, you nerd, man, you heard\nComin' from the town of Illy\nAnd alleys are full of Phillies and Rallys\nSuckers get silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy, really!\nSo here we go, now holla if ya hear me though\nCome and feel me... flow\nNever mixin' with trickin' brothers\nBitchin' over vixens that ain't fittin' to be hittin'\nFor nothin', splittin' things that's bitten and gettin' written off\nYou're like a fatter half bladder, boy, you pissin' me off!\nBefore you even started, so what? So long, see you, fly by, my try\nHow else could I say it when you play it?\nTry boom-bye-bye, bye-bye!\n[Chorus]\nHere we go\nNow holla if ya hear me though\nCome and feel me flow\nHere we go\nNow holla if ya hear me though\nCome and feel me flow\n\n[Verse 2: Treach]\nThe flow pro poetical with skills only a vet'll know\nBetter know where's the wetter flow that's on point like decimals\nManhandlin' new crews\nPartyin' with the Zoo Crew\nLookin' for the pink in boo boo's, I thought you knew too\nStone style's of stamina\nJammin' to while we plannin' to jam\nWe bust, plus we're the party amateur damagers\nManagin', damagin' mics, men and even mannequins\nYou're a fan again\nNow I wanna know, who's the man again?\nNaughty's back like vertebraes\nWord to hey-a-ho, the way I show, you pray I flow\nSteady breakin' to the boogie so bang time to slang\nBang and watch all the poo-tang tangs hang\n\n[Chorus: Treach]\nHere we go\nNow holla if ya hear me though\nCome and feel me flow\nHere we go\nNow holla if ya hear me though\nCome and feel me flow\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Treach]\nPlay and Kay'll break the body of a beat\nThen beat the break into boogie\nFirm and fully, chase bass-lines like bullies\nAll we wanna know is if your body wanna party?\nIt's 'nuff poo-tang tang for everybody!\nSo hip up and split up, get up, get up your with up\nSouped up, put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups\nFlip up, watch us rip up\nShake shows until they fizz up\nRizz up like you're with us\nIf not, zip up your lip up\nWhip up hits with ransoms, foul styles get and ones\nWe came back 'cause we heard hip-hop needed another anthem\nBlack like Noah, in fact and fo' ya\nIf we was back in the days with the Drifters\nWe would've been known as the Flow-ers\nRepin' these since the '70s, find me\nSo we went crazy in the '80s\nSo we won't kiss heinies in the '90s\nOops, the Naughty's, troops in sections with forties\nSo clap your hands and hold your shorty, I'm Naughty\n\n[Chorus]\nHere we go\nNow holla if ya hear me though\nCome and feel me flow\nHere we go\nNow holla if ya hear me though\nCome and feel me flow\nHere we go\nNow holla if ya hear me
