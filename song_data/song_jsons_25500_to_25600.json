yeah)\n\n[Verse 1]\nFever dream high in the quiet of the night\nYou know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)\nBad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price\nYou know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nKilling me slow, out the window\nI'm always waiting for you to be waiting below\nDevils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes\nWhat doesn't kill me makes me want you more\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's new, the shape of your body\nIt's blue, the feeling I've got\nAnd it's ooh, whoa oh\nIt's a cruel summer\nIt's cool, that's what I tell 'em\nNo rules in breakable heaven\nBut ooh, whoa oh\nIt's a cruel summer\nWith you\n\n[Verse 2]\nHang your head low in the glow of the vending machine\nI'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)\nWe say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times\nWe're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nSo cut the headlights, summer's a knife\nI'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone\nDevils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes\nAnd if I bleed, you'll be the last to know\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, it's new, the shape of your body\nIt's blue, the feeling I've got\nAnd it's ooh, whoa oh\nIt's a cruel summer\nIt's cool, that's what I tell 'em\nNo rules in breakable heaven\nBut ooh, whoa oh\nIt's a cruel summer\nWith you\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $299You might also like[Bridge]\nI'm drunk in the back of the car\nAnd I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)\nSaid, \"I'm fine,\" but it wasn't true\nI don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you\nAnd I snuck in through the garden gate\nEvery night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)\nAnd I scream, \"For whatever it's worth\nI love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?\"\nHe looks up, grinning like a devil\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's new, the shape of your body\nIt's blue, the feeling I've got\nAnd it's ooh, whoa oh\nIt's a cruel summer\nIt's cool, that's what I tell 'em\nNo rules in breakable

it's alright\nI've been dealin\u2019 with some things like every human being\nAnd really didn't sleep much last night (Last night)\n\"I'm sorry,\" that's fine\nI just think I need a little me time\nI just think I need a little free time\nLittle break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah (Bus rides)\nLast year I had a breakdown\nThoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud\nHad to see a therapist, then I found out\nSomethin' funny\u2019s goin\u2019 on up in my house\nYeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out\nYou know, pack my cart, take a new route\nClean up my yard, get the noose out\nHang up my heart, let it air out (Air out)\nI\u2019ve been searchin'\n\"What does that mean, Nate?\" I've been learning\nGrabbin' my keepsakes, leavin\u2019 my burdens\nWell, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect\nLookin' at the view, like this concerns me\nPickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous\nHate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry\nAnd things might hurt me\nIt's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (But hey)\nIt's worth it, though\nCold world out there, kids, grab your coats\nIt's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam\nLookin' for the antidote to crack the code\nPretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode\nDon't need pity given to me, but I can't condone\nTalkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes\nI'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)\nBeen makin' a whole lot of changes\nWrote a song about that, you should play it\nI get scared when I walk on these stages\nI look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah\nThat's when I start to get anxious\nThat's when my thoughts can be dangerous\nThat's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred\nForget what I'm sayin', and\u2014\nWhere'd the beat go?\nOh, ain't that somethin'?\nDrums came in, you ain't see that comin'\nHands on my head, can't tell me nothin'\nGot a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach\nThrow it back up like I don't want it\nWipe my face, clean off my vomit\nOCD, tryna push my buttons\nI said don't touch it, now y'all done it\nI can be critical, never typical\nIntricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal\nIntimate, but never political, pretty visual\nEven if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though\nYou call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable\nLeave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool\nWay that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful\nMan, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos, videos)\nYeah, the sales can rise\nDoesn't mean much though when your health declines\nSee, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside\nThat we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies\nTry to hold it underwater but it always survives\nThen it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise\nThen it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies\nYou don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am\nThe point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place\nAnd what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way\nIt's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe\nJust hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?\nJust think about it for a second, if you look at your face\nEvery day when you get up and think you'll never be great\nYou'll never be great\u2014not because you're not, but the hate\nWill always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith, woo\nI've been developin', take a look at the benefits\nNothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate\nAm I even relevant? That depends how you measure it\nTake a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence\nPretty evident; dependable can never be tentative\nI'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine\nPretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip\nProper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (Ah)\nIt's that time again\nBetter grab your balloons and invite your friends\nSeatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in\nLook at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big\nOn a road right now that I can't predict\nTell me \"Tone that down,\" but I can't resist\nY'all know that sound, better raise your fist\nThe search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huhYou might also like289Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/4677888", "artist_names": "Spotify", "full_title": "New Music Friday 07/05/19 by\u00a0Spotify", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 4677888, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 5637607, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1575144461, "path": "/Spotify-new-music-friday-07-05-19-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Spotify-new-music-friday-07-05-19-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2019, "month": 7, "day": 5}, "release_date_for_display": "July 5, 2019", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 5, 2019", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aaf01cc319a32dda02b3e1c4b70224e6.1000x1000x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "New Music Friday 07/05/19", "title_with_featured": "New Music Friday 07/05/19", "updated_by_human_at": 1575144461, "url": "https://genius.com/Spotify-new-music-friday-07-05-19-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/69342", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/da32597113461492089ce24af5568ab7.1000x419x1.png", "id": 69342, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4d7925a03026cc6d993484d2712b75e9.709x709x1.png", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Spotify", "slug": "Spotify", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Spotify"}, "artist": "Spotify", "lyrics": "New Music Friday 07/05/19 LyricsPost Malone - Goodbyes (Feat.

other the texts that they could never send me\nI'm bankin' two million a show for the residency\nNevada gaming commission in a frenzy\nHow much money can this casino lend me?\nRippin' markers up over shots of the Henny\nVivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?\nTo me, Benihana is pigeon food\nThis not a forgivin' mood\nSo much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room\nI am just a body that my brothers are livin' through\nKeepin' my connections strictly physical\nEveryone that's married is miserable\nI know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into\nThe rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical\nI don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital\nIt's the American Expresser, the debt collector\nHailin' all the way from the Mecca\nGot something for Trudy and Rebecca\nThis shit could last forever\nThe mind controller, the Ayatollah\nI built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over\nStep in the room and October gets a lot closer\nHaunted houses\nI don't know how to count in thousands, only millions\nNow tell your friends I'm not the villain\nSend 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos\nBarbados, Trinidad and Tobago\nNever go the same places they go\nSeparate vacations\nA far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement\nI was never on the path to get into Cambridge\nI mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language\nBorderline dangerous, approach with caution\nI plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction\nMan, truth be told, I think about it often\nThe petty king, the overseer of many things\nI wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings\nI wouldn't have space on either hand for anything\nWest Hollywood, know my presence is menacing\nCosa Nostra, shady dealings\nRacketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things\nThe things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling\nBut no regrets, though, the name'll echo\nYears later, none greater\nDeath to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeahSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like31Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

thought\nYou listen to the talk\nBut ain\u2019t nobody ever hear me squawk\nAll of y'all are quick to hate  but y'all gon\u2019 love me when I finally meet the chalk\nWatch what I make\nEvery thing I create\nEverything that I touch\nI don't need to sling no mud\nI don't need a crutch\nIma let the success speak\nWhat the fucks a grudge\nEverything you've ever said about me is about to come undone\nActing like i haven't changed\nFour passed and you're stuck in the past and you saying that its me to blame\nDamn, i moved 500 miles away\nTook my life back from the sauce\nReap what you sow and i came to close to being another corpse\nSwapped the lines on a dvd case\nTo bind these lines in a cd case\nTraded taps on these bar for these bars on tap\nBut my drip still finna needa a tray\nAy\nCos I'm either spitting or about to spray\nI won't dance around the matter i don't do ballet\nIf you know me then you know i will say it to your face\nImpulsive motherfucker i can't hold it in\nIm about to \u2018xplode again\nWoo\nI don't give a fuck about you\nHeres front row, enjoy what i do\n(Damn what a view)\nGod damn what a view\nSo glad so proud - i ain\u2019t one of you\nIma pray straight to the clouds in the pew\nThe only way to let the demons out it to set the demons loose\nIf we all sitting ducks tell me who the fucks picking goose\nI will\nMy days are grey\nAnd i take it out on bae\nCos I'm para that she won't stay\nEither way I'm pushing her away\nWhen I wanna hold her close\nIm so sorry but even in the best of times we don't have the dough so I don't see the need to toast\nFar from a chicken but ima give you roast\nCooking up the heat tho I don't like to boast\nIf a woman\u2019s place in the kitchen ima make my self at home\nKick my feet up while I'm rolling up a cone\nHit it sit back and I'm riding this\nFeel this beat n its facts that I body this\nDrop to my feet and ill know where nobody is\nI drop a tweet everybody got burning ears\nAs they say if the boots fits thats the furnishing\nRight this shit down you would benefit from learning this\nChose not to fuck you over like I didn't know what virgin is\nYet you painted me to be the villain come and tell me to my face what your version is\nIm telling you you raped\nEvery avenue I paved\nEverything that i gave\nIt was all take take take\nAnd I know a yungen that would say the same\nWe the fam that you claimed\n\u2018Cept when crunch time came\nEgo set so big can't except no blame\nWhat a joke ima have to pop another bubble you a no name\nDon't take it hard man I'm the same\nWhen its all said and done i just pray\nThat the life's for everyone around me will change\nHave em feeling like this part weren\u2019t a chapter it was just a page\nAy\nI write what I\u2019m living\nIf you don\u2019t like it turn the shit off don\u2019t cross my path\nRight now  this is what i\u2019m living\nSnakes in the grass\nI don\u2019t need a lawnmower to get to killin\u2019\nI don\u2019t know whether to make heads or tails i don\u2019t know what i\u2019m feeling\nBut i\u2019m bouta paint the ceiling with the blood of every single villain\nWhile i reel in just desserts that\u2019s a million\nI

ten\nPoppin' them bottles of lean with Instagram models, stayin' at the Drury Inn\nI know she don't drink, she said that she drink, I let her just sip what she can\nI say, \"Lil' Ben, you hear them talkin'?\" He say \"Uh-uh\"\nI hit the gas and then we turn up on they ass\nRan up my money, and they hear it when I talk now\nThem bitches know it's over with, they in my past\n'Cause you left ice on my heart\nAnd I could say that ho wasn't wrong, you wasn't right from the start\nI wish you could exchange my time for that watch that I bought\nReally was tryna make you mine, I don't know what I had

calm before the storm\nI don\u2019t want less, I don't want more\nMust bar the windows and the doors\nTo keep me safe, to keep me warm\nYeah, my life is what I'm fighting for\nCan\u2019t part the sea, can't reach the shore\nAnd my voice becomes the driving force\nI won't let this pull me overboard\n\n[Chorus]\nGod, keep my head above water\nDon't let me drown, it gets harder\nI'll meet you there at the altar\nAs I fall down to my knees\nDon't let me drown, drown, drown\nDon't let me, don't let me, don\u2019t let me drown\n[Verse 2]\nSo pull me up from down below\n\u2019Cause I'm underneath the undertow\nCome dry me off and hold me close\nI need you now, I need you most\n\n[Chorus]\nGod, keep my head above water\nDon\u2019t let me drown, it gets harder\nI'll meet you there at the altar\nAs I fall down to my knees\nDon't let me drown, drown, drown\nDon't let me, don\u2019t let me, don't let me drown\nDon't let me drown, drown, drown\nAnd keep my head above water, above water\nDon't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I can't see in the stormy weather\nI can't seem to keep it all together\nAnd I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever\nAnd I can't breathe\n\n[Chorus]\nGod, keep my head above water\nI lose my breath at the bottom\nCome rescue me, I'll be waitin'\nI'm too young to fall asleep\nSo, God, keep my head above water\nDon't let me drown, it gets harder\nI'll meet you there at the altar\nAs I fall down to my knees\nDon't let me drown\nDon't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)\nDon't let me drown\nAnd keep my head above water, above water\n(Don't let me, don't let me drown)See Avril Lavigne LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like40Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

when I was bummin'\"\nStayed away from all the bullshit, them niggas said I'm runnin'\nTime passed over now you see that I was chasin' money\nPosted on Maryland, me and Von, his mama tearin' just once\nKnow you seen up in the parish, like check it out that's my lil' youngin'\nNigga don't wanna sell me a brick of dope, act like my money funny\nDamn what you sayin' gangsta, you gon' make me take it from you\nSome hoes say I'm handsome, some of them, they say I'm ugly\nSome say that I'm the realest but I still ain't sayin' nothin'\n'Cause\n\n[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]\nI'm all who

\"Fuck a friend\"\nCommitted crimes so many times but I don't give a damn\nI are who you say I am\nPosted on high street, me and roof 'cause we been really thuggin'\nConvicted felon with a dirty pistol, bitch I'm steady clutchin'\nNo drama sittin' in my cell like check out my lil' cousin\nCan't trust these hoes because I know they come a dime a dozen\nRIP to Quahfee, know my nigga at them

drop\nI was gambling with shawty, I put some work on the block\nI tested her, she held a lil' quarter bird at her spot\nI ain't into bustin' down a Rollie, bustin' down on bales\nDon't wanna fuck me, I won't argue baby, oh well\nThe 18 Willard, the lever get 'em movin' mils\nMillionaire dollar bond in 30 minutes and I made bail\nI graduated, the square's outta town, at the room cookin' at the hotel (yeah, yeah)\nAux is outta reach, I'ma move the race car (Vroom)\nHated on us and they know who they are\nStill livin' large as I aim for the stars\nI'm a BreadWinner don and I came from the slums\nI got a stain on my arm, weather through the storm\nIf I tell you that I love you then you can't do nothin' wrong\nSurrounded by steppers, I got control in this bitch\nI'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch\nTell that curb boy Trell I love you with all my heart\nNow we ride around in Wraiths with a push button start (vroom)\n[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]\nCause I'm

to satisfy a real one\nMaverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done\nNiggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us\nLouisville hush money for my young gunners\nRick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos\nStack of C-notes, get all you niggas scratched like Preemo\nWorms, I just opened up a can of those\nMy mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose\nTwo girls that I rope like Indiana Jones\nI make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose\nYeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante\nCalifornia girls sweeter than pieces of candy\nHad me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy\nType of hood where bandanas make niggas a family\nHead on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble\nLife too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle\nMy uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals\nBut it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues\nI wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell\nEvery title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele\nSandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell\nI'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves\n[Chorus: Sample]\nYeah, no more, no more\nBaby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah\nYeah, no more, no more\nBaby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby\nOoh, ooh\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nNiggas want a classic, that's just ten of these\nCrime family like the Genovese, you don't want drama, capisc'?\nMy house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid\nI take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief\nI find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase\nI'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach\nI even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets\nSubtle reminders are key, jeez!\nSpoiler alert: the second act is tragic\nAnd everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened\nBackstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards\nLike Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches\nBury me and I'll be born again\nI walk in godly form amongst the mortal men\nI got some real demons across the border fence\nAnd made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again\nLike I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird\nNiggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work\nHit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd\nWhen I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words\nChurch of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue\nI don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off\nSandra's rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off\nI guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low

can't replace you (They can't replace you)\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, oh, oh, ohh\nOh, oh, oh, ohh\nOh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh\nOh, oh, oh, ohh\nOh, oh, oh, ohh\nOh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh\n[Verse 1]\nI was puttin' on for

that I could have control\nEverybody dies alone\n(And I ain't dead yet)\n\n[Refrain]\nSay my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago (A long time ago)\nDream nightmares\nI guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope (Guess we're losing hope)\nI don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name\nAre you on the other side? Will you save us?\nOr will you run away?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take\nTake me right to you (Take me right to you)\nOne hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back\nWhat am I to do?

a chance to grow some\nEverybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days\nNiggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm\nI respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days\nMan, they barely old enough to drive\nTo tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?\nI heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised\nI ain't trippin', listen good to my reply\nCome here lil' man, let me talk with ya\nSee if I can paint for you the large picture\nCongrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house\nI hope you make enough to buy your mom a house\nI see your watch icy and your whip foreign\nI got some good advice, never quit tourin'\n'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game\nI'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name\nI hear your music and I know that rap's changed\nA bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing\n'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now\nTrap drums is the shit that's hot now\nSee, I've been on a quest for the next wave\nBut never mind, that was just a segue\nI must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey\nBut I love to see a Black man get paid\nAnd plus, you havin' fun and I respect that\nBut have you ever thought about your impact?\nThese white kids love that you don't give a fuck\n'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black\nThey wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill\nThey wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels\nAnd somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real\nThey wanna be black and think your song is how it feels\nSo when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too\nYou hit the next city, collect your money when it's due\nYou gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you\nYou ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you\nTrue, you got better shit to do\nYou coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew\nI know you think this type of revenue is never endin'\nBut I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true\nOne day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up\nAnd get too old for that shit that made you blow up\nNow your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up\nWhich unfortunately means the money slow up\nNow you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again\nBut you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends\nNow you old news and you goin' through regrets\n'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz\nAnd a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes\nAnd a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you\nI'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'\n'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout\nIt's a faster route to the bottom\nI wish you good luck\nI'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look\nBut if it's really true what people sayin'\nAnd you call yourself playin' with my name\nThen I really know you fucked, trust\nI'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top\nTo any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked\nJust remember what I told you when your

mistakes every time\nBridges burn, I never learn\nAt least I did one thing right\nI did one thing right\nI'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers\nTrust him like a brother\nYeah, you know

promises\nLifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous\nI made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit\nTyped it in like, \"How to make a milli'\" I used to google it\nSavannah just wanted to see me perform\nAnd got hit over stupid shit\nI woke up and saw the shit right on my phone\nThey don't know who the shooter is\nYou never know, never feel untouchable\nI touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable\nIf I let you go, I would feel so skeptical\nUnacceptable but I still gotta let you know\nYeah, that I can't make no fucking promises\nI can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises\nYeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh\nUsed to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek\nYeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's\nI had to be on that corner until it was morning\nSo me and my niggas could eat\nI be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet\nI got my foot in the door\nThey never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki\nEven when I was a boy\nI was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat\nI was a beast, sheesh\nHe had her heart, but she tried to give it to me\nDamn, but she can't keep no fucking promises\nShit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit\nTold Mo, \"Bring the studio to everywhere we go\" and that's a lotta hits\nSlo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit\nSomething 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations\nWhole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless\nCan't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit\nHave you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit\nI went from rags to riches\nI bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face\nI hit the baddest bitches\nIt's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day\nI treated them bad\nI wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way\nSo treat me the same way, same way, same way\nI was a savage to you\nI had to give up and put all my hoes to the side\nI swear if I ever left you in the cold\nIt's 'cause it was colder inside\nLook here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone\nI hope you don't turn to a thot\nMost of the niggas that call me only hit my phone\nBecause I get money a lot\nI be the one with the throne\nYou say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie\nEven before we was on\nThe money was long and we used to fuck up the spot\nBitches was singing my song\nI knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch\nNiggas was hating before and they hate on me now\nBut don't know what to say to me now\nI was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her\nKeep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?\nEven if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her\nEven if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you\n[Chorus]\nYeah, at least I was good to you\nAt least I was good to you\nYeah, at least I was good to you\nAt least I was good to youSee A Boogie wit da Hoodie LiveGet tickets as low as $27You might also like19Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 34, "api_path": "/songs/3226861", "artist_names": "A Boogie wit da Hoodie", "full_title": "Say A' by\u00a0A\u00a0Boogie wit da Hoodie", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/27d2db348fc46c54ed078ef766348749.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/27d2db348fc46c54ed078ef766348749.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 3226861, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 366619, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1663427648, "path": "/A-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-say-a-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 14, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/A-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-say-a-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 22}, "release_date_for_display": "September 22, 2017", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 22, 2017", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/27d2db348fc46c54ed078ef766348749.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/27d2db348fc46c54ed078ef766348749.1000x1000x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 301634}, "title": "Say A\u2019", "title_with_featured": "Say A'", "updated_by_human_at": 1658218195, "url": "https://genius.com/A-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-say-a-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/639521", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/772026532119d77f298eb8775284e8b0.1000x563x1.jpg", "id": 639521, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2aa7cf976cc9aeb65eb9e7b0f3fbe402.601x601x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "A Boogie wit da Hoodie", "slug": "A-boogie-wit-da-hoodie", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/A-boogie-wit-da-hoodie", "iq": 9442}, "artist": "A Boogie wit da Hoodie", "lyrics": "Say A\u2019 Lyrics[Intro]\nNess on the beat\n...the fuck I'm supposed to say?\nWhat the fuck I'm supposed to say?

line\nDropped out of school to chase my dream, I had some for to prove\nI put my all in this shit, man I can't fuckin' lose\nThey smile up in my face but they don't know what I been through\nWhole lot of nights I went to sleep and I ain't had no food\nBut now I'm up and I'm just thinking about my next move\nGot to keep my head above water, gotta make it through\nI do this shit for my mama, and my lil' brother too\nAin't no more problems now I might as well go back to school\nGot to maintain, stay on my grind, no, I can't be no fool\nNah, I can't slip, nor I can't fumble, got to stick and move\nGet out BR, move to LA, where I ain't got to keep a tool\nSurprise, but, I knew my dreams comin' true\n[Chorus]\nWe had nothin', stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas\nRight or wrong,

back of the Maybach with a lot of bands\nI ain't worry 'bout 'em dissin' now, I don't hear a thing they sayin'\nThis for my sons and Montana, and can't forget Lil Ben\nI never jeopardize this and lose it all again\nThis for that North 38 Baby, they know I ain't playin'\nFrom the heart, I appreciate all of my fans\nThis for Monique for loving me and bein' my helpin' hand\nI really did it, this for moms, 3Three, Trey and Aaron\nCan't nobody tell me nothin', I'm like, \"What you sayin'?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nWe had nothin', stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas\nRight or wrong forever right, you
