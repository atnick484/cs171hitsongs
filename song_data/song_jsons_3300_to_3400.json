up\n'Cause I don't wanna fall in love\nIf I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack\n\n[Verse 1]\nNever put my love out on the line\nNever said \"yes\" to the right guy\nNever had trouble getting what I want\nBut when it comes to you, I'm never good enough\nWhen I don't care\nI can play 'em like a Ken doll\nWon't wash my hair\nThen make 'em bounce like a basketball\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut you make me wanna act like a girl\nPaint my nails and wear high heels\nYes, you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand\n\n[Chorus]\nYou make me glow\nBut I cover up, won't let it show\nSo I'm putting my defenses up\n'Cause I don't wanna fall in love\nIf I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack\n\n[Verse 2]\nNever break a sweat for the other guys\nWhen you come around, I get paralyzed\nAnd every time I try to be myself\nIt comes out wrong like a cry for help\nIt's just not fair\nPain's more trouble than love is worth\nI gasp for air\nIt feels so good, but you know it hurts\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut you make me wanna act like a girl\nPaint my nails and wear perfume for you\nMake me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou make me glow\nBut I cover up, won't let it show\nSo I'm putting my defenses up\n'Cause I don't wanna fall in love\nIf I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack\n\n[Bridge]\nThe feelings are lost in my lungs\nThey're burning, I'd rather be numb (I'd rather be numb)\nAnd there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)\nSo scared, I take off and I run\nI'm flying too close to the sun\nAnd I burst into flames\n\n[Chorus]\nYou make me glow\nBut I cover up, won't let it show\nSo I'm putting my defenses up\n'Cause I don't wanna fall in love\nIf I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack\nI think I'd have a heart attack (Heart attack)\nI think I'd

Das Album ist eines der besten Storytelling-Rap-Alben 2013 und bei der hammerm\u00e4\u00dfigen Produktion kann auch ein Jay Z oder Kanye West neidisch werden. Hier ein kurzes und knappes Review zu einigen Songs:\nEs geht los mit der Promo-Single \"All I Want\" mit einem stark verzerrten und intonierten Intro (\"I want bitches, I want cars, I don't give a fuck, I want it all! That's why the fuck we here for!\"), welches schon das Thema des ansonsten soliden Songs verr\u00e4t. Daraufhin folgen \"One Day\" und \"Paper Route\", die den Anfang perfekt vollenden. \"Paper Route\" ist eher gesellschaftskritisch, \"One Day\" wird aus der Perspektive des alten B.o.B gerappt, der von dem tr\u00e4umt, was er jetzt ist/hat, \u00fcber einen Beat, der sehr an \"Old School Love\" von Lupe Fiasco erinnert, von DJ Frank E. \"Ready\" hab ich schon bei dem \"Ohrw\u00fcrmer\"-Thread gepostet und den Song beschrieben, mehr spar ich mir.\nWer auf Stripclub-Songs steht, ist mit dem f\u00fcnften Song \"Throwback\" featuring Chris Brown sehr gut bedient. Die beiden rappen \u00fcber einen gro\u00dfartigen Beat mit einem geloopten 4-Takte-Vocalsample, welches den Song erst gro\u00dfartig macht. Ist lyrisch auf keinen Fall oberklasse, aber frech genug ist diese Single allemal, und nur Bad-Boys k\u00f6nnen sowas auch in vollen Z\u00fcgen genie\u00dfen ;-)\n\nAb Track 10 geht der eher energische Teil von \"Underground Luxury\" los: Die Leadsingle \"HeadBand\" ist ein Kandidat f\u00fcr die beste Produktion von DJ Mustard, der hier Pfeifkl\u00e4nge und Kickdrums, die so stark sind, dass sie fast den ganzen Song komprimieren, zu einem einpr\u00e4gsamen Beat auf 98 BPM zusammenbastelt. B.o.B rappt mit einer fast schon ignoranten Stimme, w\u00e4hrend 2 Chainz zwar aggressiver, aber nicht weniger arrogant rappt. Genie\u00dft die Bad-Boy-Atmosph\u00e4re inklusive sehr hotten Lyrics. HeadBand ist eine rotzfreche Twerking- und Stripclubhymne und jederzeit sommerhittauglich!\n\n\"John Doe\" geht wieder in Richtung Gesellschaftskritik und behandelt Drogen- und besonders Alkoholabh\u00e4ngigkeit und hat eine sehr traurige Atmosph\u00e4re, die sich in der Klaviermelodie und den verwendeten Effekten wiederspiegelt. Die Hook kommt von Priscilla Renea, die ihr ganzes Talent im Tonumfang unterbringt. B.o.Bs Raptechnik ist deutlich besser als bei einigen vorherigen Songs wie \"Back Me Up\" oder \"Wide Open\".\nEiner meiner pers\u00f6nlichen Favoriten ist \"Cranberry Moon Walk\", nicht wegen der (nicht vorhandenen) Lyrik, sondern einfach wegen dem Beat und der gut gesungenen Hook. Wer den Inhalt wissen will, sollte hier auf RapGenius irgendwas von Lil Wayne suchen, den Beat um B.o.Bs Gitarren und den wilden Synthesizern sollte man nicht verpasst haben. Man sollte \"Cranberry Moon Walk\" die Chance lassen, sich zum Geheimfavoriten zu mausern.\nDer letzte und 15. Track ist \"We Still In This Bitch\" featuring T.I. und Juicy J, alle drei bringen ihre Verse f\u00f6rmlich um und brillieren mit genialen Wortspielen und Punchlines, sei es B.o.B (\"Got all these pounds of ganja, I work out, I'm doing kush-ups\"), T.I. (\"You want trouble, I got plenty, how you want it, full or semi?\") oder Juicy J (\"I got your boo in my boo-gatti, she 'bout to swallow my babies\"). Der Beat ist reich an Kick- und Bassdrums und B\u00e4ssen und spart an der Melodie, hei\u00dft: angenehmer Ohrwurmsound. Produktion stammt von Mike WiLL Made It, der das Lied zu einem Clubsong macht, der an Arroganz nicht mehr zu \u00fcberbieten ist.\n\nInsgesamt ein gutes und harmonisches Genie\u00dferalbum f\u00fcr Leute, die auch mal auf die hunderste Reimsilbe kacken k\u00f6nnen, mit einer Menge Storytelling \u00e0 la \"good kid, m.A.A.d. city\", aber auch richtig guten, arroganten Songs. Positiv sind au\u00dferdem der Ohrwurmfaktor, die Beatauswahl, die Abstimmung der Tracklist und, dass das Album nie langweilig wird und man es \u00fcberall h\u00f6ren kann. Nat\u00fcrlich nicht perfekt, aber die oben genannten Gr\u00fcnde sind schlagkr\u00e4ftig und machen das Album f\u00fcr mich zu einem besseren als beispielsweise \"Magna Carta Holy Grail\" oder \"Based On a T.R.U. Story II: #MeTime\".\n\nAnspieltipps: Paper Route, Ready, Throwback, HeadBand, Cranberry Moon Walk, We Still In This Bitch\n\nRating:\n9,5/10\nmatza\nWie auf B.o.B.s Vorg\u00e4ngeralben leicht verdauliche Pop-Rapmusik garniert mt ein paar ignoranteren Nummern auf netten, basslastigen teils selbst produzierten Beats und auff\u00e4lligen Features, aber teilweise fragw\u00fcrdigen und widerspr\u00fcchlichen Texten.

looking like a high I wanna be on\nBaby it's your call, no pressure at all\n\n[Chorus: Blake Shelton]\nYou don\u2019t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer\nYou don\u2019t have to keep on smiling that smile that\u2019s driving me wild and when the night is almost over\nMeet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on\nYou don\u2019t have to keep me fallin\u2019 like this\nBut it\u2019d sure be cool if you did\n[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]\nYou can\u2019t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead\nGot me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head\nLet your mind take a little back road\nJust as far as you wanna go\nBaby I\u2019ll do whatever you wanna do\n\n[Chorus: Blake Shelton]\nYou don't

met up with some friends\nAt the edge of the night\nAt a bar off 75\nAnd we talked and talked\nAbout how our parents will die\nAll our neighbors and wives\nBut I'd like to think\nI can cheat it all\nTo make up for the times I've been cheated on\nAnd it's nice to know\nWhen I was left for dead\nI was found and now I don't roam these streets\nI am not the ghost you are to me\n\n[Chorus]\nIf

With no Tom Hanks to bring you home\nA lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem\nTrying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song\nTo fight the tanks and drones of you being alone\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Guy Sebastian]\nI wish I never looked, I wish I never touched\nI wish that I could stop loving you so much\n'Cause I'm the only one that's tryna keep us together\nWhen all of the signs say that I should forget her\nI wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had\nI wish that the good outweighed the bad\n'Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over\n\n[Chorus: Guy

into them cutoffs baby, oh yeah\nYou're getting off work, cashing out that paycheck\nGotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step\nHere she comes now lookin' so fine\nYou've been waiting on this night for such a long, long time\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe slides in and you roll down Main Street\nYou turn right when that red light turns green\nSun sets now, you're half way to heaven\nShe picks a song, you turn it up to 11\nYou say, \"Do you wanna?\" and she says, \"Hell, yeah\"\nSo you hit the party, all your buddies are jealous\nSomeday you'll be looking back on your life\nAt the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights\n[Verse 3]\nCrowded backyard, everybody's laughin'\nKinda party, next week you'll say I was there when it happened\nComing up on midnight, 'bout time to get gone\nAnd then the DJ starts to play your favorite song\nYou slow dance for 3 minutes or so, and then she whispers, \"Baby, let's go.\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd when she slides in and she gives you the green light\nYou hold off 'till you turn on the headlights\nSomeday when you're looking back on your life\nAt the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights\nYeah, one of those nights\n\n[Bridge]\nFull moon through a crack in the windshield\nYou hold her close and you'll never forget how her heartbeat feels\nNo, you never will\n'Cause someday when you're looking back on your life\nAt the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, one of those nights\nOne of those nights\nYeah, one of those nights\nOne of those nights, oh\nOne of those nights\nThis is gonna be, hey\nThis is gonna be\nOne of those nights\nOh, ohSee Tim McGraw LiveGet tickets as low as $635You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

noose\n'Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell\nBefore I'll see you with someone else\n[Pre-Chorus]\nPut me in the ground\nPut me six foot down\nAnd let the stone say:\n\n[Chorus]\nHere lies the girl whose only crutch\nWas loving one man just a little too much\nIf you go before I do\nI'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell\nIt won't be whiskey, it won't be meth\nIt'll be your name on my last breath\nIf divorce or death ever do us part\nThe coroner will call it a broken heart\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo put me in the ground\nPut me six foot down\nAnd let the stone say:\n\n[Chorus]\nHere lies the girl whose only crutch\nWas loving one man just a little too much\nIf you go before I do\nI'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two\nDig two\nYou

ends for you\nIf that ring gets a little too tight\nYou might as well read me my last rites\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd let the stone say:\n\n[Chorus]\nHere lies the girl whose only crutch\nWas loving one man just a little too much\nIf you go before I do\nGonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!\nThere'll be a stone right next to mine\nWe'll be together 'til the end of time\nDon't you go before I do\nI'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two\n\n[Outro]\nI told you on the day we wed\nI was gonna love you 'til I's dead7Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8,

feels\n[Chorus]\nLet your hair down, hair down\nGet you some of this laid on back\nKick your shoes off, kick 'em off\nGet you some of this slow down fast\nI'll take you up and down these hollers and hills\nLet me show you how country feels\n\n[Verse 2]\nNever watched the sun go down\nFrom the bed of a pickup truck\nEver been so into somebody\nYou're still lying there when it comes back up\n\n[Bridge]\nGirl what do you say?\nCut a path through that cornfield\nPark down by the water\nLet me show you how country feels\n\n[Chorus]\nLet your hair down, hair down\nGet you some of this

phone at?\n[Chorus: Trey Songz]\nI only came here for two reasons\nI came for (Whatchu came for?)\nI only came for the bitches and the drinks\nBitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks\nFor the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks\nBitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks, whatchu came for?\nBaby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks\nBaby, get your ass up, that's what I came for\n\n[Verse 2: Trey Songz]\nI see you tryin' to handcuff her on the street\nStop trippin', you can't control that freak\nAin't nobody got a body like hers\nGhetto booty, but she came from the 'burbs\nGot a dark skinned girl dancin' on me\nTwo white girls dancin' on me\nBad yellow bone, yeah I'm in my zone\nWaitress keep comin' back, so you know we hella gone\n\n[Chorus: Trey Songz]\nI only came here for two reasons\nI came for (Whatchu came for?)\nI only came for the bitches and the drinks\nBitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks\nFor the bitch, ca-came for the

I'm lookin' for tomorrow\nAll I do is turn up, ain\u2019t no dough it don\u2019t concern us\nAll this bubba kush I burn up, smell some regular, it ruined us\nTurning corners, fishtailin' out the parking lot yellin'\nBankhead, west side, eight or nine chicks trailin'\nRight behind us, been this way since we were minors\nIf it wasn't for the chicks up in this bitch, you wouldn't find us\nEven way out in China, same thing when I came through the door\nLike, here you go again, where the bitches and the drink, yo\n\n[Chorus: Trey Songz]\nI only came for the bitches and the drinks\nBitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks\nYou need to know what I came for\nBitches and the drinks\nBitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks\nI know you know what I came for\nBaby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks\nBaby, get your ass up, that's what I came for\n\n[Verse 4: Trey Songz]\nHey girl, you heard what I said, get your ass up\nIf you hot, you cold, you Florida, Alaska\nChicago, Virginia, New York City\nHouston where the girls all thick\nLA, the Bay, tell your girl 'bout this\nMatter fact tell the whole GA\nOoh, you know they fine up and down the

December\nI still remember the presents, the tree, you and me\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you went away\nHow dare you?\nI miss you\nThey say I\u2019ll be OK\nBut I\u2019m not going to ever get over you\n[Bridge]\nLiving alone, here in this place\nI think of you, and I\u2019m not afraid\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour favorite records make me feel better\nCause you sing along\nWith every song\nI know you didn\u2019t mean to give them to me\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you went away\nHow dare you?\nI miss you\nThey say I\u2019ll be OK\nBut I\u2019m not going to ever get over you\n\n[Break]\nIt really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone\n\n[Chorus]\nCause you went away\nHow dare you?\nI miss you\nThey say I\u2019ll be OK\nBut I\u2019m not going to ever get over youSee Miranda Lambert LiveGet tickets as
