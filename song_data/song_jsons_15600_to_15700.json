Circe) LyricsThe Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.)

Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads.

He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear!

I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.)

Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah!

Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O!

Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls.

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches.

Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks.

Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding.

Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/692350", "artist_names": "\u200bThe Guess Who", "full_title": "Sour Suite

ding-a-ling or talk about a thing\nNot this morning\nI don't want to think about the night before\nOr maybe it's a bore behind an open door\nI've got no time for that this morning\nIf I had the mind or I had the time\nMaybe I could throw together a new kind of rhyme\nAnd tell about my warning\n[Chorus]\nBut it's too late now\nIt's too late now\nIt's too late now\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't want to think about a runaway dad\nThat took away the only thing that I've never had\nDon't even miss him this morning\nI don't want to think about a cold goodbye\nOr a high school buddy got a little too high\nI can't help him out this morning\nReviewers laugh at me so I go out to sea\nAnd perhaps it's just as well because I'd rather be in hell\nThan be a wealthy man this morning\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhatever happened to images, because now they're gone\nAnd worn-out phrases just keep a-hanging on\nWhatever happened to homes as opposed to houses\nThe conversation sinks as the evening drowses\nIt's just like 46201\nIt's just like 46201\nWhatever happened to early morning open skies\nAnd broken faces, half with melting eyes\nEnough of riddles that just play with time\nBecause I'm still here and I can't beg a dime\nI'm back here in 46201\nI'm back here in 46201\nSomething better's waiting for me around the corner now\nI got to find it and try and hang on for a little while\nI'm back here in 46201\nThere's gotta be a few small changes made\nDon't want to listen to my telephone ring\nOr sing ding-a-ling or talk about a thing\nLeave me alone this morningYou might also

Hudson", "lyrics": "Hampshire Days (Chap. 2) LyricsBETWEEN the Boldre and the Exe, or Beaulieu river, there is a stretch of country in most part flat and featureless. It is one of those parts of the Forest which have a bare and desolate aspect; here in places you can go a mile and not find a tree or bush, where nothing grows but a starved-looking heath, scarcely ankle-deep. Wild life in such places is represented by a few meadow pipits and small lizards. There is no doubt that this barrenness and naked appearance is the result of the perpetual cutting of heath and gorse, and the removal of the thin surface soil for fuel.\n\nThose who do not know the New Forest, or know it only as a collecting or happy hunting-ground of eggers and \u201clepidopterists,\u201d or as artists in search of paintable woodland scenery know it, and others who make it a summer holiday resort, may say that this abuse is one which might and should be remedied. They would be mistaken. What I and a few others who use their senses see and hear in this or that spot, is, in every case, a very small matter, a visible but an infinitesimal part of that abuse of the New Forest which is old and chronic, and operates always, and is common to the whole area, and, as things are, irremediable. To discover and denounce certain things which ought not to be, to rail against Verderers, who are after all what they cannot help being, is about as profitable as it would be to \u201cdamn the nature of things.\u201d\n\nIt must be borne in mind that the Forest area has a considerable population composed of commoners, squatters, private owners, who have inherited or purchased lands originally filched from the Forest; and of a large number of persons who reside mostly in the villages, and are private residents, publicans, shopkeepers, and lodging-house keepers. All these people have one object in common\u2014to get as much as they can out of the Forest. It is true that a large proportion of them, especially those who live in the villages, which are now rapidly increasing their populations, are supposed not to have any Forest rights; but they do as a fact get something out of it; and we may say that, generally, all the people in the Forest dine at one table, and all get a helping out of most of the dishes going, though the first and biggest helpings are for the favoured guests.\n\nThose who have inherited rights have indeed come to look on the Forest as in a sense their property. What is given or handed over to them is not in their view their proper share: they take this openly, and get the balance the best way they can\u2014in the dark generally. It is not dishonest to help yourself to what belongs to you; and they must live must have their whack. They have, in fact, their own moral code, their New Forest conscience, just as other men\u2014miners, labourers on the land, tradesmen, gamekeepers, members of the Stock Exchange, for instance\u2014have each their corporate code and conscience. It may not be the general or the ideal or speculative conscience, but it is what may be called their working conscience. One proof that much goes on in the dark, or that much is winked at, is the paucity of all wild life which is worth any man\u2019s while to take in a district where pretty well everything is protected on paper. Game, furred and feathered, would not exist at all but for the private estates scattered through the Forest, in which game is preserved, and from which the depleted Forest lands are constantly being restocked. Again, in all this most favourable country no rare or beautiful species may be found: it would be safer for the hobby, the golden oriole, the hoopoe, the harrier, to nest in a metropolitan park than in the loneliest wood between the Avon and Southampton Water. To introduce any new species, from the biggest\u2014the capercailzie and the great bustard\u2014to the smallest quail, or any small passerine bird with a spot of brilliant colour on its plumage, would be impossible.\n\nThe New Forest people are, in fact, just what circumstances have made them. Like all organised beings, they are the creatures of, and subject to, the conditions they exist in; and they cannot be other than they are\u2014namely, parasites on the Forest. And, what is more, they cannot be educated, or preached, or worried out of their ingrained parasitical habits and ways of thought. They have had centuries\u2014long centuries\u2014of practice to make them cunning, and the effect of more stringent regulations than those now in use would only be to polish and put a better edge on that weapon which Nature has given them to fight with.\n\nThis being the conclusion, namely, that \u201cthings are what they are, and the consequences of them will be what they will be,\u201d some of my readers, especially those in the New Forest, may ask, Why, then, say anything about it? why not follow the others who have written books and books and books about the New Forest, books big and books little, from Wise, his classic, and the Victoria History, down to the long row of little rosy guide-books? They saw nothing of all this; or if they saw unpleasant things they thought it better to hold their tongues, or pens, than to make people uncomfortable.\nI confess it would be a mistake, a mere waste of words, to bring these hidden things to light if it could be believed that the New Forest, in its condition and management, will continue for any length of time to be what it is and has been\u2014just that and nothing more. A district in England, it is true, but out of the way, remote, a spot to be visited once or twice in a lifetime just to look at the scenery, like Lundy or the Scilly Isles or the Orkneys. But it cannot be believed. The place itself, its curious tangle of ownership; government by and rights of the crown, of private owners, commoners, and the public, is what it has always been; but many persons have now come to think and to believe that the time is approaching when there will be a disentanglement and a change.\n\nThe Forest has been known and loved by a limited number of persons always; the general public have only discovered it in recent years. For one visitor twenty years ago there are scores, probably hundreds, to-day. And year by year, as motoring becomes more common, and as cycling from being general grows, as it will, to be universal, the flow of visitors to the Forest will go on at an ever-increasing rate, and the hundreds of to-day will be thousands in five years\u2019 time. With these modern means of locomotion, there is no more attractive spot than this hundred and fifty square miles of level country which contains the most beautiful forest scenery in England. And as it grows in favour in all the country as a place of recreation and refreshment, the subject of its condition and management, and the ways of its inhabitants, will receive an increased attention. The desire will grow that it shall not be spoilt, either by the authorities or the residents, that it shall not be turned into townships and plantations, nor be starved, nor its wild life left to be taken and destroyed by any one and every one. It will be seen that the \u201crights\u201d I have spoken of, with the unwritten laws and customs which are kept more or less in the dark, are in conflict with the better and infinitely more important rights of the people generally\u2014of the whole nation. Once all this becomes common knowledge, that which some now regard as a mere dream, a faint hope, something too remote for us to concern ourselves about, will all at once appear to us as a practical object something to be won by fighting, and certainly worth fighting for.\n\nIt may be said at once, and I fancy that any one who knows the inner life of the Forest people will agree with me, that so long as these are in possession (and here all private owners are included) there can be no great change, no permanent improvement made in the Forest. That is the difficulty, but it is not an insuperable one. Public opinion, and the desire of the people for anything, is a considerable force to-day; so that, inspired by it, the most timid and conservative governments are apt all at once to acquire an extraordinary courage. Sustained by that outside force, the most tender-hearted and sensitive Prime Minister would not in the least mind if some persons were to dub him a second and worse William the Bastard.\n\nThe people in this district have a curious experiment to show the wonderful power of the Forest fly in retaining its grasp. A man takes the fly between his finger and thumb, and with the other hand holds a single hair of a cow or horse for it to seize, then gently pulls hair and fly apart. The fly does not release his hold\u2014he splits the hair, or at any rate shaves a piece off right down to the fine end with his sharp, grasping claw. Doubtless the human parasite will, when his time comes, show an equal tenacity; he will embrace the biggest and oldest oak he knows, and to pluck him from his beloved soil it will be necessary to pull up the tree by its roots. But this is a detail, and may be left to the engineers.\n\nBeyond that starved, melancholy wilderness, the sight of which has led me into so long a digression, one comes to a point which overlooks the valley of the Exe; and here one pauses long before going down to the half-hidden village by the river. Especially if it is in May or June, when the oak is in its \u201cglad light grene,\u201d for that is the most vivid and beautiful of all vegetable greens, and the prospect is the greenest and most soul-refreshing to be found in England. The valley is all wooded and the wood is all oak\u2014a continuous oakwood stretching away on the right, mile on mile, to the sea. The sensation experienced at the sight of this prospect is like that of the traveller in a dry desert when he comes to a clear running stream and drinks his fill of water and is refreshed. The river is tidal, and at the full of the tide in its widest part beside the village its appearance is of a small inland lake, grown round with oaks\u2014old trees that stretch their horizontal branches far out and wet their lower leaves in the salt water. The village itself that has this setting, with its ancient water-mill, its palace of the Montagus, and the Abbey of Beaulieu, a grey ivied ruin, has a distinction above all Hampshire villages, and is unlike all others in its austere beauty and atmosphere of old-world seclusion and quietude. Above all, is that quality which the mind imparts\u2014the expression due to romantic historical associations.\n\nOne very still, warm summer afternoon I stood on the margin, looking across the sheet of glassy water at a heron on the farther side, standing knee-deep in the shallow water patiently watching for a fish, his grey figure showing distinctly against a background of bright green sedges. Between me and the heron scores of swallows and martins were hawking for flies, gliding hither and thither a little above the glassy surface, and occasionally dropping down to dip and wet their under plumage in the water. And all at once, fifty yards out from the margin, there was a great splash, as if a big stone had been flung out into the lake; and then two or three moments later out from the falling spray and rocking water rose a swallow, struggling laboriously up, its plumage drenched, and flew slowly away. A big pike had dashed at and tried to seize it at the moment of dipping in the water, and the swallow had escaped as by a miracle. I turned round to see if any person was near, who might by chance have witnessed so strange a thing, in order to speak to him about it. There was no person within sight, but if on turning round my eyes had encountered the form of a Cistercian monk, returning from his day\u2019s labour in the fields, in his dirty black-and-white robe, his implements on his shoulders, his face and hands begrimed with dust and sweat, the apparition on that day, in the mood I was in, would not have greatly surprised me.\n\nThe atmosphere, the expression of the past may so attune the mind as almost to produce the illusion that the past is now.\n\nBut more than old memories, great as their power over the mind is at certain impressible moments, and more than Beaulieu as a place where men dwell, is that ineffable freshness of nature, that verdure that like the sunlight and the warmth of the sun penetrates to the inmost being. Here I have remembered the old ornithologist Willughby\u2019s suggestion, which no longer seemed fantastic, that the furred and feathered creatures inhabiting arctic regions have grown white by force of imagination and the constant intuition of snow. And here too I have recalled that modern fancy that the soul in man has its proper shape and colour, and have thought that if I came hither with a grey or blue or orange or brown soul, its colour had now changed to green. The pleasure of it has detained me long days in spring, often straying by the river at its full, among the broadly-branching oaks, delighting my sight with the new leaves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0against the sun shene,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some very red, and some a glad light grene.\n\nYet these same oak woods, great as their charm is, their green everlasting gladness, have a less enduring hold on the spirit than the open heath, though this may look melancholy and almost desolate on coming to it from those sunlit emerald glades with a green thought in the soul. It seems enough that it is open, where the wind blows free, and there is nothing between us and the sun. It is a passion, an old ineradicable instinct in us: the strongest impulse in children, savage or civilised, is to go out into some open place. If a man be capable of an exalted mood, of a sense of absolute freedom, so that he is no longer flesh and spirit but both in one, and one with nature, it comes to him like some miraculous gift on a hill or down or wide open heath. \u201cYou never enjoy the earth aright,\u201d wrote Thomas Traherne in his Divine Raptures, \u201cuntil the sun itself floweth through your veins, till you are clothed with the heavens and crowned with the stars, and perceive yourself to be the sole heir of the whole world.\u201d\n\nIt may be observed that we must be out and well away from the woods and have a wide horizon all around in order to feel the sun flowing through us. Many of us have experienced these \u201cdivine raptures,\u201d this sublimated state of feeling; and such moments are perhaps the best in our earthly lives; but it is mainly the Trahernes, the Silurist Vaughans, the Newmans, the Frederic Myers, the Coventry Patmores, the Wordsworths, that speak of them, since such moods best fit, or can be made to fit in with their philosophy, or mysticism, and are, to them, its best justification.\n\nThis wide heath, east of Beaulieu, stretching miles away towards Southampton Water, looks level to the eye. But it is not so; it is grooved with long valley-like depressions with marshy or boggy bottoms, all draining into small tributaries of the Dark Water, which flows into the Solent near Lepe. In these bottoms and in all the wet places the heather and furze mixes with or gives place to the bog myrtle, or golden withy; and on the spongiest spots the fragrant yellow stars of the bog asphodel are common in June. These spots are exceedingly rich in colour, with greys and emerald greens and orange yellows of moss and lichen, flecked with the snow-white of cotton-grass.\n\nHere, then, besides that cause of contentment which we find in openness, there is fragrance in fuller measure than in most places. One may wade through acres of myrtle, until that subtle delightful odour is in one\u2019s skin and clothes, and in the air one breathes, and seems at last to penetrate and saturate the whole being, and smell seems to be for a time the most important of the senses.\nAmong the interesting birds that breed on the heath, the nightjar is one of the commonest. A keen naturalist, Mr. E. A. Bankes, who lived close by, told me that he had marked the spot where he had found a pair of young birds, and that each time he rode over the heath he had a look at them, and as they remained there until able to fly, he concluded that it is not true that the parent birds remove the young when the nest has been discovered.\n\nI was not convinced, as it did not appear that he had handled the young birds: he had only looked at them while sitting on his horse. The following summer I found a pair of young not far from the same spot: they were half-fledged and very active, running into the heath and trying to hide from me, but I caught and handled them for some minutes, the parent bird remaining near, uttering her cries. I marked the spot and went back next day, only to find that the birds had vanished.\n\nThe snipe, too, is an annual breeder, and from what I saw of it on the heath I think we have yet something to learn concerning the breeding habits of that much-observed bird. The parent bird is not so wise as most mothers in the feathered world, since her startling cry of alarm, sounding in a small way like the snort of a frightened horse, will attract a person to the spot where she is sheltering her young among the myrtle. She will repeat the cry at intervals a dozen times without stirring or attempting to conceal the young. But she does not always act in the same way. Sometimes she has risen to a great height and begun circling above me, the circles growing smaller or larger as I came nearer or went farther from the spot where the young were lurking.\n\nIt was until recently a moot question as to whether or not the female snipe made the drumming or bleating sound; some of the authorities say that this sound proceeds only from the male bird. I have no doubt that both birds make the sound. Invariably when I disturbed a snipe with young, and when she mounted high in the air, to wheel round and round, uttering her anxious cries, she dashed downwards at intervals, and produced the bleating or drumming which the male birds emit when playing about the sky.\n\nIn all cases where I have found young snipe there was but one old bird, the female, no doubt. In some instances I have spent an hour with the young birds by me, or in my hands, waiting for the other parent to appear; and I am almost convinced that the care of the young falls wholely on the female.\n\nThe redshank, that graceful bird with a beautiful voice, breeds here in most years, and is in a perpetual state of anxiety so long as a human figure remains in sight. A little while ago the small vari-coloured stonechat or fuzz-jack, with red breast, black head and white collar, sitting upright and motionless, like a painted image of a bird, on the topmast spray of a furze bush, then flitting to perch on another bush, then to another; for ever emitting those two little contrasted sounds\u2014the gutteral chat and the clear, fretful pipe\u2014had seemed to me the most troubled and full of care and worries of all Nature\u2019s feathered children so sorrowful, in spite of his pretty harlequin dress! Now his trouble seems a small thing, and not to be regarded in the presence of the larger, louder redshank. As I walk he rises a long way ahead, and wheeling about comes towards me\u2014he and she, and by-and-by a second pair, and perhaps a third; they come with measured pulsation of the long, sharp, white-banded wings; and the first comer sweeps by and returns again to meet the others, clamouring all the time, calling on them to join in the outcry until the whole air seems full of their trouble. To and fro he flies, to this side and that; and finally, as if in imitation of the small, fretful stonechat, he sweeps down to alight on the topmost spray of some small tree or tall bush not a furze but a willow; and as it is an insecure stand for a bird of his long thin wading legs, he stands lightly, balancing himself with his wings; beautiful in his white and pale-grey plumage, and his slender form, on that airy perch of the willow in its grey-green leaves and snow-white catkins; and balanced there, he still continues his sorrowful anxious cries\u2014ever crying for me to go\u2014to go away and leave him in peace. I leave him reluctantly, and have my reward, for no sooner does he see me going than his anxious cries change to that beautiful wild pipe, unrivalled except by the curlew among shore birds.\n\nWorst of all birds that can have no peace in their lives so long as you are in sight is the peewit. The harsh wailing sound of his crying voice as he wheels about overhead, the mad downward rushes, when his wings creak as he nears you, give the idea that he is almost crazed with anxiety; and one feels ashamed at causing so much misery. Oh, poor bird! is there no way to make you understand without leaving the ground, that your black-spotted, olive-coloured eggs are perfectly safe; that a man can walk about on the heath and be no more harmful to you than the Forest ponies, and the ragged donkey browsing on a furze bush, and the cow with her tinkling bell? I stand motionless, looking the other way; I sit down to think; I lie flat on my back with hands clasped behind my head, and gaze at the sky, and still the trouble goes on he will not believe in me, nor tolerate me. There is nothing to do but get up and go away out of sight and sound of the peewits.\n\nIt appears to me that this sympathy for the lower animals is very much a matter of association\u2014an overflow of that regard for the rights of and compassion for others of our kind which are at the foundations of the social instinct. The bird is a red- and a warm-blooded being\u2014we have seen that its blood is red, and when we take a living bird in our hands we feel its warmth and the throbbing of its breast: therefore birds are related to us, and with that red human blood they have human passions. Witness the peewit\u2014the mother bird, when you have discovered or have come near her downy little one\u2014could any human mother, torn with the fear of losing her babe, show her unquiet and disturbed state in a plainer, more understandable way! But in the case of creatures of another division in the kingdom of life\u2014non-vertebrates, without sensible heat, and with a thin colourless fluid instead of red blood, as if like plants they had only a vegetative life\u2014this sympathy is not felt as a rule. When, in some exceptional case, the feeling is there, it is because some human association has come into the mind in spite of the differences between insect and man.\n\nWalking on this heath I saw a common green grasshopper, disturbed at my step, leap away, and by chance land in a geometric web in a small furze bush. Caught in the web, it began kicking with its long hind legs, and would in three seconds have made its escape. But mark what happened. Directly over the web, and above the kicking grasshopper, there was a small, web-made, thimble-shaped shelter, mouth down, fastened to a spray, and the spider was sitting in it. And looking down it must have seen and known that the grasshopper was far too big and strong to be held in that frailest snare, that it would be gone in a moment and the net torn to pieces. It also must have seen and known that it was no wasp nor dangerous insect of any kind; and so, instantly, straight and swift as a leaden plummet, it dropped out of the silvery bell it lived in on to the grasshopper and attacked it at the head. The falces were probably thrust into the body between the head and prothorax, for almost instantly the struggle ceased, and in less than three seconds the victim appeared perfectly dead.\n\nWhat interested me in this sight was the spider, an Epeira of a species I had never closely looked at before, a little less in size than our famous Epeira diadema\u2014our common garden spider, with the pretty white diadem on its velvety, brown abdomen. This heath spider was creamy-white in colour, the white deepening to warm buff all round at the sides, and to a deeper tint on the under surface. It was curiously and prettily coloured; and, being new to me, its image was vividly impressed on my mind.\n\nAs to what had happened, that did not impress me at all. I could not, like the late noble poet who cherished an extreme animosity against the spider, and inveighed against it in brilliant, inspired verse, remember and brood sadly on the thought of the fairy forms that are its victims\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lovely births that winnow by,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twin-sisters of the rainbow sky:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elf-darlings, fluffy, bee-bright things,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And owl-white moths with mealy wings.\nNor could I, like him, break the creature\u2019s toils, nor take the dead from its gibbet, nor slay it on account of its desperate wickedness. These are mere house-bred feelings and fancies, perhaps morbid; he who walks out-of-doors with Nature, who sees life and death as sunlight and shadow, on witnessing such an incident wishes the captor a good appetite, and, passing on, thinks no more about it. For any day in summer, sitting by the water, or in a wood, or on the open heath, I note little incidents of this kind; they are always going on in thousands all about us, and one with trained eye cannot but see them; but no feeling is excited, no sympathy, and they are no sooner seen than forgotten. But, as I said, there are exceptional cases, and here is one which refers to an even more insignificant creature than a field grasshopper\u2014a small dipterous insect\u2014and yet I was strangely moved by it.\n\nThe insect was flying rather slowly by me over the heath\u2014a thin, yellow-bodied, long-legged creature, a Tipula, about half as big as our familiar crane-fly. Now, as it flew by me about on a level with my thighs, up from the heath at my feet shot out a second insect, about the same size as the first, also a Dipteron, but of another family\u2014one of the Asilidse, which are rapacious. The Asilus was also very long-legged, and seizing the other with its legs, the two fell together to the ground. Stooping down, I witnessed the struggle. They were locked together, and I saw the attacking insect raise his head and the forepart of his body so as to strike, then plunge his rostrum like a dagger in the soft part of his victim\u2019s body. Again and again he raised and buried his weapon in the other, and the other still refused to die or to cease struggling. And this little light and struggle of two flies curiously moved me, and for some time I could not get over the feeling of intense repugnance it excited. This feeling was wholly due to association: the dagger-like weapon and the action of the insect were curiously human-like, and I had seen just such a combat between two men, one fallen and the other on him, raising and striking down with his knife. Had I never witnessed such an incident, the two flies struggling, one killing the other, would have produced no such feeling, and would not have been remembered.\n\nWe live in thoughts and feelings, not in days and years\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In feelings, not in figures on a dial,\n\nas some poet has said, and, recalling an afternoon and an evening spent on this heath, it does not seem to my mind like an evening passed alone in a vacant place, in the usual way, watching and listening and thinking of nothing, but an eventful period, which deeply moved me, and left an enduring memory.\n\nThe sun went down, and though the distressed birds had cried till they were weary of crying, I did not go away. Something on this occasion kept me, in spite of the gathering gloom and a cold wind\u2014bitterly cold for June\u2014which blew over the wide heath. Here and there the rays from the setting sun fell upon and lit up the few mounds that rise like little islands out of the desolate brown waste. These are the Pixie mounds, the barrows raised by probably prehistoric men, a people inconceivably remote in time and spirit from us, whose memory is pale in our civilised days.\n\nThere are times and moods in which it is revealed to us, or to a few among us, that we are a survival of the past, a dying remnant of a vanished people, and are like strangers and captives among those who do not understand us, and have no wish to do so; whose language and customs and thoughts are not ours. That \u201cworld-strangeness,\u201d which William Watson and his fellow-poets prattle in rhyme about, those, at all events, who have what they call the \u201cnote of modernity\u201d in their pipings, is not in me as in them. The blue sky, the brown soil beneath, the grass, the trees, the animals, the wind, and rain, and sun, and stars are never strange to me; for I am in and of and am one with them; and my flesh and the soil are one, and the heat in my blood and in the sunshine are one, and the winds and tempests and my passions are one. I feel the \u201cstrangeness\u201d only with regard to my fellow-men, especially in towns, where they exist in conditions unnatural to me, but congenial to them; where they are seen in numbers and in crowds, in streets and houses, and in all places where they gather together; when I look at them, their pale civilised faces, their clothes, and hear them eagerly talking about things that do not concern me. They are out of my world\u2014the real world. All that they value, and seek and strain after all their lives long, their works and sports and pleasures, are the merest baubles and childish things; and their ideals are all false, and nothing but by-products, or growths, of the artificial life\u2014little funguses cultivated in heated cellars.\n\nIn such moments we sometimes feel a kinship with, and are strangely drawn to, the dead, who were not as these; the long, long dead, the men who knew not life in towns, and felt no strangeness in sun and wind and rain. In such a mood on that evening I went to one of those lonely barrows; one that rises to a height of nine or ten feet above the level heath, and is about fifty yards round. It is a garden in the brown desert, covered over with a dense growth of furze bushes, still in flower, mixed with bramble and elder and thorn, and heather in great clumps, blooming, too, a month before its time, the fiery purple-red of its massed blossoms, and of a few tall, tapering spikes of foxglove, shining against the vivid green of the young bracken.\n\nAll this rich wild vegetation on that lonely mound on the brown heath!\n\nHere, sheltered by the bushes, I sat and saw the sun go down, and the long twilight deepen till the oak woods of Beaulieu in the west looked black on the horizon, and the stars came out: in spite of the cold wind that made me shiver in my thin clothes, I sat there for hours, held by the silence and solitariness of that mound of the ancient dead.\n\nSitting there, profoundly sad for no apparent cause, with no conscious thought in my mind, it suddenly occurred to me that I knew that spot from of old, that in long past forgotten years I had often come there of an evening and sat through the twilight, in love with the loneliness and peace, wishing that it might be my last resting-place. To sleep there for ever\u2014the sleep that knows no waking! We say it, but do not mean\u2014do not believe it. Dreams do come to give us pause; and we know that we have lived. To dwell alone, then, with this memory of life in such a spot for all time! There are moments in which the thought of death steals upon and takes us as it were by surprise, and it is then exceeding bitter. It was as if that cold wind blowing over and making strange whispers in the heather had brought a sudden tempest of icy rain to wet and chill me.\n\nThis miserable sensation soon passed away, and, with quieted heart, I began to grow more and more attracted by the thought of resting on so blessed a spot. To have always about me that wildness which I best loved\u2014the rude incult heath, the beautiful desolation; to have harsh furze and ling and bramble and bracken to grow on me, and only wild creatures for visitors and company. The little stonechat, the tinkling meadow pipit, the excited whitethroat to sing to me in summer; the deep-burrowing rabbit to bring down his warmth and familar smell among my bones; the heat-loving adder, rich in colour, to find when summer is gone a dry safe shelter and hibernaculum in my empty skull.\n\nSo beautiful did the thought appear that I could have laid down my life at that moment, in spite of death\u2019s bitterness, if by so doing I could have had my desire. But no such sweet and desirable a thing could be given me by this strange people and race that possess the earth, who are not like the people here with me in the twilight on the heath. For I thought, too, of those I should lie with, having with them my after life; and thinking of them I was no longer alone. I thought of them not as others think, those others of a strange race. What do they think? They think so many things! The materialist, the scientist, would say: They have no existence; they ceased to be anything when their flesh was turned to dust, or burned to ashes, and their minds, or souls, were changed to some other form of energy, or motion, or affection of matter, or whatever they call it. The believer would not say of them, or of the immaterial part of them, that they had gone into a world of light, that in a dream or vision he had seen them walking in an air of glory; but he might hold that they had been preached to in Hades some nineteen centuries ago, and had perhaps repented of their barbarous deeds. Or he might think, since he has considerable latitude allowed him on the point, that the imperishable parts of them are here at this very spot, tangled in dust that was once flesh and bones, sleeping like chrysalids through a long winter, to be raised again at the sound of a trumpet blown by an angel to a second conscious life, happy or miserable as may be willed.\n\nI imagine none of these things, for they were with me in the twilight on the barrow in crowds, sitting and standing in groups, and many lying on their sides on the turf below, their heads resting in their hands. They, too, all had their faces turned towards Beaulieu. Evening by evening for many and many a century they had looked to that point, towards the black wood on the horizon, where there were people and sounds of human life. Day by day for centuries they had listened with wonder and fear to the Abbey bells, and to the distant chanting of the monks. And the Abbey has been in ruins for centuries, open to the sky and overgrown with ivy; but still towards that point they look with apprehension, since men still dwell there, strangers to them, the little busy eager people, hateful in their artificial indoor lives, who do not know and who care nothing for them, who worship not and fear not the dead that are underground, but dig up their sacred places and scatter their bones and ashes, and despise and mock them because they are dead and powerless.\n\nIt is not strange that they fear and hate. I look at them\u2014their dark, pale, furious faces\u2014and think that if they could be visible thus in the daylight, all who came to that spot or passed near it would turn and fly with a terrifying image in their mind which would last to the end of life. But they do not resent my presence, and would not resent it were I permitted to come at last to dwell with them for ever. Perhaps they know me for one of their tribe,\u2014know that what they feel I feel, would hate what they hate.\n\nHas it not been said that love itself is an argument in favour of immortality? All love\u2014the love of men and women, of a mother for her child, of a friend for a friend\u2014the love that will cause him to lay down his life for another. Is it possible to believe, they say, that this beautiful sacred flame can be darkened for ever when soul and body fall asunder? But love without hate I do not know and cannot conceive; one implies the other. No good and no bad quality or principle can exist (for me) without its opposite.

Hudson", "lyrics": "Hampshire Days (Chap. 1) LyricsHERE, by chance, in the early days of December 1902, at the very spot where my book begins, I am about to bring it to an end.\n\nA few days ago, coming hither from the higher country at Silchester, where the trees were already nearly bare, I was surprised to find the oak woods of this lower southern part of the New Forest still in their full autumnal foliage. Even now, so late in the year, after many successive days and nights of rain and wind, they are in leaf still: everywhere the woods are yellow, here where the oak predominates; the stronger golden red and russet tints of the beech are vanished. We have rain and wind on most days, or rather mist and rain by day and wind with storms of rain by night; days, too, or parts of days, when it is very dark and still, and when there is a universal greyness in earth and sky. At such times, seen against the distant slaty darkness or in the blue-grey misty atmosphere, the yellow woods look almost more beautiful than in fine weather.\n\nThe wet woodland roads and paths are everywhere strewn, and in places buried deep in fallen leaves\u2014yellow, red, and russet; and this colour is continued under the trees all through the woods, where the dead bracken has now taken that deep tint which it will keep so long as there is rain or mist to wet it for the next four or five months. Dead bracken with dead leaves on a reddish soil; and where the woods are fir, the ground is carpeted with lately-fallen needles of a chestnut red, which brightens almost to orange in the rain. Now, at this season, in this universal redness of the earth where trees and bracken grow, we see that Nature is justified in having given that colour\u2014red and reddish-yellow\u2014to all or to most of her woodland mammals. Fox and foumart and weasel and stoat; the hare too; the bright squirrel; the dormouse and harvest-mouse; the bank-vole and the wood-mouse. Even the common shrew and lesser shrew, though they rarely come out by day, have a reddish tinge on their fur. Water-shrew and water-vole inhabit the banks of streams, and are safer without such a colour; the dark grey badger is strictly a night rover.\n\nSometimes about noon the clouds grow thin in that part of the sky, low down, where the sun is, and a pale gleam of sunlight filters through; even a patch of lucid blue sky sometimes becomes visible for a while: but the light soon fades; after mid-day the dimness increases, and before long one begins to think that evening has come. Withal it is singularly mild. One could almost imagine in this season of mist and wet and soft airs in late November that this is a land where days grew short and dark indeed, but where winter comes not, and the sensation of cold is unknown. It is pleasant to be out of doors in such weather, to stand in the coloured woods listening to that autumn sound of tits and other little birds wandering through the high trees in straggling parties, talking and calling to one another in their small sharp voices. Or to walk by the Boldre, or, as some call it, the Lymington, a slow, tame stream in summer, invisible till you are close to it; but now, in flood, the trees that grow on its banks and hid it in summer are seen standing deep in a broad, rushing, noisy river.\n\nThe woodpecker\u2019s laugh has the same careless happy sound as in summer: it is scarcely light in the morning before the small wren pours out his sharp bright lyric outside my window; it is time, he tells me, to light my candle and get up. The starlings are about the house all day long, vocal even in the rain, carrying on their perpetual starling conversation\u2014talk and song and recitative; a sort of bird-Yiddish, with fluty fragments of melody stolen from the blackbird, and whistle and click and the music of the triangle thrown in to give variety. So mild is it that in the blackness of night I sometimes wander into the forest paths and by furzy heaths and hedges to listen for the delicate shrill music of our late chirper in the thickets, our Thamnotrizon, about which I shall write later; and look, too, for a late glow-worm shining in some wet green place. Late in October I found one in daylight, creeping about in the grass on Selborne Hill; and some few, left unmarried, may shine much later. And as to the shade-loving grasshopper or leaf cricket, he sings, we know, on mild evenings in November. But I saw no green lamp in the herbage, and I heard only that nightly music of the tawny owl, fluting and hallooing far and near, bird answering bird in the oak woods all along the swollen stream from Brockenhurst to Boldre.\n\nThis race of wood owls perhaps have exceptionally strong voices: Wise, in his book on the New Forest, says that their hooting can be heard on a still autumn evening a distance of two miles. I have no doubt they can be heard a good mile.\nBut it is of this, to a bird lover, delectable spot in the best bird-months of April, May, and June that I have to write. The house, too, that gave me shelter must be spoken of; for never have I known any human habitation in a land where people are discovered dwelling in so many secret, green, out-of-the-world places, which had so much of nature in and about it. Grown-up and young people were in it, and children too, but they were girls, and had always quite spontaneously practised what I had preached\u2014pet nothing and persecute nothing. There was no boy to disturb the wild creatures with his hunting instincts and loud noises; no dog, no cat, nor any domestic creature except the placid cows and fowls which supplied the household with milk and eggs. A small old picturesque red-brick house with high-pitched roof and tall chimneys, a great part of it overrun with ivy and creepers, the walls and tiled roof stained by time and many-coloured lichen to a richly variegated greyish red. The date of the house, cut in a stone tablet in one of the rooms, was 1692. In front there was no lawn, but a walled plot of ground with old once ornamental trees and bushes symmetrically placed\u2014yews, both spreading and cypress-shaped Irish yew, and tall tapering juniper, and arbor vitae; it was a sort of formal garden which had long thrown off its formality. In a corner of the ground by the side of these dark plants were laurel, syringa, and lilac bushes, and among these such wildings as thorn, elder, and bramble had grown up, flourishing greatly, and making of that flowery spot a tangled thicket. At the side of the house there was another plot of ground, grass-grown, which had once been the orchard, and still had a few ancient apple and pear trees, nearly past bearing, with good nesting-holes for the tits and starlings in their decayed mossy trunks. There were also a few old ivied shade-trees\u2014chestnuts, fir, and evergreen oak.\n\nBest of all (for the birds) were the small old half-ruined outhouses which had remained from the distant days when the place, originally a manor, had been turned into a farm-house. They were here and there, scattered about, outside the enclosure, ivy-grown, each looking as old and weather-stained and in harmony with its surroundings as the house itself\u2014the small tumble-down barns, the cow-sheds, the pig-house, the granary with open door and the wooden staircase falling to pieces. All was surrounded by old oak woods, and the river was close by. It was an ideal spot for small birds. I have never in England seen so many breeding close together. The commoner species were extraordinarily abundant. Chaffinch and greenfinch; blackbird, throstle, and missel-thrush; swallow and martin, and common and lesser whitethroat; garden warbler and blackcap; robin, dunnock, wren, flycatcher, pied wagtail, starling, and sparrow;\u2014one could go round and put one\u2019s hand into half-a-dozen nests of almost any of these species. And very many of them had become partial to the old buildings: even in closed rooms where it was nearly dark, not only wrens, robins, tits, and wagtails, but blackbirds and throstles and chaffinches were breeding, building on beams and in or on the old nests of swallows and martins. The hawfinch and bullfinch were also there, the last rearing its brood within eight yards of the front door. One of his two nearest neighbours was a gold-crested wren. When the minute bird was sitting on her eggs, in her little cradle-nest suspended to a spray of the yew, every day I would pull the branch down so that we might all enjoy the sight of the little fairy bird in her fairy nest which she refused to quit. The other next-door neighbour of the bullfinch was the long-tailed tit, which built its beautiful little nest on a terminal spray of another yew, ten or twelve yards from the door; and this small creature would also let us pull the branch down and peep into her well-feathered interior.\n\nIt seemed that from long immunity from persecution, all these small birds had quite lost their fear of human beings; but in late May and in June, when many young birds were out of the nest, one had to walk warily in the grass for fear of putting a foot on some little speckled creature patiently waiting to be visited and fed by its parents.\n\nNor were there birds only. Little beasties were also quite abundant; but they were of species that did no harm (at all events there), and the weasel would come from time to time to thin them down. Money is paid to mole-catcher and rat-catcher; the weasel charges you nothing: he takes it out in kind. And even as the jungle tiger, burning bright, and the roaring lion strike with panic the wild cattle and antelopes and herds of swine, so does this miniature carnivore, this fairy tiger of English homesteads and hedges, fill with trepidation the small deer he hunts and slays with his needle teeth\u2014Nature\u2019s scourge sent out among her too prolific small rodents; her little blood-letter who relieves her and restores the balance. And therefore he, too, with his flat serpent head and fiery killing soul, is a \u201cdear\u201d creature, being, like the poet\u2019s web-footed beasts of an earlier epoch, \u201cpart of a general plan.\u201d\n\nThe most abundant of the small furred creatures were the two short-tailed voles\u2014field-vole and bank-vole; the last, in his bright chestnut-red, the prettiest. Whenever I sat down for a few minutes in the porch I would see one or more run across the stones from one side, where masses of periwinkle grew against the house, to the other side, where Virginia creeper, rose, and an old magnolia tree covered the wall. One day at the back of the house by the scullery door I noticed a swaying movement in a tall seeded stem of dock, and looking down spied a wee harvest-mouse running and climbing nimbly on the slender branchlets, feeding daintily on the seed, and looking like a miniature squirrel on a miniature bush.\n\nJust there, close to the door, was a wood-pile, and the hornets had made their nest in it. The year before they had made it in a loft in the house, and before that in the old barn. The splendid insects were coming and going all day, interfering with nobody and nobody interfering with them; and when I put a plate of honey for them on the logs close to their entrance they took no notice of it; but by-and-by bank-voles and wood-mice came stealing out from among the logs and fed on it until it was all gone.\n\nI was surprised, and could only suppose that the hornets did not notice or discover the honey, because no such good thing was looked for so close to their door. Away from home the hornet was quick to discover anything sweet to the taste, and very ready to resent the presence of any other creature at the table.\n\nAt the riverside, a few hundred yards from the house, I was sitting in the shade of a large elm tree one day when I was visited by a big hornet, who swept noisily down and settled on the trunk, four or five feet above the ground. A quantity of sap had oozed out into a deep cleft of the rough bark and had congealed there, and the hornet had discovered it. Before he had been long feeding on it I saw a little bank-vole come out from the roots of the tree and run up the trunk, looking very pretty in his bright chestnut fur as he came into the sunlight. Stealing up to the lower end of the cleft full of thickened sap he too began feeding on it. The hornet, who was at the upper end of the cleft, quite four inches apart from the vole, at once stopped eating and regarded the intruder for some time, then advanced towards him in a threatening attitude. The vole was frightened at this, starting and erecting his hair, and once or twice he tried to recover his courage and resume his feeding, but the hornet still keeping up his hostile movements, he eventually slipped quietly down and hid himself at the roots. When the hornet departed he came out again and went to the sap.\n\nWishing to see more, I spent most of that day and the day following at the spot, and saw hornet and vole meet many times. If the vole was at the sap when the hornet came he was at once driven off, and when the hornet was there first the vole was never allowed to feed, although on every occasion he tried to do so, stealing to his lower place in the gentlest way in order not to give offence, and after beginning to feed affecting not to see that the other had left off eating, and with raised head was regarding him with jealous eyes.\n\nRarely have I looked on a prettier little comedy in wild life.\n\nBut to return to the house. There was quite a happy family at that spot by the back door where the hornets were. A numerous family of shrews were reared, and the young, when they began exploring the world, used to creep over the white stone by the threshold. The girls would pick them up to feel their soft mole-like fur: the young shrew is a gentle creature and does not attempt to bite. Some of the more adventurous ones were always blundering into the empty flower-pots heaped against the wall, and there they would remain imprisoned until some person found and took them out.\n\nOne morning, at half-past four o\u2019clock, when I was lying awake listening to the blackbird, a lively squirrel came dancing into the open window of my bedroom on the first floor. There were writing materials, flowers in glasses, and other objects on the ledge and dressing-table there, and he frisked about among them, chattering, wildly excited at seeing so many curious and pretty things, but he upset nothing; and by-and-by he danced out again into the ivy covering the wall on that side, throwing the colony of breeding sparrows into a great state of consternation.\n\nThe river was quite near the house\u2014not half a minute from the front door, though hidden from sight by the trees on its banks. Here, at the nearest point, there was an old half-dead dwarf oak growing by the water and extending one horizontal branch a distance of twenty feet over the stream. This was the favourite drumming-tree of a green woodpecker, and at intervals through the day he would visit it and drum half-a-dozen times or so. This drumming sounded so loud that, following the valley down, I measured the distance it could be heard and found it just one-third of a mile. At that distance I could hear it distinctly; farther on, not at all. It seemed almost incredible that the sound produced by so small a stick as a woodpecker\u2019s beak striking a tree should be audible at that distance.\nIt is hardly to be doubted that the drumming is used as a love-call, though it is often heard in late summer. It is, however, in early spring and in the breeding season that it is oftenest heard, and I have found that a good imitation of it will sometimes greatly excite the bird. The same bird may be heard drumming here, there, and everywhere in a wood or copse, the sound varying somewhat in character and strength according to the wood; but each bird as a rule has a favourite drumming-tree, and it probably angers him to hear another bird at the spot. On one occasion, finding that a very large, old, and apparently dying cedar in a wood was constantly used by a woodpecker, I went to the spot and imitated the sound. Very soon the bird came and began drumming against me, close by. I responded, and again he drummed; and becoming more and more excited he flew close to me, and passing from tree to tree drummed at every spot he lighted on.\n\nThe other species have the same habit of drumming on one tree. I have noticed it in the small spotted, or banded, woodpecker; and have observed that invariably after he had drummed two or three times the female has come flying to him from some other part of the wood, and the two birds have then both together uttered their loud chirping notes and flown away.\n\nOn revisiting the spot a year after I had heard the green woodpecker drumming every day in the oak by the river, I found that he had forsaken it, and that close by, on the other side of the stream, a great spotted woodpecker had selected as his drumming-tree a very big elm growing on the bank. He drummed on a large dead branch about forty feet from the ground, and the sound he made was quite as loud as that of the green bird. It may be that the two big woodpeckers, who play equally well on the same instrument, are intolerant of one another\u2019s presence, and that in this case the spotted bird had driven the larger yaffle from his territory.\n\nOne of the prettiest spots by the water was that very one where the spotted bird was accustomed to come, and I often went there at noon and sat for an hour on the grassy bank in the shade of the drumming-tree. The river was but thirty to forty feet wide at that spot, with masses of water forget-me-not growing on the opposite bank, clearly reflected in the sherry-coloured sunlit current below. The trees were mostly oaks, in the young vivid green of early June foliage. And one day when the sky, seen through that fresh foliage, was without a stain of vapour in its pure azure, when the wood was full of clear sunlight\u2014so clear that silken spider webs, thirty or forty feet high in the oaks, were visible as shining red and blue and purple lines\u2014the bird, after drumming high above my head, flew to an oak tree just before me, and clinging vertically to the bark on the high part of the trunk, remained there motionless for some time. His statuesque attitude, as he sat with his head thrown well back, the light glinting on his hard polished feathers, black and white and crimson, the setting in which he appeared of greenest translucent leaves and hoary bark and open sunlit space, all together made him seem not only our handsomest woodpecker, but our most beautiful bird. I had seen him at his best, and sitting there motionless amid the wind-fluttered leaves, he was like a bird-figure carved from some beautiful vari-coloured stone.\n\n\nThe most interesting events in animal life observed at this spot relate to the cuckoo in the spring of 1900. Some time before this Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace said, in the course of a talk we had, that he very much wanted me to find out exactly what happened in a nest in which a young cuckoo was hatched. It was, I replied, an old, old story\u2014what could I see, supposing I was lucky enough to find a nest where I could observe it properly, more than Jenner, Hancock, Mrs. Hugh Blackburn, and perhaps other writers, had told us? Yes, it was an old story, he said, and he wanted it told again by some one else. People had lately been discrediting Jenner\u2019s account, and as to the other chief authority I had named, one writer, a Dr. Creighton, had said, \u201cAs for artists like Mrs. Blackburn, they can draw what they please\u2014all out of their own brains: we can\u2019t trust them, or such as them.\u201d Sober-minded naturalists had come to regard the habit and abnormal strength attributed to the newly-hatched cuckoo as \u201cnot proven\u201d or quite incredible; thus Seebohm had said, \u201cOne feels inclined to class these narratives with the equally well-authenticated stories of ghosts and other apparitions which abound.\u201d\n\nSince my conversation with Dr. Wallace we have had more of these strange narratives\u2014the fables and ghost stories which the unbelievers are compelled in the end to accept and all that Dr. Jenner or his assistant saw others have seen, and some observers have even taken snapshots of the young cuckoo in the act of ejecting his fellow-nestling. But it appears from all the accounts which I have so far read, that in every case the observer was impatient and interfered in the business by touching and irritating the young cuckoo, by putting eggs and other objects on his back, and making other experiments. In the instance I am about to give there was no interference by me or by the others who at intervals watched with me.\n\nA robin\u2019s nest with three robin\u2019s eggs and one of the cuckoo was found in a low bank at the side of the small orchard on May 19, 1900. The bird was incubating, and on the afternoon of May 27 the cuckoo hatched out. Unfortunately I did not know how long incubation had been going on before the 19th, but from the fact that the cuckoo was first out, it seems probable that the parasite has this further advantage of coming first from the shell. Long ago I found that this was so in the case of the parasitical troupials of the genus Molothrus in South America.\n\nI kept a close watch on the nest for the rest of that afternoon and the whole of the following day (the 28th), during which the young cuckoo was lying in the bottom of the nest, helpless as a piece of jelly with a little life in it, and with just strength enough in his neck to lift his head and open his mouth; and then, after a second or two, the wavering head would drop again. At eight o\u2019clock next morning (29th), I found that one robin had come out of the shell, and one egg had been ejected and was lying a few inches below the nest on the sloping bank. Yet the young cuckoo still appeared a weak, helpless, jelly-like creature, as on the previous day. But he had increased greatly in size. I believe that in forty-eight hours from the time of hatching he had quite doubled his bulk, and had grown darker, his naked skin being of a bluish-black colour. The robin, thirty or more hours younger, was little more than half his size, and had a pale, pinkish-yellow skin, thinly clothed with a long black down. The cuckoo occupied the middle of the deep, cup-shaped nest, and his broad back, hollow in the middle, formed a sort of false bottom; but there was a small space between the bird\u2019s sides and the nest, and in this space or interstice the one unhatched egg that still remained and the young robin were lying.\n\nDuring this day (29th) I observed that the pressure of the egg and young robin against his sides irritated the cuckoo: he was continually moving, jerking and wriggling his lumpish body this way and that, as if to get away from the contact. At intervals this irritation would reach its culminating point, and a series of mechanical movements would begin, all working blindly but as surely towards the end as if some devilish intelligence animated the seemingly helpless infant parasite.\n\nOf the two objects in the nest the unhatched egg irritated him the most. The young robin was soft, it yielded when pressed, and could be made somehow to fit into the interstice; but the hard, round shell, pressing against him like a pebble, was torture to him, and at intervals became unendurable. Then would come that magical change in him, when he seemed all at once to become possessed of a preternatural power and intelligence, and then the blind struggle down in the nest would begin. And after each struggle\u2014each round it might be called\u2014the cuckoo would fall back again and lie in a state of collapse, as if the mysterious virtue had gone out of him. But in a very short time the pressure on his side would again begin to annoy him, then to torment him, and at last he would be wrought up to a fresh effort. Thus in a space of eight minutes I saw him struggle four separate times, with a period of collapse after each, to get rid of the robin\u2019s egg; and each struggle involved a long series of movements on his part. On each of these occasions the egg was pushed or carried up to the wrong or upper side of the nest, with the result that when the bird jerked the egg from him it rolled back into the bottom of the nest. The statement is therefore erroneous that the cuckoo knows at which side to throw the egg out. Of course he knows nothing, and, as a fact, he tries to throw the egg up as often as down the slope.\n\nThe process in each case was as follows:\u2014The pressure of the egg against the cuckoo\u2019s side, as I have said, was a constant irritation; but the irritability varied in degree in different parts of the body. On the under parts it scarcely existed; its seat was chiefly on the upper surface, beginning at the sides and increasing towards the centre, and was greatest in the hollow of the back. When, in moving, the egg got pushed up to the upper edge of his side, he would begin to fidget more and more, and this would cause it to move round, and so to increase the irritation by touching and pressing against other parts. When all the bird\u2019s efforts to get away from the object had only made matters worse, he would cease wriggling and squat down lower and lower in the bottom of the nest, and the egg, forced up, would finally roll right into the cavity in his back\u2014the most irritable part of all. Whenever this occurred, a sudden change that was like a fit would seize the bird; he would stiffen, rise in the nest, his flabby muscles made rigid, and stand erect, his back in a horizontal position, the head hanging down, the little naked wings held up over the back. In that position he looked an ugly, lumpish negro mannikin, standing on thinnest dwarf legs, his back bent, and elbows stuck up above the hollow flat back.\n\nOnce up on his small stiffened legs he would move backwards, firmly grasping the hairs and hair-like fibres of the nest-lining, and never swerving, until the rim of the cup-like structure was reached; and then standing, with feet sometimes below and in some cases on the rim, he would jerk his body, throwing the egg off or causing it to roll off. After that he would fall back into the nest and lie quite exhausted for some time, his jelly-like body rising and falling with his breathing.\n\nThese changes in the bird strongly reminded me of a person with an epileptic fit, as I had been accustomed to see it on the pampas, where, among the gauchos, epilepsy is one of the commonest maladies;\u2014the sudden rigidity of muscle in some weak, sickly, flabby-looking person, the powerful grip of the hand, the strength in struggling, exceeding that of a man in perfect health, and finally, when this state is over, the weakness of complete exhaustion.\nI witnessed several struggles with the egg, but at last, in spite of my watchfulness, I did not see it ejected. On returning after a very short absence, I found the egg had been thrown out and had rolled down the bank, a distance of fourteen inches from the nest.\n\nThe young cuckoo appeared to rest more quietly in the nest now, but after a couple of hours the old fidgeting began again, and increased until he was in the same restless state as before. The rapid growth of the birds made the position more and more miserable for the cuckoo, since the robin, thrust against the side of the nest, would throw his head and neck across the cuckoo\u2019s back, and he could not endure being touched there. And now a fresh succession of struggles began, the whole process being just the same as when the egg was struggled with. But it was not so easy with the young bird, not because of its greater weight, but because it did not roll like the egg and settle in the middle of the back; it would fall partly on to the cuckoo\u2019s back and then slip off into the nest again. But success came at last, after many failures. The robin was lying partly across the cuckoo\u2019s neck, when, in moving its head, its little curved beak came down and rested on the very centre of that irritable hollow in the back of its foster-brother. Instantly the cuckoo pressed down into the nest, shrinking away as if hot needles had pricked him, as far as possible from the side where the robin was lying against him, and this movement of course brought the robin more and more over him, until he was thrown right upon the cuckoo\u2019s back.\n\nInstantly the rigid fit came on, and up rose the cuckoo, as if the robin weighed no more than a feather on him; and away backwards he went, right up the nest, without a pause, and standing actually on the rim, jerked his body, causing the robin to fall off, clean away from the nest. It fell, in fact, on to a large dock leaf five inches below the rim of the nest, and rested there.\n\nAfter getting rid of his burden the cuckoo continued in the same position, perfectly rigid, for a space of five or six seconds, during which it again and again violently jerked its body, as if it had the feeling of the burden on it still. Then, the fit over, it fell back, exhausted as usual.\n\nI had been singularly fortunate in witnessing the last scene and conclusion of this little bloodless tragedy in a bird\u2019s nest, with callow nestlings for dramatis personae, this innocent crime and wrong, which is not a wrong since the cuckoo doesn\u2019t think it one. It is a little curious to reflect that a similar act takes place annually in tens of thousands of small birds\u2019 nests all over the country, and that it is so rarely witnessed.\n\nMarvellous as the power of the young cuckoo is when the fit is on him, it is of course limited, and when watching his actions I concluded that it would be impossible for him to eject eggs and nestlings from any thrush\u2019s nest. The blackbird\u2019s would be too deep, and as to the throstle\u2019s, he could not move backwards up the sides of the cup-like cavity on account of the smooth plastered surface.\n\nAfter having seen the young robin cast out I still refrained from touching the nest, as there were yet other things to observe. One was the presence, very close to the nest, of the ejected nestling what would the parents do in the case? Before dealing with that matter I shall conclude the history of the young cuckoo.\n\nHaving got the nest to himself he rested very quietly, and it was not till the following day (July 1st) that I allowed myself to touch him. He was, I found, still irritable, and when I put back the eggs he had thrown out he was again miserable in the nest, and the struggle with the eggs was renewed until he got rid of them as before. The next day the irritability had almost gone, and in the afternoon he suffered an egg or a pebble to remain in the nest with him without jerking and wriggling about, and he made no further attempt to eject it. This observation\u2014the loss of irritability on the fifth day after hatching\u2014agrees with that of Mr. Craig, whose account was printed in the Feathered World, July 14, 1899.\n\nThe young cuckoo grew rapidly and soon trod his nest into a broad platform, on which he reposed, a conspicuous object in the scanty herbage on the bank. We often visited and fed him, when he would puff up his plumage and strike savagely at our hands, but at the same time he would always gobble down the food we offered. In seventeen days after being hatched he left the nest and took up his position in an oak tree growing on the bank, and there the robins continued feeding him for the next three days, after which we saw no more of him.\n\nI may add that in May 1901 a pair of robins built on the bank close to where the nest had been made the previous year, and that in this nest a cuckoo was also reared. The bird, when first seen, was apparently about four or five days old, and it had the nest to itself. Three ejected robin\u2019s eggs were lying on the bank a little lower down.\n\nIt is hardly to be doubted that the robins were the same birds that had reared the cuckoo in the previous season; and it is highly probable that the same cuckoo had returned to place her egg in their nest.\n\nThe end of the little history\u2014the fate of the ejected nestling and the attitude of the parent robins\u2014remains to be told. When the young cuckoo throws out the nestlings from nests in trees, hedges, bushes, and reeds, the victims, as a rule, fall some distance to the ground, or in the water, and are no more seen by the old birds. Here the young robin, when ejected, fell a distance of but five or six inches, and rested on a broad, bright green leaf, where it was an exceedingly conspicuous object; and when the mother robin was on the nest\u2014and at this stage she was on it a greater part of the time\u2014warming that black-skinned, toad-like, spurious babe of hers, her bright, intelligent eyes were looking full at the other one, just beneath her, which she had grown in her body and had hatched with her warmth, and was her very own. I watched her for hours; watched her when warming the cuckoo, when she left the nest and when she returned with food, and warmed it again, and never once did she pay the least attention to the outcast lying there so close to her. There, on its green leaf, it remained, growing colder by degrees, hour by hour, motionless, except when it lifted its head as if to receive food, then dropped it again, and when, at intervals, it twitched its body as if trying to move. During the evening even these slight motions ceased, though that feeblest flame of life was not yet extinguished; but in the morning it was dead and cold and stiff; and just above it, her bright eyes on it, the mother robin sat on the nest as before, warming her cuckoo.\n\nHow amazing and almost incredible it seems that a being such as a robin, intelligent above most birds as we are apt to think, should prove in this instance to be a mere automaton! The case would, I think, have been different if the ejected one had made a sound, since there is nothing which more excites the parent bird, or which is more instantly responded to, than the cry of hunger or distress of the young. But at this early stage the nestling is voiceless\u2014another point in favour of the parasite. The sight of its young, we see, slowly and dumbly dying, touches no chord in the parent: there is, in fact, no recognition; once out of the nest it is no more than a coloured leaf, or a bird-shaped pebble, or fragment of clay.\n\nIt happened that my young fellow-watchers, seeing that the ejected robin if left there would inevitably perish, proposed to take it in to feed and rear it\u2014to save it, as they said; but I advised them not to attempt such a thing, but rather to spare the bird. To spare it the misery they would inflict on it by attempting to fill its parents\u2019 place. They had, so far, never kept a caged bird, nor a pet bird, and had no desire to keep one; all they desired to do in this case was to save the little outcast from death\u2014to rear it till it was able to fly away and take care of itself. That was a difficult, a well-nigh impossible task. The bird, at this early stage, required to be fed at short intervals for about sixteen hours each day on a peculiar kind of food, suited to its delicate stomach\u2014chiefly small caterpillars found in the herbage; and it also needed a sufficient amount by day and night of that animal warmth which only the parent bird could properly supply. They, not being robins, would give it unsuitable food, feed it at improper times, and not keep it at the right temperature, with the almost certain result that after lingering a few days it would die in their hands. But if by giving a great deal of time and much care they should succeed in rearing it, their foundling would start his independent life so handicapped, weakened in constitution by an indoor artificial bringing up, without the training which all young birds receive from their parents after quitting the nest, that it would be impossible for him to save himself. If by chance he should survive until August, he would then be set upon and killed by one of the adult robins already in possession of the ground. Now, when a bird at maturity perishes, it suffers in dying sometimes very acutely; but if left to grow cold and fade out of life at this stage it can hardly be said to suffer. It is no more conscious than a chick in the shell; take from it the warmth that keeps it in being, and it drops back into nothingness without knowing and, we may say, without feeling anything. There may indeed be an incipient consciousness in that small, soft brain in its early vegetative stage, a first faint glimmer of a bright light to be, and a slight sensation of numbness may be actually felt as the body grows cold, but that would be all.\n\nPain is so common in the world; and, owing to the softness and sensitiveness induced in us by an indoor artificial life since that softness of our bodies reacts on our minds we have come to a false or an exaggerated idea of its importance, its painfulness, to put it that way; and we should therefore be but making matters worse, or rather making ourselves more miserable, by looking for and finding it where it does not exist.\n\nThe power to feel pain in any great degree comes into the bird\u2019s life after this transitional period, and is greatest at maturity, when consciousness and all the mental faculties are fully developed, particularly the passion of fear, which plays continually on the strings of the wild creature\u2019s heart with an ever varying touch, producing the feeling in all degrees from the slight disquiet, which is no sooner come than gone, to extremities of agonising terror. It would perhaps have a wholesome effect on their young minds, and save them from grieving overmuch at the death of a newly-hatched robin, if they would consider this fact of the pain that is and must be. Not the whole subject\u2014the fact that as things are designed in this world of sentient life there can be no good, no sweetness or pleasure in life, nor peace and contentment and safety, nor happiness and joy, nor any beauty or strength or lustre, nor any bright and shining quality of body or mind, without pain, which is not an accident nor an incident, nor something ancillary to life, but is involved in and a part of life, of its very colour and texture. That would be too long to speak about; all I meant was to consider that small part of the fact, the necessary pain to and destruction of the bird life around them and in the country generally.\n\nHere, for instance, without going farther than a hundred yards from the house in any direction, they could put their hands in nests in trees and bushes, and on the ground, and in the ivy, and in the old outhouses, and handle and count about one hundred and thirty young birds not yet able to fly. Probably more than twice that number would be successfully reared during the season. How many, then, would be reared in the whole parish! How many in the entire New Forest district, in the whole county of Hampshire, in the entire kingdom! Yet when summer came round again they would find no more birds than they had now. And so it would be in all places; all that incalculable increase would have perished. Many millions would be devoured by rapacious birds and beasts; millions more would perish of hunger and cold; millions of migrants would fall by the way, some in the sea and some on land; those that returned from distant regions would be but a remnant, and the residents that survived through the winter, these, too, would be nothing but a remnant. It is not only that this inconceivable amount of bird life must be destroyed each year, but we cannot suppose that death is not a painful process. In a vast majority of cases, whether the bird slowly perishes of hunger and weakness, or is pursued and captured by birds and beasts of prey, or is driven by cold adverse winds and storms into the waves, the pain, the agony must be great. The least painful death is undoubtedly that of the bird that, weakened by want of sustenance, dies by night of cold in severe weather. It is indeed most like the death of the nestling, but a few hours out of the shell, which has been thrown out of the nest, and which soon grows cold, and dozes its feeble, unconscious life away.\n\nWe may say, then, that of all the thousand forms of death which Nature has invented to keep her too rapidly multiplying creatures within bounds, that which is brought about by the singular instinct of the young cuckoo in the nest is the most merciful or the least painful.\n\nI am not sure that I said all this, or marshalled fact and argument in the precise order in which they are here set down. I fancy not, as it seems more than could well have been spoken while we were standing there in the late evening sunlight by that primrose bank, looking down on the little flesh-coloured mite in its scant clothing of black down, fading out of life on its cold green leaf. But what was said did not fail of its effect, so that my young tender-hearted hearers, who had begun to listen with moist eyes, secretly accusing me perhaps of want of feeling, were content in the end to let it be\u2014to go away and leave it to its fate in that mysterious green world we, too, live in and do not understand, in which life and death and pleasure and pain are inter-woven light and shade.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1526150", "artist_names": "Helen Reddy", "full_title": "Crazy Love by\u00a0Helen\u00a0Reddy", "header_image_thumbnail_url":

no\n\n[Hook]\nTell me why is it so\nThat I never can say goodbye\nI never can say goodbye\n[Verse 2]\nEvery time I think I've had enough and start heading for the door\nThere's a very strange vibration piercing me right to the core\nIt says, \"Turn around you fool, you know you love her more and more\"\n\n[Hook]\nTell me why is it so\nI don't wanna let you go\nI can't say goodbye\nI never say goodbye\n(I never can say goodbye)\n(No matter how hard I try)\n\nI never can say goodbye\nI never can say goodbye\n\n[Verse 3]\nI keep thinkin' that our problems soon are gonna work all out\nBut there's that same unhappy feeling that makes that anguish twist that doubt\nIt's the same old dizzy hang up, can't do with you all the time\n\n[Hook]\nTell me why is it so\nI don't wanna let you go\nI

anymore\nShaking hands I pack a bag, trembling voice I call a cab\nSlowly I start walking to the door\nThe cab arrives he blows his horn, I stumble at in the early morn\nTell him of the place I've got to go\nPassed a hundred signal lights, paid the bills and a traffic fine\nGettin' through these doors that's been so slow\nLA International Airport where the big jet engines roar\nLA International Airport I won't see him anymore\nThe stewardess in a miniskirt, a hippie in a leather shirt\nI started on the way to Naples Row\nWhile I'm wondering where it's at, I see a Paris diplomat\nCall his kids while trying to get back home\nBaggage car goes quickly by, I see my case and start to cry\nStumble to the lounge to be alone\nAnd while I'm trying to get some rest, I bite my lips and try my best\nTo fight the pain that's making me leave home\nLA International Airport...\n\nWith silver wings across the sky paper trails and wave goodbye\nTo those below who've got to stay at home\nI wish that I had flown at night so I could take that champagne flight\nRid myself of every tear I own\nSoaring high above the heavens in a 747 fighting back the tears that curse my eyes\nCaptain's voice so loud and clear amplifies into my ear\nAssuring me I'm flying friendly skies\nLA International Airport...You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

the rest of my minor life to go to boarding school in Alabama, my mother insisted on throwing me a going-away party. To say that I had low expectations would be to underestimate the matter dramatically.\n\nAlthough I was more or less forced to invite all my \u201cschool friends\u201d, i.e. the ragtag bunch of drama people and English geeks I sat with by social necessity in the cavernous cafeteria of my public school, I knew they wouldn\u2019t come.\n\nStill, my mother persevered, awash in the delusion that I had kept my popularity secret from her all these years. She cooked a small mountain of artichoke dip. She festooned our living room in green and yellow streamers, the colours of my new school. She bought two dozen champagne poppers and placed them around the edge of our coffee table.\n\nAnd when that final Friday came, when my packing was mostly done, she sat with my dad and me on the living-room couch at 4.56 p.m. and patiently awaited the arrival of the Goodbye to Miles cavalry. Said cavalry consisted of exactly two people: Marie Lawson, a tiny blonde with rectangular glasses, and her chunky (to put it charitably) boyfriend Will.\nHey, Miles,\u201d Marie said as she sat down.\n\nHey,\u201d I said.\n\nHow was your summer?\u201d Will asked.\n\nOK. Yours?\u201d\n\nGood. We did Jesus Christ Superstar. I helped with the sets. Marie did lights,\u201d said Will.\n\nThat\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nI nodded knowingly, and that about exhausted our conversational topics. I might have asked a question about Jesus Christ Superstar, except (1) I didn\u2019t know what it was and (2) I didn\u2019t care to learn, and (3) I never really excelled at small talk.\n\nMy mom, however, can talk small for hours, and so she extended the awkwardness by asking them about their rehearsal schedule, and how the show had gone, and whether it was a success.\n\nI guess it was,\u201d Marie said. \u201cA lot of people came, I guess.\u201d Marie was the sort of person to guess a lot.\n\nFinally, Will said, \u201cWell, we just dropped by to say goodbye. I\u2019ve got to get Marie home by six. Have fun at boarding school, Miles.\u201d\n\nThanks,\u201d I answered, relieved. The only thing worse than having a party that no one attends is having a party attended only by two vastly, deeply uninteresting people.\n\nThey left, and so I sat with my parents and stared at the blank TV and wanted to turn it on, but knew I shouldn\u2019t. I could feel them both looking at me, waiting for me to burst into tears or something, as if I hadn\u2019t known all along that it would go precisely like this.\n\nBut I had known. I could feel their pity as they scooped artichoke dip with chips intended for my imaginary friends, but they needed pity more than I did: I wasn\u2019t disappointed. My expectations had been met.\nIs this why you want to leave, Miles?\u201d Mom asked.\n\nI mulled it over for a moment, careful not to look at her. \u201cUh, no,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell, why then?\u201d she asked. This was not the first time she had posed the question. Mom was not particularly keen on letting me go to boarding school and had made no secret of it.\n\nBecause of me?\u201d my dad asked. He had attended Culver Creek, the same boarding school to which I was headed, as had both of his brothers and all of their kids. I think he liked the idea of me following in his footsteps.\n\nMy uncles had told me stories about how famous my dad had been on campus for having simultaneously raised hell and aced all his classes. That sounded like a better life than the one I had in Florida. But no, it wasn\u2019t because of Dad. Not exactly.\n\nHold on,\u201d I said. I went into Dad\u2019s study and found his biography of Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais. I liked reading biographies of writers, even if (as was the case with Monsieur Rabelais) I\u2019d never read any of their actual writing. I flipped to the back and found the highlighted quote (\u201cNEVER USE A HIGHLIGHTER IN MY BOOKS,\u201d my dad had told me a thousand times.\n\nBut how else are you supposed to find what you\u2019re looking for?).\n\nSo this guy,\u201d I said, standing in the doorway of the living room, \u201cFran\u00e7ois Rabelais. He was this poet. And his last words were, \u2018I go to seek a Great Perhaps.\u2019 That\u2019s why I\u2019m going. So I don\u2019t have to wait until I die to start seeking a Great Perhaps.\u201d\n\nAnd that quieted them. I was after a Great Perhaps, and they knew as well as I did that I wasn\u2019t going to find it with the likes of Will and Marie.\n\nI sat back down on the couch, between my mom and my dad, and my dad put his arm around me and we stayed there like that, quiet on the couch together, for a long time, until it seemed OK to turn on the TV, and then we ate artichoke dip for dinner and watched the History Channel and as going-away parties go, it certainly could have been worse.\n\nOne Hundred and Twenty-eight Days Before\n\nFlorida was plenty hot, certainly, and humid too. Hot enough that your clothes stuck to you like Scotch tape, and sweat dripped like tears from your forehead into your eyes. But it was only hot outside, and generally I only went outside to walk from one air-conditioned location to another.\n\nThis did not prepare me for the unique sort of heat that one encounters fifteen miles south of Birmingham, Alabama, at Culver Creek Preparatory School.\nMy parents\u2019 SUV was parked in the grass just a few feet outside my dorm room, Room 43. But each time I took those few steps to and from the car to unload what now seemed like far too much stuff, the sun burnt through my clothes and into my skin with a vicious ferocity that made me genuinely fear hellfire.\n\nBetween Mom and Dad and me, it only took a few minutes to unload the car, but my un-air-conditioned dorm room, although blessedly out of the sunshine, was only modestly cooler. The room surprised me: I\u2019d pictured plush carpet, wood-panelled walls, Victorian furniture.\n\nAside from one luxury \u2013 a private bathroom \u2013 I got a box. With cinderblock walls coated thick with layers of white paint and a green-and-white chequered linoleum floor, the place looked more like a hospital than the dorm room of my fantasies.\n\nA bunk bed of unfinished wood with vinyl mattresses was pushed against the room\u2019s back window. The desks and dressers and bookshelves were all attached to the walls in order to prevent creative floor planning.\n\nAnd no air-conditioning.\n\nI sat on the lower bunk while Mom opened the trunk, grabbed a stack of the biographies my dad had agreed to part with and placed them on the bookshelves.\n\nI can unpack, Mom,\u201d I said. My dad stood. He was ready to go.\n\nLet me at least make your bed,\u201d Mom said.\n\nNo, really. I can do it.\n\nIt\u2019s OK.\u201d Because you simply cannot draw these things out for ever. At some point, you just pull off the Band-Aid and it hurts, but then it\u2019s over and you\u2019re relieved.\n\nGod, we\u2019ll miss you,\u201d Mom said suddenly, stepping through the minefield of suitcases to get to the bed. I stood and hugged her. My dad walked over too, and we formed a sort of huddle.\n\nIt was too hot, and we were too sweaty, for the hug to last terribly long. I knew I ought to cry, but I\u2019d lived with my parents for sixteen years and a trial separation seemed overdue.\n\nDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019s a-gonna learn how t\u2019talk right Southern.\u201d Mom laughed.\n\nDon\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d my dad said.\n\nOK.\u201d\n\nNo drugs. No drinking. No cigarettes.\u201d As an alumnus of Culver Creek, he had done the things I had only heard about: the secret parties, streaking through hayfields (he always whined about how it was all boys back then), drugs, drinking and cigarettes. It had taken him a while to kick smoking, but his bad-ass days were now well behind him.\n\nI love you,\u201d they both blurted out simultaneously. It needed to be said, but the words made the whole thing horribly uncomfortable, like watching your grandparents kiss.\n\nI love you too. I\u2019ll call every Sunday.\u201d Our rooms had no phone lines, but my parents had requested I be placed in a room near one of Culver Creek\u2019s five payphones.\n\nThey hugged me again \u2013 Mom, then Dad \u2013 and it was over. Out the back window, I watched them drive the winding road off campus. I should have felt a gooey, sentimental sadness perhaps.\n\nBut mostly I just wanted to cool off, so I grabbed one of the desk chairs and sat down outside my door in the shade of the overhanging eaves, waiting for a breeze that never arrived.\n\nThe air outside sat as still and oppressive as the air inside. I stared out over my new digs: six one-storey buildings, each with sixteen dorm rooms, were arranged in a hexagram around a large circle of grass. It looked like an oversized old motel.\n\nEverywhere, boys and girls hugged and smiled and walked together. I vaguely hoped that someone would come up and talk to me. I imagined the conversation:\n\nHey. Is this your first year?\u201d\n\nYeah. Yeah. I\u2019m from Florida.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s cool. So you\u2019re used to the heat.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be used to this heat if I were from Hades,\u201d I\u2019d joke. I\u2019d make a good first impression.\n\nOh, he\u2019s funny. That guy Miles is a riot.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen, of course. Things never happened like I imagined them.\n\nBored, I went back inside, took off my shirt, lay down on the heat-soaked vinyl of the lower bunk mattress and closed my eyes. I\u2019d never been born again with the baptism and weeping and all that, but it couldn\u2019t feel much better than being born again as a guy with no known past.\n\nI thought of the people I\u2019d read about \u2013 John F Kennedy, James Joyce, Humphrey Bogart \u2013 who went to boarding school, and their adventures; Kennedy, for example, loved pranks. I thought of the Great Perhaps and the things that might happen and the people I might meet and who my roommate might be (I\u2019d gotten a letter a few weeks before that gave me his name, Chip Martin, but no other information).\n\nWhoever Chip Martin was, I hoped to God he would bring an arsenal of high-powered fans, because I hadn\u2019t packed even one and I could already feel my sweat pooling on the vinyl mattress, which disgusted me so much that I stopped thinking and got off my ass to find a towel to wipe up the sweat with. And then I thought, Well, before the adventure comes the unpacking\n\nI managed to tape a map of the world to the wall and get most of my clothes into drawers before I noticed that the hot, moist air made even the walls sweat, and I decided that now was not the time for manual labour.\n\nNow was the time for a magnificently cold shower.\n\nThe small bathroom contained a huge, full-length mirror behind the door and so I could not escape the reflection of my naked self as I leaned in to turn on the shower faucet.\n\nMy skinniness always surprised me: my thin arms didn\u2019t seem to get much bigger as they moved from wrist to shoulder, my chest lacked any hint of either fat or muscle, and I felt embarrassed and wondered if something could be done about the mirror. I pulled open the plain white shower curtain and ducked into the stall.\n\nUnfortunately, the shower seemed to have been designed for someone approximately three feet, seven inches tall, so the cold water hit my lower ribcage \u2013 with all the force of a dripping faucet. To wet my sweat-soaked face, I had to spread my legs and squat significantly.\n\nSurely, John F Kennedy (who was six feet tall according to his biography, my height exactly) did not have to squat at his boarding school.\n\nNo, this was a different beast entirely, and as the dribbling shower slowly soaked my body, I wondered whether I could find a Great Perhaps here at all or whether I had made a grand miscalculation.\n\nWhen I opened the bathroom door after my shower, a towel wrapped around my waist, I saw a short, muscular guy with a shock of brown hair. He was hauling a gigantic army-green duffel bag through the door of my room. He stood five feet and nothing, but was well-built, like a scale model of Adonis, and with him arrived the stink of stale cigarette smoke.\n\nGreat, I thought. I\u2019m meeting my roommate naked. He heaved the duffel into the room, closed the door and walked over to me.\n\nI\u2019m Chip Martin,\u201d he announced in a deep voice, the voice of a radio DJ. Before I could respond, he added, \u201cI\u2019d shake your hand, but I think you should hold on damn tight to that towel till you can get some clothes on.\u201d\n\nI laughed and nodded my head at him (that\u2019s cool, right? the nod?) and said, \u201cI\u2019m Miles Halter. Nice to meet you.\u201d\n\nMiles as in \u2018to go before I sleep\u2019?\u201d he asked me.\n\nHuh?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a Robert Frost poem. You\u2019ve never read him?\u201d\n\nI shook my head no.\n\nConsider yourself lucky.\u201d He smiled.\n\nI grabbed some clean underwear, a pair of blue Adidas soccer shorts and a white T-shirt, mumbled that I\u2019d be back in a second and ducked back into the bathroom. So much for a good first impression.\n\nSo where are your parents?\u201d I asked from the bathroom.\n\nMy parents? The father\u2019s in California right now. Maybe sitting in his La-Z-Boy. Maybe driving his truck. Either way, he\u2019s drinking. My mother is probably just now turning off campus.\u201d\n\nOh,\u201d I said, dressed now, not sure how to respond to such personal information. I shouldn\u2019t have asked, I guess, if I didn\u2019t want to know.\n\nChip grabbed some sheets and tossed them on to the top bunk. \u201cI\u2019m a top bunk man. Hope that doesn\u2019t bother you.\u201d\n\nUh, no. Whatever is fine.\u201d\n\nI see you\u2019ve decorated the place,\u201d he said, gesturing towards the world map. \u201cI like it.\u201d\n\nAnd then he started naming countries. He spoke in a monotone, as if he\u2019d done it a thousand times before.\n\nAfghanistan.\n\nAlbania.\n\nAlgeria.\n\nAmerican Samoa.\n\nAndorra.\n\nAnd so on. He got through the A\u2019s before looking up and noticing my incredulous stare.\n\nI could do the rest, but it\u2019d probably bore you.\n\nSomething I learned over the summer.\n\nGod, you can\u2019t imagine how boring New Hope, Alabama, is in the summertime. Like watching soybeans grow. Where are you from, by the way?\u201d\n\nFlorida,\u201d I said.\n\nNever been.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pretty amazing, the countries thing,\u201d I said.\n\nYeah, everybody\u2019s got a talent. I can memorise things. And you can \u2026?\u201d\n\nUm, I know a lot of people\u2019s last words.\u201d It was an indulgence, learning last words. Other people had chocolate; I had dying declarations.\n\nExample?\u201d\n\nI like Henrik Ibsen\u2019s. He was a playwright.\u201d I knew a lot about Ibsen, but I\u2019d never read any of his plays. I didn\u2019t like reading plays. I liked reading biographies.\n\nYeah, I know who he was,\u201d said Chip.\n\nRight, well, he\u2019d been sick for a while and his nurse said to him, \u2018You seem to be feeling better this morning,\u2019 and Ibsen looked at her and said, \u2018On the contrary,\u2019 and then he died.\u201d\n\nChip laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s morbid. But I like it.\u201d\n\nHe told me he was in his third year at Culver Creek. He had started in ninth grade, the first year at the school, and was now a junior like me.\n\nA scholarship kid, he said. Got a full ride. He\u2019d heard it was the best school in Alabama, so he wrote his application essay about how he wanted to go to a school where he could read long books.\n\nThe problem, he said in the essay, was that his dad would always hit him with the books in his house, so Chip kept his books short and paperback for his own safety. His parents got divorced his sophomore year.\n\nHe liked \u201cthe Creek\u201d, as he called it, but, \u201cYou have to be careful here, with students and with teachers. And I do hate being careful,\u201d he smirked. I hated being careful too \u2013 or wanted to, at least.\n\nHe told me this while ripping through his duffel bag, throwing clothes into drawers with reckless abandon. Chip did not believe in having a sock drawer or a T-shirt drawer. He believed that all drawers were created equal and filled each with whatever fit. My mother would have died.\n\nAs soon as he finished \u201cunpacking\u201d, Chip hit me roughly on the shoulder, said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re stronger than you look,\u201d and walked out the door, leaving it open behind him. He peeked his head back in a few seconds later and saw me standing still. \u201cWell, come on, Miles To Go Halter. We got shit to do.\u201d\n\nWe made out way to the TV room, which according to Chip contained the only cable TV on campus. Over the summer, it served as a storage unit.\n\nPacked nearly to the ceiling with couches, fridges and rolled-up carpets, the TV room undulated with kids trying to find and haul away their stuff. Chip said hello to a few people, but didn\u2019t introduce me.\n\n\nAs he wandered through the couch-stocked maze, I stood near the door, trying my best not to block pairs of roommates as they manoeuvred furniture through the narrow front door.\n\nIt took ten minutes for Chip to find his stuff, and an hour more for us to make four trips back and forth across the dorm circle between the TV room and Room 43. By the end, I wanted to crawl into Chip\u2019s minifridge and sleep for a thousand years, but Chip seemed immune to both fatigue and heatstroke. I sat down on his couch.\n\nI found it lying on a curb in my neighbourhood a couple of years ago,\u201d he said of the couch as he worked on setting up my PlayStation 2 on top of his footlocker. \u201cI know the leather\u2019s got some cracks, but come on. That\u2019s a damn nice couch.\u201d The leather had more than a few cracks \u2013 it was about 30 per cent baby-blue faux leather and 70 per cent foam \u2013 but it felt damn good to me anyway.\n\nAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re about done.\u201d He walked over to his desk and pulled a roll of duct tape from a drawer. \u201cWe just need your trunk.\u201d\n\nI got up, pulled the trunk out from under the bed, and Chip situated it between the couch and the PlayStation 2 and started tearing off thin strips of duct tape. He applied them to the trunk so that they spelled out COFFEE TABLE.\n\nThere,\u201d he said. He sat down and put his feet up on the, uh, coffee table.\n\nDone.\u201d\n\nI sat down next to him, and he looked over at me and suddenly said, \u201cListen. I\u2019m not going to be your entr\u00e9e to Culver Creek social life.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, OK,\u201d I said, but I could hear the words catch in my throat. I\u2019d just carried this guy\u2019s couch beneath a white-hot sun and now he doesn\u2019t like me?\n\nBasically, you\u2019ve got two groups here,\u201d he explained, speaking with increasing urgency.\n\nYou\u2019ve got the regular boarders, like me, and then you\u2019ve got the Weekday Warriors; they board here, but they\u2019re all rich kids who live in Birmingham and go home to their parents\u2019 air-conditioned mansions every weekend.\n\nThose are the cool kids. I don\u2019t like them and they don\u2019t like me, and so if you came here thinking that you were hot shit at public school so you\u2019ll be hot shit here, you\u2019d best not be seen with me. You did go to public school didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nUh\u2026\u201d I said. Absentmindedly, I began picking at the cracks in the couch\u2019s leather, digging my fingers into the foamy whiteness.\n\nRight, you did probably, because if you had gone to a private school your freakin\u2019 shorts would fit.\u201d He laughed.\n\nI wore my shorts just below my hips, which I thought was cool. Finally, I said, \u201cYeah, I went to public school. But I wasn\u2019t hot shit there, Chip. I was regular shit.\u201d\n\nHa! That\u2019s good. And don\u2019t call me Chip. Call me the Colonel.\u201d\n\nI stifled a laugh.\n\n\u201cThe Colonel?\u201d\n\nYeah. The Colonel.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll call you \u2026hmm. Pudge.\u201d\n\nHuh?\u201d\n\nPudge,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re skinny. It\u2019s called irony, Pudge. Heard of it? Now, let\u2019s go get some cigarettes and start this year off right.\u201d\n\nHe walked out of the room, again just assuming I\u2019d follow, and this time I did. Mercifully, the sun was descending towards the horizon. We walked five doors down to Room 48. A dry-erase board was taped to the door using duct tape. In blue marker, it read, Alaska has a single!\n\nThe Colonel explained to me that (1) this was Alaska\u2019s room, and that (2) she had a single room because the girl who was supposed to be her roommate got kicked out at the end of the last year, and that (3) Alaska had cigarettes, although the Colonel neglected to ask whether (4) I smoked, which (5) I didn\u2019t.\n\nHe knocked once, loudly. Through the door, a voice screamed, \u201cOh my God, come in you short little man because I have the best story.\u201d\n\nAnd we walked in. I turned to close the door behind me, and the Colonel shook his head and said, \u201cAfter seven, you have to leave the door open if you\u2019re in a girl\u2019s room,\u201d but I barely heard him because the hottest girl in all of human history was standing before me in cut-off jeans and a peach tank top. And she was talking over the Colonel, talking loud and fast.\n\nSo first day of summer, I\u2019m in grand old Vine Station with this boy named Justin and we\u2019re at his house watching TV on the couch \u2013 and mind you, I\u2019m already dating Jake \u2013 actually I\u2019m still dating him, miraculously enough, but Justin is a friend of mine from when\n\nI was a kid and so we\u2019re watching TV and literally chatting about the SATs or something, and Justin puts his arm around me and I think, Oh, that\u2019s nice, we\u2019ve been friends for so long and this is totally comfortable, and we\u2019re just chatting and then I\u2019m in the middle of a sentence about analogies or something and like a hawk he reaches down and he honks my boob.\n\nHONK.\n\nA much-too-firm, two\u2013 to three-second HONK. And the first thing I thought was, OK, how do I extricate this claw from my boob before it leaves permanent marks? and the second thing I thought was God, I can\u2019t wait to tell Takumi and the Colonel.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel laughed. I stared, stunned partly by the force of the voice emanating from the petite (but, God, curvy) girl and partly by the gigantic stacks of books that lined her walls. Her library filled her bookshelves and then overflowed into waist-high stacks of books everywhere, piled haphazardly against the walls.\n\nIf just one of them moved, I thought, the domino effect could engulf the three of us in an asphyxiating mass of literature.\n\nWho\u2019s the guy that\u2019s not laughing at my very funny story?\u201d she asked.\n\nOh, right. Alaska, this is Pudge. Pudge memorises people\u2019s last words. Pudge, this is Alaska. She got her boob honked over the summer.\u201d She walked over to me with her hand extended, then made a quick move downwards at the last moment and pulled down my shorts.\n\nThose are the biggest shorts in the state of Alabama!\u201d\n\nI like them baggy,\u201d I said, embarrassed, and pulled them up. They had been cool back home in Florida.\n\nSo far in our relationship, Pudge, I\u2019ve seen your chicken legs entirely too often,\u201d the Colonel deadpanned.\n\nSo, Alaska. Sell us some cigarettes.\u201d\n\nAnd then somehow, the Colonel talked me into paying five dollars for a pack of Marlboro Lights I had no intention of ever smoking.\n\n\nHe asked Alaska to join us, but she said, \u201cI have to find Takumi and tell him about The Honk.\u201d She turned to me and asked, \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d I had no idea whether I\u2019d seen Takumi, since I had no idea who he was. I just shook my head.\n\nAll right. Meet ya at the lake in a few minutes then.\u201d The Colonel nodded.\n\nAt the edge of the lake, just before the sandy (and, the Colonel told me, fake) beach, we sat down in an Adirondack swing. I made the obligatory joke: \u201cDon\u2019t grab my boob.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel gave an obligatory laugh, then asked, \u201cWant a smoke?\u201d I had never smoked a cigarette, but when in Rome \u2026\n\nIs it safe here?\u201d\n\nNot really,\u201d he said, then lit a cigarette and handed it to me. I inhaled. Coughed. Wheezed. Gasped for breath. Coughed again. Considered vomiting. Grabbed the swinging bench, head spinning, and threw the cigarette to the ground and stomped on it, convinced my Great Perhaps did not involve cigarettes.\n\nSmoke much?\u201d He laughed, then pointed to a white speck across the lake and said, \u201cSee that?\u201d\n\nYeah,\u201d I said.\n\nWhat is that? A bird?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the swan,\u201d he said.\n\nWow. A school with a swan. Wow.\u201d\n\nThat swan is the spawn of Satan. Never get closer to it than we are now.\u201d\n\nWhy?\u201d\n\nIt has some issues with people. It was abused or something. It\u2019ll rip you to pieces. The Eagle put it there to keep us from walking around the lake to smoke.\u201d\n\nThe Eagle?\u201d\n\nMr Starnes. Code name: the Eagle. The Dean of Students. Most of the teachers live on campus and they\u2019ll all bust you. But only the Eagle lives in the dorm circle and he sees all. He can smell a cigarette from like five miles.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t his house back there?\u201d I asked, pointing to it. I could see the house quite clearly despite the darkness, so it followed he could probably see us.\n\nYeah, but he doesn\u2019t really go into blitzkrieg mode until classes start,\u201d Chip said nonchalantly.\n\nGod, if I get in trouble my parents will kill me,\u201d I said.\n\nI suspect you\u2019re exaggerating. But look, you\u2019re going to get in trouble. Ninety-nine per cent of the time your parents never have to know though. The school doesn\u2019t want your parents to think you became a fuck-up here any more than you want your parents to think you\u2019re a fuck-up.\u201d He blew a thin stream of smoke forcefully towards the lake. I had to admit: he looked cool doing it. Taller, somehow.\n\nAnyway, when you get in trouble, just don\u2019t tell on anyone. I mean, I hate the rich snots here with a fervent passion I usually reserve only for dental work and my father. But that doesn\u2019t mean I would rat them out. Pretty much the only important thing is never never never never rat.\u201d\n\nOK,\u201d I said, although I wondered: if someone punches me in the face, I\u2019m supposed to insist that I ran into a door? It seemed a little stupid.\n\nHow do you deal with bullies and assholes if you can\u2019t get them into trouble? I didn\u2019t ask Chip though.\n\nAll right, Pudge. We have reached the point in the evening when I\u2019m obliged to go and find my girlfriend. So give me a few of those cigarettes you\u2019ll never smoke anyway and I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\nI decided to hang out on the swing for a while, half because the heat had finally dissipated into a pleasant, if muggy, eighty-something, and half because I thought Alaska might show up. But almost as soon as the Colonel left, the bugs encroached: no-see-ums (which, for the record, you can see) and mosquitoes hovered around me in such numbers that the tiny noise of their rubbing wings sounded cacophonous. And then I decided to smoke.\n\nNow, I did think, The smoke will drive the bugs away. And, to some degree, it did. I\u2019d be lying though if I claimed I became a smoker to ward off insects.\n\nI became a smoker because (1) I was on an Adirondack swing by myself, and (2) I had cigarettes, and (3) I figured that if everyone else could smoke a cigarette without coughing, I could damn well too. In short, I didn\u2019t have a very good reason. So yeah, let\u2019s just say that (4) it was the bugs.\n\nI made it through three entire drags before I felt nauseous and dizzy and only semi-pleasantly buzzed. I got up to leave. As I stood, a voice behind me said:\n\nSo, do you really memorise last words?\u201d\n\nShe ran up beside me and grabbed my shoulder and pushed me back on to the porch swing.\n\nYeah,\u201d I said. And then hesitantly, I added, \u201cYou want to quiz me?\u201d\n\nJFK,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s obvious,\u201d I answered.\n\nOh, is it now?\u201d she asked.\n\nNo. Those were his last words.\n\nSomeone said, \u2018Mr President, you sure can\u2019t say Dallas doesn\u2019t love you,\u2019 and then he said, \u2018That\u2019s obvious,\u2019 and then he got shot.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cGod, that\u2019s awful. I shouldn\u2019t laugh. But I will,\u201d and then she laughed again.\n\nOK, Mr Famous Last Words Boy. I have one for you.\u201d She reached into her overstuffed backpack and pulled out a book.\n\nGabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\n\nThe General in His Labyrinth.\n\nAbsolutely one of my favourites. It\u2019s about Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar.\u201d I didn\u2019t know who Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was, but she didn\u2019t give me time to ask. \u201cIt\u2019s a historical novel, so I don\u2019t know if this is true, but in the book, do you know what his last words are?\n\nNo, you don\u2019t. But I am about to tell you, Se\u00f1or Parting Remarks.\u201d\n\nAnd then she lit a cigarette and sucked on it so hard for so long that I thought the entire thing might burn off in one drag. She exhaled and read to me:\n\nHe \u2013 that\u2019s Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar \u2013 was shaken by the overwhelming revelation that the headlong race between his misfortunes and his dreams was at that moment reaching the finish line. The rest was darkness. \u2018Damn it,\u2019 he sighed. \u2018How will I ever get out of this labyrinth?\u2019\u201d\n\nI knew great last words when I heard them, and I made a mental note to get ahold of a biography of this Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar fellow. Beautiful last words, but I didn\u2019t quite understand.\n\nSo what\u2019s the labyrinth?\u201d I asked her.\n\nAnd now is as good a time as any to say that she was beautiful. In the dark beside me, she smelled of sweat and sunshine and vanilla, and on that thin-mooned night I could see little more than her silhouette except for when she smoked, when the burning cherry of the cigarette washed her face in pale red light. But even in the dark, I could see her eyes \u2013 fierce emeralds. She had the kind of eyes that predisposed you to supporting her every endeavour.\n\nAnd not just beautiful, but hot too, with her breasts straining against her tight tank top, her curved legs swinging back and forth beneath the swing, flip-flops dangling from her electric-blue-painted toes.\n\nIt was right then, between when I asked about the labyrinth and when she answered me, that I realised the importance of curves, of the thousand times where girls\u2019 bodies ease from one place to another, from arc of the foot to ankle to calf, from calf to hip to waist to breast to neck to ski-slope nose to forehead to shoulder to the concave arch of the back to the butt to the etc.\n\nI\u2019d noticed curves before, of course, but I had never quite apprehended their significance.\n\nHer mouth close enough to me that I could feel her breath warmer than the air, she said,\n\nThat\u2019s the mystery, isn\u2019t it? Is the labyrinth living or dying? Which is he trying to escape \u2013 the world or the end of it?\u201d I waited for her to keep talking, but after a while it became obvious she wanted an answer.\n\nUh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said finally. \u201cHave you really read all those books in your room?\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cOh God, no. I\u2019ve maybe read a third of \u2019em. But I\u2019m going to read them all. I call it my Life\u2019s Library. Every summer since I was little, I\u2019ve gone to garage sales and bought all the books that looked interesting. So I always have something to read. But there is so much to do: cigarettes to smoke, sex to have, swings to swing on. I\u2019ll have more time for reading when I\u2019m old and boring.\u201d\n\nShe told me that I reminded her of the Colonel when he came to Culver Creek. They were freshmen together, she said, both scholarship kids with, as she put it, \u201ca shared interest in booze and mischief\u201d. The phrase booze and mischief left me worrying I\u2019d stumbled into what my mother referred to as \u201cthe wrong crowd\u201d, but for the wrong crowd, they both seemed awfully smart.\n\nAs she lit a new cigarette off the butt of her previous one, she told me that the Colonel was smart but hadn\u2019t done much living when he got to the Creek.\n\nI got rid of that problem quickly.\u201d She smiled.\n\nBy November, I\u2019d gotten him his first girlfriend, a perfectly nice non-Weekday Warrior named Janice. He dumped her after a month because she was too rich for his poverty-soaked blood, but whatever.\n\nWe pulled our first prank that year \u2013 we filled Classroom 4 with a thin layer of marbles. We\u2019ve progressed some since then, of course.\u201d She laughed. So Chip became the Colonel \u2013 the military-style planner of their pranks \u2013 and Alaska was ever Alaska, the larger-than-life creative force behind them.\n\nYou\u2019re smart like him,\u201d she said. \u201cQuieter, though. And cuter, but I didn\u2019t even just say that, because I love my boyfriend.\u201d\n\nYeah, you\u2019re not bad either,\u201d I said, overwhelmed by her compliment, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t just say that, because I love my girlfriend. Oh, wait. Right. I don\u2019t have one.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry, Pudge. If there\u2019s one thing I can get you, it\u2019s a girlfriend. Let\u2019s make a deal: you figure out what the labyrinth is and how to get out of it, and I\u2019ll get you laid.\u201d\n\nDeal.\u201d We shook on it.\n\nLater, I walked towards the dorm circle beside Alaska. The cicadas hummed their one-note song, just as they had at home in Florida. She turned to me as we made our way through the darkness and said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re walking at night, do you ever get creeped out and even though it\u2019s silly and embarrassing you just want to run home?\u201d\n\nIt seemed too secret and personal to admit to a virtual stranger, but I told her, \u201cYeah, totally.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, she was quiet. Then she grabbed my hand, whispered, \u201cRun run run run run,\u201d and took off, pulling me behind her.\n\nOne Hundred and Twenty-seven Days Before\n\nEarly the next afternoon, I blinked sweat from my eyes as I taped a Van Gogh poster to the back of the door. The Colonel sat on the couch judging whether the poster was level and fielding my endless questions about Alaska.\n\nWhat\u2019s her story? \u201cShe\u2019s from Vine Station. You could drive past it without noticing \u2013 and from what I understand, you ought to. Her boyfriend\u2019s at Vanderbilt on scholarship. Plays bass in some band. Don\u2019t know much about her family.\u201d\n\nSo she really likes him? \u201cI guess. She hasn\u2019t cheated on him, which is a first.\u201d And so on. All morning, I\u2019d been unable to care about anything else, not the Van Gogh poster and not video games and not even my class schedule, which the Eagle had brought by that morning. He introduced himself too:\n\nWelcome to Culver Creek, Mr Halter. You\u2019re given a large measure of freedom here. If you abuse it, you\u2019ll regret it. You seem like a nice young man. I\u2019d hate to have to bid you farewell.\u201d\n\nAnd then he stared at me in a manner that was either serious or seriously malicious. \u201cAlaska calls that the Look of Doom,\u201d the Colonel told me after the Eagle left. \u201cThe next time you see that, you\u2019re busted.\u201d\n\nOK, Pudge,\u201d the Colonel said as I stepped away from the poster. Not entirely level, but close enough.\n\nEnough with the Alaska already.\n\nBy my count, there are ninety-two girls at this school and every last one of them is less crazy than Alaska, who, I might add, already has a boyfriend. I\u2019m going to lunch. It\u2019s bufriedo day.\u201d\n\nHe walked out, leaving the door open. Feeling like an over-infatuated idiot, I got up to close the door. The Colonel, already halfway across the dorm circle, turned around.\n\nChrist. Are you coming or what?\u201d\n\nYou can say a lot of bad things about Alabama, but you can\u2019t say that Alabamans as a people are unduly afraid of deep fryers. In that first week at the Creek, the cafeteria served fried chicken, chicken-fried steak and fried okra, which marked my first foray into the delicacy that is the fried vegetable. I half expected them to fry the iceberg lettuce. But nothing matched the bufriedo, a dish created by Maureen, the amazingly (and understandably) obese Culver Creek cook.\n\nA deep-fried bean burrito, the bufriedo proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that frying always improves a food. Sitting with the Colonel and five guys I didn\u2019t know at a circular table in the cafeteria that afternoon, I sank my teeth into the crunchy shell of my first bufriedo and experienced a culinary orgasm. My mom cooked OK, but I immediately wanted to bring Maureen home with me over Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Colonel introduced me (as \u201cPudge\u201d) to the guys at the wobbly wooden table, but I only registered the name Takumi, whom Alaska had mentioned yesterday. A thin Japanese guy only a few inches taller than the Colonel, Takumi talked with his mouth full as I chewed slowly, savouring the beany crunch.\n\nGod,\u201d Takumi said to me, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing like watching a man eat his first bufriedo.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t say much \u2013 partly because no one asked me any questions and partly because I just wanted to eat as much as I could. But Takumi felt no such modesty \u2013 he could, and did, eat and chew and swallow while talking.\n\nThe lunch discussion centred on the girl who was supposed to have been Alaska\u2019s roommate, Marya, and her boyfriend, Paul, who had been a Weekday Warrior.\n\nThey\u2019d gotten kicked out in the last week of the previous school year, I learned, for what the Colonel called \u201cthe Trifecta\u201d \u2013 they were caught committing three of Culver Creek\u2019s expellable offences at once. Lying naked in bed together (\u201cgenital contact\u201d being offence number one), already drunk (number two), they were smoking a joint (number three) when the Eagle burst in on them. Rumours had it that someone had ratted them out, and Takumi seemed intent on finding out who \u2013 intent enough, anyway, to shout about it with his mouth jampacked with bufriedo.\n\nPaul was an asshole,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have ratted on them, but anyone who shacks up with a Jaguar-driving Weekday Warrior like Paul deserves what she gets.\u201d\n\nDude,\u201d Takumi responded, \u201cyaw guhfwend,\u201d and then he swallowed a bite of food, \u201cis a Weekday Warrior.\u201d\n\nTrue.\u201d The Colonel laughed. \u201cMuch to my chagrin, that is an incontestable fact. But she is not as big an asshole as Paul.\u201d\n\nNot quite.\u201d Takumi smirked. The Colonel laughed, and I wondered why he wouldn\u2019t stand up for his girlfriend. I wouldn\u2019t have cared if my girlfriend was a Jaguar-driving Cyclops with a beard \u2013 I\u2019d have been grateful just to have someone to make out with.\n\nThat evening, when the Colonel dropped by Room 43 to pick up the cigarettes (he seemed to have forgotten that they were, technically, mine), I didn\u2019t really care when he didn\u2019t invite me out with him.\n\nIn public school, I\u2019d known plenty of people who made it a habit to hate this kind of person or that kind \u2013 the geeks hated the preps, etc \u2013 and it always seemed like a big waste of time to me. The Colonel didn\u2019t tell me where he\u2019d spent the afternoon, or where he was going to spend the evening, but he closed the door behind him when he left, so I guessed I wasn\u2019t welcome.\n\nJust as well: I spent the night surfing the web (no porn, I swear) and reading The Final Days, a book about Richard Nixon and Watergate. For dinner, I microwaved a refrigerated bufriedo the Colonel had snuck out of the cafeteria.\n\nIt reminded me of nights in Florida \u2013 except with better food and no air-conditioning. Lying in bed and reading felt pleasantly familiar.\n\nI decided to heed what I\u2019m sure would have been my mother\u2019s advice and get a good night\u2019s sleep before my first day of classes. French II started at 8.10, and figuring it couldn\u2019t take more than eight minutes to put on some clothes and walk to the classrooms, I set my alarm for 8.02. I took a shower and then lay in bed waiting for sleep to save me from the heat.\n\nAround 11.00, I realised that the tiny fan clipped to my bunk might make more of a difference if I took off my shirt, and I finally fell asleep on top of the sheets wearing just boxers.\n\nA decision I found myself regretting some hours later when I awoke to two sweaty, meaty hands shaking the holy hell out of me.\n\nI woke up completely and instantly, sitting up straight in bed, terrified, and I couldn\u2019t understand the voices for some reason, couldn\u2019t understand why there were any voices at all, and what the hell time was it anyway?\n\nAnd finally my head cleared enough to hear, \u201cC\u2019mon, kid. Don\u2019t make us kick your ass.\n\nJust get up,\u201d and then from the top bunk, I heard, \u201cChrist, Pudge. Just get up.\u201d So I got up and saw for the first time three shadowy figures. Two of them grabbed me, one with a hand on each of my upper arms, and walked me out of the room. On the way out, the Colonel mumbled, \u201cHave a good time.\n\nGo easy on him, Kevin.\u201d\n\nThey led me, almost at a jog, behind my dorm building and then across the soccer field. The ground was grassy but gravelly too, and I wondered why no one had shown the common courtesy to tell me to put on shoes, and why was I out there in my underwear, chicken legs exposed to the world?\n\nA thousand humiliations crossed my mind: There\u2019s the new junior, Miles Halter, handcuffed to the soccer goal wearing only his boxers. I imagined them taking me into the woods, where we now seemed headed, and beating the shit out of me so that I looked great for my first day of school.\n\nAnd the whole time, I just stared at my feet because I didn\u2019t want to look at them and I didn\u2019t want to fall, so I watched my steps, trying to avoid the bigger rocks. I felt the fight-or-flight reflex swell up in me over and over again, but I knew that neither fight nor flight had ever worked for me before.\n\nThey took me a roundabout way to the fake beach, and then I knew what would happen \u2013 a good, old-fashioned dunking in the lake \u2013 and I calmed down. I could handle that.\n\nWhen we reached the beach, they told me to put my arms at my side and the beefiest guy grabbed two rolls of duct tape from the sand. With my arms flat against my sides like a soldier at attention, they mummified me from my shoulder to my wrists.\n\nThen they threw me down on the ground; the sand from the fake beach cushioned the landing, but I still hit my head. Two of them pulled my legs together, while the other one \u2013 Kevin, I\u2019d figured out \u2013 put his angular, strong-jawed face up so close to mine that the gel-soaked spikes of hair pointing out from his forehead poked at my face, and told me, \u201cThis is for the Colonel.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t hang out with that asshole.\u201d They taped my legs together, from ankles to thighs. I looked like a silver mummy. I said, \u201cPlease, guys, don\u2019t,\u201d just before they taped my mouth shut. Then they picked me up and hurled me into the water.\n\nSinking.\n\nSinking, but instead of feeling panic or anything else, it occurred to me that \u201cPlease, guys, don\u2019t\u201d were terrible last words.\n\nBut then the great miracle of the human species \u2013 our buoyancy \u2013 came through, and as I felt myself floating towards the surface, I twisted and turned as best I could so that the warm night air hit my nose first, and I breathed. I wasn\u2019t dead and wasn\u2019t going to die.\n\nWell, I thought, that wasn\u2019t so bad.\n\nBut there was still the small matter of getting to shore before the sun rose. First, to determine my position vis-\u00e0-vis the shoreline. If I tilted my head too much, I felt my whole body start to roll, and on the long list of unpleasant ways to die, \u201cface-down in soaking-wet white boxers\u201d is pretty high up there.\n\nSo instead I rolled my eyes and craned my neck back, my eyes almost underwater, until I saw that the shore \u2013 not ten feet away \u2013 was directly behind my head. I began to swim, an armless silver mermaid, using only my hips to generate motion, until finally my ass scraped against the lake\u2019s mucky bottom. I turned then and used my hips and waist to roll three times, until I came ashore near a ratty green towel. They\u2019d left me a towel. How thoughtful.\n\nThe water had seeped under the duct tape and loosened the adhesive\u2019s grip on my skin, but the tape was wrapped around me three layers deep in places, which necessitated wiggling like a fish out of water. Finally, it loosened enough for me to slip my left hand up and out against my chest and rip the tape off.\n\nI wrapped myself in the sandy towel. I didn\u2019t want to go back to my room and see Chip because I had no idea what Kevin had meant \u2013 maybe if I went back to the room, they\u2019d be waiting for me and they\u2019d get me for real; maybe I needed to show them,\n\nOK. Got your message. He\u2019s just my roommate, not my friend.\u201d And anyway, I didn\u2019t feel terribly friendly towards the Colonel.\n\nHave a good time, he\u2019d said. Yeah, I thought. I had a ball.\n\nSo I went to Alaska\u2019s room. I didn\u2019t know what time it was, but I could see a faint light underneath her door. I knocked softly.\n\nYeah,\u201d she said, and I came in, wet and sandy and only wearing a towel and soaking boxers. This was not, obviously, how you want the world\u2019s hottest girl to see you, but I figured she could explain to me what had just happened.\n\nShe put down a book and got out of bed with a sheet wrapped around her shoulders. For a moment, she looked concerned. She looked like the girl I met yesterday, the girl who said I was cute and bubbled over with energy and silliness and intelligence. And then she laughed.\n\nGuess you went for a swim, huh?\u201d And she said it with such casual malice that I felt that everyone had known, and I wondered why the whole damn school agreed in advance to possibly drown Miles Halter.\n\nBut Alaska liked the Colonel, and in the confusion of the moment, I just looked at her blankly, unsure even of what to ask.\n\nGive me a break,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on. You know what? There are people with real problems I\u2019ve got real problems. Mommy ain\u2019t here, so buck up, big guy.\u201d\n\nI left without saying a word to her and went to my room, slamming the door behind me, waking the Colonel and stomping into the bathroom. I got in the shower to wash the algae and the lake off me, but the ridiculous faucet of a showerhead failed spectacularly, and how could Alaska and Kevin and those other guys already dislike me?\n\nAfter I finished the shower, I dried off and went into the room to find some clothes.\n\nSo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat took you so long? Get lost on your way home?\u201d\n\nThey said it was because of you\u201d I said, and my voice betrayed a hint of annoyance. \u201cThey said I shouldn\u2019t hang out with you.\u201d\n\nWhat? No, it happens to everybody,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cIt happened to me. They throw you in the lake. You swim out. You walk home.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t just swim out,\u201d I said softly, pulling on a pair of jean shorts beneath my towel. \u201cThey duct-taped me. I couldn\u2019t even move really.\u201d\n\nWait. Wait,\u201d he said, and hopped out of his bunk, staring at me through the darkness.\n\nThey taped you? How?\u201d And I showed him: I stood like a mummy, with my feet together and my hands at my sides, and showed him how they\u2019d wrapped me up. And then I plopped down on to the couch.\n\nChrist! You could have drowned! They\u2019re just supposed to throw you in the water in your underwear and run!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat the hell were they thinking? Who was it? Kevin Richman and who else? Do you remember their faces?\u201d\n\nYeah, I think.\u201d\n\nWhy the hell would they do that?\u201d he wondered.\n\nDid you do something to them?\u201d I asked.\n\nNo, but I\u2019m sure as shit gonna do something to \u2019em now. We\u2019ll get them.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a big deal. I got out fine.\u201d\n\nYou could have died.\u201d\n\nAnd I could have, I suppose. But I didn\u2019t.\n\nWell, maybe I should just go to the Eagle tomorrow and tell him,\u201d I said.\n\nAbsolutely not,\u201d he answered. He walked over to his crumpled shorts lying on the floor and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. He lit two and handed one to me. I smoked the whole goddamned thing.\n\nYou\u2019re not,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause that\u2019s not how shit gets dealt with here. And besides, you really don\u2019t want to get a reputation for ratting. But we will deal with those bastards, Pudge. I promise you. They will regret messing with one of my friends.\u201d\n\nAnd if the Colonel thought that calling me his friend would make me stand by him, well, he was right. \u201cAlaska was kind of mean to me tonight,\u201d I said. I leaned over, opened an empty desk drawer and used it as a makeshift ashtray.\n\nLike I said, she\u2019s moody.\u201d\n\nI went to bed wearing a T-shirt, shorts and socks. No matter how miserably hot it got, I resolved, I would sleep in my clothes every night at the Creek, feeling \u2013 probably for the first time in my life \u2013 the fear and excitement of living in a place where you never know what\u2019s going to happen or when.\n\nOne Hundred and Twenty-six Days Before\n\nWell, now it\u2019s war,\u201d the Colonel shouted the next morning. I rolled over and looked at the clock: 7.52. My first Culver Creek class, French, started in eighteen minutes. I blinked a couple of times and looked up at the Colonel, who was standing between the couch and the COFFEE TABLE, holding his well-worn, once-white tennis shoes by the laces.\n\nFor a long time, he stared at me and I stared at him. And then, almost in slow motion, a grin crept across the Colonel\u2019s face.\n\nI\u2019ve got to hand it to them,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThat was pretty clever.\u201d\n\nWhat?\u201d I asked.\n\nLast night \u2013 before they woke you up, I guess \u2013 they pissed in my shoes.\u201d\n\nAre you sure?\u201d I said, trying not to laugh.\n\nDo you care to smell?\u201d he asked, holding the shoes towards me. \u201cBecause I went ahead and smelled them, and yes, I am sure. If there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s when I\u2019ve just stepped in another man\u2019s piss. It\u2019s like my mom always says: \u2018Ya think you\u2019s a walkin\u2019 on water, but turns out you just got piss in your shoes.\u2019\n\nPoint those guys out to me if you see them today,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause we need to figure out why they\u2019re so, uh, pissed at me. And then we need to go ahead and start thinking about how we\u2019re going to ruin their miserable little lives.\u201d\n\nWhen I received the Culver Creek Handbook over the summer and noticed happily that the \u201cDress Code\u201d section contained only two words, casual modesty, it never occurred to me that girls would show up for class half asleep in cotton pyjama shorts, T-shirts and flip-flops. Modest, I guess, and casual.\n\nAnd there was something about girls wearing pyjamas (even if modest) which might have made French at 8.10 in the morning bearable, if I\u2019d had any idea what Madame O\u2019Malley was talking about.\n\nComment dis-tu \u201cOh my God, I don\u2019t know nearly enough French to pass French II\u201d en fran\u00e7ais? My French I class back in Florida did not prepare me for Madame O\u2019Malley, who skipped the \u201chow was your summer\u201d pleasantries and dived directly into something called the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, which is apparently a verb tense.\n\nAlaska sat directly across from me in the circle of desks, but she didn\u2019t look at me once the entire class, even though I could notice little but her.\n\nMaybe she could be mean \u2026 but the way she talked that first night about getting out of the labyrinth \u2013 so smart. And the way her mouth curled up on the right side all the time, like she was preparing to smirk, like she\u2019d mastered the right half of the Mona Lisa\u2019s inimitable smile \u2026\n\nFrom my room, the student population seemed manageable, but it overwhelmed me in the classroom area, which was a single, long building just beyond the dorm circle. The building was split into fourteen rooms facing out towards the lake.\n\nKids crammed the narrow sidewalks in front of the classrooms, and even though finding my classes wasn\u2019t hard (even with my poor sense of direction, I could get from French in Room 3 to precalc in Room 12), I felt unsettled all day. I didn\u2019t know anyone and couldn\u2019t even figure out whom I should be trying to know, and the classes were hard, even on the first day.\n\nMy dad had told me I\u2019d have to study and now I believed him. The teachers were serious and smart and a lot of them went by \u201cDr\u201d and so when the  time came for my last class before lunch, World Religions, I felt tremendous relief.\n\nA vestige from when Culver Creek was a Christian boys\u2019 school, I figured the World Religions class, required of every junior and senior, might be an easy A.\n\nIt was my only class all day where the desks weren\u2019t arranged either in a square or a circle, so, not wanting to seem eager, I sat down in the third row at 11.03. I was seven minutes early, partly because I liked to be punctual, and partly because I didn\u2019t have anyone to chat with out in the halls. Shortly thereafter, the Colonel came in with Takumi and they sat down on opposite sides of me.\n\nI heard about last night,\u201d Takumi said. \u201cAlaska\u2019s pissed.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s weird, since she was such a bitch last night,\u201d I blurted out.\n\nTakumi just shook his head. \u201cYeah, well, she didn\u2019t know the whole story. And people are moody, dude. You gotta get used to living with people. You could have worse friends than\u2014\u201d\n\nThe Colonel cut him off. \u201cEnough with the psychobabble, MC Dr Phil. Let\u2019s talk counter-insurgency.\u201d People were starting to file into class, so the Colonel leaned in towards me and whispered, \u201cIf any of \u2019em are in this class, let me know, OK? Just, here, just put X\u2019s where they\u2019re sitting,\u201d and he ripped a sheet of paper out of his notebook and drew a square for each desk.\n\nAs people filed in, I saw one of them \u2013 the tall one with immaculately spiky hair \u2013 Kevin. Kevin stared down the Colonel as he walked past, but in trying to stare, he forgot to watch his step and bumped his thigh against a desk. The Colonel laughed. One of the other guys, the one who was either a little fat or worked out too much, came in behind Kevin, sporting pleated khaki pants and a short sleeve black polo shirt.\n\nAs they sat down, I crossed through the appropriate squares on the Colonel\u2019s diagram and handed it to him. Just then, the Old Man shuffled in.\n\nHe breathed slowly and with great labour through his wide-open mouth. He took tiny steps towards the lectern, his heels not moving much past his toes.\n\nThe Colonel nudged me and pointed casually to his notebook, which read, The Old Man only has one lung, and I did not doubt it. His audible, almost desperate breaths reminded me of my grandfather when he was dying of lung cancer. Barrel-chested and ancient, the Old Man, it seemed to me, might die before he ever reached the podium.\n\nMy name,\u201d he said, \u201cis Dr Hyde. I have a first name, of course. So far as you are concerned, it is Doctor.\n\nYour parents pay a great deal of money so that you can attend school here, and I expect that you will offer them some return on their investment by reading what I tell you to read when I tell you to read it and consistently attending this class. And when you are here, you will listen to what I say.\u201d Clearly not an easy A.\n\nThis year, we\u2019ll be studying three religious traditions: Islam, Christianity and Buddhism. We\u2019ll tackle three more traditions next year. And in my classes, I will talk most of the time and you will listen most of the time, because you may be smart.\n\nBut I\u2019ve been smart longer. I\u2019m sure some of you do not like lecture classes, but as you have probably noted, I\u2019m not as young as I used to be.\n\nI would love to spend my remaining breath chatting with you about the finer points of Islamic history, but our time together is short. I must talk and you must listen, for we are engaged here in the most important pursuit in history: the search for meaning.\n\nWhat is the nature of being a person?\n\nWhat is the best way to go about being a person? How did we come to be, and what will become of us when we are no longer? In short: what are the rules of this game and how might we best play it?\u201d\n\nThe nature of the labyrinth, I scribbled into my spiral notebook, and the way out of it. This teacher rocked. I hated discussion classes. I hated talking, and I hated listening to everyone else stumble on their words and try to phrase things in the vaguest possible way so they wouldn\u2019t sound dumb, and I hated how it was all just a game of trying to figure out what the teacher wanted to hear and then saying it. I\u2019m in class, so teach me.\n\nAnd teach me he did: in those fifty minutes, the Old Man made me take religion seriously. I\u2019d never been religious, but he told us that religion is important whether or not we believed in one, in the same way that historical events are important whether or not you personally lived through them. And then he assigned us fifty pages of reading for the next day \u2013 from a book called Religious Studies.\n\nThat afternoon, I had two classes and two free periods. We had nine fifty-minute class periods each day, which means that most everyone had three \u201cstudy periods\u201d (except for the Colonel, who had an extra independent-study math class on account of being an Extra Special Genius).\n\nThe Colonel and I had biology together, where I pointed out the other guy who\u2019d duct-taped me the night before.\n\nIn the top corner of his notebook, the Colonel wrote, Longwell Chase. Senior W-day Warrior. Friends w/Sara. Weird. It took me a minute to remember who Sara was: the Colonel\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nI spent my free periods in my room trying to read about religion. I learned that myth doesn\u2019t mean a lie; it means a traditional story that tells you something about people and their worldview and what they hold sacred. Interesting. I also learned that after the events of the previous night, I was far too tired to care about myths or anything else, so I slept on top of the covers for most of the afternoon, until I awoke to Alaska singing,\n\nWAKE UP, LITTLE PUHHHHHDGIE!\u201d directly into my left ear canal. I held the religion book close up against my chest like a small paperback security blanket.\n\nThat was terrible,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do I need to do to ensure that never happens to me again?\u201d\n\nNothing you can do!\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m unpredictable. God, don\u2019t you hate Dr Hyde? Don\u2019t you? He\u2019s so condescending.\u201d\n\nI sat up and said, \u201cI think he\u2019s a genius,\u201d partly because I thought it was true and partly because I just felt like disagreeing with her.\n\nShe sat down on the bed. \u201cDo you always sleep in your clothes?\u201d\n\nYup.\u201d\n\nFunny,\u201d she said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t wearing much last night.\u201d I just glared at her.\n\nC\u2019mon, Pudge. I\u2019m teasing. You have to be tough here. I didn\u2019t know how bad it was \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry and they\u2019ll regret it \u2013 but you have to be tough.\u201d And then she left. That was all she had to say on the subject. She\u2019s cute, I thought, but you don\u2019t need to like a girl who treats you like you\u2019re ten: you\u2019ve already got a mom.\n\nOne Hundred and Twenty-two Days Before\n\nAfter my last class of my first week at Culver Creek, I entered Room 43 to an unlikely sight: the diminutive and shirtless Colonel, hunched over an ironing board, attacking a pink button-down shirt.\n\nSweat trickled down his forehead and chest as he ironed with great enthusiasm, his right arm pushing the iron across the length of the shirt with such vigour that his breathing nearly mirrored Dr Hyde\u2019s.\n\nI have a date,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is an emergency.\u201d He paused to catch his breath. \u201cDo you know \u2026\u201d breath \u201c\u2026 how to iron?\u201d\n\nI walked over to the pink shirt. It was wrinkled like an old woman who spent her youth sunbathing. If only the Colonel didn\u2019t ball up his every belonging and stuff it into random drawers. \u201cI think you just turn it on and press it against the shirt, right?\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t even know we had an iron.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t. It\u2019s Takumi\u2019s. But Takumi doesn\u2019t know how to iron either.\n\nAnd when I asked Alaska, she started yelling, \u2018You\u2019re not going to impose the patriarchal paradigm on me.\u2019 Oh, God, I need to smoke. I need to smoke but I can\u2019t reek when I see Sara\u2019s parents.\n\nOK, screw it. We\u2019re going to smoke in the bathroom with the shower on. The shower has steam. Steam gets rid of wrinkles, right?\u201d\n\nBy the way,\u201d he said as I followed him into the bathroom, \u201cIf you want to smoke inside during the day, just turn on the shower. The smoke follows the steam up the vents.\u201d\n\nThough this made no scientific sense, it seemed to work. The shower\u2019s shortage of water pressure and low showerhead made it all but useless for showering, but it worked great as a smoke screen.\n\nSadly, it made a poor iron. The Colonel tried ironing the shirt once more (\u201cI\u2019m just gonna push really hard and see if that helps\u201d) and finally put it on wrinkled. He matched the shirt with a blue tie decorated with horizontal lines of little pink flamingos.\n\nThe one thing my lousy father taught me,\u201d the Colonel said as his hands nimbly threaded the tie into a perfect knot, \u201cwas how to tie a tie. Which is odd, since I can\u2019t imagine when he ever had to wear one.\u201d\n\nJust then, Sara knocked on the door. I\u2019d seen her once or twice before, but the Colonel never introduced me to her and didn\u2019t have a chance to that night.\n\nOh. My. God. Can\u2019t you at least press your shirt?\u201d she asked, even though the Colonel was standing in front of the ironing board.\n\nWe\u2019re going out with my parents.\u201d Sara looked awfully nice in her blue summer dress. Her long, pale blonde hair was pulled up into a twist, with a strand of hair falling down each side of her face. She looked like a movie star \u2013 a bitchy one.\n\nLook, I did my best. We don\u2019t all have maids to do our ironing.\u201d\n\nChip, that chip on your shoulder makes you look even shorter.\u201d\n\nChrist, can\u2019t we get out the door without fighting?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just saying. It\u2019s the opera. It\u2019s a big deal to my parents. Whatever. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I felt like leaving, but it seemed stupid to hide in the bathroom, and Sara was standing in the doorway, one hand cocked on her hip and the other fiddling with her car keys.\n\nI could wear a tuxedo and your parents would still hate me!\u201d he shouted.\n\nThat\u2019s not my fault! You antagonise them!\u201d She held up the car keys in front of him. \u201cLook, we\u2019re going now or we\u2019re not going.\u201d\n\nFuck it. I\u2019m not going anywhere with you,\u201d the Colonel said.\n\nFine. Have a great night,\u201d Sara slammed the door so hard that a sizeable biography of Leo Tolstoy (last words: \u201cThe truth is \u2026 I care a great deal \u2026 what they \u2026\u201d) fell off my bookshelf and landed with a thud on our chequered floor like an echo of the slamming door.\n\nAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d he screamed.\n\nSo that\u2019s Sara,\u201d I said.\n\nYes.\u201d\n\nShe seems nice.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel laughed, knelt down next to the minifridge and pulled out a gallon of milk. He opened it, took a swig, winced, half-coughed and sat down on the couch with the milk between his legs.\n\nIs it sour or something?\u201d\n\nOh, I should have mentioned that earlier. This isn\u2019t milk. It\u2019s five parts milk and one part vodka. I call it ambrosia. Drink of the gods. You can barely smell the vodka in the milk, so the Eagle can\u2019t catch me unless he actually takes a sip.\n\nThe downside is that it tastes like sour milk and rubbing alcohol, but it\u2019s Friday night, Pudge, and my girlfriend is a bitch. Want some?\u201d\n\nI think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d Aside from a few sips of champagne on New Year\u2019s under the watchful eye of my parents, I\u2019d never really drunk any alcohol, and \u201cambrosia\u201d didn\u2019t seem like the drink with which to start.\n\nOutside, I heard the payphone ring. Given the fact that 190 boarders share five payphones, I was amazed how infrequently it rang. We weren\u2019t supposed to have cell phones, but I\u2019d noticed that some of the Weekday Warriors carried them surreptitiously. And most non-Warriors called their parents, as I did, on a regular basis, so parents only called when their kids forgot.\n\nAre you going to get that?\u201d the Colonel asked me. I didn\u2019t feel like being bossed around by him, but I also didn\u2019t feel like fighting.\n\nThrough a buggy twilight, I walked to the payphone, which was drilled into the wall between Rooms 44 and 45. On both sides of the phone, dozens of phone numbers and esoteric notes were written in pen and marker (205.555.1584; Tommy to airport 4:20; 773.573.6521; JG \u2013 Kuffs?). Calling the payphone required a great deal of patience. I picked up on about the ninth ring.\n\nCan you get Chip for me?\u201d Sara asked. It sounded like she was on a cell phone.\n\nYeah, hold on.\u201d\n\nI turned and he was already behind me, as if he knew it would be her. I handed him the receiver and walked back to the room.\n\nA minute later, three words made their way to our room through the thick, still air of Alabama at almost-night. \u201cScrew you too!\u201d the Colonel shouted.\n\nBack in the room, he sat down with his ambrosia and told me, \u201cShe says I ratted out Paul and Marya. That\u2019s what the Warriors are saying. That I ratted them out. Me. That\u2019s why the piss in the shoes. That\u2019s why the nearly killing you. \u2019Cause you live with me and they say I\u2019m a rat.\u201d\n\nI tried to remember who Paul and Marya were. The names were familiar, but I\u2019d heard so many names in the last week, and I couldn\u2019t match \u201cPaul\u201d and \u201cMarya\u201d with faces. And then I remembered why: I\u2019d never seen them. They got kicked out the year before, having committed the Trifecta.\n\nHow long have you been dating her?\u201d I asked.\n\nNine months. We never got along. I mean, I didn\u2019t even briefly like her. Like, my mom and my dad \u2013 my dad would get pissed and then he would beat the shit out of my mom. And then my dad would be all nice and they\u2019d have like a honeymoon period. But with Sara, there\u2019s never a honeymoon period.\n\nGod, how could she think I was a rat? I know, I know: why don\u2019t we break up?\u201d He ran a hand through his hair, clutching a fistful of it atop his head, and said, \u201cI guess I stay with her because she stays with me. And that\u2019s not an easy thing to do. I\u2019m a bad boyfriend. She\u2019s a bad girlfriend. We deserve one another.\u201d\n\nBut\u2014\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t believe they think that,\u201d he said as he walked to the bookshelf and pulled down the almanac. He took a long pull of his ambrosia.\n\nGoddamn Weekday Warriors. It was probably one of them that ratted out Paul and Marya and then blamed me to cover their tracks. Anyway, it\u2019s a good night for staying in. Staying in with Pudge and ambrosia.\u201d\n\nI still\u2014\u201d I said, wanting to say that I didn\u2019t understand how you could kiss someone who believed you were a rat if being a rat was the worst thing in the world, but the Colonel cut me off.\n\nNot another word about it. You know what the capital of Sierra Leone is?\u201d\n\nNo.\u201d\n\nMe neither,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I intend to find out.\u201d And with that, he stuck his nose in the almanac and the conversation was over.\n\nOne Hundred and Ten Days Before\n\nKeeping up with my classes proved easier than I\u2019d expected. My general predisposition to spending a lot of time inside reading gave me a distinct advantage over the average Culver Creek student.\n\nBy the third week of classes, plenty of kids had been sunburnt to a bufriedo-like golden brown from days spent chatting outside in the shadeless dorm circle during free periods. But I was barely pink: I studied.\n\nAnd I listened in class too, but on that Wednesday morning, when Dr Hyde started talking about how Buddhists believe that all things are interconnected, I found myself staring out the window. I was looking at the wooded, slow-sloping hill beyond the lake.\n\nAnd from Hyde\u2019s classroom, things did seem connected: the trees seemed to clothe the hill, and just as I would never think to notice a particular cotton thread in the magnificently tight orange tank top Alaska wore that day, I couldn\u2019t see the trees for the forest \u2013 everything so intricately woven together that it made no sense to think of one tree as independent from that hill. And then I heard my name and I knew I was in trouble.\n\nMr Halter,\u201d the Old Man said, \u201chere I am, straining my lungs for your edification. And yet something out there seems to have caught your fancy in a way that I\u2019ve been unable to do. Pray tell: what have you discovered out there?\u201d\n\nNow I felt my own breath shorten, the whole class watching me, thanking God they weren\u2019t me. Dr Hyde had already done this three times, kicking kids out of class for not paying attention or writing notes to one another.\n\nUm, I was just looking outside at the, uh, at the hill and thinking about um the trees and the forest, like you were saying earlier, about the way\u2014\u201d\n\nThe Old Man, who obviously did not tolerate vocalised rambling, cut me off. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to leave class, Mr Halter, so that you can go out there and discover the relationship between the um-trees and the uh-forest. And tomorrow, when you\u2019re ready to take this class seriously, I will welcome you back.\u201d\n\nI sat still, my pen resting in my hand, my notebook open, my face flushed and my jaw jutting out into an underbite, an old trick I had to keep from looking sad or scared. Two rows behind me, I heard a chair move and turned around to see Alaska standing up, slinging her backpack over one arm.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s bullshit. You can\u2019t just throw him out of class. You drone on and on for an hour every day and we\u2019re not allowed to glance out the window?\u201d\n\nThe Old Man stared back at Alaska like a bull at a matador, then raised a hand to his sagging face and slowly rubbed the white stubble on his cheek.\n\nFor fifty minutes a day, five days a week, you abide by my rules. Or you fail. The choice is yours. Both of you leave.\u201d\n\nI stuffed my notebook into my backpack and walked out, humiliated. As the door shut behind me, I felt a tap on my left shoulder. I turned, but there was no one there. Then I turned the other way and Alaska was smiling at me, the skin between her eyes and temple crinkled into a starburst. \u201cThe oldest trick in the book,\u201d she said, \u201cbut everybody falls for it.\u201d\n\nI tried a smile, but I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Dr Hyde. It was worse than the duct tape incident, because I always knew that the Kevin Richmans of the world didn\u2019t like me. But my teachers had always been card-carrying members of the Miles Halter Fan Club.\n\nI told you he was an asshole,\u201d she said.\n\nI still think he\u2019s a genius. He\u2019s right. I wasn\u2019t listening.\u201d\n\nRight, but he didn\u2019t need to be a jerk about it. Like he needs to prove his power by humiliating you?! Anyway,\u201d she said, \u201cthe only real geniuses are artists. Yeats, Picasso, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez: geniuses. Dr Hyde: bitter old man.\u201d\n\nAnd then she announced we were going to look for four-leaf clovers until class ended and we could go smoke with the Colonel and Takumi, \u201cboth of whom,\u201d she added, \u201care big-time assholes for not marching out of class right behind us.\u201d\n\nWhen Alaska Young is sitting with her legs crossed in a brittle, periodically green clover patch leaning forward in search of four-leaf clovers, the pale skin of her sizeable cleavage clearly visible, it is a plain fact of human physiology that it becomes impossible to join in her clover search. I\u2019d gotten in enough trouble already for looking where I wasn\u2019t supposed to, but still \u2026\n\nAfter perhaps two minutes of combing through a clover patch with her long, dirty fingernails, Alaska grabbed a clover with three full-size petals and an undersize runt of a fourth, and looked up at me, barely giving me time to avert my eyes.\n\nEven though you were clearly not doing your part in the clover search, Perv,\u201d she said wryly, \u201cI really would give you this clover. Except luck is for suckers.\u201d She pinched the runt petal between the nails of her thumb and finger and plucked it.\n\nThere,\u201d she said to the clover as she dropped it on to the ground. \u201cNow you\u2019re not a genetic freak any more.\u201d\n\nUh, thanks,\u201d I said. The bell rang and Takumi and the Colonel were first out the door. Alaska stared at them.\n\nWhat?\u201d asked the Colonel. But she just rolled her eyes and started walking. We followed in silence through the dorm circle and then across the soccer field. We ducked into the woods, following the faint path around the lake until we came to a dirt road.\n\nThe Colonel ran up to Alaska, and they started fighting about something quietly enough that I couldn\u2019t hear the words so much as the mutual annoyance, and I finally asked Takumi where we were headed.\n\nThis road dead-ends into the barn,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe there. But probably the Smoking Hole. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nFrom here, the woods were a totally different creature than from Dr Hyde\u2019s classroom. The ground was thick with fallen branches, decaying pine needles and brambly green bushes; the path wound past pine trees sprouting tall and thin, their stubbly needles providing a lace of shade from another sunburnt day.\n\nAnd the smaller oak and maple trees, which from Dr Hyde\u2019s classroom had been invisible beneath the more majestic pines, showed hints of an as-yet-thermally-unforeseeable fall: their still-green leaves were beginning to droop.\n\nWe came to a rickety wooden bridge \u2013 just thick plywood laid over a concrete foundation \u2013 over Culver Creek, the winding rivulet that doubled back over and over again through the outskirts of campus. On the far side of the bridge, there was a tiny path leading down a steep slope. Not even a path so much as a series of hints \u2013 a broken branch here, a patch of stomped-down grass there \u2013 that people had come this way before.\n\nAs we walked down single file, Alaska, the Colonel and Takumi each held back a thick maple branch for one another, passing it along until I, last in line, let it snap back into place behind me. And there, beneath the bridge, an oasis.\n\nA slab of concrete, three feet wide and ten feet long, with three blue plastic chairs stolen long ago from some classroom. Cooled by the creek and the shade of the bridge, I felt unhot for the first time in weeks.\n\nThe Colonel dispensed the cigarettes. Takumi passed; the rest of us lit up.\n\nHe has no right to condescend to us is all I\u2019m saying,\u201d Alaska said, continuing her conversation with the Colonel. \u201cPudge is done with staring out the window, and I\u2019m done with going on tirades about it, but he\u2019s a terrible teacher and you won\u2019t convince me otherwise.\u201d\n\nFine,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cJust don\u2019t make another scene. Christ, you nearly killed the poor old bastard.\u201d\n\nSeriously, you\u2019ll never win by crossing Hyde,\u201d Takumi said. \u201cHe\u2019ll eat you alive, shit you out and then piss on his dump. Which by the way is what we should be doing to whoever ratted on Marya. Has anyone heard anything?\u201d\n\nIt must have been some Weekday Warrior,\u201d Alaska said.\n\nBut apparently they think it was the Colonel. So who knows. Maybe the Eagle just got lucky. She was stupid; she got caught; she got expelled; it\u2019s over. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re stupid and you get caught.\u201d Alaska made an O with her lips, moving her mouth like a goldfish eating, trying unsuccessfully to blow smoke rings.\n\nWow,\u201d Takumi said, \u201cif I ever get kicked out, remind me to even the score myself, since I sure can\u2019t count on you.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she responded, not angry so much as dismissive. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so obsessed with figuring out everything that happens here, like we have to unravel every mystery. God, it\u2019s over. Takumi, you gotta stop stealing other people\u2019s problems and get some of your own.\u201d Takumi started up again, but Alaska raised her hand as if to swat the conversation away.\n\nI said nothing \u2013 I hadn\u2019t known Marya, and anyway, \u201clistening quietly\u201d was my general social strategy.\n\nAnyway,\u201d Alaska said to me. \u201cI thought the way he treated you was just awful. I wanted to cry. I just wanted to kiss you and make it better.\u201d\n\nShame you didn\u2019t,\u201d I deadpanned, and they laughed.\n\nYou\u2019re adorable,\u201d she said, and I felt the intensity of her eyes on me and looked away nervously. \u201cToo bad I love my boyfriend.\u201d I stared at the knotted roots of the trees on the creek bank, trying hard not to look like I\u2019d just been called adorable.\n\nTakumi couldn\u2019t believe it either and he walked over to me, tussling my hair with his hand, and started rapping to Alaska. \u201cYeah, Pudge is adorable / but you want incorrigible / so Jake is more endurable / \u2019cause he\u2019s so\u2014 damn. Damn! I almost had four rhymes on adorable. But all I could think of was unfloorable, which isn\u2019t even a word.\u201d\n\nAlaska laughed. \u201cThat made me not be mad at you any more. God, rapping is sexy. Pudge, did you even know that you\u2019re in the presence of the sickest emcee in Alabama?\u201d\n\nUm, no.\u201d\n\nDrop a beat, Colonel Catastrophe,\u201d Takumi said, and I laughed at the idea that a guy as short and dorky as the Colonel could have a rap name. The Colonel cupped his hands around his mouth and started making some absurd noises that I suppose were intended to be beats. Puh-chi. Puh-puhpuh-chi. Takumi laughed.\n\nRight here, by the river, you want me to kick it? / If your smoke was a popsicle, I\u2019d surely lick it / My rhymin\u2019 is old school, sort of like the ancient Romans / The Colonel\u2019s beats is sad like Arthur Miller\u2019s Willy Loman / Sometimes I\u2019m accused of being a showman / ICanRhymeFast and I can rhyme slow, man.\u201d\n\nHe paused, took a breath and then finished.\n\nLike Emily Dickinson, I ain\u2019t afraid of slant rhyme / And that\u2019s the end of this verse; emcee\u2019s out on a high.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know slant rhyme from regular rhyme, but I was suitably impressed. We gave Takumi a soft round of applause. Alaska finished her cigarette and flicked it into the river.\n\nWhy do you smoke so damn fast?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe looked at me and smiled widely, and such a wide smile on her narrow face might have looked goofy were it not for the unimpeachably elegant green in her eyes. She smiled with all the delight of a kid on Christmas morning and said, \u201cY\u2019all smoke to enjoy it. I smoke to die.\u201d\n\nOne Hundred and Nine Days Before\n\nDinner in the cafeteria the next night was meat loaf, one of the rare dishes that didn\u2019t arrive deep-fried and, perhaps as a result, meat loaf was Maureen\u2019s greatest failure \u2013 a stringy, gravy-soaked concoction that did not much resemble a loaf and did not much taste like meat.\n\nAlthough I\u2019d never ridden in it, Alaska apparently had a car and she offered to drive the Colonel and me to McDonald\u2019s, but the Colonel didn\u2019t have any money and I didn\u2019t have much either, what with constantly paying for his extravagant cigarette habit.\n\nSo instead the Colonel and I reheated two-day-old bufriedos \u2013 unlike, say, French fries, a microwaved bufriedo lost nothing of its taste or its satisfying crunch \u2013 after which the Colonel insisted on attending the Creek\u2019s first basketball game of the season.\n\nBasketball in the fall?\u201d I asked the Colonel. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about sports, but isn\u2019t that when you play football?\u201d\n\nThe schools in our league are too small to have football teams, so we play basketball in the fall. Although, man, the Culver Creek football team would be a thing of beauty. Your scrawny ass could probably start at lineman. Anyway, the basketball games are great.\u201d\n\nI hated sports. I hated sports, and I hated people who played them, and I hated people who watched them, and I hated people who didn\u2019t hate people who watched or played them. In third grade \u2013 the very last year that one could play T-ball \u2013 my mother wanted me to make friends, so she forced me on to the Orlando Pirates. I made friends all right \u2013 with a bunch of kindergartners, which didn\u2019t really bolster my social standing with my peers.\n\nPrimarily because I towered over the rest of the players, I nearly made it on to the T-Ball all-star team that year. The kid who beat me, Clay Wurtzel, had one arm. I was an unusually tall third-grader with two arms and I got beat out by kindergartner Clay Wurtzel.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t some pity-the-one-armed kid thing, either.\n\nClay Wurtzel could flat-out hit whereas I sometimes struck out even with the ball sitting on the tee. One of the things that appealed to me most about Culver Creek was that my dad assured me there was no PE requirement.\n\nThere is only one time when I put aside my passionate hatred for the Weekday Warriors and their country-club bullshit,\u201d the Colonel told me, \u201cand that\u2019s when they pump up the air-conditioning in the gym for a little old-fashioned Culver Creek basketball. You can\u2019t miss the first game of the year.\u201d\n\nAs we walked towards the airplane hangar of a gym, which I had seen but never even thought to approach, the Colonel explained to me the most important thing about our basketball team: they were not very good.\n\nThe \u201cstar\u201d of the team, the Colonel said, was a senior named Hank Walsten, who played power forward despite being five foot eight.\n\nHank\u2019s primary claim to campus fame, I already knew, was that he always had weed, and the Colonel told me that for four years, Hank started every game without ever once playing sober.\n\nHe loves weed like Alaska loves sex,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cThis is a man who once constructed a bong using only the barrel of an air rifle, a ripe pear and an eight-by-ten glossy photograph of Anna Kournikova. Not the brightest gem in the jewellery shop, but you\u2019ve got to admire his single-minded dedication to drug abuse.\u201d\n\nFrom Hank, the Colonel told me, it went downhill until you reached Wilson Carbod, the starting centre, who was almost six feet tall. \u201cWe\u2019re so bad,\u201d the Colonel said, \u201cwe don\u2019t even have a mascot. I call us the Culver Creek Nothings.\u201d\n\nSo they just suck?\u201d I asked. I didn\u2019t quite understand the point of watching your terrible team get walloped, though the air-conditioning was reason enough for me.\n\nOh, they suck,\u201d the Colonel replied. \u201cBut we always beat the shit out of the deaf-and-blind school.\u201d Apparently, basketball wasn\u2019t a big priority at the Alabama School for the Deaf and Blind, and so we usually came out of the season with a single victory.\n\nWhen we arrived, the gym was packed with most every Culver Creek student \u2013 I noticed, for instance, the Creek\u2019s three goth girls reapplying their eyeliner as they sat on the top row of the gym\u2019s bleachers. I\u2019d never attended a school basketball game back home, but I doubted the crowds there were quite so inclusive.\n\nEven so, I was surprised when none other than Kevin Richman sat down on the bleacher directly in front of me while the opposing school\u2019s cheerleading team (their unfortunate school colours were mud-brown and dehydrated-piss-yellow) tried to fire up the small visitors\u2019 section in the crowd. Kevin turned around and stared at the Colonel.\n\nLike most of the other guy Warriors, Kevin dressed preppy, looking like a lawyer-who-enjoys-golfing waiting to happen. And his hair, a blond mop, short on the sides and spiky on top, was always soaked through with so much gel that it looked perennially wet.\n\nI didn\u2019t hate him like the Colonel did, of course, because the Colonel hated him on principle, and principled hate is a hell of a lot stronger than, \u201cBoy, I wish you hadn\u2019t mummified me and thrown me into the lake\u201d hate.\n\nStill, I tried to stare at him intimidatingly as he looked at the Colonel, but it was hard to forget that this guy had seen my skinny ass in nothing but boxers a couple of weeks ago.\n\nYou ratted our Paul and Marya. We got you back. Truce?\u201d Kevin asked.\n\nI didn\u2019t rat them out. Pudge here certainly didn\u2019t rat them out, but you brought him in on your fun. Truce? Hmm, let me take a poll real quick.\u201d The cheerleaders sat down, holding their pom-poms close to their chest as if praying. \u201cHey, Pudge,\u201d the Colonel said. \u201cWhat do you think of a truce?\u201d\n\nIt reminds me of when the Germans demanded that the US surrender at the Battle of the Bulge,\u201d I said. \u201cI guess I\u2019d say to this truce offer what General McAuliffe said to that one: nuts.\u201d\n\nWhy would you try to kill this guy, Kevin? He\u2019s a genius. Nuts to your truce.\u201d\n\nCome on, dude. I know you ratted them out, and we had to defend our friend and now it\u2019s over. Let\u2019s end it.\u201d He seemed very sincere, perhaps due to the Colonel\u2019s reputation for pranking.\n\nI\u2019ll make you a deal. You pick one dead American president. If Pudge doesn\u2019t know that guy\u2019s last words, truce. If he does, you spend the rest of your life lamenting the day you pissed in my shoes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s retarded.\u201d\n\nAll right, no truce,\u201d the Colonel shot back.\n\nFine. Millard Fillmore,\u201d Kevin said. The Colonel looked at me hurriedly, his eyes saying, Was that guy a president? I just smiled.\n\nWhen Fillmore was dying, he was super hungry. But his doctor was trying to starve his fever or whatever. Fillmore wouldn\u2019t shut up about wanting to eat, though, so finally the doctor gave him a tiny teaspoon of soup.\n\nAnd all sarcastic, Fillmore said, \u2018The nourishment is palatable,\u2019 and then died. No truce.\u201d\n\nKevin rolled his eyes and walked away, and it occurred to me that I could have made up any last words for Millard Fillmore and Kevin probably would have believed me if I\u2019d used that same tone of voice, the Colonel\u2019s confidence rubbing off on me.\n\nThat was your first bad-ass moment!\u201d The Colonel laughed. \u201cNow, it\u2019s true that I gave you an easy target. But still. Well done.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for the Culver Creek Nothings, we weren\u2019t playing the deaf-and-blind school. We were playing some Christian school from downtown Birmingham, a team stocked with huge, gargantuan apemen with thick beards and a strong distaste for turning the other cheek.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter: 20\u20134.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when the fun started. The Colonel led all of the cheers.\n\nCornbread!\u201d he screamed.\n\nCHICKEN!\u201d the crowd responded.\n\nRice!\u201d\n\nPEAS!\u201d\n\nAnd then, all together: \u201cWE GOT HIGHER S-A-Ts.\u201d\n\nHip Hip Hip Hooray!\u201d the Colonel cried.\n\nYOU\u2019LL BE WORKIN\u2019 FOR US SOME DAY!\u201d\n\nThe opposing team\u2019s cheerleaders tried to answer our cheers with \u201cThe roof, the roof, the roof is on fire! Hell is in your future if you give in to desire,\u201d but we could always do them one better.\n\nBuy!\u201d\n\nSELL!\u201d\n\nTrade!\u201d\n\nBARTER!\u201d\n\nYOU\u2019RE MUCH BIGGER, BUT WE ARE SMARTER!\u201d\n\nWhen the visitors shoot a free throw on most every court in the country, the fans make a lot of noise, screaming and stomping their feet. It doesn\u2019t work, because players learn to tune out white noise.\n\nAt Culver Creek, we had a much better strategy.\n\nAt first, everyone yelled and screamed like in a normal game.\n\nBut then everyone said, \u201cShh!\u201d and there was absolute silence. Just as our hated opponent stopped dribbling and prepared for his shot, the Colonel stood up and screamed something. Like:\n\nFor the love of God, please shave your back hair!\u201d Or:\n\nI need to be saved. Can you minister to me after your shot?!\u201d\n\nTowards the end of the third quarter, the Christian school coach called a time-out and complained to the ref about the Colonel, pointing at him angrily. We were down 56\u201313. The Colonel stood up. \u201cWhat?! You have a problem with me!?\u201d\n\nThe coach screamed, \u201cYou\u2019re bothering my players!\u201d\n\nTHAT\u2019S THE POINT, SHERLOCK!\u201d the Colonel screamed. The ref came over and kicked him out of the gym. I followed him.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten thrown out of thirty-seven straight games,\u201d he said.\n\nDamn.\u201d\n\nYeah. Once or twice, I\u2019ve had to go really crazy. I ran on to the court with eleven seconds left once and stole the ball from the other team. It wasn\u2019t pretty. But, you know. I have a streak to maintain.\u201d\n\nThe Colonel ran ahead of me, gleeful at his ejection, and I jogged after him, trailing in his wake. I wanted to be one of those people who have streaks to maintain, who scorch the ground with their intensity.\n\nBut for now, at least I knew such people, and they needed me, just like comets need tails.\n\nOne Hundred and Eight Days Before\n\nThe next day, Dr Hyde asked me to stay after class. Standing before him, I realised for the first time how hunched his shoulders were, and he seemed suddenly sad and kind of old. \u201cYou like this class, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.\n\nYessir.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve got a lifetime to mull over the Buddhist understanding of interconnectedness.\u201d He spoke every sentence as if he\u2019d written it down, memorised it and was now reciting it.\n\nBut while you were looking out the window, you missed the chance to explore the equally interesting Buddhist belief in being present for every facet of your daily life, of being truly present. Be present in this class.\n\nAnd then, when it\u2019s over, be present out there,\u201d he said, nodding towards the lake and beyond.\n\nYessir.\u201d\n\nOne Hundred and One Days Before\n\nOn the first morning of October, I knew something was wrong as soon as I woke up enough to turn off the alarm clock. The bed didn\u2019t smell right. And I didn\u2019t feel right. It took me a groggy minute before I realised: I felt cold. Well, at the very least, the small fan clipped to my bunk seemed suddenly unnecessary. \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d I shouted.\n\nOh God, what time is it?\u201d I heard above me.\n\nEight-oh-four,\u201d I said.\n\nThe Colonel, who didn\u2019t have an alarm clock but almost always woke up to take a shower before mine went off, swung his short legs over the side of the bed, jumped down and dashed to his dresser.\n\nI suppose I missed my window of opportunity to shower,\u201d he said as he put on a green CULVER CREEK BASKETBALL T-shirt and a pair of shorts.\n\nOh, well. There\u2019s always tomorrow. And it\u2019s not cold. It\u2019s probably eighty.\u201d\n\nGrateful to have slept fully dressed, I just put on shoes and the Colonel and I jogged to the classrooms. I slid into my seat with twenty seconds to spare. Halfway through class, Madame O\u2019Malley turned around to write something in French on the blackboard and Alaska passed me a note.\n\nNice bedhead. Study at McDonald\u2019s for lunch?\n\nOur first significant precalc test was only two days away, so Alaska grabbed the six precalc kids she did not consider Weekday Warriors and piled us into her tiny blue two-door. By happy coincidence, a cute sophomore girl named Lara ended up sitting on my lap.\n\nLara\u2019d been born in Russia or someplace, and she spoke with a slight accent.\n\nSince we were only four layers of clothes from doing it, I took the opportunity to introduce myself.\n\nI know who you are.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re Alaska\u2019s freend from FlowReeda.\u201d\n\nYup. Get ready for a lot of dumb questions, \u2019cause I suck at precalc,\u201d I said.\n\nShe started to answer, but then she was thrown back against me as Alaska shot out of the parking lot.\n\nKids, meet Blue Citrus. So named because she is a lemon,\u201d Alaska said.\n\nBlue Citrus, meet the kids. If you can find them, you might want to fasten your seat belts. Pudge, you might want to serve as a seat belt for Lara.\u201d What the car lacked in speed, Alaska made up for by refusing to move her foot from the accelerator, damn the consequences.\n\nBefore we even got off campus, Lara was lurching helplessly whenever Alaska took hard turns, so I took Alaska\u2019s advice and wrapped my arms around Lara\u2019s waist.\n\nThanks,\u201d she said, almost inaudibly.\n\nAfter a fast if reckless three miles to McDonald\u2019s, we ordered seven large French fries to share. Alaska taught class, smoking while she ate.\n\nLike any good teacher, she tolerated little dissension. She smoked and talked and ate for an hour without stopping, and I scribbled in my notebook as the muddy waters of tangents and cosines began to clarify. But not everyone was so fortunate.\n\nAs Alaska zipped through something obvious about linear equations, stoner/baller Hank Walsten said, \u201cWait wait. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you have eight functioning brain cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudies show that marijuana is better for your health than those cigarettes,\u201d Hank said.\n\nAlaska swallowed a mouthful of French fries took a drag on her cigarette and blew smoke across the table at Hank. \u201cI may die young,\u201d she said, \u201cbut at least I\u2019ll die smart. Now, back to tangents.\u201d\n\nOne Hundred Days Before\n\nNot to ask the obvious question, but why Alaska?\u201d I asked. I\u2019d just gotten my precalc test back and I was awash with admiration for Alaska, since her tutoring had paved my way to a B-plus. She and I sat alone in the TV lounge watching MTV on a drearily cloudy Saturday.\n\nFurnished with couches left behind by previous generations of Culver Creek students, the TV room had the musty air of dust and mildew \u2013 and, perhaps for that reason, was almost perennially unoccupied. Alaska took a sip of Mountain Dew and grabbed my hand in hers.\n\nAlways comes up eventually. All right, so my mom was something of a hippie when I was a kid. You know, wore oversized sweaters she knitted herself, smoked a lot of pot, etc.\n\nAnd my dad was a real Republican type, and so when I was born, my mom wanted to name me Harmony Springs Young and my dad wanted to name me Mary Frances Young.\u201d\n\nAs she talked, she bobbed her head back and forth to the MTV music, even though the song was the kind of manufactured pop ballad she professed to hate.\n\nSo instead of naming me Harmony or Mary, they agreed to let me decide. So when I was little, they called me Mary. I mean, they called me sweetie or whatever, but like on school forms and stuff, they wrote Mary Young.\n\nAnd then on my seventh birthday, my present was that I got to pick my name. Cool, huh? So I spent the whole day looking at my dad\u2019s globe for a really cool name. And so my first choice was Chad, like the country in Africa. But then my dad said that was a boy\u2019s name, so I picked Alaska.\u201d\n\nI wish my parents had let me pick my name. But they went ahead and picked the only name first-born male Halters have had for a century. \u201cBut why Alaska?\u201d I asked her.\n\nShe smiled with the right side of her mouth. \u201cWell, later, I found out what it means. It\u2019s from an Aleut word, Alyeska. It means, \u2018That which the sea breaks against\u2019 and I love that.\n\nBut at the time, I just saw Alaska up there. And it was big, just like I wanted to be. And it was damn far away from Vine Station, Alabama, just like I wanted to be.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re all grown up and fairly far away from home,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cSo congratulations.\u201d She stopped the head bobbing and let go of my (unfortunately sweaty) hand.\n\nGetting out isn\u2019t that easy,\u201d she said seriously, her eyes on mine like I knew the way out and wouldn\u2019t tell her. And then she seemed to switch conversational horses in midstream.\n\nLike after college, know what I want to do? Teach disabled kids. I\u2019m a good teacher, right? Shit, if I can teach you precalc, I can teach it to anybody. Like maybe kids with autism.\u201d\n\nShe talked softly and thoughtfully, like she was telling me a secret, and I leaned in towards her, suddenly overwhelmed with the feeling that we must kiss, that we ought to kiss right now on the dusty orange couch with its cigarette burns and its decades of collected dust.\n\nAnd I would have: I would have kept leaning towards her until it became necessary to tilt my face so as to miss her ski-slope nose, and I would have felt the shock of her so-soft lips. I would have. But then she snapped out of it.\n\nNo,\u201d she said, and I couldn\u2019t tell at first whether she was reading my kiss-obsessed mind or responding to herself out loud. She turned away from me, and softly, maybe to herself, said, \u201cJesus, I\u2019m not going to be one of those people who sits around talking about what they\u2019re gonna do. I\u2019m just going to do it. Imagining the future is a kind of nostalgia.\u201d\n\nHuh?\u201d I asked.\n\nYou spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you\u2019ll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present.\u201d\n\nI guess that made sense. I had imagined that life at the Creek would be a bit more exciting than it was \u2013 in reality, there\u2019d been more homework than adventure \u2013 but if I hadn\u2019t imagined it, I would never have gotten to the Creek at all.\n\nShe turned back to the TV, a commercial for a car now, and made a joke about Blue Citrus needing its own car commercial. Mimicking the deep-voiced passion of commercial voice-overs, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s small, it\u2019s slow and it\u2019s shitty, but it runs. Sometimes.\n\nBlue Citrus: See Your Local Used Car Dealer.\u201d But I wanted to talk more about her and Vine Station and the future.\n\nSometimes I don\u2019t get you,\u201d I said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t even glance at me. She just smiled towards the television and said, \u201cYou never get me. That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d\n\nNinety-nine Days Before\n\nI spent most of the next day lying in bed, immersed in the miserably uninteresting fictional world of Ethan Frome while the Colonel sat at his desk, unravelling the secrets of differential equations or something.\n\nAlthough we tried to ration our smoke breaks amid the shower\u2019s steam, we ran out of cigarettes before dark, necessitating a trip to Alaska\u2019s room. She lay on the floor, holding a book over her head.\n\nLet\u2019s go smoke,\u201d he said.\n\nYou\u2019re out of cigarettes, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked without looking up.\n\nWell. Yes.\u201d\n\nGot five bucks?\u201d she asked.\n\nNope.\u201d\n\nPudge?\u201d she asked.\n\nYeah, all right.\u201d I fished a five out of my pocket and Alaska handed me a pack of twenty Marlboro Lights. I knew I\u2019d smoke maybe five of them, but so long as I subsidised the Colonel\u2019s smoking, he couldn\u2019t really attack me for being another rich kid, a Weekday Warrior who just didn\u2019t happen to live in Birmingham.\n\nWe grabbed Takumi and walked down to the lake, hiding behind a few trees, laughing. The Colonel blew smoke rings and Takumi called them \u201cpretentious\u201d, while Alaska followed the smoke rings with her fingers, stabbing at them like a kid trying to pop bubbles.\n\nAnd then we heard a branch break. It might have been a deer, but the Colonel busted out anyway. A voice directly behind us said, \u201cDon\u2019t run, Chipper,\u201d and the Colonel stopped, turned around and returned to us sheepishly.\n\nThe Eagle walked towards us slowly, his lips pursed in disgust. He wore a white shirt and a black tie, like always. He gave each of us in turn the Look of Doom.\n\nY\u2019all smell like a North Carolina tobacco field in a wildfire,\u201d he said.\n\nWe stood silent. I felt disproportionately terrible, like I had just been caught fleeing the scene of a murder. Would he call my parents?\n\nI\u2019ll see you in Jury tomorrow at five,\u201d he announced and then walked away. Alaska crouched down, picked up the cigarette she had thrown away and started smoking again. The Eagle wheeled around, his sixth sense detecting Insubordination To Authority Figures. Alaska dropped the cigarette and stepped on it. The Eagle shook his head, and even though he must have been crazy mad, I swear to God he smiled.\n\nHe loves me,\u201d Alaska told me as we walked back to the dorm circle. \u201cHe loves all y\u2019all too. He just loves the school more. That\u2019s the thing. He thinks busting us is good for the school and good for us. It\u2019s the eternal struggle, Pudge. The Good versus the Naughty.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re awfully philosophical for a girl that just got busted,\u201d I told her.\n\nSometimes you lose a battle. But mischief always wins the war.\u201d\n\nNinety-eight Days Before\n\nOne of the unique things about Culver Creek was the Jury. Every semester, the faculty elected twelve students, three from each class, to serve on the Jury. The Jury meted out punishment for non-expellable offences, for everything from staying out past curfew to smoking.\n\nUsually, it was smoking or being in a girl\u2019s room after seven. So you went to the Jury, you made your case and they punished you. The Eagle served as the Judge, and he had the right to overturn the Jury\u2019s verdict (just like in the real American court system), but he almost never did.\n\nI made my way to Classroom 4 right after my last class \u2013 forty minutes early, just to be safe. I sat with my back against the wall and read my American History textbook (kind of remedial reading for me, to be honest) until Alaska showed up and sat down next to me. She was chewing on her bottom lip and I asked whether she was nervous.\n\nWell, yeah. Listen, just sit tight and don\u2019t talk,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be nervous. But this is the seventh time I\u2019ve been caught smoking. I just don\u2019t want \u2013 whatever. I don\u2019t want to upset my dad.\u201d\n\nDoes your mom smoke or something?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNot any more,\u201d Alaska said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t start to worry until it got to be 4.50 and the Colonel and Takumi were still unaccounted for. The members of the Jury filed in one by one, walking past us without any eye contact, which made me feel worse. I counted all twelve by 4.56, plus the Eagle.\n\nAt 4.58, the Colonel and Takumi rounded the corner towards the classrooms.\n\nI never saw anything like it. Takumi wore a starched white shirt and a red tie with a black paisley print; the Colonel wore his wrinkled pink button-down and flamingo tie. They walked in step, heads up and shoulders back like some kind of action movie heroes.\n\nI heard Alaska sigh. \u201cThe Colonel\u2019s doing his Napoleon walk.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all good,\u201d the Colonel told me. \u201cJust don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\nWe walked in \u2013 two of us wearing ties and two of us wearing ratty T-shirts \u2013 and the Eagle banged an honest-to-God gavel against the podium in front of him. The Jury sat in a line behind a rectangular table. At the front of the room, by the blackboard, were four chairs. We sat down and the Colonel explained exactly what happened.\n\nAlaska and I were smoking down by the lake. We usually go off campus, but we forgot. We\u2019re sorry. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what was going on. But I knew my job: sit tight and shut up. One of the kids looked at Takumi and asked, \u201cWhat about you and Halter?\u201d\n\nWe were keeping them company,\u201d Takumi said calmly.\n\nThe kid turned to the Eagle then and asked, \u201cDid you see anyone smoking?\u201d\n\nI only saw Alaska, but Chip ran away, which struck me as cowardly, as does Miles and Takumi\u2019s \u2018aw-shucks\u2019 routine,\u201d the Eagle said, giving me the Look of Doom. I didn\u2019t want to look guilty, but I couldn\u2019t hold his stare, so I just looked down at my hands.\n\nThe Colonel gritted his teeth, like it pained him to lie. \u201cIt is the truth, sir.\u201d\n\nThe Eagle asked if any of us wanted to say anything, and then asked if there were any more questions, and then sent us outside.\n\nWhat the hell was that?\u201d I asked Takumi when we got outside.\n\nJust sit tight, Pudge.\u201d\n\nWhy have Alaska confess when she\u2019d already been in trouble so many times? Why the Colonel, who literally couldn\u2019t afford to get in serious trouble? Why not me? I\u2019d never been busted for anything. I had the least to lose. After a couple of minutes, the Eagle came out and motioned for us to come back inside.\n\nAlaska and Chip,\u201d a member of the Jury said, \u201cyou get ten work hours \u2013 doing dishes in the cafeteria \u2013 and you\u2019re both officially one problem away from a phone call home. Takumi and Miles, there\u2019s nothing in the rules about watching someone smoke, but the Jury will remember your story if you break the rules again. Fair?\u201d\n\nFair,\u201d Alaska said quickly, obviously relieved. On my way out, the Eagle spun me around.\n\nDon\u2019t abuse your privileges at this school, young man, or you will regret it.\u201d I nodded.\n\nEighty-nine Days Before\n\nWe found you a girlfriend,\u201d Alaska said to me. Still, no one had explained to me what happened the week before with the Jury. It didn\u2019t seem to have affected Alaska, though, who was (1) in our room after dark with the door closed, and (2) smoking a cigarette as she sat on the mostly foam couch. She had stuffed a towel into the bottom of our door and insisted it was safe, but I worried \u2013 about the cigarette and the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d.\n\nAll I have to do now,\u201d she said, \u201cis convince you to like her and convince her to like you.\u201d\n\nMonumental tasks,\u201d the Colonel pointed out. He lay on the top bunk, reading for his English class. Moby Dick.\n\nHow can you read and talk at the same time?\u201d I asked.\n\nWell, I usually can\u2019t, but neither the book nor the conversation is particularly intellectually challenging.\u201d\n\nI like that book,\u201d Alaska said.\n\nYes.\u201d The Colonel smiled and leaned over to look at her from his top bunk. \u201cYou would. Big white whale is a metaphor for everything. You live for pretentious metaphors.\u201d\n\nAlaska was unfazed. \u201cSo, Pudge, what\u2019s your feeling on the former Soviet bloc?\u201d\n\nUm. I\u2019m in favour of it?\u201d\n\nShe flicked the ashes of her cigarette into my pencil holder. I almost protested, but why bother.\n\nYou know that girl in our precalc class,\u201d Alaska said. \u201cSoft voice, says thees not this. Know that girl?\u201d\n\nYeah. Lara. She sat on my lap on the way to McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\n\nRight. I know. And she liked you. You thought she was quietly discussing precalc, when she was clearly talking about having hot sex with you. Which is why you need me.\u201d\n\nShe has great breasts,\u201d the Colonel said without looking up from the whale.\n\nDO NOT OBJECTIFY WOMEN\u2019S BODIES!\u201d Alaska shouted.\n\nNow he looked up. \u201cSorry. Perky breasts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not any better!\u201d\n\nSure it is,\u201d he said. \u201cGreat is a judgement on a woman\u2019s body. Perky is merely an observation. They are perky. I mean, Christ.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re hopeless,\u201d she said. \u201cSo she thinks you\u2019re cute, Pudge.\u201d\n\nNice.\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t mean anything. Problem with you is that if you talk to her you\u2019ll \u2018uh um uh\u2019 your way to disaster.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be so hard on him,\u201d the Colonel interrupted, as if he\u2019s my mom. \u201cGod, I understand whale anatomy. Can we move on now, Herman?\u201d\n\nSo Jake is going to be in Birmingham this weekend and we\u2019re going on a triple date. Well, triple and a half, since Takumi will be there too. Very low pressure. You won\u2019t be able to screw up because I\u2019ll be there the whole time.\u201d\n\nOK.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s my date?\u201d the Colonel asked.\n\nYour girlfriend is your date.\u201d\n\nAll right,\u201d he said, and then deadpanned, \u201cbut we don\u2019t get along very well.\u201d\n\nSo Friday? Do you have plans for Friday?\u201d and then I laughed because the Colonel and I didn\u2019t have plans for this Friday, or for any other Friday for the rest of our lives.\n\nI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNow, we gotta go do dishes in the cafeteria, Chipper. God, the sacrifices I make.\u201d\n\nEighty-seven Days Before\n\nOur triple-and-a-half date started off well enough. I was in Alaska\u2019s room \u2013 for the sake of getting me a girlfriend, she\u2019d agreed to iron a green button-down shirt for me \u2013 when Jake showed up. With blond hair to his shoulders, dark stubble on his cheeks and the kind of faux-ruggedness that gets you a career as a catalogue model, Jake was every bit as good-looking as you\u2019d expect Alaska\u2019s boyfriend to be.\n\nShe jumped on to him and wrapped her legs around him (God forbid anyone ever does that to me, I thought. I\u2019ll fall over). I\u2019d heard Alaska talk about kissing, but I\u2019d never seen her kiss until then: as he held her by her waist, she leaned forward, her pouty lips parted, her head just slightly tilted, and enveloped his mouth with such passion that I felt I should look away but couldn\u2019t. A good while later, she untangled herself from Jake and introduced me.\n\nThis is Pudge,\u201d she said. Jake and I shook hands.\n\nI\u2019ve heard a lot about ya,\u201d he spoke with a slight Southern accent, one of the few I\u2019d heard outside of McDonald\u2019s. \u201cI hope your date works out tonight, \u2019cause I wouldn\u2019t want you stealin\u2019 Alaska out from under me.\u201d\n\nGod, you\u2019re so adorable,\u201d Alaska said before I could answer, kissing him again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI just can\u2019t seem to stop kissing my boyfriend.\u201d\n\nI put on my freshly starched green shirt and the three of us gathered up the Colonel, Sara, Lara and Takumi, and then walked to the gym to watch the Culver Creek Nothings take on Harsden Academy, a private day school in Mountain Brook, Birmingham\u2019s richest suburb.\n\nThe Colonel\u2019s hatred for Harsden burned with the fire of a thousand suns. \u201cThe only thing I hate more than rich people,\u201d he told me as we walked to the gym, \u201cis stupid people. And all the kids at Harsden are rich, and they\u2019re all too stupid to get into the Creek.\u201d\n\nSince we were supposed to be on a date and all, I thought I\u2019d sit next to Lara at the game, but as I tried to walk past a seated Alaska on my way to Lara, Alaska shot me a look and patted the empty spot next to her on the bleachers.\n\nI\u2019m not allowed to sit next to my date?\u201d I asked.\n\nPudge, one of us has been a girl her whole life. The other of us has never gotten to second base. If I were you, I\u2019d sit down, look cute and be your pleasantly aloof self.\u201d\n\nOK. Whatever you say.\u201d\n\nJake said, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much my strategy for pleasing Alaska.\u201d\n\nAww,\u201d she said, \u201cso sweet! Pudge, did I tell you that Jake is recording an album with his band? They\u2019re fantastic. They\u2019re like Radiohead meets the Flaming Lips.\n\nDid I tell you that I came up with their name, Hickman Territory?\u201d And then, realising she was being silly: \u201cDid I tell you that Jake is hung like a horse and a beautiful, sensual lover?\u201d\n\nBaby, Jesus.\u201d Jake smiled. \u201cNot in front of the kids.\u201d\n\nI wanted to hate Jake, of course, but as I watched them together, smiling and fumbling all over one another, I didn\u2019t hate him. I wanted to be him, sure, but I tried to remember I was ostensibly on a date with someone else.\n\nHarsden Academy\u2019s star player was a six-foot-seven Goliath named Travis Eastman that everyone \u2013 even his mother I suspect \u2013 called the Beast. The first time the Beast got to the free-throw line, the Colonel could not keep himself from swearing while he taunted:\n\nYou owe everything to your daddy, you stupid redneck bastard.\u201d\n\nThe Beast turned around and glared, and the Colonel almost got kicked out after the first free throw, but he smiled at the ref and said, \u201cSorry!\u201d\n\nI want to stay around for a good part of this one,\u201d he said to me.\n\nAt the start of the second half, with the Creek down by a surprisingly slim margin of twenty-four points and the Beast at the foul line, the Colonel looked at Takumi and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d Takumi and the Colonel stood up as the crowd went, \u201cShhh \u2026\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is the best time to tell you this,\u201d the Colonel shouted at the Beast, \u201cbut Takumi here hooked up with your girlfriend just before the game.\u201d\n\nThat made everyone laugh \u2013 except the Beast, who turned from the free throw line and walked calmly, with the ball, towards us.\n\nI think we run now,\u201d Takumi said.\n\nI haven\u2019t gotten kicked out,\u201d the Colonel answered.\n\nLater,\u201d Takumi said.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether it was the general anxiety of being on a date (albeit one with my would-be date sitting five people away from me) or the specific anxiety of having the Beast stare in my direction, but for some reason,\n\nI took off running after Takumi. I thought we were in the clear as we began to round the corner of the bleachers, but then I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a cylindrical orange object getting bigger and bigger, like a fast-approaching sun.\n\nI thought: I think that is going to hit me.\n\nI thought: I should duck\n\nBut in the time between when something gets thought and when it gets done, the ball hit me square across the side of the face. I fell, the back of my head slamming against the gym floor. I then stood up immediately, as if unhurt \u2026 and left the gym.\n\nPride had gotten me off the floor of the gym, but as soon as I was outside, I sat down.\n\nI am concussed,\u201d I announced, entirely sure of my self-diagnosis.\n\nYou\u2019re fine,\u201d Takumi said as he jogged back towards me. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before we\u2019re killed.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t get up. I have suffered a mild concussion.\u201d\n\nLara ran out and sat down next to me.\n\nAre you OK?\u201d\n\nI am concussed,\u201d I said.\n\nTakumi sat down with me and looked me in the eye. \u201cDo you know what happened to you?\u201d\n\nThe Beast got me.\u201d\n\nDo you know where you are?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m on a triple-and-a-half date.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re fine,\u201d Takumi said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nAnd then I leaned forward and threw up on to Lara\u2019s pants. I can\u2019t say why I didn\u2019t lean backwards or to the side. I leaned forward and aimed my mouth towards her jeans \u2013 a nice, butt-flattering pair of jeans, the kind of pants a girl wears when she wants to look nice but not look like she is trying to look nice \u2013 and I threw up all over them.\n\nMostly peanut butter, but also clearly some corn.\n\nOh!\u201d she said, surprised and slightly horrified.\n\nOh God,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nI think you might have a concussion,\u201d Takumi said, as if the idea had never been suggested.\n\nI am suffering from the nausea and dizziness typically associated with a mild concussion,\u201d I recited. While Takumi went to get the Eagle and Lara changed pants, I lay on the concrete sidewalk.\n\nThe Eagle came back with the school nurse, who diagnosed me with \u2013 get this \u2013 a concussion, and then Takumi drove me to the hospital with Lara riding shotgun.\n\nApparently, I lay in the back and slowly repeated the words: \u201cThe. Symptoms Generally. Associated. With. Concussion.\u201d\n\nSo I spent my date at the hospital with Lara and Takumi. The doctor told me to go home and sleep a lot, but to make sure and have someone wake me up every four hours or so.\n\nI vaguely remember Lara standing in the doorway, the room dark and the outside dark and everything mild and comfortable but sort of spinny, the world pulsing as if from a heavy bass beat. And I vaguely remember Lara smiling at me from the doorway, the glittering ambiguity of a girl\u2019s smile, which seems to promise an answer to the question but never gives it.\n\nThe question, the one we\u2019ve all been asking since girls stopped being gross, the question that is too simple to be uncomplicated: does she like me or like me? And then I fell deeply, endlessly asleep and slept until three in the morning, when the Colonel woke me up.\n\nShe dumped me,\u201d he said.\n\nI am concussed,\u201d I responded.\n\nSo I heard. Hence my waking you up. Video game?\u201d\n\nOK. But keep it on mute. My head hurts.\u201d\n\nYeah. Heard you puked on Lara. Very suave.\u201d\n\nDumped?\u201d I asked, getting up.\n\nYeah. Sara told Jake that I had a hard-on for Alaska. Those words. In that order. And I was like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have a hard on for anything at this moment. You can check if you\u2019d like,\u2019 and Sara thought I was being too glib, I suppose, because then she said she knew for a fact I\u2019d hooked up with Alaska.\n\nWhich, incidentally, is ridiculous. I. Don\u2019t. Cheat,\u201d he said, and finally the game finished loading and I half listened as I drove a stock car in circles around a silent track in Talladega. The circles nauseated me, but I kept at it.\n\nSo Alaska went ballistic, basically.\u201d He affected Alaska\u2019s voice then, making it more shrill and headache-inducing than it actually was.\n\n\u2018No woman should ever lie about another woman! You\u2019ve violated the sacred covenant between women! How will stabbing one another in the back help women to rise above patriarchal oppression?!\u2019 And so on.\n\nAnd then Jake came to Alaska\u2019s defence, saying that she would never cheat because she loved him, and then I was like, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about Sara. She just likes bullying people.\u2019 And then Sara asked me why I never stood up for her, and somewhere in there I called her a crazy bitch, which didn\u2019t go over particularly well.\n\nAnd then the waitress asked us to leave, and so we were standing in the parking lot and she said, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough,\u2019 and I just stared at her and she said, \u2018Our relationship is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe stopped talking then. \u201cOur relationship is over?\u201d I repeated. I felt very spacey, and thought it was just best to repeat the last phrase of whatever the Colonel said, so he could keep talking.\n\nYeah. So that\u2019s it. You know what\u2019s lame, Pudge? I really care about her. I mean, we were hopeless. Badly matched. But still. I mean, I said I loved her. I lost my virginity to her.\u201d\n\nYou lost your virginity to her?\u201d\n\nYeah. Yeah. I never told you that? She\u2019s the only girl I\u2019ve slept with. I don\u2019t know. Even though we fought, like, 94 per cent of the time, I\u2019m really sad.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re really sad?\u201d\n\nSadder than I thought I\u2019d be, anyway. I mean, I knew it was inevitable. We haven\u2019t had a pleasant moment this whole year. Ever since I got here, I mean, we were just on each other relentlessly. I should have been nicer to her. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nIt is sad,\u201d I repeated.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s stupid to miss someone you didn\u2019t even get along with. But, I don\u2019t know, it was nice, you know, having someone you could always fight with.\u201d\n\nFighting,\u201d I said, and then, confused, barely able to drive, I added, \u201cis nice.\u201d\n\nRight. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do now. I mean, it was nice to have her. I\u2019m a mad guy, Pudge. What do I do with that?\u201d\n\nYou can fight with me,\u201d I said. I put my controller down and leaned back on our foam couch and was asleep.\n\nAs I drifted off, I heard the Colonel say, \u201cI can\u2019t be mad at you, you harmless skinny bastard.\u201d\n\nEighty-four Days Before\n\nThree days later, the rain began. My head still hurt, and the sizeable knot above my left temple looked, the Colonel thought, like a miniaturised topographical map of Macedonia, which I had not previously known was a place, let alone a country.\n\nAnd as the Colonel and I walked over the parched, half-dead grass that Monday, I said, \u201cI suppose we could use some rain,\u201d and the Colonel looked up at the low clouds coming in fast and threatening, and then he said, \u201cWell, use it or not, we\u2019re sure as shit going to get some.\u201d\n\nAnd we sure as shit did. Twenty minutes into French class and Madame O\u2019Malley was conjugating the verb \u201cto believe\u201d in the subjunctive.\n\nJe croie. Tu croies. Il ou elle croie. She said it over and over, like it wasn\u2019t a verb so much as a Buddhist mantra.\n\nQue je croie; Que tu croies; Qu\u2019il ou qu\u2019elle croie. What a funny thing to say over and over again: I would believe; you would believe; he or she would believe. Believe what? I thought, and right then, the rain came.\n\nIt came all at once and in a furious torrent, like God was mad and wanted to flood us out.\n\nDay after day, night after night, it rained. It rained so that I couldn\u2019t see across the dorm circle, so that the lake swelled up and lapped against the Adirondack swing, swallowing half of the fake beach.\n\nBy the third day, I abandoned my umbrella entirely and walked around in a perpetual state of wetness. Everything at the cafeteria tasted like the minor acid of rainwater and everything stank of mildew, and showers became ludicrously inappropriate because the whole goddamned world had better water pressure than the showers.\n\nAnd the rain made hermits of us all. The Colonel spent every not-in-class moment sitting on the couch, reading the almanac and playing video games, and I wasn\u2019t sure whether he wanted to talk or whether he just wanted to sit on the white foam and drink his ambrosia in peace.\n\nAfter the disaster that was our \u201cdate\u201d I felt it best not to speak to Lara under any circumstances, lest I suffer a concussion and/or an attack of puking, even though she\u2019d told me in precalc the next day that it was \u201cno beeg deal\u201d.\n\nAnd I saw Alaska only in class and could never talk to her, because she came to every class late and left the moment the bell rang, before I could even cap my pen and close my notebook.\n\nOn the fifth evening of the rain, I walked into the cafeteria fully prepared to go back to my room and eat a reheated bufriedo for dinner if Alaska and/or Takumi weren\u2019t eating (I knew full well the Colonel was in Room 43, dining on milk \u2018n\u2019 vodka). But I stayed because I saw Alaska sitting alone, her back to the rain-streaked window. I grabbed a heaped plate of fried okra and sat down next to her.\n\nGod, it\u2019s like it\u2019ll never end,\u201d I said, referring to the rain.\n\nIndeed,\u201d she said. Her wet hair hung from her head and mostly covered her face. I ate some. She ate some.\n\nHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d I finally asked.\n\nI\u2019m really not up for answering any questions that start with how, when, where, why or what.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked.\n\nThat\u2019s a what. I\u2019m not doing whats right now. All right, I should go.\u201d She pursed her lips and exhaled slowly, like the way the Colonel blew out smoke.\n\nWhat\u2014\u201d and then I stopped myself and reworded. \u201cDid I do something?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe gathered her tray and stood up before answering. \u201cOf course not, sweetie.\u201d\n\nHer sweetie felt condescending, not romantic, like a boy enduring his first biblical rainstorm couldn\u2019t possibly understand her problems \u2013 whatever they were. It took a sincere effort not to roll my eyes at her, though she wouldn\u2019t have even noticed as she walked out of the cafeteria with her hair dripping over her face.7Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

evening business\nLike most of the town wished they could do\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd I learned all the things that a man should know\nFrom a woman not approved of, I suppose\nBut she died knowing that I

sitting in their cages\nIn the zoo man\n'Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees\nI am an ape man\n\n[Verse 2]\nI think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized\n'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian\nBut with the over-population and inflation and starvation\nAnd the crazy politicians\nI don't feel safe in this world no more\nI don't want to die in a nuclear war\nI want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man\n[Chorus]\nI'm an ape man\nI'm an ape ape man\nI'm an ape man\nI'm a King Kong man\nI'm voodoo man\nI'm an ape man\n'Cause compared to the sun that sits in the

rumble, but give me half a chance\nAnd I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle\"\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the only time that I feel at ease\nIs swinging up and down in a coconut tree\nOh what a life of luxury\nTo be like an ape man\nI'm an ape man\nI'm an ape ape man\nI'm an ape man\nI'm a King Kong man\nI'm a voodoo man\nI'm an ape man\nI look out the window, but I can't see the

Thank you so much.\n\nToo kind, far too kind.\n\n\nBefore I even get started how about\na big round of applause for the Bus Boys.\nThere's some rules, I got some rules when I show\ndown and I do my standup, I got rules and shit.\n\n\nFaggots aren't allowed to look\nat my ass while I'm on stage !\n\n\nThat's why I keep moving while I'm up here.\nYou don't know where the faggot section is, you gotta keep moving.\n\n\nSo if they do see it, quick, you switch, they don't get no long stares at your shit...so that their imagination is flowing about my...\n\nI know when you're looking, 'cos my ass starts to get hot.\n\n\nI'm afraid of gay people. Petrified.\nI have nightmares about gay people.\n\n\nI have this nightmare that I go to Hollywood and find out that Mr. T is a faggot.\n\n\nReally, and he'd be walking up to people going:\n\"Hey, boy ! Hey, boy !\"\n\"You look mighty cute in them jeans !\"\n\"Now come on over here, and fuck me up the ass !\"\n\"I'm gonna bend over now!\"\n\"Hey, boy, slow down ! You're gonna miss the round, and come too fast !\"\n\"You make me get get mad I clench up my buttcheeks and rip your dick off!\"\n\nYou know who would be a funny faggot?\n\nRalph Kramden and Ed Norton!\n\nRalph Kramden leaning out the window and:\n\n\"Norton! Come on down, I wanna show you somethin'!\"\n\"Ralphie-boy, whaddaya say there pal of mine ?\"\n\"You know Norton, I've been watching you.\nAnd I know you've been watching me. You watch me! I know!\"\n\n\n\"So, Ralph, what are you gettin' at?\"\n\"Norton, my friend! How would you like to fuck me up the ass?\"\n\"I know you wanna fuck me, Norton!\"\n\"And you know that I know that you know that I know that you wanna fuck me!\"\n\"Now I'm gonna bend over, and when I do, start fuckin'!\"\n\"Here I go!\"\n\"[groans] hamana hamana hamana\"\n\"Way to go there, Ralphie-boy!\"\nI kid the homosexuals a lot, because they're homosexuals.\n\nI fuck with everybody. I don't give a fuck if they're...\n\nJust like I'm... I don't mean anything by it.\n\nYou can hang out with a gay person.\n\n\nThem guys don't feel, you know, alienated, like, gay people, because they're gay.\n\nYou can play tennis with a gay person.\nReally! Just after the game you say:\n\n\"I'm gonna get a beer, what's you gonna do?\"\n\"I think I'm gonna suck some guy's dick.\"\n\"Well, I'll see you later!\"\n\"You go suck that dick, I'm gonna have the beer.\"\n\n\nLadies are hip to it too.\n\nLadies be hanging out with gay people.\n\nLadies be saying:\n\n\"Gay men are the best friends to have!\"\n\"because they don't want anything from you, you don't want anything from them, you just hang out, you can be with them and get fun and just talk to them\" and all that bullshit, and they be hanging out with them.\n\nYou know what's really scary about it? that new AIDS shit.\n\nAIDS is scary because it kills motherfuckers, AIDS!\n\nThat ain't like the good old days when venereal disease was simple. In the good old days, you got gonorrhea, you dick hurt, go get a shot, cleared right up.\n\nThen they came out with herpes, you keep that shit forever like luggage.\n\nAnd now they got AIDS that just kills motherfuckers. I say what's next, I guess you just put your dick in it and explodes!\n\nAnd the girl would be on the bed:\n\n\"Maybe I should see a doctor about it...\"\n\nKills people! It petrifies me because girls be hanging out with them. One night they could be in the club having fun with their gay friend, give them a little kiss. And go home with AIDS on their lips!\nAnd then when her husband, like five years later, Somebody says;\n\n\"Mr. Johnson you have aids..\"\n\"AIDS?! But I'm not homosexual!\"\n\"Sure you're not homosexual...\"\n\nAll the diseases scare me because I'm like these...these are fuck years for me, like I'm...\nI'm in my sexual prime, this, I fuck now!\n\nThese are the years to fuck! This is when you do your best fucking. And you just start to learn your body and getting it on your shoulders on to fuck...\n\nLike 18 year olds, let me hear you all in the audience!\n\nSee y'all don't know how to fuck yet, see. You don't.\n\nYou get 22 you start moving all this shit.\n\nMaking faces, ever made them fuck faces. it\u2019s a cool motherfucking thing.\n\nYou don't do that when you're 18. There's just one expression 'cos you be surprised you fucking her. Plus you don't have no dick control when you're 18!\n\nEver been sitting around when you was young man, just sitting in class, your dick gets hard for nothing?\n\n\nYou be just sitting there and your dick's here:\n\n\"Hey what's going on out there?\"\n\n\nThat's when the teacher say:\n\n\"Mr Murphy, would you come over by the board?\"\n\"No, that's alright. I'll take the zero.\"\n\nReally, no dick control at all. It's even hard to find the pussy when you're 18. Ever had that guys? You'd be searching for the pussy down there. And your dick be sliding down and shit, and the girl be going:\n\n\"That's not it...\"\n\"Is there any problem?\"\n\"No, ain't no problem, baby.\"\n\"You got a shoe horn or some shit like that?\"\n\nAnd this is the business to be in if you want some pussy. That's why I got in show business, for pussy. I figured, if Jimmy Walker can fuck, I'm fucking everybody. Fuck this, and it's like that too.\n\nWhen you do TV-shows, women would be throwing pussy at me on the street like Frisbee.\n\n\"Ed!\"\n\"Thank you! Appreciate that!\"\n\nToo much pussy, pussy would be falling outta my pocket. Walking out the street:\n\n\"Oh, watch your step, that's mine.\"\n\nBeing a comic though ain't like being no singer. The singers get all the pussy. Like the Bus Boys: they fuck everybody.\n\nBus Boys will fuck anything that moves.\n\nCome to my house the fish stop swimming. They don't play. Singers gets pussy. Because you don't have to, even you don't have to look good, you can sing and get pussy. Just be interesting.\n\nBecause this Sex Symbol is getting pussy and is ugly motherfucker. Because all you have to do is sing, its something about singing that is the business, you sing, women go crazy.\nBecause, Mick Jagger is an ugly motherfucker! with big ass lips!\n\nMick Jagger's lips are so big, black people be going:\n\n\"You got some big ass lips!\"\n\"These some big motherfucking lips!\"\n\nBut he's singing! and you sing you'll get over.\nLuther Vandross is a big Kentucky Fried Chicken eating motherfucker.\n\nBut he put that shit up like....\n\n[mimics Luther Vandross signature scatting]\n\nAnd women go \"Ahhhh!\"\n\nSing! that's all you got to do is sing.\n\nMichael Jackson, who can sing, and is a good looking guy. But ain't the most masculine fellow in the world. That's Michael's hook, his sensitivity!\n\nThat's when women be sayin:\n\n\"Michael's just so sensitive...\"\n\nAnd they eat that shit up. Mike knows.\n\nHe be using women. I've seen Mike walk up to a girl and they'd be in the audience and say:\n\n\"Is it allright if I come down there to sing to you...\"\nAnd women go: \"Whaaaaa!\"\n\nThen, if you don't scream, Michael gets really sensitive and cry on your ass. Ever hear that record \"She's out of my life\"?\n\n\"So, I've learned that love's not possession\nAnd I've learned that love won't wait\nNow, I've learned that love needs expression\nBut, I've learned too late\"\n\n[Cries]\n\n\"Tito, give me some tissue.\"\n\"Jermaine, stop teasing.\"\n\nI'm just saying...I like dudes with masculine voices, like Teddy Pendergrass. Teddy just comes out, takes the lyrics and:\n\n\"You got, you got, you got what I need!\"\n\nAnd scare the bitches that are liking him.\n\nThat motherfucker's crazy, throw your panties on the stage. That's whats happening. I like Elvis Presley!\n\nReally I give credit where credit is due. When Elvis was young, he was a bad motherfucker. He was vicious. Sing his ass off. He sang so good, they let him do movies, he couldn't act.\n\nThey said:\n\n\"Fuck it! Let him sing all his dialogues!\"\n\"Elvis, we got to win this race!\"\n\"We got to win this race....\"\n\"Elvis, want some lemonade?\"\n\"Lemonade, that cool, refreshing drink....\"\n\n\nLet him sing 'till he was older too, Elvis was 42 years old. Remember right before he choked. He would come out, his stomach was all fat and shit...and his butt be sticking out and shit...looking like he had to shit, out walking on the stage like this...\n\"I've lived a life that's full\nI've traveled each and every highway\nAnd more, much more than this\"\n[farts]\n\"Excuse me.\"\n\nSing! That's the key to it. You don't even have to be able to talk. Just sing and get famous. James Brown's been singing for 20 years.\n\nI don't know what the fuck James is talking about! I don't understand shit James says!\n\nI met him once at Saturday Night Live, walked up to him and said \"James, I luv your stuff\". And James said [mimics James Brown talk]. And whatever James is saying is some really heavy shit to James. Because it's really meaningful shit to James..\n\nBecause at the end of every sentence\nhe ends it off with: [mimics James Brown \"huh\" grunt]\n\n\nHe meant that shit that he just said boy! Everything just \"Huh!\"\n\nAnd you getting mad you start putting the needle back \"What the fuck did I just miss?\"\n\nThat's a James Brown lyric. He wrote that shit!\n\nHe's writing a song and:\n\n\"I need a word in here: Heaay!\"\n\"That's good, I like that!\"\n\n[Sings 'Superbad (Parts 1 & 2) by James Brown']\n\n[Mimics James Brown responding to Band Members as shown in\n'Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing']\n\nBand be going:\n\"What the fuck is James talking about?\"\n\"I don't know but we're getting paid, keep singing\"\n\nAnd people take singers. There's something about singers that people just love and shit. Because I... I did Stevie Wonder on a show once.\n\nAnd black people lost their motherfucking minds! I have brother\u2019s rolling up on me going:\n\n\"Hey! You the motherfucker that'd been doing Stevie Wonder?\"\n\"That shit ain't funny, motherfucker!\"\n\"Don't you never let me see you do that shit again! I'll fuck you up!\"\n\"Stevie Wonder is a musical genius!\"\n\"That's terrible! That's terrible, man! Your mother brought you up wrong, that's what it is.\"\n\"Your mother bought you up wrong motherfucker!\"\n\n\nI got mad, I was hanging out with Stevie two months ago, I said:\n\"Look, Steve, I get two months flack over this impression.\"\n\"I don't like doin', I ain't doing this shit no more.\"\n\nStevie says: \"Well I feel that...\"\n\"Shut the fuck up !\"\n\nBecause you gotta cut Steve off quick, because if he starts rolling he talks your ears off. You ever seen Steve win a Grammy and come up to give one of those long ass acceptance speeches?\n\n\"And the winner is Stevie Wonder!\"\n\"...and I like to say all the people in the world today...\"\n\"...God's children and...\"\n\"Just take the motherfucking award and get the fuck out!\"\n\n'cos if you don't say that the credits will be rolling and Stevie going:\n\n\"And I'd like to thank...\"\nI've been in the car and said:\n\"Just shut the fuck up, Steve!\"\n\n\"I'm telling you, genius and all that shit, but you're my boy, man, we hang and, I mean, like, it's nice and shit but I don't appreciate all the flack. And personally, the piano and the singing, I told you how I feel about singing...I ain't impressed. You wanna impress me? Take the wheel for a little while, motherfucker!\"\n\n\"I heard that shit, man!\"\n\"That shit wasn't funny!\"\n\"Then I suppose in your little sketch Stevie crashed in a tree, right?\"\n\"Ha-ha, very funny, motherfucker!\"\n\"Your mother got a wooden leg with a kick stand, motherfucker!\"\n\"Your mother got a mouth in the back of her neck and the bitch chews like this!\"\n\"Motherfucker Stevie Wonder jokes and shit!\"\n\nIt's hot as fuck in here!\n\n[Somebody in the audience yells \"Take it off!\"]\n\nNo, I can't take it off. Maybe ladies would run up the place holding their pussies going: \"Aaaah!\"\n\nWhat's going on over there?\n\nLadies run down the street and shit... can't do that.\n\nDo we have the icecream man around here?\n\nRemember when the ice cream man used to come to town when you was little? And no matter what you was doing you would stop and lose your fucking mind! There's something about the ice-cream truck that makes kids lose it.\n\nAnd they can hear that shit from ten blocks away. They don't hear their mothers calling but they hear that motherfucking ice cream truck. And no matter what was was going on, the iceman came, it stopped. You be getting some marbles and shit:\n\"ice cream! Ice cream! The ice cream man is coming! The ice cream man is coming!\"\n\"Mom! Mom!\"\n\"Throw down some money!\"\n\"The ice cream man is coming!\"\n\nThen your mother come to the window and be throwing change and say:\n\n\"Get your father toasted almond boy, get your brother icy, get yourself vanilla cone and bring back my change.\"\n\nCatch all that shit and run down the street, top speed. Chasing the Icecream truck and:\n\n\"Icecream!\"\n\nIce cream man always drove extra blocks away though. And I know he's seen us and shit, but I think he just be in the car with his friends and say:\n\n\"Watch me how fast I make these motherfuckers run\"\n\nYou'd be behind him doing 50mph and going:\n\n\"Icecream!\"\n\nYou stop, you be out of wind saying:\n\n\"Icecream man, can I have this, I want this over there, toasted almond for my father, and give me this ice cream over here and vanilla cone. Thank you, icecream man! Thank you!\"\n\nI'd get my ice cream and I didn't eat it just sing for a little while. You know how kids are.\n\n\"I have some ice cream, I have some ice cream, and I'm gonna eat it all, I'm gonna eat it all...\"\n\nThe ice cream be running down your arm and shit\n\n\"You don't have no icecream!\n\nYou didn't get none! You didn't get none!\n\n\"'cos you are on the welfare, you can't afford it.\"\n\n\nOther kids would join in:\n\n\"You can't afford it, and his father is an alcoholic!\"\n\"You dropped your ice cream, you dropped your ice cream...\"\n\nEat it. I could drop my icecream in a pile of shit and eat it. I would be like \"It's just sprinkles\"\n\nUnless your mother catch you doing that nasty shit, though. My mother caught me doing that, she made me put it down in 1 sentence:\nAnd you dropped that shit, quick.\n\nAnybody got them mothers that would hit you with a shoe? I had a mother that was so ashoed she would do at the drop of a dime. And fuck you up, wherever she was aiming. And bad with the shoe, carry that shit like a gun, by the time I was lie 10, my mother was like Clint Eastwood with the shoe.\n\nAnd you fuck up, my mom was walking the room just like:\n\n[Whistle's The Good, The Bad and The Ugly theme song]\n\n\"Why did you eat your ice cream off the floor?\"\n\"I didn't, I just...\"\n\nBad! Accurate!\n\nYou'd be in a supermarket and shit and be grabbing cereals off the counter going:\n\n\"Mom, can we get this?\"\n\"I guess not!\"\n\nAnd could be doing three different things, be on the phone with my grandmother, be cooking with this hand have the phone like this and be saying;\n\n\"Yeah, mama, hold on a second.\"\n\nFuck you up and God forbid, my mother be dressed up and had them high heels on. Them pumps, 'cos then she gets boomerang action going on your ass! And fuck you up in your room, you won't even know what the fuck happened.\n\nThey can hear you when you're getting ready to walk out the door. And hear you on the bunk beds fucking around. They got that mother hearing.\n\n\"Wait a minute, baby.\"\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nShe was the one who did all the disciplining around the house and shit. Very, very strict house I came from.\n\nAnd I remember when I first went to my first contact with a white family freaked me out and shit.\n\nI went to Fresh Air Fund, ever went to that? where they take a kid from the city and take him to the country and fuck their minds up?\n\nAnd I went there, I found some white kids can curse around the house! That fucked me up! when I was little I couldn't believe that shit.\n\nBecause I couldn't even say \"dagg\" around my house, my father said \"sounds too much like damn.\" I got in trouble for saying shit the wrong way. I was in the house with Tom Kildea.\n\nHis mother said \"Tom you're a little late!\u201d He said: \"Come on mom I'm moving as fast as I can shit.\"\nAnd I was standing like this:\n\nAnd if I tried to pull some shit like that in my house? \"Ed, you're a little late!\"\n\"Oh, come on, pop, shit, what is this! Come on, damn!\"\nMy pop just go: [Fires gun] \"That motherfucker's crazy!\"\n\nPops didn't play man, he didn't play when it came to kids, he ain't fucking with my mother though. My mother would fuck him up. My moms one of those sistas you don't hit. You can't hit sistas period. Remember in the old days when you could beat up a woman? Remember that shit back in the 20's, the guys just smacked their wives in the movies... And they just go... You can't do shit like that no more. Women be takin' aerobics, and they'll fuck you up now! It's scary too, man! Especially a black woman. You hit a black woman she lose her mind! Seriously. They go crazy, you can have a really timid sister for a girl, and smack it be like:\n\n\"I'm a kill you, motherfucker! You don't hit me like that! You don't hit me shit! You don't put your hands on my face! my father don't put his hands on my face!\u201d\n\"Baby, please, stop! Baby, please... stop! Baby, hold on, stop, please!\"\n\"Calm down, baby, calm down!\"\n\"You don't hit me, motherfucker! So get the fuck out!\"\n\nThrow you out your own house, you be so scared you get the fuck out too. That's some shit. You know you're scared when a woman says get the fuck out your own house and you leave. I had a girlfriend once, I smacked her and got all cool and shit. And then she got cool and scared me more and I just left.\n\n\"I didn't want to do that shit, baby! But you brought that shit on yourself. Don't make me have to do it again.\"\nShe said: \"No, no I did bring it on myself. Why don't you just go to sleep?\"\nGot the fuck out. People are changing. Men are changing too, this shit the guys do now you couldn't do what they did 30 years ago. In the old days, you had an argument with your girl in the car, she say: \"Let me out of here!\" Men would say: \"No, no, we can't have any of that.\" And nowadays a woman say that shit, dude: \"Get the fuck out!\"\n\nSomebody broke wind in here!\n\nI've been trying like not say nothing but someone farted in this motherfucker. That's some long-distance fart too, boy. I know you get down with your friends have a good time. Especially fellas..ya know they play that game, they play the fart game you know. You know you fart around your fellas and its funny.\n\nDudes be doing that they be gettin in elevators farting and laughing and shit. It's nasty ! You play the fart game. I think deep down inside people wanna smell other people's farts. 'Cos you smell them.\n\nAnd people always tell you they farted. They say: \"I farted.\" You don't leave, you pause a second.\n\"Yeah, you did!\"\n'cos in the back of your mind you wanna grade the fart. 'cos if it smells bad enough, two years later you be going:\n\n\"Remember that fart you made, two years ago ?\"\n\n\nThe fart game you play. Starts off around the house when you're little. Your father introduces you to it. You'd be sitting in the house on a Saturday morning, watching cartoons and your father make a fart and:\n\"That wasn't me, that was your mother.\"\n\"Oh, baby, baby ! I want a divorce, uh! You're rotten, baby, shit!\"\n\nAnd you join in, grab your little brother, sit on his head and fart. You ever do that? That's a fun game, you little brother freak out and go: \"Waaah\"\n\nAnd your father goes: \"It's the fart game, you'll play one day son.\"\n\nThe fart game, you get your best friend in on that shit too. You can walk up to your best friend while he's watching a football game and fart in his face. He won't even get mad.\n\nHe just go: \"Ok, you got me.\"\n\n\"That was a good one, too ! My mouth was open. My mouth was open on that!\"\n\nI got a scar, over my eye till this day from playing the fart game in the bathtub. Me and my big brother used to play it. We were poor, we didn't have mr. bubble, we played the fart game.\n\n\"I think it's smelly !\"\n\"I'm G.I Joe, I'm swimming on the water...\"\n\nAnd my big brother was sitting in the other end of the tub, and made shit in the tub. He wanted to add some excitement to the game.\n\nHe said: \"And then a big brown shark came.\"\n\nI jumped up and said: \"Aaaaah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCut my eye on the soap dish, blood gushing out and shit. Screaming, my mother ran in the bathroom. Seeing my big brother sittin in the bathroom with a piece of shit in his hand.\n\nI was layin at the bottom of the water with blood gushing outta my eye...And G.I. Joe up my ass...\n\nMy mother: \"What the fuck is going on over here?\"\n\nCan I hold somebody's camera. Anybody bring a camera?\n\nDoes its flash go immediately? Like I don't have to be waiting like my aunt and shit \"Wait a second now !\"\n\nThey try to press it and the shit don't work they\n\nbe going like: \"There's something wrong with it...\"\n\nAnd it go immediately the flash. Are you sure? I'll take a picture of the crowd, for myself. OK, y'all come over here on this now?\n\nYou know ? I'll take two of them. This ain't no instamatic motherfucker! I got to wait for the flash and shit! See you got me waiting I should break your shit.\n\nSee the brothers sitting in the back go:\n\n\"All this money and he taking motherfucking pictures!\"\n\"I want my picture took, I'd steal a car motherfucker!\"\n\"Hey, man, I said one fuckin' picture!\"\n\n\"You're going to ruin my fucking film, man. Come on, shit!\"\n\"Who the fuck do you think you are, man!\"\n\nI'll see you explain the last one to the guy at the Photomat.\n\n\"That's a picture of Eddie Murphy's dick...\"\n\nYou know what would be a good picture? Can all the brothers stand up? All the brothers in the audience? Straight up! Everybody up! Straight up ! I'm serious ! What the fuck are you doing?\n\nWill you, motherfucker stand up? Up! And all the ladies get the cameras up. We're gonna set the record straight here.\n\nWhen I say go...everybody whip out their dick and go: \"Wuuuhaaa\"\n\nLook how fast the white dudes sat down. Some of them still standing. Y'all must be Italian!\n\nWe got some shit on us. We got all this shit! We got some dicks hanging down! Dicks down to this motherfucker! You don't believe it. White people don't believe it. What's funny about it,\n\nWhite people are the ones that made up the rumor.\n\n\"You know, black people have tremendous dicks, but I don't believe it!\"\n\nYou know remains of the first dick was found in Africa? Big ass piece of bone dick on the floor.\n\n\"What is this shit ?\"\n\"It's an old dried up dick.\"\n\"That means the first dick belonged to a black man.\"\n\nDicks. We got the shit for it. We got nice asses, too. We got our shit on. You see a white dude would be in this suit like this.\n\"All right, man ! All right, maaan !\"\n\nI got a friend, Doug, there go Doug, my friend, Doug's ass is way up here on his back. Ain't it, Doug? Doug be getting shit stains on his collar. And in restaurants be reaching for his wallet:\n\n\"Lemme get my wallet\"\n\nCoz we got our shit hooked, all this is hooked up with black people. Chinese people are fucked all around, coz they got little dicks and little asses. They do and its fucked up the way they walk. They be walking all light coz they ain't got no shit pulling them down.\n\nNow, a brother's dick is too big it fucks up his balance so he'd have to do all this shit..\n\nEverytime you see a brother in a wheel chair he ain't always crippled. He's got big shit hanging down! That's why all the brothers model they drawers in the newspapers. Think 'bout it. I've been seeing newspapers every sunday morning.\n\nA white dude in his drawers...Never have no balls in they drawers.\n\nSmiling and shit. If I had no balls. I wouldn't be smiling this shit.\n\n\"I don't have any dick !\"\n\nBrother be standing there..if a brother models is drawers they need an extra fold in the page. They're selling underwear but this niggers dick is in my coffee.\n\n\"Want me stir it for you?\"\n\nThat's some true shit.\n\nWhat's today's date?\n\n\nDon't go to cook-outs. I hate cook-outs man. Stay away from cook-outs, if you're like me stay away. I don't like my family come by the house, with the relatives I ain't seen since the last cook-out.\n\nYou got certain relatives you just see at the cook-out. And they get on your fuckin nerves every year. My uncle Gus come by the house every year. My uncle Gus is the uncle that likes to work the grill. And don't let nobody touch the grill when he's around and shit.\n\nAs as soon as he walks in the house its like:\n\n\"Get away from that grill you dunna know how to start a fire\"\n\"You dunna start no fire, put this fire out. This ain't no fire goddamnit.\"\n\"Eddie. Eddie go over there get all of that wood I need half a tree. Chop that tree.\"\n\"Chop down that tree and give me the wood.\"\n\"And Charlie go get me  gallons of gasoline out the shed.\"\n\"Two gallons of gasoline, you kids roll up your shirt we're gonna start a fire.\"\n\"Come on, you wanna eat?

My aunt Bunny got a moustache and shit! You know one of them lady moustaches? It was really cool, back when she was 20.\n\nLadies had them little thin ones and shit. Then when they get about 40 like aunt Bunny they be havin' a Billy Dee Williams' look. The shit is bigger than a man's and shit !\n\nAunt Bunny weight like 300  pounds. Like real heavy lady and shit. And the kids were scared of her. You got that kid logic going. I remember my aunt Bunny come by the house.\n\nIt was like. I was petrified coz she always wanted to kiss me and touch me and some shit.\nSoon as she walked on the door was like:\n\n\"Come here and give aunt Bunny a kiss, baby.\"\nThen you go: \"Waaaaa!\"\n\nAnd my mom would say:\n\n\"Why don't you go and kiss your aunt Bunny ?\"\n\nKids don't give a fuck, they go:\n\n\"She's got a moustache!\"\n\nWhy do kids move so slow when they be crying?\n\n\"Stop making all that noise!\"\n\"I said shut up!\"\n\nYou be mad coz your mother hit you. You be standing there wishing hateful shit on your mother.\n\n\n\"God please kill her !\"\n\"I hope she gets hit by a truck and die !\"\n\"I hate her ! I hate her! I hate her ! I hate her!\"\n\n\nShut up or I'll come and give you something to cry about. Than my pop starts talking. And my pop is fucked up every 4th of July!\"\n\nBlack men like to claim the house when they're drunk. Men period I think, like to claim their house. They want you to know that if you drunk and they're drunk. And you in their house, that it's their house. My father standing in the middle of the cook-out saying: \"It's my house!\"\n\n\"You know that it is ? And if you don't like it, you get the fuck out !\"\n\"I don't give a fuck!\"\n\"I don't give a... I pay the motherfucker bills in this motherfucker!\"\n\"And, hey...

I got drunk in my motherfucking kitchen, I was drinking out of my glass in my motherfucker house.\"\n\"So, fuck it!\"\n\nThen he attacks the whole family, like:\n\n\"Gus!

But you take things too far Gus.\"\n\"I tell you go an inch, you go 17 inches. Tell you go 17  inches you go.\"\n\"Give a nigga rope gonna be a cowboy Gus.\"\n\"Why don't you listen. Eddie, get that motherfucking dog away from my plate.\"\n\"I'm gonna shoot this dog.\"\n\"I'm gonna shoot this mother... shut up. I'm gonna shoot it.

You don't even know what the fuck the dogs name is anymore do you\"\n\"The dog don't give a fuck he don't know his name. The dog is  3 yrs old dont know his name.\"\n\"Watch this: Coco !

And then I giggle my motherfucking ass off.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"'cos I hate the motherfucker! 'cos you don't clean up behind it!\u201d\n\"This ain't Scooby-Doo motherfucker!\"\n\"Why can't you clean the dog.\"\n\"The dog shits all over the house. If no one tells you Eddie you dont clean the shit.\"\n\"You let the shit stay forever.\"\n\"Shit been in the den for 3  months Eddie.\"\n\nIt's been in the den for 3 months, you kids go pass it you act like you don't see it.\n\n\"And unless you're told you won't clean the shit.\"\n\"The shit is hard as a rock now! It's like motherfuckin furniture in there!\"\n\"I went in there last week to watch the fight, and said fuck it I put my drink on top of it Eddie\"\n\"It's a coffee table now! Why can't you clean up shit?\"\n\"My friends come over and they oh that's lovely. It's not lovely it's a piece of shit.\"\n\"'Cos my children don't listen!\"\n\nThen my aunt Bunny would fall down the steps. Almost every year. Ever had a heavy set aunt fall down the steps? Make a whole lotta fucking noise!\n\nIt's scary, too, 'cos they'll be calling Jesus on the way down! And aunts don't like to fall straight  down the steps like a kid,They be trying to break the fall and hold it and stop the shit. And that's what makes the fall take a half hour then.\n\nReal loud, like:\n\n\"Lord, Jesus Christ, help my lord, please, Jesus, please!\"\n\"Jesus, God, help, my lord, Jesus, help me I'm falling down the steps oh lord Jesus Christ please!\"\n\"My shoe!\"\n\"Oh lord Jesus God help us!\"\n\"I'm half way down now help my lord Jesus !\"\n\"Lilian!\"\n\"What is all that fuckin' noise?!\"\n\"Lilian! The bitch is falling down the steps again!\"\n\"Lilian! Lilian!\"\n\"What's wrong, Bunny?\"\n\"I fell down the steps!\"\n\"Bunny fell down the steps! Bunny fell down the steps! Eddie, go get your aunt Bunny something cool for her head!\"\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Bunny fell down the steps!\"\n\"Hey, Charlie ! Aunt Bunny fell down the steps!\"\n\"Gus ! What the fuck is wrong with your wife? Why can't she walk the fucking steps? You come up every fuckin' year, Gus, and you burn down my motherfucker backyard and your wife rips down the steps! Why? I work hard to get my place beautiful, and then the motherfucker come over and rips the steps down! Look at the motherfucking steps! They're fucked up, Gus! Why can't she walk the steps? You know why she can't walk the steps? 'Cause she's a fat hairy bitch! That's why! That's why, Gus! And my children are afraid of your wife. Eddie's afraid of her! He has nightmares about your wife! I went to his room last week, Gus, he was in the bed screaming, 'Oh, help me, help me!' I just walk up to him, shake him, ask: 'What's wrong?' He said: 'Aunt Bunny is coming to get me!' He's afraid of your wife, 'cos she has a bigger mustache than his father!\n\n\"But you know what it is, Gus! I figured out about your wife. And I'm gonna say it. I figured out about your wife. I know where you met your wife. You told me you met your wife 50 years ago on a motherfucking camping trip, and that your wife was Puerto Rican. Your wife ain't no motherfucking Puerto Rican! I thought she wasn't from the first minute 'cos I walked up to her I said: 'Hi, my name is Vernon.' And she said: 'Hello, I'm Bunny. Guni gugu!' What the fuck does 'guni gugu' mean, Gus? I don't know what the fuck that shit is as to this day. I thought I learned some new Spanish shit! I went up to my friend: \"Hey, Sanchez! Guni gugu!' And Sanchez says: 'Get the fuck outta here!'\n\n\"I've been walking around for years confused. And I finally figured out about your wife, where you met your wife. You didn't meet your motherfucker wife on no camping trip! ...Your wife is a Bigfoot, isn't she, Gus? Your wife is a Bigfoot, isn't she? That's why the bitch's mustache is so motherfucker thick: 'cause you shaved the bitch down and taught it to speak! I know a motherfuckin' Bigfoot when I see one! You bring a Bigfoot in my home, Gus? On my children? The bitch can't talk, she can't walk the fryer steps! She's not trained well, Gus! She cannot walk steps. I bet she climb the fuck out a tree though, don't she, Gus?\nDoesn't she ? Doesn't she? But you had to bring her out here! Fuck her!\n\n\"And your motherfucking children? They're Bigfeet too! They're half Bigfoot, Gus, 'cause the motherfuckers is 6 years old and have afros 17 inches long. They're little hairy motherfuckers just like their mother. Look at the motherfuckers, you know how I found out they was bigfoot? When I took your kids fishing last week. I put the motherfuckers in the boat, Gus; And I took the worm and I put it on the hooks, and they both sat there, and put the poles down in the boat. And slammed their face in the water, for 3 mins.\nAnd I think, 'What the fuck are these kids doin'?' Then they start movin' their heads like this and the motherfuckers come up with fish. I jumped back and said, 'Can you believe this motherfuckin shit?' Then kid took the fish out of his mouth, looked at his brother and said: 'Guni gugu!' I said, 'What the fuck is going on here?' Normal kids don't do shit like that, Gus! But I'll tell you somethin' motherfucker: You can take your motherfucking hairy fat ass white mustache bitch out the fuck. You can go upstairs and get the motherfuckin' dog and scoop up the shit, and take Eddie and get these motherfucker long Angela Davis afro-ware motherfucker kids of yours...and put them in the motherfucking guni gugu-mobile and get the fuck out! And if my wife don't like it she can get the fuck out too!\"\n\"You missed me, bitch!\"\n\nThank you!\nOh, Jesus.\nOh, shit... I'm in Washington D.C.!\nJesus ! Christ !\n\nThis is where Reagan lives. Not far from here.\n\nHey Ron everyone's booing and I ain't said shit.\n\nWell, tell us something we don't know, motherfucker! It ain't like people sit around going \"Really does it suck?\"\n\nShit's changing though, we got black politicians now.\n\nWho's that boy... Harold Washington ?\n\nHarold Washington said: \"Fuck it !\"\n\nAnd won. I know he's still sitting around going:\n\n\"I really won the motherfucker?\"\n\nAnd Jesse Jackson seen that shit and said:\n\n\"Fuck it, imma run too, fuck it\"\n\"Jesse you can win\" i see these brothers going. You can win Jesse, coz you're bigger than motherfucking Harold Washington.\"\n\"Fuck Harold Washington.\"\n\"Fuck him man, run for president.\"\nAnd Jesse going: \"Yeah, fuck that shit.\"\n\nI've seen Jesse in the gym, working the fuck out, too, for getting into shape. You know he got a chance he can win. White dudes like to do shit like that...vote for the wrong dude as a goof.\n\n\nThey get drunk and shit and go like:\n\n\"Let's vote for Jesse Jackson!\"\n\n\"I just voted for Jesse Jackson !\"\n\nAnd next day would be like this: \"He fuckin' won?\"\n\nJesse knows that shit can happen. He gets in shape. I've seen him running round the track and shit.\n\nI said: \"Why the fuck you getting in shape like this?\"\n\nHe says: \"cos I'm gonna be the first black president.\"\n\n\"I have to give speeches like this: My fellow Americans!\n\nAs your president I feel and dude be going:\n\n\n\"He won't stand still!\"\n\nI ain't hooked up into all that racism shit.\n\nMy motto is, life just be happy with the motherfuckers. I ain't into all that racism shit. Racism ain't as bad as it used to be anyway man\u2026I mean its fucked up but, they don't call niggers, niggers no more and shit.\n\nWhite people don't say it. Especially when there's niggas around. So I guess I wouldn't know it.\nI went to Texas to look into racism, about two months ago. I had a show down in Texas, got off the plane and shit, walked up looking for racism.\nMy friends always told me: \"You better not go to Texas! They'll fuck you up!\"\nAnd when a modern day brother here that shit\n\n\"What ! They ain't fucking nobody up!\"\n\nBrothers act like they couldn't have been slaves back 200 years ago. Its like motherfuckers liked that shit.\n\n\"I wish I was a slave; I would fuck somebody up!\"\n\"Shit..tell me to bale some motherfucking cotton.\"\n\"I would have been on the street and shit..\n\"He would came up and say ey yo nigga bale this cotton?\"\n\"I'd say suck my dick master.\"\n\"Suck my motherfucking dick.\"\n\"That's right I ain't baling a motherfucker.\"\n\nThe first dude that got off the boat said that shit.\n\"Bale that cotton.\"\n\"Fuck you, motherfucker!\"\nOther motherfuckers say: \"We bale the shit, just keep that shit away.\"\n\"Just keep that fuckin' shit away from me.\"\n\nI got of the motherfucking plane, walked up, Got up, walked up, my bag. All my black shit on, black leather, big ass medallion and shit on like this.\n\nLittle white dude walk up and say: \"This your bag?\"\nI said: \"Yes, my fuckin' bag!\"\n\"Why, motherfucker? A black man can't have a suitcase?\"\n\nAnd the dude is like:\n\"What the fuck's wrong with this guy?\"\n\nWasn't that bad at all. I'm winded. I'm out of breath. Sweating and shit.\n\n[Female audience member yells \"Do Mr. Rob!\"]\n\n[\"Shut up, bitch!!\" from another member in the audience]\n\nY'all didn't know I was a ventriloquist too.\n\nShit ain't as bad as it used to be. You know who get it real bad now? Chinese people. They are the ones who be getting fucked over bad. You be teasin' them and shit. Ever go into a restaurant and order up some food.\nChinese dude would be in there and when he leave you do like this:\nEverybody makes fun of chinese when they order some food up and shit.\nAnd they're nice guys, be all courteous and shit. Your friends and shit be laughing.\nAnd he look out the back and say:\n\"The food is coming right up.\"\n\nHe be in the back watching us:\n\n\"Very funny. Very funny.\"\n\"Make a special Won-Ton soup for him...\"\nI wonder if they have, like a McDonald's in China?\n\nChinese people would be walking and say:\n\"Give me a Big Mac and a strawberry shake, a large order fry and a cherry pie.\"\nAnd dude say: \"Big Mac, strawberry shake, large order fry and a cherry pie, coming right up.\"\n\nThat's a fucked up language too, chinese. Hard to learn.\n\nI wanna learn to speak spanish. That's the shit. You know what I'd really want to speak? I'd like to learn how to speak french, 'cos that's some cool shit, French.\n\nYou can say \"I gotta shit\" in french and it would sound good: Just sounds good.\n\nI don't like that shit that Arabic. That the motherfuckers be speaking in the [imitates Arabic languages]. That shit's fucked for me. It sounds nasty and shit, would be getting like:\n\nThat's a word in arabic: That means some shit to them!\n\n\"Could I have a hamburger cheese roll?\"\n\n\"Never mind, man.\"\n\n\"I don't want no hakana on my bread, motherfucker!\"\n\nSpanish language.\n\nYou know why I want to learn how to speak Spanish? Coz I was always a Ricky Ricardo buff.\nWhen he would get mad of Lucy and be saying:\nI'd say: \"Go on Ricky curse the bitch out.\"\n\nRicky would lose his mind. Ricky was cool and shit.\nFor the fifties Desi Arnaz, Ricky\nRicardo was a cool motherfucker.\nHe had his baggies on, pointed shoes, in the club Babaloo and shit.\n\nRemember that shit?\nYou be sittin' there like this:\n\nHe had a cool ass laugh too, it was like:\n\"It's justa ridiculous !\"\n\n\"Hey, Fred ! How would you like to fuck me up the ass ?\"\nTV is all screwed...\n\nAny kids here ?\nI mean, little kids.\n\nI don't like you bringing those kids down here.\nHow old are you, man ?\n\nHow old?\nOh, you're gonna be fucked up\n\nwhen you leave.\n\"Dad ! What's a dick, what is that ?\"\n\n\nHow old is the other girl, over there?\nOh, y'all fucked up now !\n\n\n\nY'all thought I would be going like this:\nYou didn't know I'd be saying: \"A dick this big!\"\n\n\nThe kid's gonna be waking up and:\n\"A negro's dick's coming to get me mom!\"\n\n\nI'mma tell you all a joke you can tell in school, all right, 'cos I've been telling this dirty stuff.\n\nHere's a little joke...Y'all can listen to it too.\n\n\nI know lots of times people seen my show then go to work and try to tell and fuck my jokes up on the job and shit.\n\n\n\"...and then he said guni gugu!\"\n\"And he had a G.I. Joe up his ass!\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm Mr. T, I'll rip your cock off with my ass !\"\nAnd dude be standing all:\n\n\n\"Yeah, very funny shit, right...\"\nHere's a joke you can tell at school, when school starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverybody be quiet now. Are you listening guys?\n\nA bear and a rabbit are takin' a shit in the woods. And the bear turns to the rabbit and says: \"Excuse me, you have problems with shit sticking to your fur?\" And the rabbit says: \"No.\"\nSo the bear wiped his ass with the rabbit.\nI like that joke.\nOh, shit !\nAnybody got cable ?\n\nI've been watching a lot of cable lately 'cos I'm so mad with it. Only good TV show now is Star Trek. That's some good shit!\n\nI like Captain Kirk, 'cos Captain Kirk will fuck anybody!\n\n\nI've seen him beamed down on a planet, ever seen that when he's fucked this dream bitch?\n\nYou gotta be a horny motherfucker to fuck a dream bitch!\n\nI mean, I'm no racist, but if the bitch is green there's something wrong with the pussy!\n\nHe'll be fucking a mutant and:\n\nShip be gettin' all fucked up. Mr Scott, I like him he made me laugh, he's never cool and shit. He's the opposite of Spock. The ship be all fucked up and Mr. Scott say:\n\n\"Captain, my ship can't take much more of this sir. She's about to blow!\"\n\n\"Let Spock handle it.\"\n\nAnd Spock say: \"Mr Scott, why don't you take the phasers and point them at the dylithium crystals and point them phasers at them and then use the power from the phasers to regenerate the dylithium crystals and we can get out on the impulse power.\"\n\n\"Mr Spock ! It just might wax it !\"\n\n\"The shit worked last week, motherfucker !\"\n\nI got fed up with TV and shit, coz I seen all the Star Treks. I start watching cable. I was watching Poltergeist last month.\n\nI got a question.\n\nWhy don't white people just leave the house when there's a ghost in the house?\n\nY'all stay in the house too fuckin' long.\n\nGet the fuck out of the house!\n\n\nVery simple: If there's a ghost in the house, get the fuck out!\n\nAnd not only did they stay in the house with the poltergeist, they invite more people over! Sitting around going: \"Our daughter Carroll-Ann's in the television set.\"\n\nI would have been gone. If I had a daughter, went down to the precinct and say\n\n\"Look man, I went home my fucking daughter's in the t.v. set and I just fucking left.\"\n\nYou can have all this, I ain't going back to the motherfucker. I just came down so when she ain't at the school you don't think I killed the bitch or anything like that. But she is inside the tv set you can have all that shit. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Murphy didn't you try to save your daughter?\"\n\nYeah, I'm a man, see I tried to save her I turned the channels the shit didn't work. I got the fuck out. The kid was only  6 years old in the movie, they couldn't have been to attached to her.\n\nIn the amityville horror the ghost told them to get out of the house. White people stayed in there. Now that's a hint and a half for your ass.\n\nA ghost say get the fuck out, I would just tip the fuck out the door!\n\nLou Walker looked in the toilet bowl, the're was blood in the toilet.\n\nAnd said, \"That's peculiar.\"\n\nI would\u2019ve been in the house saying:\n\"Oh baby this is beautiful. We got a chandelier hanging up here, kids outside playing. It's a beautiful neighborhood. We ain't got nuttin to worry, I really love it. This is really nice.\"\n\"GET OUT!\"\n\"Too bad we can't stay, baby!\"\n\nYou know, I wanna say something. I think maybe like 30 years ago there was a woman that wanted to sing, a black lady wanted to sing opera...What was her name? Marian Anderson? And this place was like segregated and she couldn't sing here. And she couldn't sing in the place. And here we are, like not even 50 years later, a 22 year old black male on stage getting paid to hold his dick!\n\nGod bless America! I gotta go now.\n\nY'all take it easy, bye bye!9Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1161597", "artist_names": "Dionne Warwick", "full_title": "The Green Grass Starts to Grow by\u00a0Dionne\u00a0Warwick", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a98b943c38c4b2229e5575aa330f479b.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a98b943c38c4b2229e5575aa330f479b.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 1161597, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8121664, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1658511710, "path": "/Dionne-warwick-the-green-grass-starts-to-grow-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Dionne-warwick-the-green-grass-starts-to-grow-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1970, "month": 12, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "December 1970", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Dec. 1970", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a98b943c38c4b2229e5575aa330f479b.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a98b943c38c4b2229e5575aa330f479b.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "The Green Grass Starts to Grow", "title_with_featured": "The Green Grass Starts to Grow", "updated_by_human_at": 1658511710, "url": "https://genius.com/Dionne-warwick-the-green-grass-starts-to-grow-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/8674", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/41356e3aa2860a192b9239593d438897.970x649x1.jpg", "id": 8674, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/41356e3aa2860a192b9239593d438897.970x649x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Dionne Warwick", "slug": "Dionne-warwick", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Dionne-warwick"}, "artist": "Dionne Warwick", "lyrics": "The Green Grass Starts to Grow Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe world outside your house is cold and windy\nThe summer breeze becomes a winter storm\nAnd then you smile at me\nAnd almost instantly the weather turns warm\n\n[Chorus]\nSlowly the green grass starts to grow\nSoftly the sunshine of your smile melts the snow\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I'm alone, the streets are dark and cloudy\nI walk around not knowing day from night\nAnd then you touch my hand\nThat's all that happens and the whole world turns bright\n[Chorus]\nSlowly the green grass starts to grow\nSoftly the sunshine of your smile melts the snow\n\n[Bridge]\nTo me you're everything that's true\nMy world begins and it will end with only you\nForever\n\n[Chorus]\nSlowly the green grass starts to grow\nSoftly the sunshine of your smile melts the snow\nSlowly the green grass starts to grow\nSoftly the sunshine of your smile melts the snowSee Dionne Warwick LiveGet tickets as low as $87You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/742250", "artist_names": "Michael Nesmith (Ft.

home\n[Verse 2]\nHalf the thoughts I'm thinking speak in sighs\nAs that same old wave of loneliness returns\nAnd I can see you when I close my eyes\nSpeaking very softly as you turn\n\n[Chorus]\nStanding in the lonely light of the silver moon\nLooking over maps of memories for the road\nStanding in the lonely light of the silver moon\nWith the unexpected destination of my

You know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless I'm a guy\n\nthat's kind of shouting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin some kind of echo chamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I think one\n\nof our responsibilities here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis to act like a band\n\nthat's still continuing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're going on.\n\nWe're doing our exploring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're exploring ourselves individually,\n\nwe're exploring our relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we really need to get together,\n\ntalk about this,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nact like the band exists,\n\nbecause it does exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if we don't do that,\n\nthen we are the coproducers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof the process slipping off the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a bit\n\nof a shit sandwich, though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it--?\n\nThe unravelling of a band?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then there were two?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo a good friend of mine\n\nphoned me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he knew where James was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Really?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe couldn't even imagine James\n\ndoing anything for six months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm prepared for the worst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm pretty confident that, you know,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe will come together\n\nwhen the time is right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut knowing when\n\nthat time will come,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor not knowing\n\nwhen that time will come,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis very, very uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope that at some point\n\nhe will come back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand try and finish the making\n\nof this record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlf...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf he walked away from Metallica,\n\nI'm not sure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat it would surprise me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay your prayers, little one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget, my son\n\nTo include everyone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've always felt that James\n\nwas a softer, more caring,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompassionate person than he\n\nallowed himself to be to most people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can remember\n\nfrom the Dave Mustaine days,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, when him and Dave Mustaine,\n\nthese guys, they started right away\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith their big, you know,\n\nchests beating and their mannerisms,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand the whole thing was very much\n\nabout this kind of, like, macho--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was just, like--\n\nI couldn't deal with that stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd looking back on, I mean,\n\nwhat was that,       years ago,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, I just felt so alienated,\n\nbecause it was just so far removed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom the upbringing\n\nthat I come from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, here's to you, my friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then, at the same time,\n\nI'm starting to realizing now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat the sort of depressive things\n\nthat show up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas a result of the alcohol\n\nand stuff like that,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit was just very difficult for him\n\nto communicate from the heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- You want some or not?\n\n- And not hide behind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na lot of these different fronts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it's alcohol, that gives\n\nhim a false sense of strength\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor the front man in Metallica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor, you know, macho bullshit\n\nand all that stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll right, now you guys are drunk,\n\nand I'm drunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow this is the fun part, man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to help him.\n\nI want to be there for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I want to do the best I can\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto make him the best person\n\nthat he can be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I don't know how the fuck\n\nit's gonna play out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's really healthy for me to be here\n\nwithout any pressure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor anything related to the band\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor anyone who would remind me\n\nof the band.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd to recognize what's real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur sessions with Phil really stirred up\n\na lot of things in James\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat he thought that he needed\n\nto address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMentally, it's really taken--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaken its toll on myself, you know,\n\nand I'm very worried about him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, you know, whenever\n\nyou check yourself into rehab,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthey don't-- They don't focus on, you\n\nknow, the fact that you're an alcoholic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey go much deeper, you know?\n\nI mean, they go way deep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey crack you open\n\nand then spill you out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand examine all the things\n\nthat are on the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've spoken to him a few times,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand, you know,\n\nI know he's having a rough trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter how bad it gets, eventually\n\nthings seem to sort themselves out,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsooner or later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether it's good or bad,\n\nthey sort themselves out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI watched the people\n\naround the world say\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat a great guitar player Kirk is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand what a piece of shit I am.\n\nAnd that I got kicked out of Metallica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I wasn't good enough for them.\n\nAnd that I was a loser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I've had to deal with that\n\nfor almost    years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a dreadful experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been hard, Lars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been hard to watch everything that\n\nyou guys do and you touch turn to gold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand everything I do fucking backfire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I'm sure there's\n\na lot of people that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthey would consider my backfire\n\ncomplete success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know? And am I happy\n\nbeing number two? No.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know? You're just now\n\nencountering something\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been going\n\nthrough       years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've never had a chance\n\nto be able to tell you without\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntalking to Lars, the guy in Metallica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever talked to my little Danish\n\nfriend again. You know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI remember the day you and I talked\n\nabout digging a hole in fucking dirt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand smoking hash\n\nthrough the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat to me is the stuff that's, like--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know? And we've never had\n\nvery many moments like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I feel some guilt? Yes, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at the same time,\n\nit's difficult for me to comprehend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat the only thing that you feel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhen you look back\n\non the last    years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis rooted in the Metallica thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever thought what--?\n\nWhat I've been through?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I've had an awareness\n\nof the pain I caused you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's not what I said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have any idea--?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Of what I put you through.\n\n- No, no, no, what I went through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, people hate me\n\nbecause of you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know, I walk down the street,\n\nand I hear some piece of shit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsay \"Metallica\" at me,\n\nand they do that to taunt me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, when I would hear Metallica\n\non the radio,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would be like,\n\n\"God, I have to turn this off,\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbecause I just keep thinking,\n\n\"I fucked up!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been waiting for this day\n\nfor a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know? And by no means\n\nis it done because\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsomebody else very important\n\nis not here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I wish it was      all over again,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand you guys woke me up and say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hey, Dave, you know what?\n\nYou need to go to AA\"? Yeah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd give anything for that chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there any last words you wanna\n\nsay to everybody out there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetal up your ass!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, thank you. This is Donna Davis,\n\nand this is Metallica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is, like, a pretty bitchin' club\n\nto play the first fucking gig.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- How do you guys feel?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Stoked.\n\n- Freaking out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Freaking out?\n\n- Totally. Totally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's un-fucking-believable is what\n\nit comes down to. Can I say that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- You can say whatever you want.\n\n- It's fucking unbelievable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEchobrain. Yeah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know, I just-- All of a sudden\n\nthis became such a big production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't understand.\n\nIt's like all of a sudden, like--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI get one phone call, it's like everybody\n\nand their fucking brother are in town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought it'd be Jason, like,\n\nplaying with his new band\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin front of, you know, like,    drunks\n\ndown at some bar or something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, I guess, to my own\n\nignorance or something, l--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's what-- I guess that's\n\nwhat I wanted it to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now I'm realizing that supposedly\n\nit's a little more of a big deal than that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Hey, what's happening, man?\n\n- What's going on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Sounded good, man. Very good.\n\n- Thanks. Thanks, man, thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Awesome. Awesome.\n\n- Oh, thanks. Right on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- I'm Lars. How you doing?\n\n- Nice to meet you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere's Jason?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Jas?\n\n- I don't know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think he went back to--\n\nI think he already fucking bailed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- He went back to--\n\n- Really?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice. Go back to say hey,\n\nand he's, like, fucking gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElvis has left the building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's Zach. Hey, Zach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee, he's even blowing me off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJason blows me off.\n\nZach blows me off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow quick we become\n\nyesterday's news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo-- No kidding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee, there's a guy\n\nin an Echobrain T-shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, that's Steve over there.\n\nHe works at the studio with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, he is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Really?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI remember that guy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI remember him.\n\nHe worked at the studio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Which guy?\n\n- Over there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- The guy in the red shorts?\n\n- No, the guy in the black\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat's walking across right now.\n\nKessel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTodd. He works at the studio too,\n\ndoesn't he?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Who?\n\n- Todd over there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure they're all here, Bob.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, the only two people\n\nin the Bay Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnot working for him is me and you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHetfield's gonna freak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm in fucking hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis whole gig has brought\n\nall of this on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, it has.\n\nIt's made me feel like--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- You really wanna come clean.\n\n- It made me feel like such a loser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, I can't hold my band together,\n\nyou know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI start records,\n\nI don't finish them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI fucking--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJason is the future.\n\nMetallica's the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've never had a break like this\n\nin    years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know what I mean? And just--\n\nWhat's been kind of getting me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis just not knowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know what I mean?

I mean--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a big question,\n\nbecause, for me, it was really just--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt came along with being in Metallica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hey, we're gonna do this.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's part of this, all of this...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bigness of Metallica,\n\nand I'm kind of tired of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might look at it as a friend.\n\nTo me, it's been a beast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's sucked a lot of me into it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou were maybe the keeper\n\nof the beast at one point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know, because you were the\n\nchampion of that fifth-- That entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, of course,\n\nyou gotta find the right balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween what\n\neverybody's personal needs are,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut if Metallica collectively decides\n\nto do this,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen I think Metallica\n\ncan make it happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know. That scares me again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetallica is three individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd three individuals have to decide\n\nif it's good to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I still think that the priority\n\nis the collective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuntil all the people involved\n\nin the collective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsay that the priority\n\nis the individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so far, you're the only one\n\nthat said the priority is the individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven't said that.\n\nHe hasn't said that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven't heard him say that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I feel that it's still--\n\nThere's still an unbalance there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe met from, like, maybe,\n\nI don't know, six or eight weeks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbefore we actually picked up\n\nthe project again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was when we came in,\n\nand it was the first time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe actually used this studio, HQ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, here we are.

Now we gotta talk about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou started talking about the idea of\n\nthe guitar solo, as we have known it,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaybe being something that was\n\na little outdated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand maybe reintroducing\n\nsome riff-o-rama things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut can I say something\n\nthat I think is bullshit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis whole fucking solo out,\n\nyou know, dates the whole thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's so bullshit. You know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you put a guitar-- If you don't play\n\na guitar solo in one of these songs,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat dates it to this period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that cements it to a trend\n\nthat's happening in music right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think that's stupid,\n\nand I think it's totally trendy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that's not what I said.\n\nIt's always been about,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlike, where could it go\n\nthat's kind of new and interesting,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstead of just repeating\n\nsomething from the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not interested in playing\n\ntraditional guitar solos anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- You know, that's just-- For me, it's--\n\n- And you told me that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's just boring, you know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo me, if you can add a colour\n\nto the song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat satisfies you and works\n\nfor the song,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen that's what we should do with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I don't wanna get in the position\n\nwhere it's like,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe put something down on the tape\n\nto satisfy your ego,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy ego, Lars' ego or James' ego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think it should serve\n\nwhat's going down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike, in other words, there shouldn't be,\n\nlike, a rule of no solos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere shouldn't be a rule of solos.\n\nIt should be--\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I agree.\n\nI mean, it really is, to me,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nall about serving the song,\n\nand, you know,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel much better about that,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbecause, you know, I just don't wanna\n\nfollow certain trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat I see other bands following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don't necessarily have\n\nto stick to our traditional way,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut we also don't have\n\nto follow that trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm actually very, very comfortable\n\nwith my role in the band, you know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've actually always been very, very\n\ncomfortable with my role in the band.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not a really egotistical person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, I've-- I spend a large\n\namount of my time trying to, like,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndownplay my ego\n\nand get it even smaller and smaller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's part of my beliefs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI try to be an example\n\nof being egoless to the other guys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi!

Can I have a word with you for a few minutes?\nSit down, get comfortable\nUhhh, how long have we known each other? About 10 months? Yeah I think its, yeah. You and John are real tight aren\u2019t ya?\nYeah.  Oh is that an engagement ring?\nAwww, congratulations\nOh he slipped it on your finger last night huh?\nHe\u2019s the luckiest man in the world, you know, he should be real proud to have someone like you\nOh yeah, umm, what I wanted to talk to you about is, well, there is something that has been bugging me for about 5 months and I\u2019ve been carrying it around with me and it\u2019s getting heavier and heavier everyday\u2026\nAnd, uh, yeah it\u2019s almost to the boiling point and I have to get it off my chest\nYeah, I\u2019m not trying to be fresh or anything, because I know you're John\u2019s girl, but I just have to tell you this\nYou see I have a great deal of respect for you\u2026I\u2019m not being, you know, not going left field on you \u2026but dig\nYou see I\u2019m gonna take you back to my childhood for a minute\u2026.We had quite a big family and we weren\u2019t very rich, sometimes we lived from day-to-day\nBut one thing we did do was go to church every Sunday.  Mama took us to church, and I was in the choir too, hey yeah I sang a little bit in Sunday school\nShe taught us the golden rules, the 10 commandments, and she said, \u201cSon do onto others as you have them do onto you\u201d, she said \u201cDon\u2019t steal\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t rob\u201d You know all the things good parents try to instil into their children\nWell you know I did a few little things like shoot hook, I guess every kid shoots hooky at least once\nAnd umm, she said \u201cStay out of trouble\u201d You know when I was a teenager I didn\u2019t break in, burglarize, or rob anybody\nI tried to work for what I got, you know, tried to be honest.  Didn\u2019t commit no crimes or nothing, but you know I had to wait,  huh \u2019til I reached manhood to commit a crime, according to the court of love, if there is such a court\nBut you know\u2026.sometimes you\u2019re forced into things like this, see sometimes Cupid can shoot his arrow so fast you can\u2019t get out the way, you know?\nAnd you can fall and the more you, it\u2019s like being in quicksand too, the more you wiggle the deeper you sink\n\nI\u2019m not gonna take up too much of your time, you see I\u2019m not very good with words and I had to tell you all of that, so I can really say what I got to say\nSee there is a lot of talk going around town that I\u2019m on the make for John\u2019s girl, \u201cIke\u2019s on the make for John\u2019s girl\u201d.  I don\u2019t mean to do anybody wrong because I wouldn\u2019t want anybody to bother anything that belongs to me\nBut you see I\u2019ve never seen anybody like you, I\u2019ve never known anybody like you, and there\u2019s some things you just can\u2019t help.  At night I toss and turn, I try to keep it out my mind but you see\u2026.I find myself thinking about you\nI just can\u2019t help it, and right now\u2026\u2026\n\nI stand accused\nOf lovin' you too much\nAnd I hope, I hope it's not a crime\n'Cause if it is, I'm guilty\nOf lovin' you, you, you\n\nI, I hope to God\nThat I never have, oh, to testify\n'Cause if I do\nEveryone is gonna, they're gonna cry\nThey're gonna say\nOld Ike is guilty\nOf lovin' a sweet girl like you\nYou might also likeI know, I know\nYou belong to another\nI, I may not stand a ghost of a chance\nI'll stand on top of Mount Everest\nAnd proudly tell the world that I love ya\nOh yes, I will\n\nBecause I, I just can't\nI can't help myself\nI'm a victim of circumstance\n\nAnd just one\nOoh, one touch of your hand\nI don't know how it happened\nBut just look at me\nI find myself chillin'\nOn the witness stand\n\nAnd I'm shoutin' out\nAll over, all over the land\nEverybody, I'm guilty\nI'm guilty of lovin', lovin' you\n\nI'm guilty of lovin' you\nI said, I'm guilty\nBut what can I do?\nI wanna hold ya\nI wanna squeeze ya tight\nBut my mind said\nShe belong to another\nAnd that ain't right\n(Album version cont.)\n...\nI didn't ask to fall in love with you\nI just couldn't help myself\nAnd now I'm strung out\nDon't know what to do, no, no, no\nI'm guilty\nOf lovin' you\nOh yeah, I'm guilty, of lovin' you\nI'm not ashamed to say I love you, I love you, I love you\nI can't help but, I just can't help but.. love you\nAnd I'm guilty baby\nOh I'm guilty\nI know you belong to another\nBut I can't help, I can't help but love you\nOh yes I do\nI stand accused of loving you\nBaby, baby, baby\nPlease, can't you understand, the situation that I'm in\nThat's ~a~ one side of love, manEmbed"}, {"_type":

Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\n\n\u2014Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?\n\n\u2014Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.\n\n\u2014What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\u2014old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him\u2014lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.\n\u2014Circumcised? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a penny out of him.\n\n\u2014That the lay you're on now? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain. Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does, says he, I'll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?\n\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.

Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.\n\n\u2014Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\n\n\u2014Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\n\n\u2014Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\n\u2014Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\n\n\u2014-What was that, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.\n\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a licence, says he.\n\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruahan's land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\n\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\n\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!\n\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.\n\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.\n\n\u2014There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.\n\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.\n\n\u2014Stand and deliver, says he.\n\n\u2014That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\n\u2014Pass, friends, says he.\n\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\n\n\u2014What's your opinion of the times?\n\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.\n\n\u2014I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.\n\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\n\n\u2014Foreign wars is the cause of it.\n\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\n\n\u2014It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.\n\n\u2014Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me I wouldn't sell for half a crown.\n\n\u2014Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Wine of the country, says he.\n\n\u2014What's yours? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\n\n\u2014Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says he.\n\n\u2014Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\n\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\n\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.\n\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.\n\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid O, as true as I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\n\n\u2014And there's more where that came from, says he.\n\n\u2014Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\n\n\u2014Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.\n\n\u2014I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\n\nWho comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the prudent soul.\n\n\u2014For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.\n\nAnd he starts reading them out:\n\n\u2014Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...\n\n\u2014I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\n\n\u2014Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, honourable person.\n\n\u2014Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\n\nAh! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\n\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.\n\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.\n\n\u2014Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...\n\nAnd he doubled up.\n\n\u2014Take a what? says I.\n\n\u2014Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\n\n\u2014O hell! says I.\n\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\n\n\u2014Bi i dho husht, says he.\n\n\u2014Who? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\n\n\u2014When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John's eye. U. p...\n\nAnd he started laughing.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\n\n\u2014Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\n\nTerence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\n\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\n\nBut he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\n\n\u2014What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.\n\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.\n\n\u2014Are you codding? says I.\n\n\u2014Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\n\nSo Joe took up the letters.\n\n\u2014Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\n\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob's a queer chap when the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:\n\n\u2014How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?\n\n\u2014I don't know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that...\n\n\u2014You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\n\n\u2014With Dignam, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is it Paddy? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Alf. Why?\n\n\u2014Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.\n\n\u2014Who's dead? says Bob Doran.\n\n\u2014You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam dead?\n\n\u2014What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?\n\n\u2014Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.\n\n\u2014Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\n\n\u2014Paddy? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says Alf.\n\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\n\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar, hatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.\n\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.\n\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\n\n\u2014There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.\n\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\n\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\n\n\u2014Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\n\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:\n\n\u2014Who said Christ is good?\n\n\u2014I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?\n\n\u2014Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.\n\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\n\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.\n\n\u2014The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\n\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\n\n\u2014The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.\n\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.\n\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.\n\n\u2014Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.\n\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.\n\n\u2014O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?\n\nAnd he starts reading out one.\n\n7 Hunter Street, Liverpool. To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin.\n\nHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged...\n\n\u2014Show us, Joe, says I.\n\n\u2014... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when...\n\n\u2014Jesus, says I.\n\n\u2014... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...\n\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\n\n\u2014Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.\nH. RUMBOLD, MASTER BARBER.\n\n\u2014And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?\n\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.\n\n\u2014Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\n\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.\n\n\u2014They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\n\nAnd he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\n\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.\n\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\n\n\u2014There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.\n\n\u2014That so? says Joe.\n\n\u2014God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\n\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.\n\n\u2014Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\n\n\u2014That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...\n\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\n\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis.\n\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\n\n\u2014Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!\n\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.\n\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b\u00e9zique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but don't you see? and but on the other hand. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!\n\n\u2014The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, says Joe.\n\n\u2014You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\n\n\u2014Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.\n\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit\u00e9patant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir\u00e1ga Kis\u00e1szony Putr\u00e1pesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\n\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\u2014short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fianc\u00e9e an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\n\n\u2014God blimey if she ain't a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.\n\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.\n\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn't blind him.\n\n\u2014Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\n\n\u2014No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\n\nSo he calls the old dog over.\n\n\u2014What's on you, Garry? says he.\n\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\n\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.\n\nThe curse of my curses\nSeven days every day\nAnd seven dry Thursdays\nOn you, Barney Kiernan,\nHas no sup of water\nTo cool my courage,\nAnd my guts red roaring\nAfter Lowry's lights.\n\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.\n\n\u2014I will, says he, a chara, to show there's no ill feeling.\n\nGob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:\n\n\u2014Could you make a hole in another pint?\n\n\u2014Could a swim duck? says I.\n\n\u2014Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.\n\n\u2014Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the policy.\n\n\u2014Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\n\n\u2014Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.\n\n\u2014Whose admirers? says Joe.\n\n\u2014The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\n\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\n\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.\n\n\u2014Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\n\n\u2014No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.\n\n\u2014Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.\n\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got an old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus, he'd kick the shite out of him.\n\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\n\n\u2014Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\n\n\u2014Slan leat, says he.\n\n\u2014Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\n\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.\n\n\u2014Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Friend of yours, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\n\n\u2014I won't mention any names, says Alf.\n\n\u2014I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M. P., the cattle traders.\n\n\u2014Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.\n\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob, he'd have a soft hand under a hen.\n\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\n\n\u2014Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\n\n\u2014Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him, as it happens.\n\n\u2014Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\n\n\u2014That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?\n\n\u2014Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?\n\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member's question is in the affirmative.\n\nMr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?\n\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\n\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)\n\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\n\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.\n\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\n\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\n\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\n\n\u2014There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?\n\n\u2014Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\n\n\u2014Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\n\n\u2014Is that really a fact? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?\n\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw. Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.\n\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian O'ciarnain's in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na h-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then terminated.\n\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev. P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr. Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T. Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery, V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O. M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P. Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\n\n\u2014Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?\n\n\u2014No, says Joe.\n\n\u2014I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\n\n\u2014Who? Blazes? says Joe.\n\nAnd says Bloom:\n\n\u2014What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.\n\n\u2014Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.\n\n\u2014We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put English gold in his pocket.\n\n\u2014-True for you, says Joe.\n\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:\n\n\u2014Now, don't you think, Bergan?\n\n\u2014Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.\n\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.\n\n\u2014He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's running a concert tour now up in the north.\n\n\u2014He is, says Joe. Isn't he?\n\n\u2014Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.\n\n\u2014Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.\n\n\u2014My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success too.\n\nHe's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\n\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you Caddareesh.\n\nPride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\n\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.\n\n\u2014Hello, Ned.\n\n\u2014Hello, Alf.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack.\n\n\u2014Hello, Joe.\n\n\u2014God save you, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?\n\n\u2014Half one, says Ned.\n\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\n\n\u2014Were you round at the court? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.\n\n\u2014Hope so, says Ned.\n\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.\n\n\u2014Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.\n\n\u2014Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.\n\n\u2014Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\n\n\u2014Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.\n\n\u2014Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.\n\n\u2014Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not compos mentis. U. p: up.\n\n\u2014Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\n\n\u2014Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\n\n\u2014Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.\n\n\u2014How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\n\n\u2014Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish nor flesh.\n\n\u2014Nor good red herring, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.\n\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.\n\n\u2014And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.\n\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.\n\n\u2014Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Good health, Ned, says J. J.\n\n\u2014-There he is again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Where? says Alf.\n\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.\n\n\u2014How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Remanded, says J. J.\n\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\n\n\u2014Who tried the case? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Recorder, says Ned.\n\n\u2014Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\n\n\u2014Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve in tears on the bench.\n\n\u2014Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.\n\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\n\n\u2014A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?\n\n\u2014Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\n\n\u2014And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.\n\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.\n\n\u2014Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.\n\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.\n\n\u2014Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That's the whole secret.\n\n\u2014Rely on me, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.\n\n\u2014O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that Keyes, you see.\n\n\u2014Consider that done, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Very kind of you, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.\n\n\u2014Decree nisi, says J. J.\n\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.\n\n\u2014A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all our misfortunes.\n\n\u2014And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\n\n\u2014Give us a squint at her, says I.\n\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.\n\n\u2014O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\n\n\u2014There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?\n\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.\n\n\u2014Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action? What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?\n\nO'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.\n\n\u2014It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their patois.\n\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.\n\n\u2014Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.\n\n\u2014The European family, says J. J....\n\n\u2014They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a cabinet d'aisance.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\n\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!\n\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh Dearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.\n\n\u2014What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.\n\n\u2014Gold cup, says he.\n\n\u2014Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest nowhere.\n\n\u2014And Bass's mare? says Terry.\n\n\u2014Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on my tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.\n\n\u2014I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.\n\n\u2014Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is Sceptre.\n\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\n\n\u2014Not there, my child, says he.\n\n\u2014Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the other dog.\n\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.\n\n\u2014Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they can't see the beam in their own.\n\n\u2014Raimeis, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?\n\n\u2014As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report of lord Castletown's...\n\n\u2014Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.\n\n\u2014Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\n\nThe fashionable international world attended EN MASSE this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the conclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in Horto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\n\n\u2014And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\n\n\u2014And will again, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh, our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.\n\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.\n\n\u2014Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\n\n\u2014An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\n\n\u2014Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\n\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.\n\n\u2014But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?\n\n\u2014I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is. Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself Disgusted One.\n\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.\n\n\u2014A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on the breech.\n\nAnd says John Wyse:\n\n\u2014'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.\n\n\u2014That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.\n\nThe fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.\n\n\u2014On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\n\n\u2014And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The unfortunate yahoos believe it.\n\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\n\n\u2014But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?\n\nDidn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.\n\n\u2014We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\n\n\u2014Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\n\n\u2014We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.\n\n\u2014Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?\n\n\u2014The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they trying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\n\n\u2014Conspuez les Fran\u00e7ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\n\n\u2014And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's dead?\n\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and come where the boose is cheaper.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\n\n\u2014Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\n\n\u2014And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\n\n\u2014They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.\n\nAnd says J. J.:\n\n\u2014Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.\n\n\u2014Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, says he. I will.\n\n\u2014You? says Joe.\n\n\u2014Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\n\n\u2014Repeat that dose, says Joe.\n\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\n\n\u2014Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.\n\n\u2014But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014Yes, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014What is it? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.\n\n\u2014By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm living in the same place for the past five years.\n\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:\n\n\u2014Or also living in different places.\n\n\u2014That covers my case, says Joe.\n\n\u2014What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\n\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\n\n\u2014After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.\n\n\u2014Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.\n\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S. Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal's Cave\u2014all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.\n\n\u2014Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\n\n\u2014That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\n\n\u2014And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.\n\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\n\n\u2014Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\n\n\u2014Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.\n\n\u2014Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\n\nThat's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.\n\n\u2014But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.\n\n\u2014What? says Alf.\n\n\u2014Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.\n\nWho's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\n\n\u2014A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\n\n\u2014Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.\n\n\u2014That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love, moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\n\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\n\n\u2014Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.\n\n\u2014Hurrah, there, says Joe.\n\n\u2014The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\n\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\n\n\u2014We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the United Irishman today about that Zulu chief that's visiting England?\n\n\u2014What's that? says Joe.\n\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out:\n\n\u2014A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.\n\n\u2014Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.\n\n\u2014Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\n\n\u2014Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\n\n\u2014No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only initialled: P.\n\n\u2014And a very good initial too, says Joe.\n\n\u2014That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\n\n\u2014Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what's this his name is?\n\n\u2014Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.\n\n\u2014I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\n\n\u2014Who? says I.\n\n\u2014Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on Throwaway and he's gone to gather in the shekels.\n\n\u2014Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?\n\n\u2014That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\n\n\u2014He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\n\n\u2014There you are, says Terry.\n\nGoodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she's better or she's (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\n\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms. Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the road with every one.\n\n\u2014Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.\n\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king's expense.\n\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.\n\n\u2014Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!\n\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\n\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\n\n\u2014Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\n\n\u2014Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\n\n\u2014Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\n\n\u2014How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?\n\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.\n\n\u2014Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.\n\n\u2014Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\n\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\n\n\u2014What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?\n\n\u2014Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\n\n\u2014Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.\n\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\n\n\u2014Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\n\n\u2014Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?\n\n\u2014That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\n\n\u2014Who made those allegations? says Alf.\n\n\u2014I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.\n\n\u2014And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like the next fellow?\n\n\u2014Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.\n\n\u2014Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\n\n\u2014Who is Junius? says J. J.\n\n\u2014We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\n\n\u2014He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.\n\n\u2014Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.\n\n\u2014That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!\n\n\u2014Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.\n\n\u2014Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he's a father or a mother.\n\n\u2014Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\n\n\u2014O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\n\n\u2014En ventre sa m\u00e8re, says J. J.\n\n\u2014Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\n\n\u2014Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\n\n\u2014And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\n\nGob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your eye.\n\n\u2014Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.\n\n\u2014A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\n\n\u2014Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\n\n\u2014Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\n\n\u2014You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\n\n\u2014Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.\n\n\u2014Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.\n\n\u2014Amen, says the citizen.\n\n\u2014And I'm sure He will, says Joe.\n\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S. Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S. Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge, illuminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de Saba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed fo the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.\n\n\u2014Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.\n\n\u2014Qui fecit coelum et terram.\n\n\u2014Dominus vobiscum.\n\n\u2014Et cum spiritu tuo.\n\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed:\n\n\u2014Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.\n\n\u2014And so say all of us, says Jack.\n\n\u2014Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\n\n\u2014Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\n\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\n\n\u2014I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope I'm not...\n\n\u2014No, says Martin, we're ready.\n\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to five.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen,\n\n\u2014Beg your pardon, says he.\n\n\u2014Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\n\n\u2014Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a secret.\n\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\n\n\u2014Bye bye all, says Martin.\n\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\n\n\u2014-Off with you, says\n\nMartin to the jarvey.\n\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.\n\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\n\n\u2014Let me alone, says he.\n\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him:\n\n\u2014Three cheers for Israel!\n\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.\n\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a slut shouts out of her:\n\n\u2014Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\n\nAnd says he:\n\n\u2014Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\n\n\u2014He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.\n\n\u2014Whose God? says the citizen.\n\n\u2014Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.\n\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\n\n\u2014By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.\n\nBy Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\n\n\u2014Stop! Stop! says Joe.\n\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyasagos uram Lipoti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great \u00e9clat was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of Come back to Erin, followed immediately by Rakoczsy's March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light. Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra, kedves bar\u00e1ton! Visszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra! Gone but not forgotten.\n\nGob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's royal theatre:\n\n\u2014Where is he till I murder him?\n\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\n\n\u2014Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.\n\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other way and off with him.\n\n\u2014Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\n\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\n\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of d\u00e9bris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B., M. P, J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R. C. S. I.\n\nYou never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.\n\n\u2014Did I kill him, says he, or what?\n\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\n\n\u2014After him, Garry! After him, boy!\n\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.\n\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah! Elijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/107472", "artist_names": "Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young", "full_title": "Ohio by\u00a0Crosby,\u00a0Stills, Nash & Young",

2]\nI've been running all my life, now\nIn search of something I can't find\nI've been chasing rainbows\nThey're just visions in my mind\nThere's a lot of lonely people\nJust like me who need someone\nYou see, everybody needs a friend\nTo walk with and talk with\nSometimes, Mister Sun\n\n[Chorus]\nBa-da-da-da, da-da\nBa-da-da-da, da-da-da\nBa-da-da-da, da-da\nBa-da-da-da\n\n[Bridge]\nHey, Mister Sun\nYou can change the night to day\nYou can chase away the rainbows\nThey're just illusions, anyway\nAnd when I'm standing in the rain\nYou can come and be my friend\nYou can make the storm clouds break\nAnd let the sun shine through again (Again)\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nAnd tomorrow, when I'm dreaming\nOf some mountain I will climb\nYou can tap me on the shoulder\nAnd whisper to me from behind\nPlease remind me of the yesterdays\nI tried, but all alone\nYou can tell me that it's time, again\nTo walk with you\nAnd talk with you awhile, Mister Sun\n\n[Outro]\nBa-da-da-da,

Script LyricsThe movie opens in flashback to about 1980 at a fair in Indiana of some sort. With pie eating contests...\nOLD LADY: On the count of three. One, two, three!\n...ring toss...\nANNOUNCER: Try the ring toss. Three for a quarter. Look how easy it is. There you go, a winner!\n...and eventually the one the camera settles, on a boy magician named \"Harold the Great\", who is about to perform a trick, where an assistant saws a girl in a box in half with a chainsaw.\nHAROLD: And now, for my shocking finale. Not for the squeamish. Not for the faint of heart. I call my trick \"The Jaws of Death. \"\nHe turns to the girl in the box.\nHAROLD: Now. Say it. Say it.\nGIRL: Harold, use your awesome might to save me from this hopeless plight.\nHe waves a wand on her.\nHAROLD: No harm will come to you. Alakazam.\nMidway through the sawing, the girl lets loose with a series of piercing screams.\nGIRL:Help me! Help me!\nThe audience panics, and some nearby adults rush up and open the box. The girl is just pretending to be hurt and smiles up at an adult man...\nGIRL:I'm going to be an actress.\nThe adult slaps her.OPENING CREDITSDay One: Trouble is my businessThe movie cuts to a generic Hollywood beautiful person party where we see Harry (Robert Downey Jr.), fully but shabbily clothed, intentionally teetering at the edge of a pool full of bikini clad women.\nHARRY (V.O.): Hard to believe it was last Christmas that me and Harmony changed the world.  And we didn't mean to. And it didn't last long, you know. A thing like that can't.Now that I'm in L.A., I go to parties. The kind where if a girl is named Jill, she spells it J-Y-L-L-E, that bullshit.\nAt this point the camera focuses on Harry, who finally introduces himself as the narrator.\nHARRY (V.O.): That's me there. My name's Harry Lockhart, I'll be your narrator.  Welcome to L.A. Welcome to the party.\n\nClose on two guys talking, a Larry Miller-ish casting agent (played by - who else - Larry Miller)...\nHARRY (V.O.): The guy smoking, that's Dabney Shaw, my producer. He discovered me.\n...and another, played by Val Kilmer.\nHARRY (V.O.): The man with him is Perry Van Shrike, a.k.a. Gay Perry. Honest-to-God private eye, consults in film, TV. Just incorporated. He's bigtime. Also, he's gay.\nSHAW: Don't start, Perry, huh?  I seen you play ball. You're tough. But you see a naked guy, your brain says, \"I want that. \" I don't make that leap. It's like, \"Look, there's an elephant. Quick, let's drain its blood to paint my boathouse. \" It's just that that's not the first thing you think of.\nPerry laughs. Back to Harry, who\u2019s lighting a cigarette.\nHARRY (V.O.): L.A. By now you may wonder how I wound up here, or maybe not. Maybe you wonder how Silly Putty picks shit up from comic books. Point is, I don't see another goddamn narrator, so pipe down. How did I get here? See for yourself.\n\nHow Harry got to the party\nWe now cut to New York City, and then specifically to a small toy store late at night. It\u2019s obviously closed, and we hear Harry on the phone with his niece.\nHARRY (offscreen): Chloe, just run the name by me one more time because I must be missing something.\n[Cut to inside the store.Two thieves are rummaging around. One of them is Harry]\nHARRY: I'm going nuts. I've been through the store three times.\nCHLOE: Cyber Agent. C-Y-B-E- Why don't you ask an employee or something?\nHARRY: No, they're all busy.\n[Harry moves his flashlight until he finds a box similar to what she said]\nHARRY: Ah! \"Protocop, protector of man. \" Is that it? Protocop? He protects men.\nCHLOE: Uncle Harry, look around. There are signs.\n[he sees the Protocop is on the bargain bin]\nCHLOE:  That show was cancelled two years ago. Just ask- Wait, are they even open?\nHARRY:Yeah, it's holiday hours. Look- [turns to the other thief] Get away from the window. [back to the phone] I gotta go, but I'll find this.\nA large UPS truck drives by, jostling the wiring on the jury rigged alarm and setting it off.\nHARRY:Great.\nThe two run out the back door and into an alley.\nPARTNER:  Shit, Harry, that shit went wrong!\nHARRY:Give me the gun!\nPARTNER: No. Give me the bullets!\nWOMAN (O.S.): Freeze!\nAs they turn around and lift their hands, the camera pans up, revealing a woman on a fire escape with a pistol.\nHARRY:You gotta be fucking kidding me.\nWOMAN WITH GUN: We'll stand here and wait for the police.\nHARRY:[to his partner]Drop the gun. [to the woman]We didn't do anything. We are not dangerous. [to the partner]Drop the gun.\n[the partner waves the unloaded gun]\nPARTNER:Hey, lady, gun is not loaded-\nHARRY:Richie, no!\nThey are fired upon by the woman . Harry's partner is hit by a bullet that grazed Harry\u2019s arm.\nHARRY:Richie![More bullets.]  Shit!\nHarry escapes on foot. The police approaches, he\u2019s forced to turn around and take another way.\nHARRY:Oh, boy.\n[He runs from alley to alley until he encounters a milling group of men who are all dressed in dark thiefish clothing like himself. He runs up a stairway and crashes into a room with 3 or 4 people sitting around a desk. ]\nWOMAN: Take it easy. Jesus. Oh, no, no. We're not ready for you yet, sir.Go wait with the others.\nSHAW:  Grace, do me a favor, let's take him. He's ready. You're ready?\nGRACE: Ready?\nHARRY:Okay, come on.\nGRACE: You know the setup? Got any questions?\n[Harry is handed a script and takes the chair in front of Grace]\nSHAW: He's got no questions. Look at him. Let's go.\nHARRY:Let's read.\n[The cops arrive near the others in thiefish clothing. Back to the other room...]\nGRACE:  Where is he? Where's Raphael?\nHARRY:Where is he? Where's-?\n[Harry looks at the script. It's from some sort of hard boiled crime thriller in which the main character is being berated for allowing his partner to be killed.]\nHARRY: [deadpan] Beat up on me all night. You want me to give up my partner, you can go spit.\n[the cops have left the car and are approaching]\nGRACE: Quit acting like the good guy, jerk-off. You got your partner killed. He was in over his head, you knew it. You may as well have pulled the trigger. You killed him!\n[Harry looks at the page again]\nHARRY: No, I didn't- I didn't kill him. He wanted in. Why-?[The similarity to his current situation is too much. Harry loses it, throws his chair and stands up, delivering it with intensity] Why?! I didn't want him to come in on it. He insisted. I said, \"Stay at home. \" But he doesn't listen. He's such a stupid son of a bitch. I killed him, didn't I? Oh, fuck, this is my fault.\n[Harry puts his head on Grace\u2019s lap, crying and begging for forgiveness. Both she and Shaw are amused. At this moment a cop bursts through the door.]\nCOP: I'm sorry. Sorry. Hey, good luck.\n[The cop ducks back out.]\nSHAW: See, this is what I'm talking about. Old school. Method.\nGRACE: Studio.\nSHAW: Brando. Put this in the pouch to L.A. Get Gay Perry on the phone.\nMeanwhile, back at the party\u2026\nHARRY (V.O.): Now, get this, they're screen-testing me. Is that wild? One minute, I'm boosting Xboxes in the East Village the next, I'm sipping champagne in L.A.\nA blonde approaches Harry.\nBLONDE: Hi.\nHARRY:  Hey.\nBLONDE: So, what do you do?\nHARRY: I'm retired. I invented dice when I was a kid. How about you?\nBLONDE: I do a little acting.\n[Cut to the blonde, naked, being decapitated by a werewolf-like monster in a horror movie]\nBLONDE: I'm gonna see who else is here.\nHARRY (V.O.): Anyway, that's how I got to the party.\nA woman (Michelle Monaghan)  is introduced by the narrator.\nHARRY (V.O.): Now, Harmony, different story. Some will tell you she got here on account of the giant robot.  I'll show you that in a minute. But for me, robot-schmobot, she was destined to be here. Jeez, look at those stems, will you? Not that that's what constitutes why she should be here.\nHARMONY: Yes, racist. I'm serious.  The other reindeer laughed at him. Then, out of the blue, they need him.  He's as good as a fog light or whatever. You know what, so you tell me, how is it any different than: \"Don't talk to Reggie, he's black. Oh, wait, he can play basketball.\nSign him up. \" Rudolph, Reggie.\nHow Harmony got to the party\nImages of a Middle-American town.\nHARRY (V.O.): Harmony Faith Lane was your typical L.A. girl, she wasn't from there. She grew up in a burg in southern Indiana.  \"When in doubt, cut up a pig. \" That was the town motto. [child Harmony reading to her mother in bed] Like most soon-to-be-fucked-up girls, Harmony was wicked smart. Of course, credit where credit's due she had a terrific mentor. [Close on her mother.] No, not her.\n[Close on the book Harmony is reading, part of a crime series about a detective called \"Johnny Gossamer\"] Him.\nCHILD HARMONY: \"'Go to hell, Jonny Gossamer!' She poured herself into a seamless dress. From the looks of it, she spilled some. \"\n[Harmony rolls Silly Putty on the Johnny Gossamer book,making it stamp the detective\u2019s face. She then rolls the putty into a ball and plays with it.]\nHARRY (V.O.): Jonny spoke from the pages of cheap paperbacks and told of a promised land known as \"the Coast\u201d and a magical city called Los Angeles. As the years progressed, she wished he was real. Wished that he would come to Indiana to save her little sister, Jenna.\n[Harmony and Jenna sleeping. The door opens, a man takes Jenna away]\nHARRY (V.O.):You see, Papa was at her night after night. But Jonny never showed. And then the guy writing the books died. Age 16, she split.\n[Bus, then teenage Harmony sleeping inside it, Johnny Gossamer book in her hand.]\nHARRY (V.O.): Took the bus to L.A., the promised land. She'd get rich and famous and then help little sis. Before he died the guy who wrote the books said Jonny was a joke. He wrote it for money, and it was bullshit. Harmony ignored this. She knew better. I mean, who the hell was he?  He was just a writer.  And that's how she got to the same party as me-\n[The film reel skips out of the projector]\nHARRY (V.O.): Oh, shit. I skipped something. Damn it. This robot bit. I made a big deal, then I forgot. Fuck, bad narrating. Like my dad telling a joke. \"Oh, wait, back up. I forgot to tell you the cowboy rode a blue horse.\" Fuck.  I don't know if you want to see it now, but here's the fucking robot stuff. Can I say \"fuck\" more?\n[Harmony eating while watching television]\nANNOUNCER: Now back to Protocop, starring Jeff Neal.\n[A RoboCop knock-off fighting thugs in a building. Harmony hears a noise, picks up a baseball bat and goes to the kitchen. A guy dressed as Protocop is there putting cookies he dropped back into a tray \u2013 which lies next to a crate of Dos Equis bottles.]\nHARMONY: What the-? Oh, my God.\n[\u201cProtocop\u201d gets a beer bottle, opens it.]\nHARMONY: Hey!\n[The startled \u201cProtocop\u201d throws the beer he was about to drink into the wall, jumps back, stumbles on the railing, and falls down the balcony. As Harmony goes to see how the guy is doing, we then hear a news report\u2026]\nREPORTER (V.O.): Sources close to Neal, who has not worked as an actor in two years say he seemed despondent earlier tonight during a rerun of Protocop.\n[Neal is seen unconscious on the ground below, pieces of the armor spread. Cut to the reporter in front of cops checking on Neal.]\nREPORTER: The actor, who still retains a costume he wore on the show, allegedly dressed up, stumbled down the bike path and wandered into this Venice Beach house\u2026\n[We see Shaw is watching this news program]\nREPORTER (V.O.): \u2026 where aspiring actress Harmony Faith Lane was shocked to discover him.\nHARMONY: I'd jog by, \"Hi, hello, \" you know, that sort of thing.\nSHAW: Who's this?\nHARMONY: I feel for the guy. This city can't get enough of messing with people. Like putting a whoopee cushion on the seat of an electric chair. Like that.\n[Shaw talking to an executive type, who checks on a folder]\nSHAW: They always do this.You can never see below the waist. It's like a Playmate in 1964. It was always behind the bedpost or there's a shadow. You never-What am I telling you for? Invite her to something.\nBack to the present.\nHARRY (V.O.): And there it was. Bingo. Destiny.\nHarmony is seen going over the bookshelves in the house until she finds some copies of the same old paperback detective series - \"Johnny Gossamer\". She hugs them tenderly, reads from them for a bit and then passes out on a table. A sleazy man enters and, seeing her unconscious - starts to poke around in her underthings before Harry walks in.\nHARRY: You know what, you better be her doctor. Walk away. Don't think, just do it.\nSLEAZE: What, are you her brother or something? It's none of your business, man. I will fuck you up.\nHARRY:  No, you'll try. And that little experimente will end in tears, my friend.So again, for the cheap seats, do not think, walk the fuck away.Or let's you and me go outside right now.It's past my bedtime. Make a choice.\nHarry ends up being beaten to a pulp - reflecting he never was very good at fighting.\nSLEAZE: Asshole.\n[After the man walks away, Perry helps Harry up.]\nPERRY:  You all right?\nHARRY:    Yeah.\n[he gives Perry his hand]\nThanks, bro. One day, I'll actually learn how to fight.\nPERRY: Perry Van Shrike.\nHARRY:   Hey. Harry Lockhart.\n[both start waling away]\nHARRY:   I heard about you. You're the whatchamacallit, the consultant. You must be- Anyway...\nPERRY: Gay Perry?\nHARRY:  Yeah. Right. Dabney calls you that.I guess you guys are old buddies.\nPERRY:  Five years now.\nHARRY:   Wow, five years. Still gay?\nPERRY: Me? No. I'm knee-deep in pussy. I just like the name so much, I can't get rid of it.\n[Harry sees Harmony walking out with the sleazy man]\nSLEAZE:  You should know better than to fall asleep at a party. There's freaks here.\n[The two are in a bathroom, where Perry is helping Harry clean up.]\nPERRY: Dabney wants you to take detective lessons.\nHARRY:    Come again?\nPERRY: For your acting. I've got surveillance tomorrow. You game?\nHARRY:   What's the person like? Crime lord?\nPERRY: Please. I'm guessing some sad, lonely little man who single-handedly haunts his own home in the Hollywood Hills.\nHARRY:   That was incredibly gay.\n[Harlan Dexter (Corbin Bernsen) pokes his head in.]\nHARLAN: Good God. Ouch.\nHARRY: Yeah, you should see the other guy.\nPERRY: Harry, this is our generous host, Harlan Dexter.\nHARLAN: Ah, yes, of course. You're Dabney's golden boy from back East. I hope it isn't past your bedtime.\nHARRY: No, sir. My mom used to say I had the neon disease. When the neon lights came on, I woke up.\nHARLAN:I'm afraid I'm similarly afflicted. My daughter just lived 10 years in Paris. She says it is heaven for the vampire set.\n[Harlan points at the birthday cake.]\nHARLAN:If you'll excuse me, apparently I'm meant to help cut this monstrosity.\n[Harlan is seen hugging a girl]\nPERRY:Mom's gone, so it's just him and his born-again little bundle of joy.\nHARRY: Born-again? That's precious.\nPERRY:Isn't it? Three months ago, she was suing him over Mom's millions.  He called her a- Well, a bad word. Cunt. Welcome to Hollywood.\n[Film gets out of the reel]\nHARRY (V.O.): Okay, I apologize. That is a terrible scene. It's like, \"Why was that in the movie?   Gee, you think maybe it'll come back later, maybe?\" I hate that. A TV's on, talking about the new power plant. Wonder where the climax will happen. Or that shot of the cook in Hunt for Red October. Sorry.\n[Harry and Perry in the party\u2019s entrance, getting mementos from the receptionist]\nRECEPTIONIST: Hi, thank you for coming.\nHARRY: Hey, do you know that blond gal who just left?\nRECEPTIONIST: Oh, the one with the guy that beat the shit out of you? No. Bye, have a better night.\n[They continue walking down the stairs]\nHARRY: She had something, that gal, this quality. Like the girl from high school, the one that got away. You know what I mean? That haunts you still.\nPERRY:Yeah, I had that.\nHARRY:  You did?\nPERRY: Bobby Mills.\nHARRY:  Huh. Well, maybe you should try to get in touch. I got 5 bucks says you could still get him.\nPERRY: Really? That's funny. I got a 10 says, \"Pass the pepper.\" [Perry sits on his car] I got two quarters harmonizing on \"Moonlight in Vermont. \"\nHARRY:  What?\nPERRY: Talking money.\nHARRY:  A talking monkey?\nPERRY: Talking monkey, yeah.Came here from the future. Ugly sucker. Only says, \"Ficus. \" Detective lessons tomorrow.Don't forget.\nHARRY:  Okay.\nPERRY: And Harry... Come here.  That girl, I know her. She's done some work for me.Try the Domino Room.\nHARRY:  Where's that?\n[Images of downtown LA, and then the Domino Room. Harry shows up at the club and walks past the doorman without being hassled. As he sees Harmony on the bar, he encounters a woman named Flicka (Angela Lindvall).]\nFLICKA: Hey there. I'm Flicka.\nHARRY:  Hey. How are you?\nFLICKA:  Good. So, what do you do?\nHARRY:  I'm a private detective. And you?\nFLICKA:  I'm a stewardess.\nHARRY: Really?\nFLICKA:  Yeah. [Flicka starts leaving]Well, nice to meet you.\nHARRY:  That it?\nFLICKA:  Yeah.\nHARRY:   Yep.\n[Harry takes a seat besides Harmony at the bar]\nHARRY:  Could I have a Jack and soda? Thanks. [turns to Harmony] Evening. Harry. God, I'm sore. I mean, physically, not like a guy who's angry in a movie in the 1950s.Didn't I see you at a party hours ago?\nHARMONY: Why?\nHARRY:   Why what?\nHARMONY: Why me? Seriously, why not the girl over there? Look, she's very pretty.\nHARRY:   Which one?\nHARMONY: On the left, next to Brazilian Billy Bob Thornton.\n[we see said guy, with a blonde and a brunette next to him]\nHARRY:  Oh, that's a bit of a reach. I'm interrupting. I feel badly. What are you drinking?\nHARMONY: Bad.\nHARRY: Bad? Sorry?\nHARMONY: You feel bad.\nHARRY:   Bad?\nHARMONY: \"Badly\" is an adverb. To say you feel badly says that the mechanism which allows you to feel is broken.\nHARRY:   Well, that one over there?\nHARMONY: Between-[she looks at the girl again] Oh, God, nix, nix. That's-  The blond. The blond's pathetic.\nHARRY:   Because?\nHARMONY: For starters, she's been fucked more times than she's had hot meals.\nHARRY:  I heard. It was neck and neck, and then she skipped lunch.\nHARMONY:  Worst thing, though....\nHARRY:   Do tell.\nHARMONY: Worst thing is she's 35 years old and still trying to act. I see her at auditions all the time. It's over, baby. You missed.\nHARRY:   That's charitable of you.May I ask how old you are?\nHARMONY:  Go for it.\nHARRY:   Okay, how old are you?\nHARMONY:  Thirty-four.\nHARRY:   Yeah?\nHARMONY:   I'm a baby.\nHARRY:   Where's your buddy? The guy you- The guy you left the party with?\nHARMONY:   He's a fucking asshole. I just needed a ride.Sorry, I swear a lot.\nHARRY:   I know. It's okay.\nHARMONY:   Did you know the host?\nHARRY:   No.\nHARMONY:   He looked familiar, though.  Probably an actor.\n[a girl arrives and stands between Harry and Harmony]\nHARMONY\u2019S FRIEND: Buzz buzz. Go away, Mr. Fly.\nHARRY:   I was talking to your friend.\nHARMONY\u2019S FRIEND: She doesn't want to talk to you.\nHARRY:  Sunshine, she'll be back to you in a minute. Relax.\nHARMONY\u2019S FRIEND: She doesn't have a minute.\nHARRY:   Tell you what, if you change your mind about that drink, I'll be over there with Native American Joe Pesci.\n[Harmony sees the guy, and laughs]\nHARMONY: You are so....\nHARRY:  That was good, right?\nHARMONY\u2019S FRIEND: Why are you humoring him? Stop it. You know what, there's an empty table over there. I hear it's a recommended cheeseball hangout.\nHARRY:Your mouth is a recommended place to put a sock. [looks at Harmony]Princess.[and the other] Scary friend.\n[as he tries to leave\u2026]\nHARMONY:  Goddamn it.Harry Lockhart, are you gonna recognize me or what? God! Embrey, Indiana! Loves snakes, afraid of spiders. Come on, remember? You were Amazing Harry- No, no, no. Harold the Great.\nHARRY:Harmony?\nHARMONY:  You cut me in half, remember?\nHARMONY\u2019S FRIEND: Harmony\u2026\nHARRY: Oh, shit. Oh, my God. How are you?\n[Harmony hugs Harry, the friend looks pissed.]\nHARRY (V.O.): Okay, I was a bad narrator again...\n[the magician from the opening sequence is seen again]\n...because the kid at the beginning, the magician, that was me. I don't want to put this on you... but if you've been paying attention, I shouldn't have to-\n[an elderly couple walks in front of the \u201cHarold the Great\u201d sign]\nGreat. No wonder. Ma and Pa Kettle. I got an idea. Why not put these two lame-o extras in front of the mammoth fucking lens? Boo.\n[said extras turn to the camera]\nScat. Fat lady, leave.\n[the two extras move out of the camera\u2019s view]\nSee there? \"Harold. \"\n[he even scribbles around the sign to highlight it]\n[now it\u2019s a group of cheerleaders in high school]\nHARRY (V.O.): Remember how I said this high school chick haunted me? How seeing Harmony made me think of her? That's because it was her. [teenage Harmony is circled, with an arrow reading \u201cHer\u201d] It all came flooding back. How I was the one she confided in. [ditto with teen Harry, only reading \u201cme\u201d] While she was doing every other guy in school. [Teen with an arrow pointing at him reading \u201cSome Asshole\u201d. Horns are scribbled on his head]\n[Harmony and Harry talking; she eventually puts her head in his shoulder]\nHARRY (V.O.): It was the first time I felt that how pitying someone and wanting to fuck them can get all tangled up in your head. Overwhelming sadness. Meanwhile, you got a rodney.Is that sick? I think- Yeah, I think that's sick.\nBack to the present.\nHARMONY: Leaving my sister back home, leaving her there all alone....Hardest thing I ever did.Do you remember when we were real little and a movie crew came to town?\nHARRY: That mystery flick with the guy, Jonny what's-his-name?\nHARMONY:  Gossamer.\nHARRY: Jonny Gossamer. Right. Your mom went nuts, and she bought all the books and stuff.\nHARMONY:  That was- God, that was forever ago.\nHARRY: Yeah, that was back in the day.\nHARMONY: Harry... I didn't get famous.\nHARRY: Yet.\nHARMONY: I did... get to do this one commercial.\nHARRY: You're shitting me. Which one?\nHARMONY: Well, you know the one with the bear? And it goes- Well, this is funny.  \"I prefer Genaros, but-\"\nHARRY: \"But I'm a bear, what do I know? I suck heads off fish. \" That was you?  Oh, my God.\nHARMONY:  Yeah, it was. Yeah.\nHARRY: That's awesome.\nHARMONY:  Oooh, Commercial.\nHARRY:Come on, that's a big deal. That's a national commercial.\nHARMONY:  Harry, stop. It's nothing. There was actually this kind of cool moment where I got to sort of do the wave. [she waves]\"I prefer Genaros. \" Whatever, it's nothing.\nHARRY: It's pretty cool.\nHARMONY: It's nothing special at all.\nHARRY:    Well, I think it's special. [she chugs on her beer; close on\u2026] Punk-rock Steven Seagal thinks it's special. Right there, at your 11 o'clock. [Harmony sees the guy and nearly chokes on the beer laughing] That's dead-on, right? That's all right. I had him pegged when I came in.Come back to the hotel for a little while, just have one drink. Bring your friend. It'd just be a drink. You'll be home faster than you can say \"Jack Robinson. \"\nHARMONY: I don't know about that. I can say \"Jack Robinson\" pretty fast.\nHARRY:    I'm timing you.\nHARMONY:  Jack Robinson.\nCut to: Bedroom, next day\nTwo champagne glasses, and then Harry waking up with a girl in his bed... He thinks it's Harmony, but is shocked to find out it's her hostile friend instead. She comes towards him with a smile on his face, but he jumps out of bed.   Harry runs to Harmony's place and knocks on her door.\nHARMONY: Do you have any idea what time it is?\nHARRY:    I'm really sorry. God, you still look great. You're just stunning. I like-\nHARMONY:  Why are you here?\nHARRY:    Good question. Sounds crazy, but I don't remember what occurred...between the hours of 2 and 5, a blur.\nHARMONY: Really? Where's Marleah?\nHARRY:    Marleah?\nHARMONY: The girl you....\nHARRY:    Marleah fell asleep at my place and I didn't see you leave-\nHARMONY: I left when you had your tongue down her throat.\nHARRY:   I did?\nHARMONY: Yeah.\nHARRY:   God. No, wrong throat, wrong woman. That's bad.\nHARMONY: Yeah, that's bad. You got 10 seconds, Harry.\nHARRY:    Oh, boy, pressure, pressure. I came here... because I think you're intelligent and attractive-\nHARMONY:That's plenty. Stop. Oh, my God! I can't believe you'd come here to tell me you like me after you fucked my friend!\nHARRY:   That's just it, I didn't. I believe that I did not.\nHARMONY: What? You said you don't remember!\nHARRY:    If I don't remember because I was drunk, how could I have gotten it up? I know this is outrageous and not normal. I'm not pretending that I'm normal. I just chickened out-\n[Harmony slams the door on him; next we see Harry walking down the street]\nHARRY:   Moron. Why? Why? Why?\n[He looks down, and then lights a cigarette before walking away]Day two: The Lady in the LakeHARRY (V.O.):And the plots, they all have this thing, this formula that was so cool.\n[we then see Harry is on the passenger seat of Perry\u2019s car, which is parked]\nHARRY: Seriously, I would go through one in a day.\nPERRY:  A whole book in one day. Wow.\nHARRY:See, Gossamer would always take on two cases that were seemingly unrelated.  One's normal and the other's some wild shit... then you'd find out that they're connected. That it's all one case. That's the essence of the-\nPERRY: Yeah, I get that all the time. Would you mind not rooting around in there?\n[Harry finds a small gun in the glove compartment]\nHARRY: It's tiny. Is this real?\nPERRY: Yeah, it's a derringer. It's loaded. I call it my faggot gun.\nHARRY: Because?\nPERRY:  It's only good for a couple shots, then you gotta drop it for something better.   You asked, chief. [Harry puts it back] On with our lesson.\n[Harry and Perry leave the car, the latter carrying a briefcase]\nPERRY:  My client is one Allison Ames. A-M-E-S.\nHARRY: Ames.\nPERRY: Female. She hired me to do some video surveillance.\nHARRY: Is she a looker?\nPERRY: Oh, man. She opens the door, she got nothing on but the radio. Invites me to sit down, sits on my lap... fires up a smoke.\nHARRY: Really?\nPERRY:  No. Idiot. She hired me over the phone.Paid for it with a credit card.\nHARRY: Okay.\nPERRY:  Rule number one: This business, real life, it's boring. Do you have to smoke?\nHARRY: You want me to put it out?\nPERRY: Yeah, soon as you find a large, brown clump of shrubs, just throw it in there.\nThey are approaching a woodsy house\nPERRY: So you knew Harmony in high school. You said she dissed you.\nHARRY: No, not really. She fucked every other guy but me. No, that's not true. She made one concession.  She agreed not to fuck my best friend, Chook Chutney. He was my best friend, so she gave me that.\nPERRY: Well, that was nice of her.\nHARRY: Even if he asked, she said she wouldn't.\nPERRY: Stay put. Be quiet.\nThey hide behind a woodpile with a video camera .\nPERRY:\"Chook Chutney\"? Yeah, he's gay.\nPerry comes close to the cottage with a camera, walks back once someone comes out of the house in a ski mask, gets in an old beater car and drives off.\nHARRY: What's wrong with his car?\nPERRY: Do I look like a mechanic? Come on.\nHarry and Perry follow them by car.\nHARRY:  Are we gonna follow him? Where'd he go? He was right in front of us, then he cut in- Where is he?\nThey seem to lose him and stop by a pond next to a low ridge to get their bearings\nHARRY: What the hell. He's gotta be somewhere. He turned right in front of us.\nAs they look around, the beater car comes shooting airborne over the ridge and lands in the pond.\nHARRY: Ow!\nPERRY: Jesus!\nThey quickly leave the car\nHarry Shit!\nHarry rushes towards the pond.\nPERRY: Harry, come back. Harry. There's no one in the car. Harry.\nHARRY:  What?\nHarry is now waist-deep in the water\nPERRY: Harry, stop.\nHarry turns around.\nHARRY: I think it's going down.\nPERRY:  Wait, the sound.\nHe points to the car\nHARRY:  Check the back seat.\nPERRY:  No, get the keys! The keys! Get the keys!\nPerry dives into the water.\nHARRY: Perry. Perry? Shit. Perry!\nPerry emerges holding a body. It's a woman in a sundress.\nPERRY: Watch out.\nHARRY: Where'd she come from?\nPERRY: She was in the trunk. I had to shoot the lock to get it open. Oh, Jesus.\nHarry gets her legs so both can leave the body on the sand.\nPERRY:  God, what did they do to her face?\nBoth lie down for a while, recovering their breaths.\nHARRY: Is she dead?\nPERRY:  No. She's resting her eyes for a minute. Of course she's fucking dead. Her neck's broken.\nHarry notices she has no underwear, pulls her skirt down to cover the \u201cparts\u201d. A car breaking is heard. Harry then points up, Perry turns and sees two figures in ski masks appear on top of the ridge.\nHARRY: Hey, what the hell's going on?\nPERRY:   Shut up.\nHARRY: Hey, we got a dead girl here!\nPERRY:  Hey, shut up.\nThe masked guys return to their car.\nHARRY: Two guys in masks, and there they go.\nPERRY:  What the fuck is going on?\nHARRY:  This is bad. We gotta roll before the cops come.\nPERRY:  Nix. We go right to the cops.\nHARRY:  Exactly, to the cops who'll believe that she broke her neck before you shot her in the head.\nPERRY: What?\nPerry checks the corpse\u2019s face, she has a huge gunshot wound above one eye.\nHARRY:   Come on, we gotta go.\nPERRY:  Oh, God.\nHarry picks up Perry\u2019s briefcase and gun\nHARRY:    We gotta go. Go, go, go.\nPERRY:  Oh, God. Oh, God.\nHarry throws the gun in the lake\nHARRY:     All right, we're out of here.\nPERRY:   We gotta go, go, go.\nPERRY: Where's my gun?\nHARRY:   No, I-\nPERRY:  Give me my gun.\nHARRY:  I got rid of it.\nPERRY:  Say again.\nHARRY:Threw it in the lake. You wouldn't, I would.I got priors in New York, so I can't be messing around-\nPERRY:  You threw it away?\n[Perry tries advancing on Harry, he lifts the metal briefcase to protect himself]\nHARRY: It's evidence. Watch it. Relax.\nPERRY:   Okay, okay. No, I'm sorry. I got a little nonplussed there.\nHARRY: This is crazy. I understand.\n[Perry stares at something in the briefcase]\nPERRY: Whoa! What is that? Is that a clue?\nHARRY: What do you mean?\nPERRY: Do you see that?\nHARRY: In the thing?\n[he hits him in the head with the case]\nPERRY: What were you thinking? My $2000 ceramic Vektor my mother got me as a special gift you threw next to the car. What happens when they drag the lake? You think they'll find my pistol? Jesus. Look up \"idiot\" in the dictionary. You know what you'll find?\nHARRY:  A picture of me?\nPERRY:  No, the definition of the word \"idiot,\" which you fucking are.\n[Perry\u2019s car driving away]\nPERRY (O.S.): Bitch client.\n[cut to inside the car]\nPERRY: Hires me, has me witness a murder.\nHARRY: Can I use a dry towel? This towel's wet.\nPERRY: No.\nHARRY: This towel is wet.\nPERRY: The towel is for the seat.\nHARRY: This was for your shoes. You handed it to me for my face? This is wet. Can I use a dry-?\nPERRY: It's dirty. No.\nHARRY: Can I-?\nPERRY: No. Stop dripping. Shit better be improving your acting.\n[Perry arrives at the hotel. Harry is asleep in the passenger seat, Perry pokes his face]\nPERRY: Get out.\nHARRY: Sorry about the gun.\nPERRY: Whatever. Out. Go. Sleep badly. Any questions, hesitate to call.\nHARRY:  Bad.\nPERRY:  Excuse me?\nHARRY: Sleep bad. Otherwise, it seems like the mechanism that allows sleep-\nPERRY: What, fuckhead? \"Badly\" is an adverb. Who taught you grammar? Out. Vanish.\n[Harry opens the  door and gets out]\nHARRY:  I'll give you a buzz.\nPERRY:  Die.\nAfter Harry is dropped off and is walking away, Perry returns.\nHARRY:  That's all right, don't apologize.\n[Perry extends Harry's ringing cell phone that was left in the car]\nPERRY: Blow me. You forgot this.\nHARRY:  Oh, thanks. [Harry answers the phone] Hello?\nMAN ON PHONE: I'm trying to locate Harry Lockhart.\nHARRY:  Speaking.\nMAN ON PHONE: I'm detective Sgt. Kale. [Harry pokes Perry\u2019s shoulder, wanting him to listen as well] Mind answering a question or two?\nHARRY: Of course, no problem. Fire away, officer.\nKALE: Thank you.   Are you familiar with a woman by the name of Harmony Faith Lane?\nHARRY:  Yeah, what's this-?\nKALE: Are you aware of giving your number to Miss Lane recently? On a slip of paper, perhaps?\nHARRY:  No.\nKALE: Are you sure?\nHARRY:  Well, maybe she had my number. Why?\nKALE: We're required by law to treat every suicide as a potential homicide. Harmony Lane shot herself, sir.\nHARRY:  Suicide?\nKALE: Yes-[connection starts to get really bad]\nHARRY: Hello?  Hello?\n[Harry turns off the call]\nHARRY: I'll be goddamned.\nPERRY:  Jesus.\n[a saddened Harry sits, back against the car door]\nPERRY: Don't blame yourself. Listen... sometimes these things just happen-\nHARRY: For a reason.For a reason? Fuck that.Why? Because I fall off a building, 10 people in Baltimor survive a bus crash? Swell, they're enjoying Baltimore. I'm lying here with my brains out.\nPERRY: I've been to Baltimore, you win. Listen... I'm really sorry. I gotta go.\nHARRY:  Yeah.\nPERRY: [puts his hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder] I gotta go. [pushes Harry\u2019s head, making him lean forward] I have to go.\nWith Harry no longer touching his car, Perry drives away\nA television playing Harmony\u2019s commercial. She\u2019s dressed as an European milkmaid in a castle full of people in German costumes. A cheesy CGI bear comes out of a cake carrying bottles of beer, leading Harmony to wave. The bear throws the bottles to the people there, who proceed to dance and party. As shots of beer being poured into a glass are shown, we hear the announcer.\nANNOUNCER: Genaros. Pure drinking pleasure.\nCut to the bear in front of Harmony, who just keeps laughing.\nBEAR: I prefer Genaros. But what do I know? I'm a bear. I suck the heads off fish.\nThe bear shows a fish in his paw, puts it in his mouth and removes it decapitated. Harmony turns to the camera and laughs one more time as the announcer says \u201cGenaros\u201d.\nA heartbroken Harry enters his hotel room.\nHARRY (V.O.): I was tired. I was pissed. I was wetter than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club. [Harry empties his pockets in a table] I needed a hot bath, a warm bed. [he sees a gift basket and a champagne bottle on said table, grabs the latter]\n[Harry drowning his sorrows with champagne, while smoking and talking on the phone]\nHARRY (V.O.):But the night had other plans for me.\nHARRY:  Oh, you did?\nCHLOE:   I got the Cyber Agent.\nHARRY:  You got the Cyber Agent.\nCHLOE:  It has all the cool weapons.\nHARRY:  You got Protocop coming too. It's gonna be worth more too because I think he's, like, paralyzed now.\n[knocking on the door; he opens, it\u2019s a wet and depressed Harmony]\nHARRY: [shocked] Son of a bitch!\nHARRY (V.O.): See, I forgot, old Jonny, he always had two cases. Remember?\n[Harry hugs Harmony]\nHARRY: How are you?\nHARMONY: Hey. She's gone, Harry.\nHARRY:  Yeah.\nHARMONY: She's gone.\nHARRY:  I know. Who?\n\n[Flashback, Harmony questioned by cops in front of an apartment ]\nCOP: Fact is, she stole not only your credit card, but your ID. We're very sorry about the mix-up on our part.\n[Harmony gets sad before the camera cuts to inside the apartment, where cops are inspecting the place, a rifle lies on the bed, and the legs of a stretched body are seen on the floor]\nCOP (O.S.): So are you willing to positively identify this woman as your-\n\nBack to Harry\u2019s apartment, where Harmony is smoking, screaming, and running back and forth.\nHARMONY: My sister!\nHARRY:  Your sister was here?\nHARMONY: Yes!Oh, God! God, we haven't spoken in years. She's never forgiven me for leaving her all alone.\nHARRY:  Fine. I'm just gonna get you a blanket.\nHARMONY: I don't want a blanket!\nHARRY:  But you're shivering.\nHARMONY: I don't care!\nHARRY:  You're freaking me out. Will you relax, okay?\nHARMONY: Oh, God.\nHARRY:  I'm so glad that you're okay, but now, I don't know, you're making me more nervous. Sit down.\nHARMONY:  Okay.\nHARRY:  Tell me what happened.\nHARMONY: Yesterday, Jenna, she got into my house, Harry. She must have been broke, I don't know. She swiped 200 bucks, a credit card, California ID, God knows what else.\nHARRY:  Right.\nHARMONY:  Oh, God. No more lies, Harry.\nHARRY: No.  No.\nHARMONY: Are you a detective? [inhales from the cigarette] Are you a detective?\nHARRY:  Who told you that? [takes a sip from the champagne glass]\nHARMONY: Flicka. Flicka. You know, my friend? She told me. She told me you were a detective. If you are, then I really need your help.\nHARRY:  Well-\n[Harmony tries to drink out of the glass Harry just emptied]\nHARRY: That's empty, honey.\n[Harmony gets up, starts talking while wildly gesturing]\nHARMONY: Okay, I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but listen. Okay. Okay.My sister's been living out here....\nHARRY (V.O.): Harmony's sister, dead. What the hell? What was she even doing here? The lady in the lake, now the sister.This was two corpses in three hours. Am I crazy? That's unusual, right?Yeah, looking back, I maybe should've told her...\n[Harry had been staring at Harmony\u2019s cleavage, and a breast is escaping]\nHARRY (V.O.):...I wasn't really a nipple- Detective. Detective. Sorry. I should've said something, but she wouldn't shut up.\nHARMONY: The card she stole from me was maxed out! Right before she died, she charged over $2000 on it. That's weird, isn't it? Sentron something. Some bullshit company! Plus- Red flag, Harry. She took her birth control pill for the day. Why would she even bother with the pill, huh? She was murdered, Harry. She was murdered. She was murdered.\nHARRY:  Honey, all right. Relax, relax, relax. Okay, relax.\nHARMONY: Are you gonna help me, Harry?\n(She gets her face close to Harry\u2019s)\nHARRY:   I gotta check my schedule-\nHARMONY:  If you're not gonna help me... I need to get out of here, find someone that'll help me.\nHARRY:   I just gotta check my schedule.\nHARMONY: Can you help me? If you're not gonna help me, I need to find somebody else!\nHARRY:   My caseload is pretty-\nHARMONY: Oh, Harry, thank you.\n[Harmony passes out. Harry carries her to bed, dries her with a towel, then opens her wet shirt. He then sees a spider walk from Harmony\u2019s neck to her chest]\nHARRY:   Yuck, come on.\n[Harry tries to flick the spider off, then it enters Harmony\u2019s bra. He searches for its location, and hits her breast, causing Harmony to wake up screaming.]\nHARRY:It was nothing. I didn't do anything.\nHARMONY: What are you doing?\nHARRY:I didn't do anything.\nHARMONY: You were grabbing my tit.\nHARRY:No, there was a spider. There was a big spider.\nHARMONY:  Oh, please, whatever.\nHARRY:  I swear to God.\n[he tries to find it on the bed\u2019s side]\nHARRY: Look, I'll find it. I'll find the thing. Where are you? Fuzzy little bitch.\nHARMONY:  Whatever. It's okay, I believe you.\nHARRY: Clearly, you don't.\nHARMONY: Look, Harry, you grabbed my tit. It's life, all right? It's no biggie.\nHARRY: No biggie? Guy grabs your tit, \"That's life, no biggie\"? I mean, what kind of talk is that? [Harmony laughs] No, you tell me. What kind of talk is that? I can't believe you. I can't believe that that's the reaction that-\n[she finds a spider leg near her nipple]\nHARMONY: See there?\nHARRY:Yeah.\nHARMONY: I trust you.\nHARRY: Right.\nHARMONY: What is your problem? I'm letting you off the hook. You didn't do anything.\nHARRY: No, but you thought I did. Do you get it? I'm on the hook. The hook is my home. Do you understand? [she laughs] Listen to me. I grab your tit, it's a fucking biggie! That came out wrong. But what I'm saying is you act like, \"Oops, it's an okay lapse. You know, everybody does it. \" What the fuck kind of guys you hang out with here? I mean, are you the kind of girl who like, you know...?\nHARMONY: Who what, Harry? Who what?\nHARRY: Forget it. I'm sorry, just relax.\n\nHarry heads to the loo. The bathroom is long and deep with the toilet on the far end, a bathtub to the left of the toilet and a towel closet to the right of the toilet.\nHARRY: Just get some rest, okay? Okay, we'll start on your case tomorrow. All right? Afternoon good?\nHARMONY:  Whatever, Harry. I'm going.\nHARRY: Okay.\nHARMONY: I'm taking some sweats, all right?\nHARRY: Yeah, anything you want to borrow.\nHARMONY:  I'll give them back.\nHARRY: Yeah. Yeah, anything in the drawer. If it's in the drawer, it's clean.\nHarry is relieving himself standing up when something on the left catches his eye. He turns to look without interrupting the stream. It\u2019s the corpse from the car trunk,  someone's stashed it in his bathroom. He winds up covering the with pee.]\nHARMONY: Night, Harry. Harry? This is....This is really great.\nHARRY: Isn't it?\nHARMONY:  I'm leaving.\nHARRY: Yeah, some nice rest.\nHARMONY: Bye.\n[Harry falls grabbing his stomach, clearly retching]\nHARRY:  Fuck off-!\n[Perry in his car]\nPERRY: Say again? They gave her back?\n[Harry crawled into the towel closet]\nHARRY: Yes. She's in my shower. I'm looking at her, for chrissake.\nPERRY: That's impossible. They don't even know you.\nHARRY: You're right. The body can't be here. This is all a dream. There's Elmo the elf. Good morning, Elmo! What\u2019s new?\nPERRY: Shut up. How did they get in?\nHARRY: I don't know.  How am I supposed to know? The goddamn fire escape, maybe.\nPERRY:Okay, first things first. We gotta move her somewhere. You got gloves?\nHARRY: Excuse me?\nPERRY: Gloves. Do you have gloves? You have to move her. If it's a frame-up, some asshole's calling the cops on you right now. Do this: Wrap up the body in a blanket, a sheet, anything.\nHARRY: Okay, any particular kind of gloves?\nPERRY: Yes, fawn. Will you fucking hurry?\nHARRY: Perry?\nPERRY: Yeah?\nHARRY: I peed on it.\nPERRY: What? You peed on what?\nHARRY: I peed on the corpse. Can they do, like, an ID from that?\nPERRY: I'm sorry, you peed on-?\nHARRY: On the corpse. My question is-\nPERRY: No, my question. I get to go first. Why in poo-perfect hell would you pee on a corpse?\nHARRY: It's not like I did it for kicks. God, you said this doesn't happen. This is your fault!\nPERRY:  Shut up and listen. First, we have to wrap the body. Second, you've got to find the gun. Say this with me, \"Find the gun. \"\nHARRY: Find the gun, find the gun. Damn it, I threw it in the lake.\nPERRY:Not my gun, idiot. They dropped the body on you, it's a frame-up. Then they also have planted a gun, trust me. Move it. I'll be there in four minutes.\n[Perry driving to the hotel, then Harry searching for a gun. Harry quickly finds it under the bed.]\n[Down in the hotel lobby Harmony is just leaving as the cops arrive, and talk to the clerk]\nCOP: Caller specified room 714, some sort of brawl or something. Violent.\nCLERK: Yeah, 714. Lockhart. Let me get you the key.\nHARMONY:  Actually, it's not 714, it's 514. I was just up there, and it's really noisy.\nCOP: Let's get the key.\nHARMONY:  Yep, pretty awful.\n[Harmony calls Harry as Perry rushes behind her. Perry comes out of the elevator in the seventh floor, and is then seen walking along with Harry to the bathroom, while Harry\u2019s phone rings]\nPERRY:  Don't answer that.\nHARRY:  Yeah, duh.\n[inside the bathtub, the corpse is wrapped in a towel]\nPERRY:  That it?\nHARRY: No, that's the corpse from the last guy who stayed here.\nPERRY: Fuck off. Was there a gun?\n[they bundle up the corpse again]\nHARRY:Yeah, it's right here. Perry, sons of bitches made us, made me. I'm in town for two days, they know who I am and where to find me. Come on!\nPERRY: That's impossible.\nHARRY: Yeah, it's totally nuts.\nPERRY: Back stairway.\n[They\u2019re running in the corridor while carrying the wrapped body]\nHARRY:I forgot to tell you, Harmony's alive. She thinks her sister was murdered.\nPERRY: Come again?\nHARRY:Never mind.\n[They can't figure out how to get it out of the hotel. Upon seeing a sign reading \u201cRoof Access\u201d they stare at each other\u2026]\nCut to: OUTSIDE\n[The body is seen falling from the roof, aiming for a dumpster in an alley. It misses and bounces off the edge of the dumpster.]\n[Harry and Perry rush down the stairs. Then Perry\u2019s car is seen backing into the alley.]\nHARRY: See, these dudes tonight, they see two assholes out of nowhere. What do they think?\nPERRY:   They think we know something. They panic. They got a body, they've gotta dispose of the evidence.\nHARRY:In my shower? Come on, you said real life.\nPERRY:  They were setting you up, dummy. It happens in real life.\nHARRY: They're not setting me up. Shut up. You change your tune every five minutes.\n[They shove the body into the trunk of the car\u2026 just at that moment the police drive by.]\nPERRY:Kiss me.\nHARRY:What? No, no, no.\n[Perry grabs Harry and kisses him. We see the cops from inside their car\u2026]\nCOP: Check out Doris and Lucinda over here.\n[The cops drive away. A disgusted Harry breaks the kiss, spits and wipes his mouth]\nHARRY:These lessons suck.  I quit. This is not being a detective. Corpses floating in lakes, people kissing people. This is wrong. This is every shade of wrong.\nHARMONY (OS): Somebody wanna fill me in?\n[Harmony is standing right behind them]\nHARRY:[to Perry] She thinks I'm a detective, so go along with it.\nPERRY: What?\nHARRY:Don't fuck me up.\n[Harry runs towards Harmony]\nHARRY:Hey.\nHARMONY: Do you know the cops are looking for you, Harry?\nHARRY:They are?\nHARMONY: Yeah. I sent them to the wrong room. I didn't know what else to do.\nHARRY:You did fine. Perry and I, we're just-\nHARMONY: Hiya, Perry.\n[Perry salutes as he\u2019s adjusting the body and closing the trunk]\nHARRY:We're just running, you know, a game.Perry, what do you call it?\nHARMONY: What are you talking about, Harry?\nHARRY:The old Bring Them In and Push Them Out. That's what we're doing.\nHARMONY: What's going on? Why are you and Perry nacking on each other?\n[Perry\u2019s car driving away]\nHARRY (V.O.): I sent her home believing, A, we'd meet tomorrow to go over her case, and, B, I wasn't actually gay. Do not ask me how I did B.\n[inside the car]\nHARRY:Why didn't we just leave it there?\nPERRY: Think, dummy. A 911 call from your hotel room, all of a sudden, there's a corpse outside? Bad idea. Speaking of bad ideas, what's this about you taking on your own case? Of all the dipshit things to do.Killed herself, by the way.\nHARRY:Huh?\nPERRY:Killed herself. I solved your case for you.\nHARRY: No, no, no. Harmony's convinced-\nPERRY: I don't care about- Listen to me. Little sis punched her own ticket.\nHARRY: Okay. Gotcha.\nPERRY: All right, this looks good up ahead. Time to lose the luggage.\n[Harry walks out, opens the trunk]\nHARRY: Sorry, sweetheart. You deserved better.\n[Harry closes the door, having ditched the body at a random street side location.]Day Three: The Little SisterHARMONY (V.O.): Before I left, I got her into foster care.   I've never told you just how awful he treated her. My dad, I'm talking about.\nHarry and Harmony are in the restaurant of his hotel.\nHARRY:I'll tell you what, I take notes, in general, so if you're just real specific, thorough and precise, that'll help.\nHARMONY: I remember only lying to her one time. I said to her:  \"Maybe the man who is living here is not your father.\"\nHARRY:You told your sister she was adopted, yeah?\nHARMONY:  No, I did one better. I told her her real father was an actor who was in the movie that came through town.\nHARRY: Jonny Gossamer-\nHARMONY:  Jonny Gossamer movie. That's right. I told Jenna one day she'd go to Hollywood and she'd meet her famous, real father.\n[Flashback to Jenna\u2019s crime scene. On the apartment\u2019s blood-spattered board, there was the front page of an Embry newspaper from 1980, with the headline \u201cLos Angeles Film Crew Invades Embry\u201d]\nHARMONY: She believed me, Harry, and she came out here looking for him.\nHARRY:Okay, this is a bunch. I can start my process, I guess.\n[we see Harry\u2019s notes\u2026 a cat with a human face, alongside a caption reading \u201cGato!\u201d]\nHARMONY: Thank you.\nHARRY:I'm on the case. [puts the lap napkin in front of his hand] Here is my card. [once he pulls the napkin, the hand\u2019s holding a paper napkin reading \u201cThe Amazing Harold\u201d] It's a magic card, so...\nHARMONY:  Wow, \"the Amazing Harold. \"[she takes the napkin]\nHARRY: Just say \"abracadabra. \"\nHARMONY: What happened, somebody sue you? It used to be \"alakazam\" when you cut me in half. And, not to be picky, but it was \"Harold the Great. \"\nHARRY:No, I used to be great, now I'm amazing. Get with it.\n[Harry\u2019s phone rings]\nPERRY:Hi, it's me. You hear anything?\nHARRY:No, there's nothing in the papers, so.... I'm busy working on Harmony's case.\nPERRY:What case? Leave her alone. News on Channel 5, just starting. Call me after.\n[Harry goes to a nearby television, Harmony eventually gets by his side]\nREPORTER: -a kidnapping gone wrong. It is unclear why his daughter was subsequently murdered or where for she was almost certainly killed and then moved, police sources say.  Veronica Dexter was reported missing yesterday afternoon when she failed to greet her boyfriend at the airport. Miss Dexter recently made headlines when she returned from Paris and withdrew her multimillion-dollar lawsuit against her father actor-turned-entrepreneur Harlan Dexter. Mr. Dexter owns the prestigious Dexter Clinic. His wife died last spring, prompting Veronica's return to the U.S. and a father-daughter reconciliation following years of estrangement. Veronica Dexter, 25 years old yesterday. Paul.\nCut to: BUILDING BALCONY\nHarry and Perry are talking.\nHARRY:We were just at that party. Are you telling me...that the girl in the lake, that was Veronica Dexter?\nPERRY: Positive ID, scars, dental records.\nHARRY: You talked to your police guy?\nPERRY: Yeah, not much there. The lab report came back, no sign of rape. Boils down to this: Veronica Dexter, yesterday afternoon about 4:30, left her home.Went off to the airport, pick up some dude, old boyfriend. Off she went.\nHARRY: That was the last anybody saw of her?\nPERRY: With a symmetrical, ungooshed head.\nHARRY:Police ever find the car?\nPERRY: No, genius, that was us. Remember?\nHARRY:Oh, yeah, right.\nPERRY: The killers were at the party, Harry.\nHARRY: They were? The killers were at Dexter's?\nPERRY: That's how they recognized you. It's getting too scary. You gotta bail. Get a flight out, today.\nHARRY:But I got my screen test Tuesday. I'll go Wednesday.\nPERRY: You're not getting the part.\nHARRY: Fuck off. Don't be a schmuck.\nPERRY: You're not gonna get the part\nHARRY: I know it's a long shot. I know I\u2019m no Brando\u2026\nPERRY: It's not a long shot. Harry! You're not listening to me. You won't get the- Harry! HARRY! You're not gonna get the part, okay? [covers Harry\u2019s mouth] Colin Farrell wants too much money. Do you get me now? Dabney, he unearths a discovery. New kid, works for cheap. Flies him out here, high profile, parties, screen tests, detective lessons, all of it. You were just being used. Shave a couple million off of Colin Farrell's price tag. Sorry, chief. There it is. I'm not gonna lie to you anymore. I understand if you wanna take a swing at me.\n[Harry punches him in the jaw]\nPERRY: You fuck!\nHARRY: You sissy bitch!\nPERRY: Stop. [Perry takes the advantage, holds Harry in an armlock] Don't bother asking Harmony out on your date. She wasn't very happy to find out that you're not a detective, that you lied.\nHARRY: You told her?\nPERRY: Pick those up.Pick them up.\nHARRY:Why did you tell her? You didn't have to tell her. I am an idiot. I thought we were friends.\nPERRY: We're not friends.\nHARRY:I was in trouble, you were there for me.\nPERRY:No, I was- Stop speaking. I was there protecting my employer, Dabney. Hello. He pays me to insulate him from corpses. I'm not a nice man, Harry.  Go home before something bad happens to you.\nHARRY:What, are you threatening me?\nPERRY: No, moron.Go home before the bad guys do something bad to you.\nHARRY:Right, I get it. Fine.\nPERRY:Merry Christmas. Sorry I fucked you over.\nHARRY:No problem. Don't quit your gay job.\n\nCut to AIRPORT, night\nHarry snoozing, then we hear a PA announcing of a flight to Denver that just arrived. While he's waiting for his flight he sees Flicka and tries to chat her up.\nHARRY:Hey, Flicka. Hey, it's me, Harry. Remember me? What's up, honey? How are you?\nFLICKA:  She doesn't want to talk to you.\nHARRY: Oh, no, no. I know.Did you ever think maybe I don't want to talk to her? I just saw your really distinctive ears.You look different,but it's obviously Flicka. Maybe it's you I'm interested in.\nFLICKA: Is that true?\nHARRY:Not really. Look, she must have a cell phone, right? She must.\nFLICKA: Forget it. This is between you two.\nHARRY:Look, I got a ticket. I am leaving. I'm going back to the East Coast, and that's- No? Come on, I just want to say something to her. Just anything before I split. I'm begging you. Come on, help me out.\nFLICKA: I'm gonna regret this.\nHARRY: No, you're not and that is a very smart suit, by the way.\nFLICKA: It's not here, that's funny.\nHARRY:What's funny?\nFLICKA: Nothing. It's just under her stage name.\nHARRY:Oh, God. Everyone's got a stage name. What's her stage name?\nFLICKA: Ames. Allison Ames.\nHARRY: Okay, well, I'll just write it down and then- Hey! Say that name again.\nFLICKA: Allison Ames.\nHARRY: Allison Ames. A-M-E-S. That's Harmony\u2019s stage name.\nFLICKA: I just said that.\nHARRY:That's the name on her credit cards.\nFLICKA:How am I supposed to know?\nHARRY:  Fuck! [starts running] Thanks, honey. Gotta roll. Later.\nHarry in a cab, talking on the cellphone. We hear Perry\u2019s voice in an answering machine\nPERRY (O.S.): You have reached the offices of Sentron, Inc. Leave a message.\nHARRY: Newsflash, Perry. Your client, Ames, it was the little sister. Repeat, the little sister. That's where Harmony's 2 grand went. It's in your bank, you overpriced bastard. Her kid sister hired you. Do you get this? Your case and my case are the same fucking case.\nHarmony\u2019s door again. A distressed Harry pounds the door\nHARRY: Come on!\n[She angrily opens the door]\nHARMONY: Get out of my life!\nHARRY:I'm at the airport, right, and I run into Flicka, and she says-\nShe slams the door on him\u2026 and opens it again shortly afterwards\nHARMONY: Did I just cut off your finger?\nHARRY:Yeah. It's on the floor, to my periph- I don't wanna see it. Pick it up, put it on ice. [Harmony picks up the severed bit, a joint and a half of his left ring finger] Thanks.\nHe walks into the house, Harmony still angry.\nCut to HOSPITAL\nThe finger is precariously sewn back on and lightly bandaged up as Harmony\u2019s voice is heard.\nHARMONY (VO): You're a genius, Harry. You're a genius. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry I had to bail on you, but I had to go to work. I am going nuts here. I can't stop thinking about this.\nNow he\u2019s in the back of a cab, in a phone call with Harmony.\nHARMONY (OS): What's my sister's connection to Veronica Dexter? She predicted that murder, Harry. She sent you and Perry to that exact spot.\nHARRY:Yeah, that whole thing is wild. You know what else is nuts? You cut off my finger!\n[Harmony is in a party, dressed in a sexy Santa Claus outfit]\nHARMONY: Oh, God, Harry, I am so sorry about that. How is it?\nHARRY:It's fine. It's all shut up. They gave me painkillers. I can\u2019t feel a thing. Where's Perry? We gotta find him.\nHARMONY:  Perry's coming by here. I'm working a party on Sunset Plaza. Listen. Remember you said the killer may have been at Dexter's party? Well, that whole bunch is here tonight.\nHARRY: Honey, put me on the list, I'm gonna drop by. I'll see if I can stir up the kettle, stick out my hat, see if anyone shoots at it.\nHARMONY: Maybe you could put the hat in the kettle and if they shoot at it, it'll ricochet. Harry, you sound trashed.\nHARRY: [laughing] Give me the address. I'm coming.\n\nHarry heads over (High as a kite) to the party.\nHARRY (V.O.): I showed up mildly whacked on Demerol thinking Harmony's theory wasn't so crazy.\n[Holiday-themed fancy party. A pretty blonde says \u201cHi\u201d to Harry as he passes by. Harry stands near a cage where a dancer is dressed as a Christmas angel.]\nHARRY (V.O.): What if little sis had been murdered by the same assholes who offed Veronica Dexter? Remember? With the ski masks, those dudes. Then and there, I made a decision. If it fucking killed me, I would not stop until I got, like, two more Demerol. No, seriously, I was on the case. Harry Lockhart, L.A.P.I.\n[Harry continues to check on his bizarre surroundings - a glass cube where two half naked men do a weird dance, a half-naked woman posing as the Virgin Mary, dancers dressed as candy cane\u2026 - until Harmony comes from behind and pokes his shoulder. When he turns, she\u2019s holding an paper bag]\nHARMONY: Harry, I got it.\nHARRY:What do you got?\nHARMONY: Just now. My friend Tiff does the video dubbing at Fox.\n[he looks inside thebag]\nHARRY:\"Lord of the Cock Rings. \"\nHARMONY:  No, Harry, it's a fake label. Copyright infringement, she'd get fired. It's a Jonny Gossamer movie.If Jenna was hunting her mystery dad, this is where she would start, right? [Harry starts an  intoxicated laugh] Jesus, don't patronize me!\nHARRY: I'm not.\nHARMONY:  You're patronizing me.\nHARRY: No, I'm not. It's just a funny little buzz.\n[the pretty blonde drops by]\nBLONDE: I don't know if this guy's your boyfriend or not but when you were in the bathroom, he was checking me out.\nHARRY:What?\nHARMONY: Harry!\nHARRY:What is it out here with these women?\nHARMONY: Please, they're no diferente from anywhere else.\nHARRY:They are. These are damaged goods, every one of them, from way back. Take a guy who sleeps with 100 women a year, go into his childhood, dollars to doughnuts, it's relatively unspectacular. [puts a cigarette on his mouth] Now, you take one of these gals who sleeps with 100 guys a year and I bet you if you look in their childhood there's something rotten in Denver.\nHARMONY: Denmark.\nHARRY: [closes lighter]  That too. But it's abandonment, it's abuse. It's, \"My uncle put his ping-ping in my papa.\" Then they all come out here. It's like someone took America by the East Coast and shook it and all the normal girls managed to hang on.\nHARMONY: Okay, everybody who hates Harry here raise their hand.\n[all the girls in the club raise their hands. Perry walks in]\nPERRY: See that? Obedient little bitches too.\nGIRL (O.S.): Fuck you!\n[throws a glass, which he dodges]\nHARRY: Hey.\nPERRY: Okay, you've got 30 of my fucking seconds, thrill me.\nCut to KITCHEN\nHarry is putting the \u201cLord of the Cock Rings\u201d tape on a TV, Harmony gives him a paper\nHARMONY: All right, guys, cast list. Perry, catch.[throws him something] That's the credit card my sister used to hire you.\nClose on the \u201cAllison Ames\u201d credit card\nPERRY:So who's in this cinematic milestone, anyway?\nHARRY:  We got a Michael Beck, [Close on the cast list, printed off IMDB] whoever that is.\nPERRY: He's the star of Xanadu, with Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly.\nHARRY: [mouthing] Gay. [Harmony chuckles]\nPERRY: What?\nHARRY: Nothing.\nHARMONY: Perry, listen up. I know this is a long shot, but indulge me, please.\nHARRY:We gotta lose the hat. I'm sorry, honey, I can't-\n[Harry pulls Harmony\u2019s Santa hood]\nHARMONY: God, Harry, I'm working!\nHARRY: I know, but just forget it.\nHARMONY: Seriously, don't jump all over me. Just pay attention. Watch it, please.\n[Perry, who was seeming disinterested, changes his expression once he looks at the movie]\nPERRY: That's Harlan Dexter.\nHARMONY:  What?\nHARRY: Who's Har-? What?\nPERRY: Look, that's- He's 20 years younger, but that's Harlan Dexter.\nHarlan Dexter is indeed the Johnny Gossamer of the movie\nGOSSAMER: Always sees the inside of a police van.\nHarmony is shocked, puts her hand on her forehead\nHARMONY: No way.\nHARRY: Wow. This kind of makes sense. He had the Gossamer books at his house.\nPERRY:  Used to be an actor.\nHARMONY:   Jesus, Harry. I remember him now. 1980. Oh, my God, I saw him like this. Young.\nPERRY:   Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where?\nHARMONY: In Indiana. He was there with the movie crew. Remember, I told you he looked familiar. Oh, God, this can't be true.\nHARRY: And your sister has to have seen this, so you know what it comes down to. You tell your sister a fairy tale about her real father-\nPERRY: And 20 years later, she comes out to L.A. hunting Harlan Dexter.\nBack to the PARTY\nPERRY: I've got a surveillance in MacArthur Park. I gotta follow some chick around till midnight. Do not play detective. This is not a book. This is not a movie.\nHARRY:We got it. Do you think I'm stupid?\nPERRY: You wouldn't know where to feed yourself if you didn't flap your mouth so much. Yes, I think you're stupid.\n[Perry leaves]\nHARMONY: Harry, don't listen to a word he says, all right? We're getting somewhere.   I'll call you tomorrow. I'm going back to work.\nHARRY:Good.\n[Harmony leaves, Harry wanders off, and stops to look at a dancer dressed like a deer. He is then jumped by two thugs, a white guy, and a black one.]\nHARRY: Excuse me.\nTHUG 1: What's up, baby? How you feeling?\nHARRY:I'm just gonna-\nTHUG 2: Come and take a walk. Walk with me.\nHARRY: Great, this is fucking rich.\nCut to ROOM\nHarry is forced by the duo to sit on a fancy chair in an empty room filled with stuff\nTHUG 2: Well, now, here we all are: Ike, Mike and Mustard.\nHARRY:What the hell does that mean?\nTHUG 1: I'm with him on this one. That's pretty fucking obscure.\nTHUG 2: Horseshit. I hear that all the time.\nTHUG 1: You do?\nTHUG 2: Yeah, sure.\nTHUG 1: Where? At the 1942 Club?\nTHUG 2: Just because you didn't get in\u2026\nTHUG 1: Motherfucker, I could\u2019ve gotten in\u2026\n[Harry tries to make a break for it. The tall goon pushes him back]\nTHUG 1: Hey-ey-EY! Slow your roll, man!\nHARRY:This is bullshit. What will you do, take me out here? There's sec-\nThe short goon punches the bandaged hand, Harry groans\nTHUG 1:Keep talking. Keep talking.\nTHUG 2: You wanna know who we are? I'm the frying pan, see? And my boy over here- He's\u2026\nTHUG 1: Mustard. I'm Mustard, baby.\nHARRY:Sure.\nMR. FRYING PAN: He's the fire. Fuck you, Mr. Mustard.\nMR. FIRE: Here we go.\nMR. FRYING PAN: Now, me and my man, we're puzzled lately by your behavior, such as-\nMR. FIRE: Such as why is a savvy, stand-up cat like yourself consorting with gay men? Frolicking in the lake and shit together. What is that?\nHARRY:You're the guys who were wearing the masks.\n[Frying Pan presses the bandaged hand]\nMR. FIRE: You don't ask the questions.\nMR. FRYING PAN:  Don't ask questions.\nHarry\u2019s hand is released, the bandage is all bloodied\nHARRY:God, you just tore up my fucking finger! I just got this fixed. Jesus!\nMR. FRYING PAN:  I bet there's a doctor in New York, clear that shit right up.\nMR. FIRE:  Clear it right up.\n\u201dFire\\Mustard\u201d punches him in the face\nMR. FIRE:  L.A. don't want you no more, tough guy.\nMR. FRYING PAN:  All right? [they leave]\n\nCut to STREET\nHarmony\u2019s car driving away\nHARRY (O.S.): How much further to the hospital?\nHarry is in the backseat while Harmony tries taking him to the hospital.\nHARMONY: Five minutes away. Talk to me. Our mascot, back in high school, who was it? Come on, Harry, stay with me.\n[Flashback to the high school years, man dressed as a knight jumps in front of a \u201dTHE EMBREY KNIGHTS\u201d sign]\nHARRY: Whitey, the white knight. Whitey. I guess it's better than calling him \"Knighty.\" Then it'd be Knighty Knight. Soon it'd be Toodles, and then Ta-Ta.  It's very emasculating.\n[a car passes in front of them]\nHARMONY:  Harry, that's them. Twelve o'clock.\n[Harry sits uptight]\nHARMONY: You said it's a black guy and a white guy?\nHARRY: Oh yeah, yeah. You're right. Get the plate, call the cops.\nHARMONY:  Let me find a pen.\n[Harmony leans forward]\nHARRY:  No. Whatever. Watch the road. Are we slowing down?\nHARMONY:  No, I'm getting a pen.\nHARRY: Are you following them? Better not be.\nHARRY:Tell me you're not following them.\nHARMONY: I\u2019m not! I'm taking you to the hospital.\n[Harmony puts the hand back on the wheel]\nHARMONY: Oh, shit. They're turning.\nHARRY:What?\nHARMONY: Holy shit.\n[street sign reading \u201cMacArthur Park\u201d]\nHARMONY: Perry's stakeout. It's a setup. They're going to MacArthur Park after Perry!\nHARRY: Wait a second! My finger's hanging off. We gotta move on this.\nHARMONY: We're gonna go save Perry, really quickly. Then we'll go fix your finger. It'll be like, \"Hey, Perry, look out. \" Boom, back in the car. All right? Cool?\nHARRY:  Yeah. This is exhausting.\nHarmony parks by the sidewalk. \u201cMr. Fire\u201d is standing near the parked car.\nHARMONY: Bingo. All right. All right, Harry. Twelve o'clock, that's them. One of them is on foot.\nThe car moves, \u201cMustard\u201d walks too. Harmony opens the door\nHARMONY: God, Harry. Shit, if I leave the keys, can you take yourself to the hospital?\nHARRY: Oh, yeah, sure.\nHARMONY: All right, good.I got the gun you gave me.\nHARRY:You what?\n[Harmony walks in front of the windshield, pistol in one hand, and gives a thumbs-up with the other. Harry passes out in the back seat.]\nCut to PARK\nHarmony is entering the park.  A girl with pink hair (Shannyn Sossomon) shows up and Perry starts following her. She purposefully leads him under a bridge where the black thug is, gesturing to him. Harmony sees the white thug is driving up behind Perry - starting to line up in order to run Perry over.\nHARMONY: Perry!\nShe's jumped by the black thug\nMR. FIRE: Now, where you going?\nHe throws her on the ground, starts strangling Harmony.\nMR. FIRE: No, no, no. Don't fight it. Let it happen, baby.\nHarmony kicks him in the balls, he releases her. She manages to get atop him better of him and knock him out with a headbutt. She gets \u201cMustard\u2019s\u201d gun and points it at him, but decides to just run for Perry.\nHARMONY: Perry!\nAfter getting nearly ran over by the bridge\u2019s traffic, Harmony finally gets to the other side.\nHARMONY: Perry, watch out! Goddamn it, turn around!\nWhile jumping off the bridge, Harmony falls and drops the gun. It accidentally fires, hitting a parked car and catching Perry's attention - he spots the approaching car and leaps out of the way. The driver careers toward a hot dog stand destroying tables\nHOT DOG VENDOR: Son of a bitch!\nMr. Frying Pan leaves the car, gun in hand, approaches Perry who\u2019s also pointing his pistol at him\u2026 and then the hot dog vendor takes out a gun of his own and shoots the thug dead.\nHOT DOG VENDOR:  How about that, you fucking animals! Goddamn cocksuckers.\nIn the chaos, the girl with pink hair runs around looking for an escape. She finds a car with the door open and the keys still in it. Of course, it's Harmony's car with Harry passed out in the back seat. The car leaves.\nBack in the car, Harmony runs towards Perry, having just returned from where she left the other thug\nHARMONY: Perry.\nPERRY:  Where the hell did you come from?\nHARMONY: He got away.\nPERRY: It's okay. You did good.\nHARMONY: I couldn't shoot him, Perry. Oh, God.\nPERRY:  You did fine. You did fine.\nPERRY: We gotta go now.\nCut to: GARAGE\nHarry wakes up some hours later in the back seat of the car in a strange garage in a strange house totally confused (which must mean he got there the entire way without the pink-haired girl seeing him lying asleep in the backseat...) He walks around inside calling out for help.\nHARRY:Hello?Anyone home?Hello?Anyone home? I got an injury problem. Hello.\n[As Harry hears people approaching, he hides under a bed. He hears them talking.]\nMR. FIRE: All right, first things first. You've gotta ditch that car.\nPINK WIG: I know, I know. I've- I know you said that there was gonna be consequences, but fuck. I saw him shot to death. I was scared.\nMR. FIRE:  Look, it's okay, yeah. We can absolutely talk about it, all right?\n[They are now right by the bed]\nPINK WIG: Thank you. Thank you so much.It's nothing against your boss. I'm grateful. I just-\nMR. FIRE: I spoke to him. You'll never have to go through anything like that again. I swear.\nPINK WIG: Promise?\nMR. FIRE:  Yep.\n[Gunshot. The pink haired girl falls in front of Harry.]\nPINK WIG: Who are you? Who are you? Who-?\n[Harry holds his fingers to her lips as she mutters before dying. The thug runs off to get something to wrap the body with. So Harry, in a daze, gets out from under the bed.  He sees \u201cMR. FIRE\u201d\\\u201dMR. Mustard\u201d]\nMR. FIRE: Well, hey. So you still here, huh, tough guy?\n[Harry sees the thug\u2019s gun on the bed.]\nMR. FIRE: Oh, you got a gun, I see. Well, damn, you are tough.\n[Harry shoots him in the chest repeatedly. He dies falling upon a glass table]\n[Harry sits next to Pink Wig, cleans off the gun, and puts the girl's fingerprints on it so the police will think she and the thug killed each other.]\nHARRY: Sorry.\nHarry goes to the kitchen, puts the severed finger in a bowl with ice. He turns to  get some water.\nHARRY: Fuck.\nA dog comes up and grabs the finger. Harry turns around, sees the bowl was a dog one, and then notices his limb on the dog\u2019s mouth.\nHARRY: Hey. Hey! Sit. [the dog runs, Harry whistles]\n[As the dog stands from a distance of Harry, his phone rings.]\nHARRY:  Yeah? What?\nPERRY:  Where the hell are you?\nHARRY:I'm with one of the kidnappers. One of them, anyhow. I shot him. He's dead.[to the dog] Come here, you fuck.\nPERRY: Jesus, Harry. Wipe the place clean and get out of there.\nHARRY:I want to, but I can't.\nPERRY: So do it.\nHARRY:My fingerprint's here. The fucking dog's got it.\nPERRY:  No one's gonna dust the fucking dog.\nHARRY:He's got the finger, asshole with the print part.\nPERRY:  Get the finger, kill the dog, get out.\nHARRY:Hang on. [the dog swallows the finger ] Shit. Well, I think.... I think we're safe.\n[ Harry seems resigned to its loss]\nPERRY:Harry? Harry?\nHARRY:Hey, Perry, I shot a guy. I never did that before.\nPERRY: Harry, listen\u2026\nJust as he\u2019s about to break in tears, he turns off the call and the dog approaches. He embraces the puppy.\nAerial shot of dawn arriving in Los Angeles, as a reporter is heard.\nREPORTER (V.O.): link to the items found in the Silver Lake home to the kidnap-murder of socialite Veronica Dexter.\nCut to LOBBY\nThe lobby of Harry\u2019s hotel is playing the news, while Harry, Harmony and Perry are seated in the couches.\nREPORTER:Police theorize a falling out between the kidnappers, resulting in at least two deaths, and possibly a third tonight.\nPERRY:  So this evening, was it Jonny Gossamer enough for you?\nHARRY:To tell you the truth, Jonny Gossamer always has a way bigger ending.There's always the part where the guy gets tortured.\nHARMONY:Yeah, tortured, sure. Then he usually breaks free and shoots, like, 16 guys.\nHARRY:Yeah, 16 guys. It's always 16. That's funny. So this thing, it's over, right? They say the kidnappers are all dead, so....\nPERRY:Well, Harry, I'd be lying to you if I didn't say that I still didn't have a few questions.\nHARRY: What do you mean?\nPERRY:Harmony's sister. If she stumbles on a murder plot, why hire me to film it? Why not simply go to the police?\nHARMONY:  Right. And I still think this Veronica Dexter father-daughter business is wanky.\nHARRY: So the whole reconcilement thing?\nPERRY: \"Reconciliation,\" idiot. Yep. She comes back to the States, drops the lawsuit, moves in with her father.Suddenly they're inseparable?\nHARRY:  So, what are you saying? We're gonna, like, probe deeper?\nPERRY: Absolutely not.\nHARMONY:  What? Perry, what are you talking about? My sister paid you. What, you're gonna bail?\nPERRY: Harmony do you want your sister's money back? Done. In the meantime, back off. Before you get me and Harry killed.\nHe walks away.\nCut to HOTEL FRONT\nHarmony waits for a cab, Harry runs to her.\nHARRY: Pardon me.Hey, I lucked out. They gave me the same room.\nHARMONY: Lucky you.\nHARRY: It's pretty good. You wanna come up?\nHARMONY: No, I don't wanna come up. Why would I go up there?\nHARRY: You got time? They cleaned it.\nHARMONY: The car is coming. I'm going. Jesus.\n[Harry, looking defeated, starts to walk away]\nHARMONY:You know what, Harry? Stop. [she turns around]Why'd you lie to me?\nHARRY:It was an excuse to stay around you. So I think, in the realm of lies-\nHARMONY: You are such a dumb-ass. I am so not who you think I am, Harry.\nHARRY:And who would that be?\nHARMONY:You think I'm- You think I'm amazing. You do. You think I'm so amazing because that's who I told you I'd be. Yeah, that was the game plan.\nHARRY:You know what? It worked.\nHARMONY: No one else thinks so.\nHARRY:My opinion doesn't count?\nHARMONY: No, it doesn't. Because you're new here. Look around, there's younger and better.\nHARRY:I don't want younger and better, I want you. I'm such a moron. I'm sorry. You know what-\nHARMONY: It doesn't matter, I'm going. Look, just- [stares at street again]\nHARRY: I'm such an idiot. I steal shit.\nHARMONY:[turns around] Come again?\nHARRY: That's what I do for a living. I steal audio-visual components.  I steal. I robbed a house. [shows his watch] I stole this watch. It's a cool watch. It's got this little light thing. [picks up something from his pocket]I stole this gum from the lobby, because it was kind of a rush. I've never finished anything that I've started my entire life. Not school, not marriage, nothing. And I have this thing where, like halfway in the middle, I just and I cut and run.\nHARMONY: Like the other night when you were all over me and you gave up and just went for it with-\nHARRY:Prime example. I switched to the ugly friend. Homely friend. She's not ugly.She's homely. Don't go. Please.Not yet. This isn't finished.\nHarmony stares at him.\nHARMONY:  Turn around.\nHARRY: Why?\nHARMONY: Just turn around.\nHARRY: What, my tag's out?\nshe tugs his tag back into the shirt\nHARMONY: This dump have a bar?\nHARRY:Yeah.\n\nCut to: HARRY\u2019S ROOM\nPackets of gum hit the sofa as we hear Harry and Harmony, sounding wasted after spending the morning at the hotel bar\nHARMONY: Call me \"Slick\" from here on out.\nHARRY:That was such a good job.You snagged a ton of gum. I mean, petty theft-\nHARMONY: Oh, Harry. I really didn't need that last shot of tequila.\nHarmony is stripping in the bedroom to go to sleep, while Harry suddenly thinks of the body in the lake \u2013 specifically, the part where he pulled her skirt down.\nHARRY: Oh, God.I just had a weird thought. Veronica Dexter. I saw the body up close. Hell, I carried the damn thing. Both times, the dress was soaked through, so it was transparent. So-\nHARMONY: God, Harry, where are you going with this?\nHARRY: No, no, no. It's just-Perry said this chick was deep into the born-again bit, so it's probably nothing, but just if she had on underwear I didn't see any.\nHarmony tugs herself under the blankets\nHARRY:  I guess I'm taking the couch.\nHARMONY: Yeah. Thanks. Or you can sleep here. But it would only be sleeping, Harry. If that's gonna frustrate you.\nHARRY: Let's see.[gets up]\n[he lies on the bed, next to Harmony. She embraces him and puts her head on his shoulder]\nHARMONY: Oh, Harry. So long ago. Didn't really turn out the way we hoped, did it?\nHARRY:  I guess if I racked my brain, I could think of worse places to be.\nHARMONY:  Is that so, Whitey?\nHARRY:  Whitey? Calling me a knight?\nHARMONY:  Maybe, yeah. Except for the boner. That's not too knightly.\nHARRY:  The hell it isn't. Actually, it's nightly and most mornings.\nShe laughs and continues sleeping. A short moment passes, and then Harry puts his arms up, and sits down.\nHARRY:  Fuck it, I'm not a knight. I'm sorry. I'm thinking- I'm going nuts, so I think maybe...the couch is good.\nHARMONY:  What? Stop. Harry.\nHARRY:  Or I can keep drinking until it goes away.\nHARMONY: Harry, seriously, if you're at all uncomfortable... I am more than happy to do something.\nHARRY:  For chrissake, no.\nHARMONY: Why not?\nHARRY:I don't want you to offer it as- Not, \"It's a courtesy freebie.\"\nHARMONY: You're so anal.\nHARRY:  I don't want the backup: \"Let me just give you a hand here\"... as a kind of, like, default backup thing.\nShe passionately kisses him\nHARMONY: You're gonna stop calling me.\nHARRY: No. You know, that's crazy. I swear to God, this is it.  You are the dream girl. You always have been. This is destiny.\nShe kisses him once more\nHARMONY: Okay. Before we do this...I have a little confession to make.\nAn angry Harry is seen tossing stuff at a now-dressed Harmony on his doorstep.\nHARRY:  My best friend! You said you were going to drop by his house, wave goodbye.\nHARMONY: I was leaving for L.A. I was never gonna see him- He looked sad.\nHARRY:  He looked sad?\nHARMONY:  Yes, he did.\nHARRY:  You slept with Chook Chutney.\nHARMONY: Fuck. For chrissake, Harry, it was forever ago. Come on, I was a different person back then.\nHARRY: [patting her arm] You slept with Chook. Excuse me.\nHARMONY: Come on.\nHARRY:  Watch your hand.\nHARMONY: Harry!\nHe slams the door in Harmony\u2019s face. Harmony wanders off,  pays the valet, and is crying when something occurs to her. She calls Harry up.\nHARRY:  Yeah.\nHARMONY:  Harry, was she raped?\nHARRY:  Huh?\nHARMONY:  The Dexter girl, was she raped?\nHARRY: No, the ME's report showed no indication of rape stuff. You slept with Chook Chutney.\nHarry turns off the phone, sees the Johnny Gossamer book in his hand \u2013 \u201cYou Wouldn\u2019t Want To Live There \u2013 and lies down as the screen cuts to black.Day Four: The Simple Art of MurderPERRY (V.O.):  Wake up. Harry, wake up.\nA sleeping Harry gets a pair of pants thrown on his face.\nPERRY (O.S.) Get up.\nHe sits down, Perry sits next to him\nHARRY: What's up?\nPERRY:  Harmony's in trouble. Get dressed. Let's go.\nCut to: PERRY'S CAR\nHarry in the passenger seat. While Perry is driving, he plays a message on his phone.\nHARMONY (V.O.):  Perry, it's me. Listen, this Veronica Dexter business stinks. I'm gonna go check on something Harry said. Call me. If I'm right, you'll shit.\nPERRY:  What did you say to her?\nHARRY: Nothing.I don't get what's happening.\nPERRY:  She solved this thing. That sly little minx of yours has solved this case, and now I can't find her.\nHARRY: You're worried.\nPERRY: You're not worried?\nHARRY: Of course. If you are, I should be. Now, what did you say? Think. You said something about the case.\nHARRY:Yeah. Yeah.\nPERRY: What?\nThe car brakes suddenly, screeching its tires, and takes a turn\nHARRY (V.O.): I tell him about destiny. He's shaking his head. About dream girls, he doesn't care. I mention the underwear thing, he has a fucking conniption.\n\nCut to: INSANE ASYLUM\nHarry frantically smokes a cigarette outside a building, in which we can see in the parking lot a van with the name \u201cH.R. Dexter Mental Health Institute\u201d \u2013 the \u201cDexter Clinic\u201d a reporter mentioned previously.\nHARRY (V.O.): And you? How about it, filmgoer? Have you solved the case of the dead people in L.A.? Times Square audiences, don't shout at the screen. And stop picking at that, it'll just get worse.\nHarry then enters as Perry opens the door to him.\nPERRY: This won't take a second.\nHARRY:Right.\nThey meet a large woman patient, fiddling with a Santa sculpture.\nHARRY: (clears throat) Hi. How are you doing tonight?\nPATIENT:  They gave away my crickets.\nHarry turns on his phone, shows a picture of Harmony\nHARRY: Excuse me, you wouldn't, by chance, happen to have seen this woman?\nMENTAL PATIENT: No. I don't like him. Kurt Cobain, he took my cricket.\nHARRY: Of course. That's sad.\nPERRY: Ma'am, I hope you won't be offended when I ask you if you're wearing anything at all underneath your hospital blues.Any undergarments. It's important.\nShe lowers her dress, giggling. The two men are slightly disgusted as they walk away. In a corridor they resume their conversation.\nHARRY: That\u2019s it. That's the clue. Veronica Dexter was a patient here.\nPERRY: Private mental clinic, where even nice girls don't wear undies.\nHARRY:How could she be here and meanwhile, she's out having parties?\nPERRY: Think. First she hates her dad, then loves him. Has a lawsuit, withdraws it. Why? I'll tell you why.\nA doctor is approaching, they hide in an open room\nHARRY:Oh, my God. Oh, my God. So it's two different girls, right? He stashed his daughter in here, and then he put the ringer on the street.\nPERRY: All he needed was someone who looks enough like his daughter to withdraw the complaint. It's been 10 years.\nHARRY: This is nuts.\nPERRY: It's right out of a Gossamer book.\nHARRY: Of course, because the guy who planned the crimes has all the books. He's read them all. They're in his house. Plus, he was in that piece of shit\u2026 movie.\nPerry puts one pointer finger in his nose, points the other at Harry.\nHARRY: You're telling me the girl imposter-\nPERRY:  A desperate man needs a replacement daughter. Same time along comes a girl\u2026\nHARRY: Harmony's sister. Fresh off the bus, looking for her dad.dy\nPERRY: I'd say I found my imposter.\nHARRY:Let's get out of here.\nHarry and Perry head out from the asylum, and are then seen outside the clinic.\nHARRY: So where did she go from here?\nPERRY:  Shut up, I'm thinking.\nHARRY: By the way, this thing: [Imitates Perry's nose-touching gesture] Single gayest thing you've ever done.\n[As they pass by the van,  they meet an orderly who holds them at gunpoint]\nGUARD: Evening, gentlemen.\nPERRY:Hi, we are so incredibly lost.\nGUARD: Mr. Van Shrike, hello. You look chilly. Come back inside.\nPERRY:Actually, I'm from back East. I'm kind of digging the cold.\n[The guard pistol-whips Harry in the ear]\nHARRY: Agh! Fuck! He's the one who said it.\nGUARD:  Or I can kill you here.\n[The guard starts marching them back.]\nPERRY:Harry, I was thinking some more about this reality versus fiction.\nHARRY: Oh, is that a fact.\nPERRY:Like in the movies, when a guy sticks a gun at some schmuck's back and says: \"Let's take a walk. \" He's got a hostage.\nHARRY:I've seen that movie.\nPERRY:In reality, the pros like about five feet of separation.\nHARRY: Right, huh?\n[Perry takes a sudden turn and overpowers the guard, grabbing his pistol, while Harry gets the one in his belt]\nPERRY:That's so the schmuck doesn't take the gun back [both are pointing guns at the goon now] and make him eat it.\n[Harry pistol-whips the guy]\nHARRY:Doesn't that suck? I just hit you for no reason.[Perry bobbles forward] Watch it.\n[The goon is now on his knees with the guns on his head]\nPERRY: Tell us where Harmony is.\nGUARD:   Fuck you, Mary.\nPERRY: You don't get it, do you? This isn't \"good cop, bad cop. \" This is fag and New Yorker. You're in a lot of trouble. For chrissake, who are you protecting? It's all over, fini. Dexter is going down.\nHARRY:Down.\nPERRY:  I know about Veronica's lawsuit. I know Dexter was facing ruin. I even know he switched daughters. Which, for God's sake, actually did work for a while, till last week.\nHARRY:What happened that he had to kill her, huh?\nPERRY: Harry, put a sock in it.\nHARRY:I'm asking a question.\nPERRY:  If you ask questions then it seems like we don't know anything, that we\u2019re dishing. Okay? And for the record, it was the boyfriend, the guy from Paris. He would've spotted the fake and said, \"That's not Veronica.\" Am I right?\nGUARD: Fuck you!\nPERRY:  Exactly. So Dexter had Veronica killed, threw a dress on her dumped the body and walked away clean, except for one little thing.\nHARRY: Underpants.\nPERRY: One tiny little pair of undies.\nHARRY: Yeah.\n[the goon laughs]\nPERRY: You think that's funny, huh? I'm gonna break your nose now.\n[Perry punches him in the nose; the goon spits the nosebleed that fell in his mouth]\nPERRY: I want you to picture a bullet inside your head. Can you do that for me?\nPERRY: Fuck you. Anyway, that's ambiguous.\nPERRY: Ambiguous? I don't think so.\nHARRY: No, I think it means when you say, \"Picture it inside your head\", is that \"a bullet will be inside your head\" or \"picture it in your head\"?\nPERRY: Harry, will you shut up.\nGUARD: I don't know anything about a girl, seriously. I was bluffing.\nHARRY: I think that you are bluffing right now.\n[Harry starts unloading the bullets from his gun]\nPERRY: Harry, what are you doing?\nHARRY:What I'm doing for the guy who likes to bluff is I'm playing a little game called \"Am I Bluffing?\" [Loads one round into the revolver to play Russian Roulette]  Huh! Where is she?\nPERRY: Harry.\nHARRY: Where the fuck is Harmony? You want to play hardball? [Spins the chamber and points the gun] Where is the girl?\n[Shoots the guy in the head]\nPERRY: What did you just do?\nHARRY: I just put in one bullet, didn't I?\nPERRY: You put a live round in that gun?\nHARRY: Yeah, there was like an 8 percent chance.\nPERRY: Eight? Who taught you math?\nHARRY: Maybe it was more. I don't know-\n[Perry\u2019s phone rings. His tone is \u201cI Will Survive\u201d.]\nPERRY: Shit! [answering] Hello?\nHARMONY: Perry, is that you? Hey, it's me.\nPERRY: Hi, Harmony.\n[Harry sits confused, leaned against the van]\nHARMONY: What's going on?\nPERRY: Where are you?\nHARMONY: At home.\nPERRY: You're at home?\nHARMONY: [She is shown in her living room] I just got back. I was in the Hills all day. Shitty reception.\nPERRY: You don't sound so good.\nHARMONY: Why aren't you following your lead?\nPERRY: Oh, forget it. It's just crazy.\nHARMONY: No, it's not crazy. Listen- It's right out of a Gossamer book.\nPERRY: Don't talk. Listen.\nHARRY: Times 12\u2026 Eight percent.\nPERRY: And you, stop multiplying.\nHARMONY:Huh?\nPERRY: No, not you. Listen, call downtown, see if Veronica Dexter's body has gone to the mortuary. If it has, see if there's a cremation scheduled.\nHARMONY:  Wait, Perry.\nPERRY:Call me back right away.\n[Perry turns off the call, and talks to Harry]\nPERRY:Look, he was gonna kill you anyway. He said so. Cover him up. I'll get the car.\n[In a nearby field, Harry has hidden the body in the bushes]\nHARRY: All right, that's pretty much all done.\nPERRY: Harry-\n[Harry starts walking back]\nHARRY:I got an idea. I say we take the son of a bitch Dexter down...\n[he sees Perry is being held at gunpoint by the man himself and another goon.]\nHARRY:...to the racetrack and buy the son of a gun a drink. What do you say, Perry?[takes the guns off his pants] Oh, fuck, no fair. No fucking fair.\nHARLAN: Aurelio, give Mr. Van Shrike a little pat down.\n[as Perry is getting frisked, he smiles and shouts as if he\u2019s liking]\nAURELIO: Fucking maric\u00f3n.\n[Perry's phone rings. The thug takes the phone from the jacket\u2019s pocket]\nHARLAN: Toss it here. Let's see who it is.\n[Aurelio throws it over to Dexter, but Harry catches it and answers the call.]\nHARRY: We're in trouble. Dexter's got us.\n[Aurelio punches Harry, picks up the phone and puts it in his ear]\nAURELIO: He just asked a carpet-cleaning service to save him.\nHARLAN:  Sorry, kid. Good hands, though.\nHARRY:Thanks. Used to be a magician.\n[Cut to the other side of the conversation\u2026]\nHARMONY: And for 39.99 we'll carpet up to three rooms in half the time. That's a $40 value. Act today.\n[The van arrives at a hospital to be tortured. Harry has his pants down as Thug #3 hooks up electrodes to Harry's balls]\nHARRY:That chick in the casket, she won't even match up with that ringer you been toting around. You ever think about that?\nPERRY:He did, Harry. That's why he's cremating the body.\n[Harlan\u2019s phone rings]\nHARLAN: Yeah, you ready?\n[The Thug is starting the electrical device as Harlan finishes his call]\nHARLAN:Speak of the devil. Gotta go. Perry, nice to have known you.\n[turns to Harry]\nHARRY: Harry.\nHarry. Yes, of course. Harry from New York. I hope you don't judge Los Angeles based solely on your experience tonight. [sees the electrodes hanging from his crotch] Ouch.\n[Harlan walks away]\nHARRY:I'm kind of scared here, Perry.\nPERRY:Aurelio, why don't you give the kid a break?\n[Aurelio is holding a gun at Perry and firing from a water gun at Harry\u2019s crotch]\nPERRY: Do unto others and all that. It's Christmas.\nAURELIO: Who else knows? Who did you tell?\nHARRY:I don't know anything.I'm not even from here, you fuck-up.\n[Aurelio proceeds to start the torture. Harry screams in pain.]\n[Outside the hospital, the coffin is being brought into a van \u2013 something Harmony sees from her car.]\nTHUG: Mr. Dexter, the coffin's good to go.\nHARLAN: Okay, let's burn the bitch.\n[Back to the torture room, Harry continues his agony.]\nPERRY:  You could zap his chest. It'd be easier. [Aurelio turns off the device] But we know why you gotta do it down there. You like looking at his johnson, don't you? Admit it, dude, you got it in you.\n[Aurelio gets angry  and starts pounding on the electrode button to emphasize his point. Harry's not having a good time.]\nAURELIO: Enough!\nPERRY: Aurelio, look me in the eyes and tell me you've never been with a man.\n[Punches the machine again]\nAURELIO: Fuck you, maric\u00f3n! Fuck you!\nPERRY: That's what you want, isn't it? You want to fuck me.\nHARRY:Stop helping. Stop helping.\nPERRY: If you are not gay, just say so.\nAURELIO:  Fuck you, maric\u00f3n!\n[Punches the machine again]\nPERRY: Look at him. He can't even say it.\nHARRY:Stop helping!\nAURELIO:  Can't wait to have you as a patient.\nPERRY: Bet you can't.\n[Perry mimes grabbing at his balls]\nPERRY:  This is what you want. Here.\nAURELIO:  Shut up!\n[Perry puts his hand inside his pants]\nPERRY:  Take a look. You want some of this right here? Look at this.\nAURELIO: Just shut up!\n[Aurelio prepares to pistol-whip Harry\u2026 [when the thug is killed by bullets flying out of Perry's crotch]\nHARRY:Yeah!\nPERRY:  Homophobes never check there.\n[he reveals a miniscule gun that was in his pants]\nHARRY: Thank God you had a gun in there. I thought it was a gay thing, like somehow you guys could do that. Sorry.\nPERRY:   Are you okay?\nHARRY: Not really, no.\n[Outside, the body has been loaded into the van, where four thugs are right by the back doors.]\nTHUG 1: Gentlemen, let's wrap it up and get out of here.\n[Harmony is seen running towards the cabin.]\nTHUG 2: Who's driving?\nTHUG 3:I tell you what, I'll flip you for it.\nTHUG 1: All right.\n[As the tossed coin lands, the van drives off. They are startled, and then run away.]\nTHUG 1: This way, come on.\nTHUG 2: Shit!\n[Harmony driving the van in a busy street. Her phone rings]\nHARMONY: Yeah.\nPERRY: Hey, Harmony, it's me.\nHARMONY: Oh, God, how did you get away?\nPERRY: I shot him with a small revolver I keep near my balls. I can't get to my car. We're near Olive and the freeway. Can you pick us up?\nHARMONY: I'm in a van with Veronica\u2019s body. I'll be there in 30 seconds. All right, be where I can see you. Be ready to move.\n[checking the rearview mirror, Harmony sees the thugs are in a car behind her]\nHARMONY: Shit, they're on my tail. I gotta go.\n[as the car keeps chasing the van it approaches the hospital, where Perry and Harry are already on the sidewalk]\nHARRY: Right there. She's right there!\n[the van rushes without stopping]\nHARRY:Shit.\n[they start running towards the van. The car hits the van a bit, given the back doors are open, so the coffin is in danger of flying out at any time.]\nHARRY: Harmony!\nHarmony crashes the van on an overpass, sending the coffin over the edge. It lands on a sign above the underpass. An arm pops out. Harmony's OK, though, and leaves the cabin. Harry and Perry keep running up.\nHARRY: Harmony!\nHarmony runs away just as a thug\u2019s car hits the flipped van. He brakes, gets out of the car, and tries to shoot Harmony. She jumps off the road and into a median, slamming her forehead on the grass and drawing blood. Up there, Harry and Perry are approaching.\nHARRY:  Harmony!\nPERRY: Harry, don't!\n[Perry gets into a gunfight with the thug. The thug is shot, but not before shooting a bullet through Perry's chest and into Harry. Harry falls to his knees and collapses on the ground as the other thugs drive away. He then crawls to Perry.]\nHARRY:Come on, we gotta go. They're coming back around. Harmony's down there. Perry, what's wrong? Come on, breathe.\n[Harry tries to give Perry mouth to mouth, but Perry starts coughing up blood.]\n[Meanwhile, the resulting concussion has left Harmony pretty dazed, but she is still able to talk\u2026]\nHARMONY: Harry.\n[Harmony grabs her cellphone and clicks it\u2026]\nHARMONY: Harold.\n[Her hand falls on  the ground. Perry's cell phone rings. Harry grabs it from the man\u2019s pocket, sees it\u2019s Harmony, and answers Perry\u2019s cellphone]\nHARMONY: Harold...  use your awesome might.  Save me from this hopeless plight. Harold...\n[Harry throws the phone away, takes Perry\u2019s gun, and gets up. Loading the magazine, he walks to the overpass, and sees the car arriving. As Harry points the gun to hit, Dexter shows up and tries to run Harry down. He jumps off the overpass and lands on the coffin perched on the freeway sign. He accidentally drops the gun onto the casket and slides off, hanging onto the arm and dangling above the speeding traffic.]\nHARRY:Harmony!\n[He sees Harmony in a field below. Dexter rushes to the edge of the bridge to shoot him, Harry jogging the coffin and knocking the gun down - catching it in the nick of time and shooting Dexter.]\nHARLAN:Captain Fucking Magic.\n[Harlan falls back dead. Some thugs are speeding towards unconscious Harmony to finish her off, but Harry tries shooting them while dangling from the coffin,]\nHARRY:Come on!\n[Harry manages to shoot the driver. As the out-of-control car gets near, Harry lets go of the corpse\u2019s arm and drops onto the roof of the car as it passes under. The backseat thug opens the door and goes at Harry]\nHARRY:No.\n[He manages to kill the last two thugs with some showy moves]\nHARRY:There, all done. [he drops the gun down on the street] Finished.\n[ Harry staggers over to Harmony]\nHARMONY: Harry.\nHARRY:Did you call me?\nHARMONY: Harry, you're shot.\nHARRY:No, no. Look, you want to see something cool?\n[Harry pulls out a Jonny Gossamer book from his breast pocket - complimenting it on stopping the bullet.]\nHARMONY: Cool! This stopped the bullet, Harry. [she puts her finger in the bullet hole,seeing it goes all the way] No, not really.\n[Harry sees blood in his chest, and touches the wound.]\nHARRY: Oh, not really.\n[Harry puts his head on Harmony\u2019s shoulder and starts passing out]\nHARMONY: Oh, Harry. Oh, God, Harry. Harry.\n[Sirens roar as it fades to orange\u2026]\n[Harry wakes up at the hospital. Harmony is in the room with him.]\nHARMONY: Hi. Welcome back.\nHARRY: Yeah.\nHARMONY: How many fingers?\nHARRY: Will you put that cat down, because I'm allergic.\nHARMONY: You feeling okay? How's your...?\nHARRY: My what?\nHARMONY:  Well, your....\n[looks at his crotch]\nHARMONY:  Everything down there.\nHARRY: I can't believe he told you that.\n[Perry rolls in on a wheelchair.]\nHARRY: Hey, hey, hey. It's Christmas, where's my present, Slick?\nPERRY: Your present is you're not in jail, fag-hag.\nHARRY (V.O.): Yeah, boo, hiss, I know. Look, I hate it too. In movies where the studio gets all paranoid about a downer ending, so the guy shows up, he's magically alive on crutches, I hate that. [To slam the point home, everybody who died in the movie walks in (purple-haired girl and thugs included), smiling and waving... along with Abraham Lincoln.] I mean, shit, why not bring them all back. [A producer starts dragging everyone away\u2026 including an Elvis who tried to enter the room] But the point is, in this case, this time, it really happened. Perry, like, lived. Yeah, it's a dumb movie thing but what do you want me to do, lie about it?\n\nHARMONY: So you found something out?\nPERRY:Yeah. But you're not gonna like it.Dexter didn't murder your sister.\nHARMONY: That's crazy. He was using my sister to impersonate his daughter, Perry.\nPERRY:Never happened. I talked to my police guy. The ringer was a girl named Mia Frye, 23-year-old from Glendale.When she wasn't impersonating Veronica Dexter... [flashback to Harry below the bed]...she wore a pink wig.\nHARMONY: But my sister sent you up to Big Bear Lake, to his cabin.\n[flashback to the lake sequence]\nPERRY: Your sister was convinced that Dexter was her natural father, so she started following him, hanging around. Do you see where I'm going with this? One day your sister came calling, and she saw Dexter...\n[Jenna is seeing from a window Dexter frolicking with the topless and blindfolded Mia Frye, pink wig lying nearby]\nPERRY (V.O.):...in bed with the pink-haired girl.What she thought was father and daughter. Remember, that's how it would appear.\nPERRY: It was too much for her. First the old father, now the shiny new one.She couldn't handle it, and she took her own life. What she hired me to film wasn't murder, but incest. I'm sorry.\n[Harmony and Harry get sad]\nHARRY (V.O.):So much for unreality. I said goodbye, watched Jonny's world go back on the fiction shelf. But while it lasted, brother... [Harry holds Harmony\u2019s hand] it was one for the books.\nHarry helping Perry, who\u2019s walking with a cane, down the hospital corridor.\nPERRY:You should've told me you were arrested five times. I should be pissed.\nHARRY:You should have told me that when you go home, you put on lady's underpants.\nPERRY:That's cross-dressing, imbecile.\nHARRY:Whatever.\nPERRY:Half those guys are straight. Perfect fathers, love their kids. How about you? Did your father love you?\nHARRY:Sometimes. You know, when I dressed up like a bottle. How about yours?\nPERRY: Well, he used to beat me in Morse code, so it's possible... but he never actually said the words.Harry.\nHARRY:What?\nPERRY:Don't steal any more shit. You're not a punk.\nA male nurse passes by them, Perry turns back.\nPERRY:You bet I'll turn around.\nHARRY:You like that, huh?\nPERRY:  I saw him in the commissary twice. What is he, like 6'4\"?He doesn't know he's gay. Look how he walks.Epilogue: Farewell, My LovelyFlyover of an Indiana town\nHARRY (V.O.): So that's pretty much that.  We went back to Indiana, the three of us, for Jenna's funeral. Don't worry, I saw the last Lord of the Rings.I won't have the movie end 17 times.  There is, though, one final scene for your viewing pleasure.\nInside a house, Perry confronts Harmony's father, who's on oxygen and bedridden\nHARMONY\u2019S DAD: Do I know you?\nPERRY:  No. Just in town for the funeral.\nHARMONY\u2019S DAD:  What do you want?\nPERRY:  The zoo was closed, so I thought I'd come here and look at an animal.\nHARMONY\u2019S DAD: Son of a- Who do you think you're talking to?  I buried my daughter today.\nPERRY:  No. You buried her 20 years ago. Harmony was right, her sister was murdered. You pulled the trigger. It just took this long for the bullet to hit.\nHARMONY\u2019S DAD: Who are you? I loved my girl.\nPerry backhands him\nHARMONY\u2019S DAD: You fucker! If I could get out of this bed-\nPERRY:  Yeah? Well, you can't.\nPerry backhands him again\nHARMONY\u2019S DAD:You bastard! An old man that can't defend himself. Big tough guy.\nPERRY:  Yeah, that's right.  Big tough guy.\nPerry leaves. As he passes by the living room, the Genaros commercial is seen on the TV\u2026 only instead of Harmony, it\u2019s the blonde girl who Harry met before introducing Harmony.\nOne year later. Harry, much better dressed, is making a video recording of himself telling the whole story in an office.\nHARRY:That's it. That's the true story of what happened last Christmas. That was some pretty harsh shit with the old guy back there, right? But whatever, he's creepy. Fuck him. Don't worry about him. Anyhow, so... Thanks for coming. Thanks for taking the trip to L.A. with me. If I had to sum it up, and I do-Because, you know, it's, like, the end.\nHARRY:I would say that this movie is about- It's about friendship. Friendship is sacred.\nPerry enters, carrying a folder\nPERRY:   What are you doing?\nHARRY:I'm trying to wrap up the movie  and leave the people with a message.\nPERRY:  I've got a message for you. Get your feet off my fucking desk.\nHARRY: Sorry. [Harry moves his feet]  I work for Perry now.\nPERRY: [covers Harry\u2019s mouth with his hand] And stop narrating.\nHARRY: Obviously.\nPERRY:   That's it. Please stay for the end credits. If you're wondering who the best boy is, it's someone's nephew.  Don't forget to validate your parking. For all of you good people in the Midwest, sorry we said \"fuck\" so much.  Say good night.\nHARRY: Thanks again.\nPERRY:  Now, go.
