religiously\nLike clockwork every time he see's an opening\nIn a conversation, 'bout the way things used to be\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door\nBut I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor\nHanging onto every word, man the things I heard\n\n[Bridge 1]\nIt was harder times and longer days\nFive miles to school uphill both ways\nWe were cane-switch raised and dirt floor poor\nCourse that was back before the war\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nYea your uncle and I made quite a pair\nFlying F-15's through hostile air\nHe went down but they missed me by a hair\nHe'd always stop right there and say\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's something to be proud of\nThat's a life you can hang your hat on\nAs your chins held high as the tears fall down\nGut sucked in, chest stuck out\nLike a small town flag a flying\nOr a new born baby crying\nIn the arms of the woman that you love\nThat's something to be proud of\n\n[Verse 3]\nSon graduating college, that was momma's dream\nAnd I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned eighteen\nCause when you got a fast car, and think you got everything\n\n[Verse 4]\nI learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith\nI ended up broken down in some town north of L.A\nWorking maximum hours, for minimum wage\nYou might also like[Bridge 2]\nWell I fell in love next thing I know\nThe babies came and the car got sold\nSure do miss that old Hot Rod\nBut you sure save gas in them foreign jobs\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nDad I wonder if I ever let you down\nIf you're ashamed how I turned out\nWell he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow\nSaid let me tell you right now\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThat's something to be proud of\nThat's a life you can hang your hat on\nYou don't need to make a million just be thankful to be working\nIf you're doing what you're able\nPutting food there on the table\nAnd providing for the family that you love\nThat's something to be proud of\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nAnd if all you ever really do is the best you can\nWell, you did it man\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's something to be proud of\nThat's a life you can hang your hat on\nAs your chins held high as the tears fall down\nGut sucked in, chest stuck out\nLike a small town flag a flying\nOr a new born baby crying\nIn the arms of the woman that you love\nThat's something to be proud of\n[Outro]\nThat's something to be proud of\nNow that's something to be proud of\nThat's something to be proud of\nNow that's something to be proud of1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/707165", "artist_names": "The Click

over fast cars and freedom\nThat sunset river bank, first time feeling\n\n[Outro]\nI see a dust trail following an old red Nova\nBaby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder\nYou don't look a day over

ride\nBacktrackin' on these few years\nTryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad\n\u2018Cause ever since my girl left me\nMy whole life came crashin', and I'm so\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Bobby Vinton & Akon]\nLonely (So lonely)\nI'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)\nI have nobody (I have nobody)\nFor my own (To call my own, girl)\nOh, I'm so lonely (So lonely)\nI'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)\nI have nobody (I have nobody)\nFor my own (To call my own, girl)\nOh, I'm so lonely\n\n[Verse 2: Akon]\nCan't believe I had a girl like you\nAnd I just let you walk right out of my life\nAfter all I put you through\nYou still stuck around and stayed by my side\nWhat really hurt me is I broke your heart\nBaby, you a good girl and I had no right\nI really wanna make things right\n\u2018Cause without you in my life, girl, I'm so\u2026\nYou might also like[Chorus: Bobby Vinton & (Akon)]\nLonely (So lonely)\nI'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)\nI have nobody (I have nobody)\nFor my own (To call my own, girl)\nOh,

met a girl\nThat could take the things that you been through\nNever thought the day would come\nWhere you would get up and run\nAnd I would be out chasin' you\n\u2018Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be\nAin't no one in the globe I'd rather see\nThan the girl of my dreams that made me be\nSo happy, but now so lonely\n[Chorus: Bobby Vinton & Akon]\nLonely (So lonely)\nI'm Mr. Lonely (Mr.

about all the things I could've done\nI'm gonna need a forklift 'cause all the baggage weighs a ton\nI know we had our problems\nI can't remember one\n\n[Verse 3]\nI almost forgot to say something else\nAnd if I can't fit it in I'll keep it all to myself\nI almost wrote a song about you today\nBut I tore it all up and then I threw it away\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd I almost had you\nBut

with you again\nI would sacrifice\n'Cause the feeling that I feel within\nNo other man would ever make me feel so right\nIt's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night\nBut I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me\nI miss the way you hold me tight\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch\nI never thought that I could ever love a man so much\nI gotta let you know I think that we are destiny\nFor you, I'd cross the world\nFor you, I'd do anything\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's right, baby\nI'm goin' crazy\nI needa be your lady\nI've been thinkin' lately\nThat you and me\nYes, we can make it\nJust ride with me, roll with me\nI'm in love with you, baby\nThat's right, baby\nI'm goin' crazy\nI needa be your lady\nI've been thinkin' lately\nThat you and me\nYes, we can make it\nJust ride with me, roll with me\nI'm in love with you, baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nBreak it down now, I'll tell you what I feel\nFrom the moment that I met, you its been so damn real\nMy heart seems to skip another beat\nEvery time we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak\nTell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me\nAnd you love me, I'm your lady\nI'll be around waitin' for you\nI'll put it down, be the woman for you\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI'm fallin' so deep for you, crazy over for you\nI'm callin', callin' out to you\nWhat am I gonna do?\nIt's

our way into the night\nYou can hear the cries from the carnival rides\nThe pinball bells, ski ball slides\nWatching the summer sun fall out of sight\nThere's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean\nMaking it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets\nMary is holding both of her shoes in her hands\nSaid she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet\n[Chorus]\nAnd in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland\nSo tonight I hope that I will do just fine\nAnd I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion\nAnd I got just enough cash to get us in\nAnd as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me\nAnd I can feel the sting of summer on my skin\nIn the midst of the music I tell her I love her\nWe both laugh cause we know it isn't true\nBut Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight\nAnd there's so much that I long to do to you\n\n[Chorus]\nBut in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland\nSo tonight I hope that I will do just fine\nAnd I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine\n\n[Break]\nOo, oo\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd in the morning I'm leaving, making my way

once\nTried to smile and hide the way I felt\nBut I was thinking to myself\n\n[Chorus]\n(Truth is)\nI never got over you\n(Truth is)\nWish I was standing in her shoes\n(Truth is)\nAnd when it's all said and done\nGuess I\u2019m still in love with you\n(Truth is)\nI never should have let you go\n(Truth is)\nAnd it's killing me cuz now I know\n(Truth is)\nAnd when it's all said and done\nGuess I\u2019m still in love with you\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe reminisce on the way things used to be\nShared a couple laughs, shared some memories\nTalked about the things that changed\nSome for good and some for bad\nThen he said good-bye\nAnd he paid for lunch\nPromised that we'd always keep in touch\nGrabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts\nWalked away and that was that\nYou might also like[Hook]\nAnd all the feelings that I thought were gone\nCame rushing back to me at once\nTried to smile and hide the way I felt\nBut I was thinking to myself\n\n[Chorus]\n(Truth is)\nI never got over you\n(Truth is)\nWish I was standing in her shoes\n(Truth is)\nAnd when it's all said and done\nGuess I\u2019m still in love with you\n(Truth is)\nI never should have let you go\n(Truth is)\nAnd it's killing me cuz now I know\n(Truth is)\nAnd when it's all said and done\nGuess I\u2019m still in love with you\n\n[Bridge]\nNow the truth is it hurts\nBut I know that the fault is mine\n\u2018Cuz I let him go\nTried to get over it\nBut it's messin' with my mind\n(Because I know)\n[Repeat Chorus (2x)]\n[Chorus]\n(Truth is)\nI never got over you\n(Truth is)\nWish I was standing in her shoes\n(Truth is)\nAnd when it's all said and done\nGuess I\u2019m still in love with you\n(Truth is)\nI never should have let you go\n(Truth is)\nAnd it's killing me cuz now I know\n(Truth is)\nAnd when it's all said and done\nGuess I\u2019m still in love with you\n(Truth is)\nI never got over you\n(Truth is)\nWish I was standing in her shoes\n(Truth is)\nAnd when it's all said and done\nGuess I\u2019m still

sometimes\nThings may not always make sense to you right now\nBut ayy\nWhat'd Daddy always tell you?\nStraighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip\nWhat you cryin' about?\nYou got me\n\n[Verse 1]\nHailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad\nWhen I'm gone, but I'm tryna give you the life that I never had\nI can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\nI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry\n'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's witchu in your prayers\nNo more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares\nWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it\nLainie\u2014Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'\nTogether ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something\nWe have no control over, and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\n[Chorus 1]\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Momma's gon' be alright\n\n[Verse 2]\nHeh, it's funny\nI remember back one year when Daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'\n'Cause Daddy felt like a bum\u2014see, Daddy had a job but his job\nWas to keep the food on the table for you and Mom and at the time\nEvery house that we lived in either kept gettin'\nBroken into and robbed or shot up on the block and your Mom\nWas savin' money for you in a jar\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurts so bad it broke your Momma's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back\nOn to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment\nAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre  and flew you and Momma out to see me\nBut Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me\nThen you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here\nLainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShh! Momma's only gone for the moment\nYou might also like[Chorus 2]\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise, momma's gon' be alright\nAnd if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'ma give you the world, I'ma buy a diamond ring for you\nI'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'ma break that birdie's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat\nDon't fuck with Dad!

scattered news\nYou know my fantasies, am I feelin' things or can this be\nYour girlfriend tryin' to sandwich me\nMy heart's colder than sandwich meat\n'Cause I, come from the hood where the hammers be\nI move fast with a switch pace\nAnd pop a Listerine strip in, before you get all up in a bitch face\nMovin' your body like this\nGon' make me blow like a bottle of Crist'\nMan I don't know no one hotter than Twist\nYou got my temperature risin'\nFrom your hips and your thighs and\nAnd that glare in your eyes'll brighten up a horizon\nIt comes naturally, I don't bribe 'em\nIt's as easy as one, two, three and I slide in\n\n[Chorus: Avant]\nI am, the one you denied\nBrushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright\nI'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side\nIf you ready

been out the night before with all my friends\nA little worried, kinda wondering what i did\nI said lord please forgive me for my sins\nMy wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first\nYou're going if i have to drag your butt to church\n\n[Hook]\nI love this crazy, tragic\nSometimes almost magic\nAwful, beautiful life\n[Verse 2]\nI read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along\nMade it throught the sunday sermon wide awake\nWe met the family for dinner at our home\nDrank some beers, watched the game and cooked some steaks\nMy little brother had a big fight with his wife\nMy poor mother sat between them both all night\n\n[Hook]\nI love this crazy, tragic\nSometimes almost magic\nAwful, beautiful life\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe said a prayer for Cousin Michael in Iraq\nWe're all aware he may never make it back\nWe talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes\nAnd how he wanted to be a soldier more than most\n\n[Verse 4]\nI laid in bed that night and thought about the day\nAnd how my life was like a rollercoaster ride\nThe ups and downs and crazy turns along the way\nIt'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight\nYou can't really smile until you've shed some tears\nI could die today or i might live on for years\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI love this crazy, tragic\nSometimes almost magic\nAwful, beautiful life\n\nI love this crazy, tragic\nSometimes almost magic\nAwful,

big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair\nPalm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing\nI picture myself right there\nOn some beach, somewhere\n[Verse 2]\nI circled the parking lot trying to find a spot\nJust big enough I could park my old truck\nA man with a big cigar was getting into his car\nI stopped and I waited for him to back up\nBut from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz\nCame cruising up and whipped right in\n\n[Chorus 2]\nSome beach, somewhere\nThere's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there\nThere's cold margaritas and hot se\u00f1ioritas smiling with long dark hair\nOn some beach, somewhere\n\n[Verse 3]\nI sat in that waiting room\nIt seemed like all afternoon\nThe nurse finally said doc's ready for you\nYou\u2019re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain\nThat tooth will be fine in a minute or two\nBut he stuck that needle down deep in my gum\nAnd he started drilling before I was numb\n\n[Chorus 3]\nSome beach, somewhere\nThere's a
