man\nShe was seventeen and she was far from in-between\nIt was summertime in Northern Michigan\nAh ah ah\nAh ah ah\n\n[Verse 1]\nSplashing through the sand bar\nTalking by the campfire\nIt's the simple things in life, like when and where\nWe didn't have no internet\nBut man, I never will forget\nThe way the moonlight shined upon her hair\n[Hook]\nAnd we were trying different things\nWe were smoking funny things\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\nSipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\n\n[Verse 2]\nCatching walleye from the dock\nWatching the waves roll off the rocks\nShe'll forever hold a spot inside my soul\nWe'd blister in the sun\nWe couldn't wait for night to come\nTo hit that sand and play some rock and roll\n\n[Hook]\nWhile we were trying different things\nWe were smoking funny things\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\nSipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\nSinging \"Sweet Home Alabama\" all summer long\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change\nOr how we thought those days would never end\nSometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along\nAnd think man I'd love to see that girl again\n(Man I'd love to see that girl again) Yeah\nSee Kid Rock LiveGet tickets as low as $215You might also like[Hook]\nAnd we were trying different things\nWe were smoking funny things\nMaking love

Boone]\nBartender, I really did it this time\nBroke my parole to have a good time\nWhen I got home it was 6 am\nThe door was locked, so I kicked it in\nShe was trippin' on the bills\nI think she was high on some pills\nShe threw my shit out into the yard\nThen she called me a bum and slapped me real hard\nAnd in my drunken stupor, I did what I should've never done\nNow I'm sittin' here, talkin' to you, drunk and on the run\n[Chorus: Danny Boone]\nI'm sittin' at a bar on the inside\nWaitin' for my ride on the outside\nShe broke my heart in the trailer park\nSo I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car\nAnd crashed that piece of shit, then stepped away\n\n[Verse 2: Danny Boone]\nYou know Moe, I'll probably get ten years\nSo just give me beers 'til they get here\nYeah, I know the sun is comin' up\nAnd y'all are probably gettin' ready for closin' up\nBut I'm tryna drown my soul\nI'm tired of this life on the dirt road\nAnd everything that I love is gone\nAnd I'm tired of hangin' on\n\n[Chorus: Danny Boone]\nShe got me sittin' at a bar on the inside\nWaitin' for my ride on the outside\nShe stole my heart in the trailer park\nSo I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car\nAnd crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away\n\n[Verse 3: Brooks Buford]\nGuess it was meant to be, romance is misery\nSo much for memories and now I'm headed to the penitentiary\nSee me on T.V., the next Cop series, I am a danger\nI guess I should've did somethin' about my anger\nBut I never learn, real things I don't concern\nI pour kerosene on everything I love and watch it burn\nI know it's my fault, but I wasn't happy it was over\nShe threw a fit, so I crashed that piece a shit Nova\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Danny Boone]\nAnd now I'm goin' back again\nBack to the pen to see my friends\nAnd when we all pile out that county van\nThey'll ask me where I've been\n\n[Chorus: Danny Boone]\nI've been at a bar on the inside\nWaitin' for my ride on the outside\nShe broke my heart in the trailer park\nSo I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car\nI crashed that piece of shit, then stepped away\n\n[Outro: Danny Boone]\nWell, I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside\nAnd I'm waitin' on my ride on the outside\nYou know I crashed that piece of shit then I stepped away\nYeah, yeah, I stepped away\nYou know I crashed that piece of shit and then I stepped away\nI stepped away-ay-ay\nAnd then I

world start to turn\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll taste every moment and live it out loud\nI know this is the time, this is the time to be\nMore than a name or a face in the crowd\nI know this is the time, this is the time of my life\nTime of my life\n\n[Verse 2]\nHoldin' onto things that vanished into the air\nLeft me in pieces\nBut now I'm risin' from the ashes\nFinding my wings\nAnd all that I needed\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWas there all along within' my reach\nAs close as the beat of my heart\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll taste every moment and live it out loud\nI know this is the time, this is the time

lights\nThe honking horns\nAll seem to fade away\nBut in the shadow of the hospital\nAt 5:08\nI saw God today\n[Chorus]\nI've been to church\nI've read the book\nI know He's there\nBut I don't look\nNear as often as I should\n\nHis fingerprints are everywhere\nI just look down and stop and stare\nOpen my eyes and then I swear\nI Saw God Today\n\n[Verse 2]\nSaw a couple walking by\nThey were holding hands\nAnd she had that glow\nYeah, I couldn't help\nBut I noticed that she was starting to show\nStood there for a minute\nTaking in the sky\nLost in that sunset\nA splash of amber melting into shades of red\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been to church\nI've read the book\nI know He's there\nBut I don't look\nNear as often as I should\nSee George Strait LiveGet tickets as low as $116You might also

town Southern man\n\n[Verse 2]\nFirst there came four pretty daughters\nFor this small town Southern man\nThen a few years later came another\nA boy, he wasn't planned\nSeven people living all together\nIn a house built with his own hands\nLittle words with love and understanding\nFrom a small town Southern man\n[Chorus]\nAnd he bowed his head to Jesus\nAnd he stood for Uncle Sam\nAnd he only loved one woman\nHe was always proud of what he had\nHe said his greatest contribution\nIs the ones you leave behind\nRaised on the ways and gentle kindness\nOf a small town Southern man\n\n[Verse 3]\nCallous hands told the story\nFor this small town Southern man\nHe gave it all to keep it all together\nAnd keep his family on his land\nLike his daddy, years wore out his body\nMade it hard just to walk and stand\nYou can break the back\nBut you can't break the spirit\nOf a small town Southern man\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd he bowed his head to Jesus\nAnd he stood for Uncle Sam\nAnd he only loved one woman\nHe was always proud of what he had\nHe said his greatest contribution\nIs the ones you leave behind\nRaised on the ways and gentle kindness\nOf a small town Southern man\nYou

blessed, and I know I am\n'Cause God has a place in Heaven\nFor the small town Southern man\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd he bowed his head to Jesus\nAnd he stood for Uncle Sam\nAnd he only loved one woman\nHe was

You?\nDid you improve on a design? Did you do something new?\nWell, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?\nYou\u2014the more famous person\u2014you come through\nAnd the sexy lady next to you, you come too!\"\nAnd then it hit me, standing outside of heaven\nWaiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth\nUnschooled to the rules and too gumshoe\nToo much of a newcomer and too uncool\nLike Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well\nThough I need a holiday like lady who sung blue\n\"Go back, whatever you did, you undo.\"\nHeavy as heaven, the devil on me two tons too\nHa, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha\n[Chorus: Matthew

most of us don't want it to fade\nWe want it to braid\nMeaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay\nLike the governor called, and he told him to wait\nUnstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage\nThe audience ain't fazed\nAnd they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Uh)\nThey want everything back (Back) that they've paid\n'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim\nHa, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha\n[Chorus: Matthew Santos]\nIf you are what you say you are\nA superstar\nThen have no fear, the crowd is here\nAnd the lights are on\nAnd they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah\n[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nSo, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away\n'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days\nMe and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front\nThey told me all of the tickets were gone\nSo just take me home where the mood is mellow\nAnd the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow\nAnd the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker\nEverybody gets a nice autograph picture\nOne for you and one for your sister\nWho had to work tonight but is an avid listener\nEvery song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback\nAll the reviewers say, \"You need to go and see that!\"\nAnd everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased\nAnd then, they all take the stage and start performing for me\nLike, \"Ha, ha,

seventeen\nFirst, I'd prove it's me by sayin' look under your bed\nThere's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid\nAnd then I'd say I know it's tough\nWhen you break up after seven months\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair\nBut all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare\n[Chorus]\nAnd, oh, you got so much goin' for you, goin' right\nBut I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night\nShe wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife\nStickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive\nBut you'll make it through this and you'll see\nYou're still around to write this letter to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nAt the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth\nAlways stop completely, well, don't just tap your brakes\nAnd when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full\nOn second thought, forget it, that one turns out kinda cool\nEach and every time you have a fight\nJust assume you're wrong and Dad is right\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman, she spends so much extra time\nIt's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishin' you 'til you shine\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd, oh, you got so much goin' for you, goin' right\nBut I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night\nTonight's the bonfire rally, but you're stayin' home instead\nBecause if you fail Algebra, Mom and Dad'll kill you dead\nBut trust me, you'll squeak by and get a C\nAnd you're still around to write this letter to me\nSee Brad Paisley LiveGet tickets as low as $175You might also like[Bridge]\nWell, you got so much up ahead and you'll make new friends\nYou should see your kids and wife\nAnd I'd end by sayin' have no fear\nThese are nowhere near the best years of your life\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI guess I'll see you in the mirror when you're a grown man\nP.S., go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd, oh, you got so much goin' for you, goin' right\nBut I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night\nI, I wish you'd study Spanish, I wish you'd take a typin' class\nI wish you wouldn't worry, let it be\nHey, I'd say have a little faith and you'll see\n\n[Outro]\nIf I could write a letter to me\nTo me5Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/1204236", "artist_names": "Chuck Wicks",

began\n\n[Verse 1]\nSend in your skeletons\nSing as their bones go marching in again\nThe need you buried deep\nThe secrets that you keep are at the ready\nAre you ready?\nI'm finished making sense\nDone pleading ignorance, that whole defense\nSpinning infinity, boy\nThe wheel is spinning me, it's never ending, never ending\nSame old story\n[Chorus]\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others?\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?\nYou're the pretender\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others?\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?\nYou're the pretender\nWhat if I say that I'll never surrender?\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn time or so I'm told\nI'm just another soul for sale, oh well\nThe page is out of print\nWe are not permanent, we're temporary, temporary\nSame old story\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others?\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?\nYou're the pretender\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others?\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?\nYou're the pretender\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI'm the voice inside your head\nYou refuse to hear\nI'm the face that you have to face\nMirroring your stare\nI'm what's left, I'm what's right\nI'm the enemy\nI'm the hand that'll take you down\nBring you to your knees\nSo who are you?\nYeah, who are you?\nYeah, who are you?\nYeah, who are you?\nKeep you in the dark, you know they all pretend\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others?\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?\nYou're the pretender\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others?\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?\nYou're the pretender\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\n[Outro]\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others? (Keep you in the dark)\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (You know they all)\nYou're the pretender (Pretend)\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others? (Keep you in the dark)\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (You know they all)\nYou're the pretender (Pretend)\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\nSo who are you?\nYeah, who are you?\nYeah, who are you?61Embed"}]
