though?\nWe the best music...\nI guess I'm on my Don shit\nWhat that mean?\nI'ma go, aaaa\nDJ Khaled\n\n[Verse 1: Big Sean]\nStraight up, late nights mixed with early days\nIt'll probably be that way until the pearly gates\nStress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break\nThese hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man\nSheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it\nRealize the energy you give is what you manifested\nSo understand we positive as could be\nThe vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats\nBoy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach\nKhaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in\nEverything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating\nIf it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan\nWoah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers\nYou know it's true, bitch I need respect due\nNow or later, either way I'ma take it\nJust like it's fuckin' taxes\nNo wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch\nLately I been living life in detachment\nI practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions\nWe been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting\nDetroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion\nFather help us, police doing target practice with real bodies\nMommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body\nNiggas over stressing, we under investigation\nEvery day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist\nBeat your ass until you purple\nThey can't even tell what your race is\nDoctor King meet Dr. Dre\nExcept this doctor lost all his patience\nHave you tied up in a basement\nWith you and your partner facing adjacent\nUntil you deposit payment or reparations\nIf you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me\nIt feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key\n[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]\nAnd I'ma celebrate it for a long time\nThey tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine\nSurrounded by my angels and we all shine\nHoly, holy, holy, holy key\nAnd I'ma celebrate it for a long time\nThey tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine\nSurrounded by my angels and we all shine\nHoly, holy, holy,  holy key\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nEverything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)\nEverything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)\nEverything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings\nOut for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was\nI don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back\nI ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that\nI don't resonate with the concept of love and hate\nCause your perspective is less effective and rather fake\nThe universe and the heavens work in my DNA\nKendrick said \"Fuck Mother Earth,\" that's PSA\nThe land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit\nWalking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness\nUncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again\nThe underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in\nThe big money, the fast cars, my life produced\nThe blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube\nSo what you look up to?\nFame and fortune, bitches, Porsches\nSources with designer thing\nBrand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me\nLaw enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed\nFuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed\nTwo new Royce's with choices of color my desire need\nCrab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee\nFlesh and poison the point is the reason\nYou won't die in peace\nOpen door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally\nI destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me\nTape recording my voices and tweak it\nLet's play hide and seek\nWar distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least\nI'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast\nI don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD\nHair like ODB, I'm off a higher need\nKhaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration\nBut when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix\nYou might also like[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]\nOh yeah, mhm yeah\nAnd I'ma celebrate it for a long time\nThey tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine\nSurrounded by my angels and we all shine\nHoly, holy, holy, holy key\nAnd I'ma celebrate it for a long time\nThey tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine\nSurrounded by my angels and we all shine\nHoly, holy, holy,  holy key\n\n[Outro: Betty Wright]\nHoly, Holy key, holy88Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12, "api_path":

send her back to you\nShe gon' have Guwop on her breath\nI'm the last real nigga left\nI'm on an island  by myself\nI'm my only competition so I'm battling with myself\nFacing prison, drug addiction\nIt's like I'm battling with myself\nI done shook off all my demons\nNow I'm back to myself\nYou didn't keep it real nigga so just keep it to yourself\nWaiting on Gucci Mane to call

streets\nMuhammad Ali and these streets miss me\nI went from trappin' on the block to niggas trappin' for me\nI left the trappin' went to rap thought you\u2019d be happy for me\nAnd then your jealousy turned to hate\nAnd you wrote a statement on me\nBut when they let me out the gates\nMy bitch was waiting on me\nSee I ain't mad at you homie, we ain't got no beef\nBut I ain't got no rat for you, I know you must love cheese\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nI got money that I saved then I'm back on road\nGet my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road\nI still do these hoes the same when I'm back on

reaction\n[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]\nThose who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down\nCause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound\nIf they try to deny us or silence us now\nWe just say no,

fear from our eyes\nLove is a call to action\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]\nThose who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down\nCause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound\nIf they try to deny

the music is playing and the place is jumping\nWhen the bass rattles your ribcage, hey something's changed\nI'm dancing face to face with a stranger\nA moment of grace, you know that you're safe, and they just\nDrop the beat the moment you most needed it\nYou came in as a question until the music completed it\nMe and you in the universe, moving in unison, coming in hot\nBut in the grand scheme what do we got?\nWhat we got is love even when the sinners hate us\nWe can not let 'em diminish or intimidate us\nWe sing out, we got the rhythm and the truth on our side\nWe cut through the divide and we do it with pride\n(Wake up, wake up, wake up)\nA generation of innovators unable to patiently wait for change\nCause change is what they've been afraid of\nTheir malevolence can wait, raise the level of debate\nCelebrate, elevate, love, love\n(Love make the world go round)\n[Interlude: Lin-Manuel Miranda (Jennifer Lopez)]\nCannot be killed or swept aside\n(Love make the world go round)\nAnd fill the world with music, love and pride\n(Love make the world go round\nLove make the world go round)\nAnd love is love, is love, is love is love\nIs love, is love, is love, is love\n(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)\n\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]\nLove make the world go round\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nLove make the world go round\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nLove make the world go

I wanted to speak with a gay-rights group that I had researched and admired, so I called its local Honolulu branch.\n\nThe office number turned out to be some guy\u2019s cell phone. I left him a message\u2014I said, \u201cI\u2019m from out of town, I\u2019m visiting Hawaii on business, I\u2019d like to  get some information on your group.\u201d After two or three more calls, he answered the phone. I said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m the guy that called about your organization.\u201d And he said, somewhat impatiently, \u201cOkay, well, what did you want?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, let me put it to you this way, Nick. Your name is Nick? Nick, let me begin by asking you a question. Who would you say, by your estimation, is the most homophobic member of the entertainment industry currently in the media?\u201d And he paused for a long count of four and said, \u201cUm \u2026 Alec Baldwin?\u201d\n\nAnd I said, \u201cDing, ding, ding, ding! Bingo, Nick, bingo! That\u2019s who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cNick, I want to come in and talk.\u201d\n\nI met with Nick and others from two LGBT organizations. We talked for a while about the torment of the LGBT life many of them have lived while growing up in traditional Hawaiian families. Macho fathers. Religious mothers. We talked a lot about words and their power, especially in the lives of young people.\nOne young man, an F-to-M tranny, said, \u201cAre you here to get dry-cleaned, like Brett Ratner?\u201d Meaning I could do some mea culpa, write them a six-figure check, go to a dinner, sob at the table, give a heartfelt speech, beg for forgiveness. I thought to myself: Beg for forgiveness for something I didn\u2019t do?\n\nI said, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to get dry-cleaned. I don\u2019t want to be decontaminated by you, Karen Silkwood\u2013wise, scrubbed down. I want to learn about what is hurtful speech in your community. I want to participate in some programs about that. Or underwrite one. And then, like you, I just want to be left alone.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve read where a number of people have felt that 2013 was a shitty year. For me, it was actually a great year, because my wife and I had a baby. But, yeah, everything else was pretty awful. And I find myself bitter, defensive, and more misanthropic than I care to admit. And I\u2019m trying to understand what happened, how an altercation on the street, in which I was accused\u2014wrongly\u2014of using a gay slur, could have cascaded like this. There\u2019s been a shift in my life. And it\u2019s caused me to step back and say, This is happening for a reason.\n\nI\u2019ve had a relatively charmed life. I loved to be out in the city. New York was my town. I\u2019ve had people come up to me and say, \u201cYou\u2019re a great New Yorker. You\u2019ve given your time and money to so many New York charities. You\u2019re a great supporter of the arts. I like some of your movies\u2014and some of your movies suck, actually.\u201d (It\u2019s New York, so people give you their unvarnished opinion.) But people in general had been very kind to me for years.\n\nAnd then, last November, everything changed.\n\nAm I a homophobe? Look, I work in show business. I am awash in gay people, as colleagues and as friends. I\u2019m doing Rock of Ages one day, making out with Russell Brand. Soon after that, I\u2019m advocating with Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Cynthia Nixon for marriage equality. I\u2019m officiating at a gay friend\u2019s wedding. I\u2019m not a homophobic person at all. But this is how the world now sees me.\nI haven\u2019t changed, but public life has.\n\nIt used to be you\u2019d go into a restaurant and the owner would say, \u201cDo you mind if I take a picture of you and put it on my wall?\u201d Sweet and simple. Now, everyone has a camera in their pocket. Add to that predatory photographers and predatory videographers who want to taunt you and catch you doing embarrassing things. (Some proof of which I have provided.) You\u2019re out there in a world where if you do make a mistake, it echoes in a digital canyon forever.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t the days of Rona Barrett and Ron Galella, who were viewed as outcasts or peripheral at best. Paparazzi today are part of a network that includes the Huffington Post and, much to my dismay, even NBC News, in their reliance on tabloid reporting.\n\nPhotographers today get right up in your face, my wife\u2019s, my baby\u2019s. They are baiting you. You can tell they want to get into it with you. Some bump into me or block the entrance to my apartment, frustrating my neighbors (some of whom may regret that I live in their building).\n\nI\u2019m self-aware enough to know that I am to blame for some of this. I definitely should not have reacted the way I did in some of these situations. I don\u2019t have these issues with waiters, traffic cops, store clerks. I know there\u2019s an impression that I\u2019m someone who seeks to have violent confrontations with people. I don\u2019t. Do I regret screaming at some guy who practically clipped my kid in the head with the lens of a camera? Yeah, I probably do, because it\u2019s only caused me problems.\n\nBut\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t let go of this\u2014do people really, really believe that, when I shouted at that guy, I called him a \u201cfaggot\u201d on-camera? Do you honestly believe I would give someone like TMZ\u2019s Harvey Levin, of all people, another club to beat me with?\n\nWhat happened is, a TMZ videographer ambushed me as I was putting my family in a car, and I chased him down the block and said, \u201cCocksucking motherfucker\u201d or whatever (when I have some volatile interaction with these people, I don\u2019t pull out a pen and take notes on what I said). I knew that guy. This was a guy who is on a bike usually, and when we get in a car, he follows us. Very aggressive. The same guy who followed my wife on a bicycle, and when she slipped and fell trying to dodge him and hurt her leg, he laughed at her and said, \u201cSee what I made you do?\u201d At my wife. How would that make you feel?\n\nLast year began with making plans to do a play called Orphans, on Broadway. I was filled with hope. I had spent six and a half years on a television sitcom. I won every award you could win in television. I got paid well. And people loved 30 Rock. And I loved 30 Rock. I mean, sometimes you do a show that\u2019s a hit show and you hate it. As my agent used to say, you don\u2019t want to be walking down an alleyway with a flashlight in your hand for ten years, doing some police procedural. We had a ball. And everybody was funny. And I\u2019ll never laugh that way again. And I miss that show terribly. I know we all had to move on because it\u2019s Tina Fey\u2019s show and Tina had worked herself to death. She\u2019s a mom with two kids. Eventually, it had to end. But I\u2019ll never have it that good again, professionally.\nGetting back onstage seemed like a good idea. I loved Lyle Kessler\u2019s play and was anxious to work with director Dan Sullivan. Then Shia LaBeouf showed up. I\u2019d heard from other people that he was potentially very difficult to work with, but I always ignore that because people say the same thing about me. When he showed up, he seemed like a lot of young actors today\u2014scattered, as he was coming from making six movies in a row or whatever.\n\nThere was friction between us from the beginning. LaBeouf seems to carry with him, to put it mildly, a jailhouse mentality wherever he goes. When he came to rehearsal, he was told it was important to memorize his lines. He took that to heart and learned all his lines in advance, even emailing me videos in which he read aloud his lines from the entire play. To prove he had put in the time. (What else do you do in jail?) I, however, do not learn my lines in advance. So he began to sulk because he felt we were slowing him down. You could tell right away he loves to argue. And one day he attacked me in front of everyone. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re slowing me down, and you don\u2019t know your lines. And if you don\u2019t say your lines, I\u2019m just going to keep saying my lines.\u201d\n\nWe all sat, frozen. I snorted a bit, and, turning to him in front of the whole cast, I asked, \u201cIf I don\u2019t say my words fast enough, you\u2019re going to just say your next line?\u201d I said. \u201cYou realize the lines are written in a certain order?\u201d He just glared at me.\n\nSo I asked the company to break. And I took the stage manager, with Sullivan, to another room, and I said one of us is going to go. I said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll go.\u201d I said don\u2019t fire the kid, I\u2019ll quit. They said no, no, no, no, and they fired him. And I think he was shocked. He had that card, that card you get when you make films that make a lot of money that gives you a certain kind of entitlement. I think he was surprised that it didn\u2019t work in the theater.\n\nBut firing LaBeouf didn\u2019t help things. Sullivan played both sides. In emails, he coddled Shia. To me, he spoke differently. I was working with an older, more enervated Sullivan, who didn\u2019t have the energy for any of this. I don\u2019t think Sullivan liked the play\u2014I don\u2019t think he liked me. Sullivan agreed to do something that, once he realized what it was, he had lost interest in it. We closed early. I\u2019ll forever be indebted to Ben Foster for stepping in for Shia. He is one of the good guys.\n\nMy \u201ccareer\u201d as a talk-show host started with a perfectly simple ambition. In my WNYC podcast, \u201cHere\u2019s the Thing,\u201d I wanted to conduct interviews based on appreciation of my guests and their work. Or, in the case of those like George Will, a respect for their careers, whether I agreed with them or not. To think that something as uncomplicated and innocent as that led to the MSNBC debacle is still surreal to me. My goal was always to take a talk show to the network. I never wanted to be on MSNBC. My contacts at the network said to me, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a slot for you on the network right now.\u201d And I told them that was fine. And they said, \u201cMaybe you go on MSNBC for a year and we\u2019ll hone and refine the show?\u201d And I said okay.\n\nI watched MSNBC, prior to working there, very sporadically. Once I had signed a contract with them, I wanted to see more of what they were about. It turned out to be the same shit all day long. The only difference was who was actually pulling off whatever act they had come up with. Morning Joe was boring. Scarborough is neither eloquent nor funny. And merely cranky doesn\u2019t always work well in the morning. Mika B. is the Margaret Dumont of cable news. I liked Chris Jansing a lot. Very straightforward. I like Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, but he\u2019s too smart to be doing that show. Rachel Maddow is Rachel Maddow, the ultimate wonk/dweeb who got a show, polished it, made it her own. She\u2019s talented. The problem with everybody on MSNBC is none of them are funny, although that doesn\u2019t prevent them from trying to be.\n\nMy pitch to them was: I\u2019m going to bring the WNYC podcast to MSNBC. And that show is going to be eclectic\u2014guests who don\u2019t often get the microphone. I want to keep it simple. I get somebody in a chair and I shoot the shit with them for an hour and a half and we cut it into a one-hour show. Dick Cavett was my hero who allowed there to be pauses in the show. He put \u00adpeople on who were somewhat unconventional.\n\nSo I\u2019m going to go on MSNBC, and people are speculating, \u201cOh, here he comes! Crazy liberal! And what\u2019s he going to do? Is he going to try to give Bill Maher a run for his money? Is he going to try to give Jon Stewart a run for his money?\u201d And I think, Are you out of your fucking mind? Those men are stars of established, highly successful shows. That\u2019s never going to happen. My show was meant to be as harmless and inoffensive as could be. There was one theme to the 52 episodes of the WNYC podcast and only one way it worked\u2014the show was about appreciation. I wasn\u2019t out to get anybody or make anybody look bad, because I know what that\u2019s like.\n\nMSNBC assigned a producer to me, Jonathan Larsen. Like Sullivan with Orphans, Larsen didn\u2019t get me or the show and didn\u2019t want to be there. When I told him I wanted to interview Debra Winger, Larsen looked like, We\u2019re here on a set, with an expensive crew and studio time, and you want to talk to Debra Winger? There was nothing less interesting to him. Most of the guests I suggested\u2014Ellen Barkin, Neal Barnard from PCRM, JFK-conspiracy icon Mark Lane\u2014he couldn\u2019t care less. As we went along, Larsen would simply stare at me after everything I\u2019d suggest and say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s see what Phil says.\u201d Larsen was sent there to babysit me.\n\nPhil Griffin is the head of MSNBC, and when I saw that Griffin didn\u2019t have a single piece of paper on his desk, meeting after meeting after meeting, that should have been my first indication there was going to be a problem. Phil is a veteran programmer who knows well the corridors and chambers of television programming\u2014and couldn\u2019t give a flying fuck about content. All he wanted to talk about was Giants tickets, Super Bowl tickets, restaurants, movies. The conversations about the set, about the physical production of the show, cameras, lighting\u2014it seemed like he wanted to get those over with as quickly as possible. He didn\u2019t care. He had four monitors on the wall. They were all on, muted. He never listened to them. He never watched them.\n\nThe meetings with Phil were brisk and convivial. Eventually, however, we got to the point where he asked, \u201cSo you really meant it when you said you wanted to do your podcast on the air, on TV?\u201d And I told him, yes, that was my idea. That was when he explained to me that TV, with its visual component, was different. When viewers turn the channel, they want to see something. They want to see Robert Redford. They want to see Justin Timberlake. TV \u201ccaptures\u201d the audience with the visual.\n\nHe said that we needed to change it up. At first I thought, This is not working. It was a mistake and I need to get out of here. And I told Phil so. Then I stopped and I said to myself, They might be right. I would try it their way.\nThe first name they came up with was Rob Lowe. They said, Rob Lowe\u2019s going to be in the building. Do you want to interview Rob? I said, \u201cNot particularly.\u201d Rob\u2019s a famous star of films, TV. He\u2019s Rob Lowe. He\u2019s famous. But there\u2019s no shortage of outlets for him. And they looked at me like, You really don\u2019t get it. I think they thought, You should have just said yes, simply to play the game.\n\nI should have simply said, \u201cSure, bring in Rob Lowe.\u201d\n\nJust prior to all of this, there was Jimmy Gandolfini\u2019s funeral. I was despondent about his death. Jimmy was a \u201cshowbiz friend,\u201d one with whom I had worked and greeted warmly whenever our paths crossed. His death hit me somewhat hard, considering his baby daughter and the fact that he was younger than me. I ended up attacking a reporter who wrote in the Daily Mail online that my wife was tweeting from Jimmy\u2019s funeral. He was wrong\u2014in fact, at a later time, she had retweeted items whose original time code matched the time of the funeral.\n\nIn my rage, however, I called him a \u201ctoxic little queen,\u201d and, thus, Anderson Cooper, the self-appointed Jack Valenti of gay media culture, suggested I should be \u201cvilified,\u201d in his words. I didn\u2019t feel bad about the incident. He lied about my wife. They say this is what comes with stardom\u2014I don\u2019t agree with you. A journalist isn\u2019t supposed to write a lie about you. If he was in New York, I might have had the impulse to beat the shit out of the guy. At the time, I didn\u2019t view \u201ctoxic little queen\u201d as a homophobic statement. I didn\u2019t realize how those words could give offense, and I\u2019m sorry for that.\n\nThen this other thing happens with TMZ and then it becomes a one-two punch. All this is based on the fact of them believing what I said on a video.\n\nHarvey Levin exists in his own universe. He\u2019s this kind of cretinous barnacle on the press. Levin told the world that that muffled sound on the video\u2014Levin wanted everyone to know he knows what it is. You don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t know, but Levin knows, and he tells the world that it\u2019s \u201cfaggot.\u201d\n\nI get angry, and I\u2019ve said all sorts of things in anger, but I\u2019d never use that word. Levin has so little regard for the truth, which is odd, knowing he was once a legal correspondent for the CBS affiliate in L.A. He\u2019s also the one who revealed the tape that my ex-wife\u2019s lawyers provided of me yelling at my daughter seven years ago. Knowing that none of it would have transpired if I hadn\u2019t left the message in the first place, I think he hurt my daughter more than anyone.\n\nIn the recent video, you see me completely riled up and going after this guy and you hear me saying \u201ccocksucker\u201d and then some bisyllabic word that sounds like \u201cfaggot\u201d\u2014but wasn\u2019t. Still, it doesn\u2019t matter. glaad comes after me and Anderson Cooper comes after me and Andrew Sullivan comes after me, all maintaining that I\u2019m a hateful homophobe. All based on what Harvey Levin told them.\n\nImmediately prior to this, I\u2019d go see Phil and I\u2019d say, \u201cWhat are the ratings?\u201d If I had 15 meetings with Phil Griffin, 5 of them were after the show, with me saying, \u201cWhat do you make of these ratings?\u201d He\u2019d say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It takes time.\u201d (We beat Cooper two of three Fridays at ten.) Although he appeared to have some buyer\u2019s remorse, he told me to hang in there. After the TMZ event, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have to suspend you. But this will blow over.\u201d I have all the emails to prove it. And then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, MSNBC said, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nOnce they fired me, a former MSNBC employee I knew emailed me. He said, \u201cYou watch now, Phil is going to start leaking left and right to bury you.\u201d When I left, \u201cPage Six\u201d was flooded with lies about me. Another told me, regarding the \u201ctoxic little queen\u201d comment, that Rachel Maddow was the prime mover in my firing, as she was aghast that I had been hired and viewed me as equivalent to Mel Gibson. Another source told me, \u201cYou know who\u2019s going to get you fired, don\u2019t you? Rachel. Phil will do whatever Rachel tells him to do.\u201d I think Rachel Maddow is quite good at what she does. I also think she\u2019s a phony who doesn\u2019t have the same passion for the truth off-camera that she seems to have on the air.\n\nThey invoked a morals clause and refused to pay my contract. Later, when Martin Bashir resigned, I was disappointed. Bashir brought a depth of experience and polish that I imagined might help get MSNBC to a higher place, content-wise, in spite of Griffin and his episodes of Lockup and To Catch a Predator. I suppose the end of the show was inevitable. And the Conan O\u2019Brien treatment came as no surprise. What hurt was that several of the writers and segment producers I worked with were wonderful and talented people. As I meandered through the ill-conceived process, I had grown very fond of them and hopeful about our possibilities once Larsen was replaced.\n\nI went to the opening of the play Machinal, put on by Roundabout, where I\u2019m on the board, and I can\u2019t tell you how frosty the reception was toward me. These are all people who are heavy-hitting theatrical artists in that community and many of them are gay. And I was thinking to myself, These people think I\u2019m a homophobe. And that makes me incredibly sad.\nEvery time people throw this mud on me, there are very serious consequences in my life. The single most painful episode for me was last year when a New York Post photographer, an ex-cop, accused me of \u00adcalling him a \u201ccoon.\u201d This was totally false, as was revealed on his own tape. A D.A. in the hate-crimes unit called me in. At the time, I had just been asked to join the board of the Arthur Ashe Learning Center, so I had to call Jeanne Moutoussamy\u00ad-Ashe and ask her, now that I was on the cover of the New York Post labeled as a racist, if she still wanted me to attend a coming event. Jeanne was her ever-gracious self and said yes, but that broke my heart.\n\nI spent 25 years working hard for the issues I care about. When 30 Rock went into syndication, I sensed that I was going to be on TV for a bit, so I crafted my arrangement with Capital One Bank to fund my foundation for charitable giving. They paid me $15 million over nearly five years. After taxes and accounting fees, I will have given all of it, $14.125 million, to charity. After the TMZ event, Capital One did not renew my contract, although it politely said the two things were unrelated. AT&T had booked me for a paid speech in Orlando\u2014and then canceled. WNYC lost funding for my radio show. Bill de Blasio, who apparently gets his news from TMZ, too, distanced himself from me.\n\nNow I loathe and despise the media in a way I did not think possible. I used to engage with the media knowing that some of it would be adversarial, but now it\u2019s superfluous at best and toxic at its worst. If MSNBC went off the air tomorrow, what difference would it make? If the Huffington Post went out of business tomorrow, what difference would it make? Arianna Huffington accomplished what she wanted to accomplish. She created this wonderful thing. And what have they done with that? They want clicks, I get it. They\u2019ve gotta have clicks for their advertisers, so they\u2019re going to need as much Kim Kardashian and wardrobe malfunctions as possible. The other day, they had a thing on the home page about pimples. Tripe. Liberal and conservative media are now precisely equivalent.\n\nI\u2019m aware that it\u2019s ironic that I\u2019m making this case in the media\u2014but this is the last time I\u2019m going to talk about my personal life in an American publication ever again.\n\nWhen this whole thing happened, Warren Beatty, who is mystifyingly intelligent and wise, said to me: Your problem is a very basic one, and it\u2019s very common to actors. And that\u2019s when we step in front of a camera, we feel the need to make it into a moment. This instinct, even unconsciously, is to make the exchange in front of the camera a dramatic one. Perhaps I fell for that.\nIn the New Media culture, anything good you do is tossed in a pit, and you are measured by who you are on your worst day. What\u2019s the Boy Scout code? Trustworthy. Loyal. Helpful. Friendly. Courteous. Kind. Obedient. Cheerful. Thrifty. Brave. Clean. Reverent. I might be all of those things, at certain moments. But people suspect that whatever good you do, you are faking. You\u2019re that guy. You\u2019re that guy that says this. There is a core of outlets that are pushing these stories out. Breitbart clutters the blogosphere with \u201cAlec Baldwin, he\u2019s the Devil, he\u2019s Fidel Baldwin.\u201d\n\nBroadway has changed, by my lights. The TV networks, too. New York has changed. Even the U.S., which is so preposterously judgmental now. The heart, the arteries of the country are now clogged with hate. The fuel of American political life is hatred. Who would ever dream that Obama would deserve to be treated the way he has been? The birth-certificate bullshit, which is just Obama\u2019s version of Swiftboating. And all for the electoral nullification that seems like a cancer on the American system. But this is Roger Ailes. And Fox. And Breitbart. And this is all about hate. It\u2019s Hate Incorporated. But the liberals have taken the bait and run in the same direction\u2014and it\u2019s just as corrosive. MSNBC, in its own way, is as full of shit, as redundant and as superfluous, as Fox.\n\nI think America\u2019s more fucked up now than it\u2019s ever been. People are angry that in the game of musical chairs that is the U.S. economy, there are less seats at the table when the music stops. And at every recession, the music is stopping.\n\nAm I bitter about some of the things that have happened to me in the past year? Yes, I\u2019m a human being. I always had big ambitions. I had dreams of running for office at some point in the next five years. In the pyramid of decision-making in New York City politics, rich people come first, unions second, and rank-and-file New Yorkers come dead last. I wanted to change that. I wanted to find a way to lower the cost of the city government and thus reduce New York\u2019s shameful tax burden. I would have decentralized the schools. My father was a public-school teacher. He always told me that although you could encourage a child to work hard, you could only go so far; that half the goal had to be achieved at home. As progressive as I\u2019ve been in my politics, there are other things I don\u2019t think of as liberal or progressive, just common sense. Of course, another thing I would have done\u2014and this will not surprise anyone\u2014is change the paparazzi law.\n\nI\u2019ve lived in New York since 1979. It was a place that they gave you your anonymity. And not just if you were famous. New Yorkers nodded at you. New Yorkers smiled at you at the Shakespeare & Co. bookshop. New Yorkers would make a terse comment to you. \u201cBig fan,\u201d they\u2019d say. \u201cLoved you in Streetcar,\u201d they\u2019d say. They signaled their appreciation of you very politely. To be a New Yorker meant you gave everybody five feet. You gave everybody their privacy. I recall how, in a big city, many people had to play out private moments in public: a woman sobbing at a pay phone (remember pay phones?), someone studying their paperwork, undisturbed, at the Oyster Bar, before catching the train. We allowed people privacy, we left them alone. And now we don\u2019t leave each other alone. Now we live in a digital arena, like some Roman Colosseum, with our thumbs up or thumbs down.\n\nMy uncle was a lifelong New Yorker. He said, \u201cNew York is the place where if you really are one in a million, there\u2019s seven other people just like you right here in town!\u201d And I used to laugh at that. He\u2019d say, \u201cNew York, millionaires and whores shoulder to shoulder on 57th Street. Some of them millionaires and whores!\u201d\n\nThere was a time the entire world didn\u2019t have a camera in their pocket\u2014the first thing that cell phones did was to kill the autograph business. Nobody cares about your autograph. There are cameras everywhere, and there are media outlets for them to \u201cfile their story.\u201d They take your picture in line for coffee. They\u2019re trying to get a picture of your baby. Everyone\u2019s got a camera. When they\u2019re done, they tweet it. It\u2019s \u2026 unnatural.\n\nI did not have a happy family life a few years ago. I was divorced and I was very alienated from my daughter and I was out there cutting every ribbon and running around New York hosting events for different causes to supplant my loss, because I didn\u2019t have a family to go home to. Now I don\u2019t want to be Mr. Show Business anymore. I want the same thing everybody else wants. I want a happy home, and for the first time in my adult life, I have one. I love my wife more than anything in the world and I love my child more than anything else in the world and I don\u2019t want that to change in any way.\n\nI probably have to move out of New York. I just can\u2019t live in New York anymore. Everything I hated about L.A. I\u2019m beginning to crave. L.A. is a place where you live behind a gate, you get in a car, your interaction with the public is minimal. I used to hate that. But New York has changed. Manhattan is like Beverly Hills. And the soul of New York has moved to Brooklyn, where everything new and exciting seems to be. I have to accept that. I want my newest child to have as normal and decent a life as I can provide. New York doesn\u2019t seem the place for that anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s good-bye to public life in the way that you try to communicate with an audience playfully like we\u2019re friends, beyond the work you are actually paid for. Letterman. Saturday Night Live. That kind of thing. I want to go make a movie and be very present for that and give it everything I have, and after we\u2019re done, then the rest of the time is mine. I started out as an actor, where you seek to understand yourself using the words of great writers and collaborating with other creative people. Then I slid into show business, where you seek only an audience\u2019s approval, whether you deserve it or not. I think I want to go back to being an actor now.\n\nThere\u2019s a way I could have done things differently. I know that. If I offended anyone along the way, I do apologize. But the solution for me now is: I\u2019ve lived this for 30 years, I\u2019m done with it.\n\nAnd, admittedly, this is how I feel in February of 2014.\n\nShia LaBeouf went to a film screening recently and he wore a bag over his head and the bag says I AM NOT FAMOUS \u00adANYMORE. And there was truly a part of me that felt sorry for him, oddly enough.4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2732110", "artist_names": "Kane Brown", "full_title":

I, I-I, I-I-I-I\n\n[Verse: Chance The Rapper]\nI speak of promised lands\nSoil as soft as mama's hands\nRunning water standing still\nEndless fields of daffodils and chamomile\nRice under black beans\nWalked into Apple with cracked screens\nAnd told prophetic stories of freedom\nFound warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold like Nat King\nI'm doing the dad thing\nI speak of wondrous, unfamiliar lessons from childhood\nMake you remember how to smile good\nI'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label, pro-famous\nI'm Broadway Joe Namath\nKanye's best prodigy\nHe ain't signed me, but he proud of me\nI got some ideas that you gotta see\nMake a vid with shorty and they ship it like the Odyssey\nThey never seen a rapper practice modesty\nI never practice, I only perform\nI don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn\nI speak to God in public\nI speak to God in public, He keep my rhymes in couplets\nHe think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans\nI used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school\nI used to pass out music, I still pass out music\nThe people's champ must be everything the people can't be\nI'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys\nYou must've missed the come-up, I must be all I can be\nCall me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]\nI made it through, made it through, made it through\nAnd everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you\nYou got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming (It's coming, coming, coming)\nSo are you ready?

Have you got nothing better to think on this good Sunday as poor old Thias Bede's to be put into the ground, and him drownded i' th' dead o' the night, as it's enough to make one's back run cold, but you must be 'dizening yourself as if there was a wedding i'stid of a funeral?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, Aunt,\" said Hetty, \"I can't be ready so soon as everybody else, when I've got Totty's things to put on. And I'd ever such work to make her stand still.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and shawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been made of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her hat was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her, except in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser was provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door, followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she trod on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyser's own hand, setting off the proportions of his leg. Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face, which was good humour itself as he said, \"Come, Hetty\u2014come, little uns!\" and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway gate into the yard.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"little uns\" addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven, in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small elephant is like a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and behind came patient Molly, whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard and over all the wet places on the road; for Totty, having speedily recovered from her threatened fever, had insisted on going to church to-day, and especially on wearing her red-and-black necklace outside her tippet. And there were many wet places for her to be carried over this afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the morning, though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery masses on the horizon.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the farmyard. The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made only crooning subdued noises; the very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would have been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual. The sunshine seemed to call all things to rest and not to labour. It was asleep itself on the moss-grown cow-shed; on the group of white ducks nestling together with their bills tucked under their wings; on the old black sow stretched languidly on the straw, while her largest young one found an excellent spring-bed on his mother's fat ribs; on Alick, the shepherd, in his new smock-frock, taking an uneasy siesta, half-sitting, half-standing on the granary steps. Alick was of opinion that church, like other luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who had the weather and the ewes on his mind. \"Church! Nay\u2014I'n gotten summat else to think on,\" was an answer which he often uttered in a tone of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel sure Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed going to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and \"Whissuntide.\" But he had a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies, like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had leisure.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's Father a-standing at the yard-gate,\" said Martin Poyser. \"I reckon he wants to watch us down the field. It's wonderful what sight he has, and him turned seventy-five.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, I often think it's wi' th' old folks as it is wi' the babbies,\" said Mrs. Poyser; \"they're satisfied wi' looking, no matter what they're looking at. It's God A'mighty's way o' quietening 'em, I reckon, afore they go to sleep.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Old Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching, and held it wide open, leaning on his stick\u2014pleased to do this bit of work; for, like all old men whose life has been spent in labour, he liked to feel that he was still useful\u2014that there was a better crop of onions in the garden because he was by at the sowing\u2014and that the cows would be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon to look on. He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays, but not very regularly at other times; on wet Sundays, or whenever he had a touch of rheumatism, he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis instead.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They'll ha' putten Thias Bede i' the ground afore ye get to the churchyard,\" he said, as his son came up. \"It 'ud ha' been better luck if they'd ha' buried him i' the forenoon when the rain was fallin'; there's no likelihoods of a drop now; an' the moon lies like a boat there, dost see? That's a sure sign o' fair weather\u2014there's a many as is false but that's sure.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aye, aye,\" said the son, \"I'm in hopes it'll hold up now.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mind what the parson says, mind what the parson says, my lads,\" said Grandfather to the black-eyed youngsters in knee-breeches, conscious of a marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling, a little, secretly, during the sermon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dood-bye, Dandad,\" said Totty. \"Me doin' to church. Me dot my neklace on. Dive me a peppermint.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grandad, shaking with laughter at this \"deep little wench,\" slowly transferred his stick to his left hand, which held the gate open, and slowly thrust his finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had fixed her eyes with a confident look of expectation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again, watching them across the lane along the Home Close, and through the far gate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge. For the hedgerows in those days shut out one's view, even on the better-managed farms; and this afternoon, the dog-roses were tossing out their pink wreaths, the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory, the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach, peeping high up out of a holly bush, and over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow across the path.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let them pass: at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of cows standing one behind the other, extremely slow to understand that their large bodies might be in the way; at the far gate there was the mare holding her head over the bars, and beside her the liver-coloured foal with its head towards its mother's flank, apparently still much embarrassed by its own straddling existence. The way lay entirely through Mr. Poyser's own fields till they reached the main road leading to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on stock and their \"keep\"\u2014an exercise which strengthens her understanding so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most other subjects.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's that shorthorned Sally,\" she said, as they entered the Home Close, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud and looking at her with a sleepy eye. \"I begin to hate the sight o' the cow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid of her the better, for there's that little yallow cow as doesn't give half the milk, and yet I've twice as much butter from her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, thee't not like the women in general,\" said Mr. Poyser; \"they like the shorthorns, as give such a lot o' milk. There's Chowne's wife wants him to buy no other sort.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's it sinnify what Chowne's wife likes? A poor soft thing, wi' no more head-piece nor a sparrow. She'd take a big cullender to strain her lard wi', and then wonder as the scratchin's run through. I've seen enough of her to know as I'll niver take a servant from her house again\u2014all hugger-mugger\u2014and you'd niver know, when you went in, whether it was Monday or Friday, the wash draggin' on to th' end o' the week; and as for her cheese, I know well enough it rose like a loaf in a tin last year. And then she talks o' the weather bein' i' fault, as there's folks 'ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i' their boots.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, Chowne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if thee lik'st,\" said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wife's superior power of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days he had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of shorthorns. \"Aye, them as choose a soft for a wife may's well buy up the shorthorns, for if you get your head stuck in a bog, your legs may's well go after it. Eh! Talk o' legs, there's legs for you,\" Mrs. Poyser continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road was dry, toddled on in front of her father and mother. \"There's shapes! An' she's got such a long foot, she'll be her father's own child.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aye, she'll be welly such a one as Hetty i' ten years' time, on'y she's got THY coloured eyes. I niver remember a blue eye i' my family; my mother had eyes as black as sloes, just like Hetty's.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The child 'ull be none the worse for having summat as isn't like Hetty. An' I'm none for having her so overpretty. Though for the matter o' that, there's people wi' light hair an' blue eyes as pretty as them wi' black. If Dinah had got a bit o' colour in her cheeks, an' didn't stick that Methodist cap on her head, enough to frighten the cows, folks 'ud think her as pretty as Hetty.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Nay, nay,\" said Mr. Poyser, with rather a contemptuous emphasis, \"thee dostna know the pints of a woman. The men 'ud niver run after Dinah as they would after Hetty.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What care I what the men 'ud run after? It's well seen what choice the most of 'em know how to make, by the poor draggle-tails o' wives you see, like bits o' gauze ribbin, good for nothing when the colour's gone.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice when I married thee,\" said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled little conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; \"and thee wast twice as buxom as Dinah ten year ago.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a house. There's Chowne's wife ugly enough to turn the milk an' save the rennet, but she'll niver save nothing any other way. But as for Dinah, poor child, she's niver likely to be buxom as long as she'll make her dinner o' cake and water, for the sake o' giving to them as want. She provoked me past bearing sometimes; and, as I told her, she went clean again' the Scriptur', for that says, 'Love your neighbour as yourself'; 'but,' I said, 'if you loved your neighbour no better nor you do yourself, Dinah, it's little enough you'd do for him. You'd be thinking he might do well enough on a half-empty stomach.' Eh, I wonder where she is this blessed Sunday! Sitting by that sick woman, I daresay, as she'd set her heart on going to all of a sudden.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, it was a pity she should take such megrims into her head, when she might ha' stayed wi' us all summer, and eaten twice as much as she wanted, and it 'ud niver ha' been missed. She made no odds in th' house at all, for she sat as still at her sewing as a bird on the nest, and was uncommon nimble at running to fetch anything. If Hetty gets married, theed'st like to ha' Dinah wi' thee constant.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's no use thinking o' that,\" said Mrs. Poyser. \"You might as well beckon to the flying swallow as ask Dinah to come an' live here comfortable, like other folks. If anything could turn her, I should ha' turned her, for I've talked to her for a hour on end, and scolded her too; for she's my own sister's child, and it behoves me to do what I can for her. But eh, poor thing, as soon as she'd said us 'good-bye' an' got into the cart, an' looked back at me with her pale face, as is welly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven, I begun to be frightened to think o' the set-downs I'd given her; for it comes over you sometimes as if she'd a way o' knowing the rights o' things more nor other folks have. But I'll niver give in as that's cause she's a Methodist, no more nor a white calf's white cause it eats out o' the same bucket wi' a black un.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Nay,\" said Mr. Poyser, with as near an approach to a snarl as his good-nature would allow; \"I'm no opinion o' the Methodists. It's on'y tradesfolks as turn Methodists; you nuver knew a farmer bitten wi' them maggots. There's maybe a workman now an' then, as isn't overclever at's work, takes to preachin' an' that, like Seth Bede. But you see Adam, as has got one o' the best head-pieces hereabout, knows better; he's a good Churchman, else I'd never encourage him for a sweetheart for Hetty.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, goodness me,\" said Mrs. Poyser, who had looked back while her husband was speaking, \"look where Molly is with them lads! They're the field's length behind us. How COULD you let 'em do so, Hetty? Anybody might as well set a pictur' to watch the children as you. Run back and tell 'em to come on.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field, so they set Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the true Loamshire stile, and awaited the loiterers Totty observing with complacency, \"Dey naughty, naughty boys\u2014me dood.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with great excitement to Marty and Tommy, who saw a perpetual drama going on in the hedgerows, and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior Tommy. Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her ready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and said \"Lawks!\" whenever she was expected to wonder.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting, \"We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!\" with the instinctive confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah,\" said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this pleasant surprise, \"that's a good lad; why, where is it?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge. I saw it first, looking after the greenfinch, and she sat on th' nest.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You didn't frighten her, I hope,\" said the mother, \"else she'll forsake it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I went away as still as still, and whispered to Molly\u2014didn't I, Molly?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, well, now come on,\" said Mrs. Poyser, \"and walk before Father and Mother, and take your little sister by the hand. We must go straight on now. Good boys don't look after the birds of a Sunday.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, Mother,\" said Marty, \"you said you'd give half-a-crown to find the speckled turkey's nest. Mayn't I have the half-crown put into my money-box?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We'll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at their eldest-born's acuteness; but on Tommy's round face there was a cloud.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mother,\" he said, half-crying, \"Marty's got ever so much more money in his box nor I've got in mine.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Munny, me want half-a-toun in my bots,\" said Totty.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hush, hush, hush,\" said Mrs. Poyser, \"did ever anybody hear such naughty children? Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if they don't make haste and go on to church.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles, alias \"bullheads,\" which the lads looked at wistfully.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no temptation would have induced him to carry on any field-work, however early in the morning, on a Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a pair of oxen \"sweltered\" while he was ploughing on Good Friday? That was a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and with wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would have nothing to do, since money got by such means would never prosper.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It a'most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines so,\" he observed, as they passed through the \"Big Meadow.\" \"But it's poor foolishness to think o' saving by going against your conscience. There's that Jim Wakefield, as they used to call 'Gentleman Wakefield,' used to do the same of a Sunday as o' weekdays, and took no heed to right or wrong, as if there was nayther God nor devil. An' what's he come to? Why, I saw him myself last market-day a-carrying a basket wi' oranges in't.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, to be sure,\" said Mrs. Poyser, emphatically, \"you make but a poor trap to catch luck if you go and bait it wi' wickedness. The money as is got so's like to burn holes i' your pocket. I'd niver wish us to leave our lads a sixpence but what was got i' the rightful way. And as for the weather, there's One above makes it, and we must put up wi't: it's nothing of a plague to what the wenches are.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the interruption in their walk, the excellent habit which Mrs. Poyser's clock had of taking time by the forelock had secured their arrival at the village while it was still a quarter to two, though almost every one who meant to go to church was already within the churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home were chiefly mothers, like Timothy's Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her baby and feeling as women feel in that position\u2014that nothing else can be expected of them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not entirely to see Thias Bede's funeral that the people were standing about the churchyard so long before service began; that was their common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at once, and the farmers' wives talked in an undertone to each other, over the tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor's stuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as far preferable\u2014about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to wages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to year, and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could see her\u2014about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer, was giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible woman, and they were all sorry for HER, for she had very good kin. Meantime the men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature entrance\u2014what could they do in church if they were there before service began?\u2014and they did not conceive that any power in the universe could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about \"bus'ness.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the farmers; for Chad was accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he meant what was, after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who had horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where the burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the farm-labourers, made a group round it, and stood with their hats off, as fellow-mourners with the mother and sons. Others held a midway position, sometimes watching the group at the grave, sometimes listening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in a knot near the church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his family passed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitude\u2014that is to say, with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business; curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands behind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk was in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased, and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine passed. Adam and Seth were coming next, with their mother between them; for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk, and was not yet ready to follow the rector into the vestry. But there was a pause before the three mourners came on: Lisbeth had turned round to look again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any day since her husband's death. Along with all her grief there was mixed an unusual sense of her own importance in having a \"burial,\" and in Mr. Irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods of their fellow-parishioners.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr. Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth; the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every one must now enter and take his place.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for anything except for the grey age of its oaken pews\u2014great square pews mostly, ranged on each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed, from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass, and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk, grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior, and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats. And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew had handsome crimson cloth cushions; and, to close the vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth, embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia's own hand.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on that simple congregation\u2014on the hardy old men, with bent knees and shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and thatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of the stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers, with their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly farm-labourers' wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow, folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held books\u2014why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a few \"good words\" by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing up\u2014the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey pews, while good Bishop Ken's evening hymn was being sung to one of those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent too\u2014all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his ample white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair thrown back, his rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and upper lip; for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul beams out. And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his family. And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances\u2014she was absorbed in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church, for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself. That must be old Mr. Donnithorne\u2014he always came first, the wrinkled small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia was passing, and though Hetty liked so much to look at her fashionable little coal-scuttle bonnet, with the wreath of small roses round it, she didn't mind it to-day. But there were no more curtsies\u2014no, he was not come; she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the house-keeper's black bonnet and the lady's maid's beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydia's, and then the powdered heads of the butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look now\u2014she might be mistaken\u2014for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the chancel\u2014there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The chill disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt herself turning pale, her lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what SHOULD she do? Everybody would know the reason; they would know she was crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful hothouse plant in his button-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was dreadfully long before the General Confession began, so that she could kneel down. Two great drops WOULD fall then, but no one saw them except good-natured Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her. Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church except faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hetty's nostrils. \"It donna smell,\" she whispered, thinking this was a great advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good without biting your nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this little flash of temper did what the salts could not have done\u2014it roused her to wipe away the traces of her tears, and try with all her might not to shed any more. Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little nature: she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at, or pointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would have pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should know a secret she did not want them to know.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn \"Absolution\" in her deaf ears, and through all the tones of petition that followed! Anger lay very close to disappointment, and soon won the victory over the conjectures her small ingenuity could devise to account for Arthur's absence on the supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her again. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because all the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even with a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches to herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain\u2014she would like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so, as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to discern odours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village nooks in the kingdom\u2014a reason of which I am sure you have not the slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses. The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the autumn boughs. This may seem a strange mode of speaking about the reading of a parish clerk\u2014a man in rusty spectacles, with stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown. But that is Nature's way: she will allow a gentleman of splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and not give him the slightest hint of it; and takes care that some narrow-browed fellow, trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house, shall be as true to his intervals as a bird.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and it was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from the desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death\u2014not in his bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant\u2014and now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure. Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang. The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thou sweep'st us off as with a flood;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We vanish hence like dreams\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings. Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days while he was living. The more there was said about her husband, the more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was poor Lisbeth's blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed tears, and tried to recall, as he had done continually since his father's death, all that he had heard of the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and reconcilement; for was it not written in the very psalm they were singing that the Divine dealings were not measured and circumscribed by time? Adam had never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had known plenty of trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this was the first sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his father's hand before their parting, and say, \"Father, you know it was all right between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!\" Adam thought but little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had been in moments of humiliation, when he had held down his head before the rebukes of his son. When our indignation is borne in submissive silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as to our own generosity, if not justice; how much more when the object of our anger has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his face for the last time in the meekness of death!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! I was always too hard,\" Adam said to himself. \"It's a sore fault in me as I'm so hot and out o' patience with people when they do wrong, and my heart gets shut up against 'em, so as I can't bring myself to forgive 'em. I see clear enough there's more pride nor love in my soul, for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th' hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him. And there went plenty o' pride and temper to the strokes, as the devil WILL be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins. Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself. It's allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still, but the real tough job for me 'ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against my own pride. It seems to me now, if I was to find Father at home to-night, I should behave different; but there's no knowing\u2014perhaps nothing 'ud be a lesson to us if it didn't come too late. It's well we should feel as life's a reckoning we can't make twice over; there's no real making amends in this world, any more nor you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was the key-note to which Adam's thoughts had perpetually returned since his father's death, and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference to Thias's funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, \"In the midst of life we are in death\"\u2014how the present moment is all we can call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family tenderness. All very old truths\u2014but what we thought the oldest truth becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure its intensity by remembering the former dimness?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime words, \"The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,\" seemed to blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the bonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon, the fathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk, their simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday every one was ready to receive a guest\u2014it was the day when all must be in their best clothes and their best humour.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they were waiting for Adam to come up, not being contented to go away without saying a kind word to the widow and her sons.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, Mrs. Bede,\" said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, \"you must keep up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when they've lived to rear their children and see one another's hair grey.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aye, aye,\" said Mr. Poyser; \"they wonna have long to wait for one another then, anyhow. And ye've got two o' the strapping'st sons i' th' country; and well you may, for I remember poor Thias as fine a broad-shouldered fellow as need to be; and as for you, Mrs. Bede, why you're straighter i' the back nor half the young women now.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Eh,\" said Lisbeth, \"it's poor luck for the platter to wear well when it's broke i' two. The sooner I'm laid under the thorn the better. I'm no good to nobody now.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adam never took notice of his mother's little unjust plaints; but Seth said, \"Nay, Mother, thee mustna say so. Thy sons 'ull never get another mother.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's true, lad, that's true,\" said Mr. Poyser; \"and it's wrong on us to give way to grief, Mrs. Bede; for it's like the children cryin' when the fathers and mothers take things from 'em. There's One above knows better nor us.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah,\" said Mrs. Poyser, \"an' it's poor work allays settin' the dead above the livin'. We shall all on us be dead some time, I reckon\u2014it 'ud be better if folks 'ud make much on us beforehand, i'stid o' beginnin' when we're gone. It's but little good you'll do a-watering the last year's crop.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, Adam,\" said Mr. Poyser, feeling that his wife's words were, as usual, rather incisive than soothing, and that it would be well to change the subject, \"you'll come and see us again now, I hope. I hanna had a talk with you this long while, and the missis here wants you to see what can be done with her best spinning-wheel, for it's got broke, and it'll be a nice job to mend it\u2014there'll want a bit o' turning. You'll come as soon as you can now, will you?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see where Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white hot-house plant, with a very long name\u2014a Scotch name, she supposed, since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression on Hetty's face as she listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond of giving information.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain limits is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble understanding\u2014it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover, Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty that the \"lass was well enough,\" and that \"a man might do worse\"; but on convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who \"knew his business\" and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in confidence to her husband, \"You're mighty fond o' Craig, but for my part, I think he's welly like a cock as thinks the sun's rose o' purpose to hear him crow.\" For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener, and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself. He had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his head forward a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets. I think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch, and not his \"bringing up\"; for except that he had a stronger burr in his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is Parisian.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, Mr. Poyser,\" he said, before the good slow farmer had time to speak, \"ye'll not be carrying your hay to-morrow, I'm thinking. The glass sticks at 'change,' and ye may rely upo' my word as we'll ha' more downfall afore twenty-four hours is past. Ye see that darkish-blue cloud there upo' the 'rizon\u2014ye know what I mean by the 'rizon, where the land and sky seems to meet?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aye, aye, I see the cloud,\" said Mr. Poyser, \"'rizon or no 'rizon. It's right o'er Mike Holdsworth's fallow, and a foul fallow it is.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you mark my words, as that cloud 'ull spread o'er the sky pretty nigh as quick as you'd spread a tarpaulin over one o' your hay-ricks. It's a great thing to ha' studied the look o' the clouds. Lord bless you! Th' met'orological almanecks can learn me nothing, but there's a pretty sight o' things I could let THEM up to, if they'd just come to me. And how are you, Mrs. Poyser?\u2014thinking o' getherin' the red currants soon, I reckon. You'd a deal better gether 'em afore they're o'erripe, wi' such weather as we've got to look forward to. How do ye do, Mistress Bede?\" Mr. Craig continued, without a pause, nodding by the way to Adam and Seth. \"I hope y' enjoyed them spinach and gooseberries as I sent Chester with th' other day. If ye want vegetables while ye're in trouble, ye know where to come to. It's well known I'm not giving other folks' things away, for when I've supplied the house, the garden s my own spekilation, and it isna every man th' old squire could get as 'ud be equil to the undertaking, let alone asking whether he'd be willing I've got to run my calkilation fine, I can tell you, to make sure o' getting back the money as I pay the squire. I should like to see some o' them fellows as make the almanecks looking as far before their noses as I've got to do every year as comes.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They look pretty fur, though,\" said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on one side and speaking in rather a subdued reverential tone. \"Why, what could come truer nor that pictur o' the cock wi' the big spurs, as has got its head knocked down wi' th' anchor, an' th' firin', an' the ships behind? Why, that pictur was made afore Christmas, and yit it's come as true as th' Bible. Why, th' cock's France, an' th' anchor's Nelson\u2014an' they told us that beforehand.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Pee\u2014ee-eh!\" said Mr. Craig. \"A man doesna want to see fur to know as th' English 'ull beat the French. Why, I know upo' good authority as it's a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high, an' they live upo' spoon-meat mostly. I knew a man as his father had a particular knowledge o' the French. I should like to know what them grasshoppers are to do against such fine fellows as our young Captain Arthur. Why, it 'ud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him; his arm's thicker nor a Frenchman's body, I'll be bound, for they pinch theirsells in wi' stays; and it's easy enough, for they've got nothing i' their insides.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Where IS the captain, as he wasna at church to-day?\" said Adam. \"I was talking to him o' Friday, and he said nothing about his going away.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, he's only gone to Eagledale for a bit o' fishing; I reckon he'll be back again afore many days are o'er, for he's to be at all th' arranging and preparing o' things for the comin' o' age o' the 30th o' July. But he's fond o' getting away for a bit, now and then. Him and th' old squire fit one another like frost and flowers.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation, but the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say \"good-bye.\" The gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if he had not accepted Mr. Poyser's invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and dislikes must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr. Craig had always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall Farm, and Mrs. Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had \"nothing to say again' him, on'y it was a pity he couldna be hatched o'er again, an' hatched different.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound their way down to the valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory had taken the place of a long, long anxiety\u2014where Adam would never have to ask again as he entered, \"Where's Father?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went back to the pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farm\u2014all with quiet minds, except Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone, but was only the more puzzled and uneasy. For it appeared that his absence was quite voluntary; he need not have gone\u2014he would not have gone if he had wanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be pleasant to her again if her Thursday night's vision was not to be fulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and doubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again, of meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with that eager yearning which one may call the \"growing pain\" of passion.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/2469899", "artist_names": "Blake Shelton (Ft.

no, no\nNo, no, no, no\nQuestion is, will I ever leave you?\nThe answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no\nNo, no-no-no, no, no\nNo, no, no, no\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure\nAnd my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham\nA lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section\nOVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up\nAnd I know who gon' take the fall with me\nThey right here on call with me, they all with me\nYou could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted\nThey've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?\nToast to the days when they wasn't out to get me\nI worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me\nCeesay\u2019s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday\nKiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray\nI dropped out right before I graduate\nSix credits left, my mama had her saddest day\n\u201cIt's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait\u201d\nAnd she took my word for it, that's all I had to say\nLately I just feel so out of character\nThe paranoia can start to turn into arrogance\nThoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist\nI get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison\nI'm gettin' straight to the point with it\nNeed y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas\nFuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition\nIt's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business\nBut I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute\n[Verse 2]\nLook, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals\nMy niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below\nWho you think runnin' this show?\nYou saw it in me at 20 years old\nThe lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code\nI got a pure soul, I don't do the hate\nYou don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made\nMe and Niko used to plot on how to make a change\nNow me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game\nStill drop 40 with liquor in my system\nNumbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance\nI might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya\nNiggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian\nLamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale\nAnd I never bend my morals for the ticket sales\nTippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL\nI never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself\nRunnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts\nI'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts\nThey think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon\nI still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room\nPayment plan for the family debt, we in the minus\nAnd like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us\nWhere you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever\nI'm a staple in the game, all my papers together\nAnd my life is on display like Truman\nThey wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner\nMy exes made some of my favorite music\nI dated women from my favorite movies\nKarma's such a thing of beauty\nI'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it\nIt's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters\nI keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever\nI might take a breather but I won't ever leave you\nIf I was you, I wouldn't like me either\nYeahSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like39Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/2461261", "artist_names": "Beyonc\u00e9 (Ft.

you\n[Verse 2]\nI won't, I won't, I won't\nCover the scars, I'll let 'em bleed\nSo my silence, so my silence\nWon't be mistaken for peace\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAm I wrong for wanting us to make it?\nTell me your lies because I just can't face it\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's you, it's you, it's you\nIt's you, it's you, it's you\n\n[Bridge]\nCould it be that it's a lesson that I never had to learn?\nI looked at it like a blessing and now it's just a curse\nI don't know why, I don't know why\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's you, it's you\nIt's you, it's you, it's youYou might also like56Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

BARE WITH IT WITH ME, WE BOTH MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING.\n\nAlright, so there's 3 ways to listen to this album. You can\neither...\n-pair it up with the story below.\n-pair it up with the concepts below.\n-say \"Nigga fuck you mean? It's just a beat tape.\" and just listen to it casually like a normal person.\nAlso, I understand the feeling of sitting there listening to\nthe same damn pattern for 10 minutes straight, so that's\nwhy I made sure every beat has a variation so it doesn't\nget repetitive. Plus, a few have beat changes, so watch\nout for those.\n*Excuse any future typos\n\nStory\nNights (Intro) starts playing, you're in a dark room with blue\nand white streaks zooming around you and all you see is a purple entity\nwith the voice of an old white guy talking towards your\ndirection. You can make out some of the shit he's saying,\nbut it seems as if every time you start tuning in to\nwhat it's saying, the music in the background gets louder\nand throws you off, almost intentionally. Now you're struggling\nto decide whether or not you want to listen to the entity or\nthe music. The music makes it clear that it wants you listen to it as ifthe music had a mind of it's own.\nIt's almost impossible to listen to the entity now unless you really focused, because the music is so absurd.\nAnd then you finally realize... Ya Not Even In This Fuckin' Story. *blacks*\n\nA DUDE WAKES UP and immediately starts getting ready for the day as if he's\njust sure what's to come today. He gets dressed, in what we would think if we\nseen him physically, his best clothes, brushes his teeth with Crest toothpaste,\ncombs his hair using MAD Mane N' Tale Detangler product, puts on Dove lotion,\ngrabs his keys, and heads the f*ck out the house. *scenes*\nThere's a Dodge Charger parked outside a Winchell's across the street from a Rally's\n(burger joint) and a McDonald's. The dude walks out with a baker's dozen of donuts and a Nestle's Chocolate Milk.\nHe always gets a baker's dozen of donuts and a Nestle's Chocolate Milk on Saturday mornings.\nAs he's heading towards the Charger, he looks up as a plane flys overhead. You can hear\na couple walking by murmur how low it looked/sounded when it flew by. He looks back at his car\nwith a confused then relieved look on his face. He shakes off this moment then gets in his car\nto start heading towards Corbin & Jenny's pad (his friend's/girlfriend's house). *scenes*\n\nTHE DUDE PULLS UP in front of their house. Then he heads toward the door... Donut$ and chocolate milk in hand...\nkey lanyard hanging out in left pocket. He's greeted at the door with hugs, handshakes, and loud cartoon\nvibrations coming from the Samsung flatscreen TV in the living the room next to them.\nHim, Corbin & Jenny laugh and talk for what seems like hours as they wait for Lonny (they're friend; I'll let you\ndecide the race/gender) to show up. Corbin gets a text from Lonny saying to open the door.\nAs Corbin opens the door, Jenny (while holding the dude's hand) follows him out the door eagerly and they don't\nbreak stride walking towards the dude's car. Corbin hands Lonny a donut as they head towards the dude's car.\nThey all get in the car (The dude: driver seat; Jenny: passenger; Corbin: backseat behind the dude;\nLonny: backseat behind Jenny) and Corbin asks for the aux cord. He was ready to play some heat... and his\nmixtape. *scenes*\n\n*Montage Time*\nThe sun goes down as graduates start straddlin'\nThe line between the real world and the one's they called mannequins\nBag handles slip out of man-i-cured's hand damages\nMcDonalds should start askin \"pape\" or \"plastic\" and...\nAs they reminisce in front of the baristas\nI come back from the bathroom, ready to take pictures\nThey pile up and *click* \"yup... that instant Insta-grati\"\nNotifications pourin' in and Up like Downey Back stage @ the Grammy's\nRights to Patty for Le Bell thats rattling fastly in my mental,\nGrasping breasteses and tit for tatting with a simple\nTemple tasking... Where are the priorities? \"They're hiding at this party up in Hollywood.\"\nThe sorcery. I don't know about you guys, but it's 8:26 and I don't want this Night to be over with. It might lead to demise or extreme fun\nI Don't Give A Shit.\n\nBut Then You & I Finally Realize, I'm Not Even In This Fuckin' Story. *blacks*\n\n\n\nThe dude and all his friends are driving on a nicely lit bridge/freeway, heading to a mansion party.\nIt's a full Moon out that Night.\nJenny is staring out the window at the lights and up at the stars, having one of those indie short film moments\nand sh*t. Corbin is on Instagram blowing up a female named Kaitlyn's profile with mad likes. She the type\nof female to find this HIGHLY attractive. Would maybe even screenshot it and call it a \"relationship goal\".\nLonny is eating a bag of Takis with a Raspberry Brisk on standby in the cupholder. The dude is 2 and 10, singing along (Barely) to the\nsong playing (Mick Jenkins- Comfortable) with a half-empty/half-filled Strawberry-Kiwi Arizona on standby in the cupholder.\nEven though the dude is singing along to the song out loud, it seems as if the music isn't even on. It seems real silent.\nAs If Everyone's In Their Own Little World. As the song fades out, the dude notices the silence and attempts to liven up the car.\nOne thing leads to another and they all end up in a roast battle. The dude ends up calling Jenny a fake ass Lisa Left Eye Lopez\n(It wasn't that they were mad or not feeling the party idea or anything at first, they just finally calmed down and took a breather\nsince their Day out. No matter how old you get, or wherever you are, you always need a moment to yourself to breath and think.\n*Chance The Rapper's Voice* I drink water and photosynthesize). *scenes*\n\nTHE DUDE and his friends pull up to a In-N-Out drive thru so they won't have to eat/drink anything at the party and run the risk of\ngetting drugged. The party is not too far away at this point. The dude orders a Double-Double with fries, Jenny gets the same without\nthe fries, Corbin gets a milkshake, and Lonny gets a 4x4 meal. As they wait for their food in the parking lot, they use that time\nprep their selves for the party. Them and a lady still sitting in the drive thru are the only ones there, so the dude turns the volume\nof the music up loud, grabs Jenny's hand and sits on the hood of the car with her as they have a side conversation. Lonny and\nCorbin sing along and trade between parts of the song the dude turned up (Schama Noel- Suitcase). After that goes off, an instrumental\ncomes on (Sellin' Sherbert). Corbin hears the first milisecond of it & loses it. He runs up to the dude & starts freestyling/dancing at him.\nJenny and Lonny laugh hysterically at it. The dude replies with his own freestyle/dance but kills him off when he says\n\"he a vegetarian but wanna bring the beef, you show yo' kids this nigga's face so that they start to brush they teeth\". They all go wild.\nCorbin and the dude shake hands and they all start dancing to the rest of the beat. After a minute or two, the dude and Jenny look\nat each other simultaneously and hug up. They kiss. *Imagine all that (starting from the dancing part) in slow motion/scenes*\n\n*Criminal Intent (Interlude) Starts Playing/A Biker Gang Rides Down A Familiar Freeway Conversing Casually*\nShane (The Leader): I want grub and b*tches. *In The Raspiest Voice*\nNolan: Hmm. I also could go for a good triple B.\nPip: What the f*ck is a triple B?\nNolan: Burger, B*tch and Beverage bruh!?! *They all laugh*\nPip: Do ya' want fries with that? *They all laugh again*\nShane: Come on, there's an In-N-Out right down this next exit. I'm sure they have EVERYTHING we want.\n\n*That from behind shot shows, like in car movies when they're moving fast and- fuck it, Nevermind*\n\nThe bikers pull up to the In-N-Out parking lot. The dude and his friends are all eating their food in the same positions\nthey were before the rap battle incident (With the exception of Lonny in the car eating ... food).\nThe dude and his friends being caught up in their activities don't notice the looks being given to them by the bikers.\nPredominantly in Jenny's direction. Shane and the bikers make their orders to the mobile waitress (you know, the bitch/nigga\nthat takes your order in line when there's a good amount of people in line at the drive thru) for what seems like 2 seconds\nthen head in the dude and Jenny's direction. At the same time, Corbin tells Jenny and the dude that he's getting messages left and\nright from people excited to see them show up to the party. Shane interrupts him as he saying that last part and says \"F*ck a party,\nI want the b*tch on my bike in 5.\" He turns around and starts heading to his bike as Pip and Nolan replace where he just was with\nballed up fist poses and sinister smirks on their faces. These niggas thought that they were in the f*cking Ginyu Force.\nThe dude, not having it, stands up and clutches Jenny closer with Corbin and Lonny postioning their selves beside them. Shane returns 5 minutes\nlater with 0 hesistation in his eyes to turn up. This is the part when Krystal Alley(oops) starts playing and all hell breaks loose after a stare-off.\nThe dude is fighting Shane one on one, Corbin is fighting Pip, Jenny is panicking and debating whether or not to help or call the cops, and Lonny and Nolan are no where to be found. That quick.\nThe dude and Shane are a equal match-up and aren't letting up, Pip thought he had Corbin but Jenny comes in and \"helps a brotha' out\" by hitting Pip\nwith the car, and Lonny and Nolan is still nowhere to be found. Shane realizes they're starting to lose so he pulls out a gat & shoots 4 shots in the air and says\n\"I'VE. HAD. ENOUGH... I. AM. A MAN... GIVE ME THE B*TCH NOW BEFORE I PUT A ROUND IN YO PUNK *SS.\" An In-N-Out waitress from behind says\n\"Soooo, did you want tomatooo oorrr?\" Shane sighs and turns around and replies \"Yes Francine. I would like tomato.\" Francine replies\n\"Okay, Super! Your total'll be $8.67\" Shane says \"Ooooh, I only got 8, *turns around to the dude* Do you have .67 cent?\" The dude reaches in his pocket\nand walks over and hands em .75 cent. Shane says \"Thanks fam, you a real one, i'll be right back.\" then runs over to the waitress and says\n\"Sorry, I was sort of in a hurry the first time we came over!\" Francine replies \"Oh it's okay, that happens a lot here hahaha *Shane laughs with her*\nbut *With the most serious face* don't let that shit happen again nigga... you're order number 114.\" Shane nervously replies \"O- Okay\" and runs back to\nthe same position he was before Francine interrupted. Shane says \"Where were we? uhh... oh yeah, GIVE ME THE B*TCH, NOW!\" The dude looks at Corbin\non his left. Corbin nods. Jenny honks the horn loud as sh*t (scaring Shane) as the dude takes off to his right towards the dumpsters. Corbin rushes Shane\nand has one of those fight scene moments where they fight for the gun and the bad guy drops it. Lonny comes around the corner with Nolan on ...\ntail. Jenny gets out the car, scoops up the gun, looks around, and then starts running towards Lonny (running a damn 4.2 40 right now). Corbin & Shane are rolling\naround all on the floor trading blows in between positions (like me and yo' bitch). Jenny gets at a close distance, tells Lonny to hit the deck and then\nshoots Nolan in the shoulder. Everyone stops when they hear the gunshot. Shane pushes Corbin off him and runs to his aid (Which is weird because\nPip is still on the floor recuperating from the car hit he just took and Shane didn't even flinch in his direction). At this point you could hear the cops coming.\nThe dude comes running back and tells everyone to get in the car. They all hop in and flea the scene. Shane puts Nolan on his shoulder and tells Pip \"Wake\nyo' hurt *ss up, we gotta get out of here!\" Then Francine walks up behind him and says \"Here's you're Animal Syle 4x Fo-\" \"B*TCH, DOES IT LOOK LIKE I NEED A BURGER\nRIGHT NOW!?!... Cause I hope I do, a nigga hungry. Pip quit b*tchin' about your broken rib cage and grab my food, the cops are co-... *That siren\nsound you hear when cops pull up/their faces start flashing red and blue* ming...\n\nFrancine: I'm Sorry, But Did You Want Fries With That Sir? *scenes*\n\n\n[VALERO GAS STATION' GREEN AND WHITE SIGN LIT UP BRIGHT]\n\nCORBIN IS PUMPING gas while Lonny is leaning on the car drinking a V8 Fusion Juice. Bishop Nehru- You Stressin' is playing loud (it's fading out while\nTyler The Creator- Rusty is next in the queue) from the aux. Jenny and the dude are in front of the gas station store door talking about what just happened at In-N-Out.\nShe's real worked up, but the dude manages to calm her down quickly. He asks if she wants anything out of the store before they go. Jenny looks at the car, Lonny, and Corbin;\nthen inside the glass window of the store (she notices there's barely anyone in it) then looks back at the dude and nods her head yes with an intimate look in her eyes.\nHe opens the door for her while she walks in (and looks at the booty) and follows her to the drink aisle. The dude observes Jenny looking for her drink (again. Eyes locked on the booty)\nand realizes she keeps inching to the right... towards the bathroom. At this point she's a step a way from the bathroom and kneeling \"looking for the gatorades\", but that swiftly\nturns into a stealth walk with the dude's hand in her hand. You would think at this point the cashier would get suspicious of thievery happening in his store, but somehow it just\nworked in their favor this time. Like God was like \"Go head lil niggas\". They sneak into the bathroom and fuck and suck and such for what seems like an hour... okay it was an hour.\n(The fact that no one came in looking for them is a miracle). They come out the bathroom looking like brand new people and readjust their clothing. Jenny grabs a Blue\nGatorade (no one ever knows the names) and Hostess donuts, heads up to the counter and lets the dude buy it, and they walk out the store. Lonny and Corbin are already walking towards\nthe store (probably to see where the fuck they were) and Lonny asks what took them so long. Jenny blurts out that she went to get donuts. Corbin repeats what she just said\nand puts emphasis on Do-Nuts making it sound like doz' nutz. They all laugh and walk back to the car, knowing damn well what just happened. Mac Miller- Thumbalina is playing from the\naux while they get in the car. *scenes*\n\n\n*RICKY'S PROJECT X TURN UP 20TH BD@Y MANSION PARTY INFO \uf44f\uf608\uf389\uf38a\uf388*\nWHEN \uf4c5: May 23, 2015\n\nTIME: 9:00pm \uf559\n\nWHERE: 1232 SUNSET PLAZA DRIVE, LOS ANGELES, CA 90069 \uf440\n\nBYOB...

The dude whips it in reverse and parks it, and they all get\nout and start getting into the groove of what's been going on (since they arrived fashionably late). This party is intense. It might as well be a concert\nthe way they have the stage set up with a live band and DJ. They have Reggie Watts, Fun., DJ CR$CNT CVT (Ricky's friend), and G-Eazy (Ricky's cousin\napparently) as a special guest. There's at least 4-7 jumpers all over the damn place (2 deflated). A pool full of half/fully naked females/dudes, annndd\njust about every drug and drink you can think of. (This is the part like on Project X where it shows all the shit that's going on in and outside of the house\nand how much fun everyone is having). The amount of Instagram/Snapchat/Facebook/Twitter/Vine posts is ridiculous at this point. The dude and Jenny manage to still\nhave a great time without all the drugs and alcohol. It's an even bigger plus that they trust each other enough to separate a little during the party and not be afraid\none of em' is going to do something they'd regret. Corbin is all over the place with a blunt on his lips, a cup of PURPLE DRANK, and pussy on his mind for the Night.\nHe's been in a substantial amount of Instagram/Snapchat/Facebook/Twitter/Vine posts tonight. Lonny is upstairs in the kitchen getting cheered on in a game of beer pong\n(aka defending ... title). Jenny and the dude meet up again upstairs and explore what's going on inside the house. Suddenly, Jenny grabs the dudes hand and runs\noutside on to a balcony. They soak in the beautiful view of the LA city lights that everyone's been neglecting. Even Ricky his self has neglected it and he lives\nthere. Typical rich person). An hour and 45 minutes have went by (Fun. is on stage now performing We Are Young with Reggie Watts as the drums) since the dude\narrived but it still feels early into the party. Everything at this point is going great. Barely any fight incidents, no drinks thrown at b*tches faces...\nGuess you could say tonight is a good Night... *blacks*\n\nEERR, THIS AIN'T NO ICE CUBE SONG, OF COURSE SOME SH*T BOUT TO POP OFF BRUH\n\nShane: GET THE F*CK OUT THE CAR BITCH *Waving a pistol into a car window*\nPip: *Throws a husband and wife out the car on to the street*\n*They both get in slamming the doors hard as shit and zoom off*\n\n(Oh you didn't think they were going to jail did you? Oh no, they're white.\nThey got a pat on the wrist and a \"Don't let me catch you boys again, alright?\")\n\nShane: That stupid *ss b*tch! I'm gonna murder her and all those little f*ckin'\npieces of sh*t!!\nPip: It looked like the bullet hit Nolan in the shoulder, not his heart!\nShane: Even if it did hit his shoulder, we all three would've came back and\nmade sure these b*tch *ss niggas got what they deserved!\nPip: You god damn right!!\nShane: I WILL AVENGE MY BROTHER, IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO!\nPip: Let's Murk(y) these niggas!...

(Hella turnt up bruh!?) {Yeah we, outchea'}\n\nOne of the 3 guys (He's wearing a bucket hat): Yeah, we just came from\nthis massive *ss mansion party, we came to stock up on some more brewskies\nfor the after party at my house later on!\n\nAnother on of the 3 (He has a button up on): Yo.

Looks like somebody else is dying tonight!\nPip: But how do we know THIS is the right party? It's a Saturday during graduation season,\nthis could be anybody's.\nShane: Nah Pip. I just have a gut feeling this is it. I can smell the fear in that b*tch\nthat hasn't even settled yet in her from here. And I can hear her little boyfriend shaking\nin fear of his knowing that this isn't over.\nPip: ...Riigghhttt... *The 3 guys come out the store*\nThe button up guy: Y'all ready to roll!?\nShane: Hell yeah, show me where da' b*tches at! *They all laugh and get in their cars*\n*scenes*\n\nBACK AT THE PARTY, Reggie Watts is mid-stage with a mic in his hand. He asks who wants to come up and rap battle someone else in the crowd.\nJenny and the dude (front row) bicker for a minute then Jenny pushes the dude onstage and cheers him on to go. The dude and Reggie shake hands\nand talk for a minute about fist fighting his girlfriend and his level of nervousness at the moment. Then Reggie calls for one more person to\ngo against the dude. G-Eazy goes stage right and picks out a dude wearing a green and red flannel wrapped around his waist with a leather\nstrapback hat on named Kevin. G-Eazy and Reggie tells everyone to give them a round of applause for having the courage to come up onstage.\nG-Eazy tells them he needs bars \"and not the ones in your pocket you were about to take before you got up here\" and Reggie signals CR$CNT and\nFun. to follow his lead. Reggie acts like he's about to sing his song \"Social Construct\" but him and CR$CNT turntable scratch it off and Reggie\nstarts beatboxing a drum pattern. Then the bass player from Fun. adds a melodic bass over Reggies's pattern (Everyone ends up helpin' with\nthe beat as it goes along; You hear CR$CNT do turntable scratches, the piano player from Fun. match the bass' melody, and the drum player from\nFun. do hi-hats on one part; under the instruction of G-Eazy telling them what should be added). Kevin goes first and has a fairly decent verse\n(minus all of the lines about hoes and money and cars). The dude listens to his verse and the reaction he got from the crowd and does some quick\nsubject matter analyzations. Then he looks at Jenny and sees her nod her head at him and begins to let loose on Kevin.\n\n\"Shout out to Mr. Bennett, it's the menace with the dentist problems\nGobblin' up the spinach, with the chicken, then I'm flippin', so professional with it\nImpeccable when I finish, I make the beat my fuckin' slave, call that vegetable whippin'\nA miracle in the makin', holy as swiss on a pagan\nI'll steal the Banks and give it to the poor, leave Tyra for Satan\nAnd to you niggas complainin' bout' how this nigga cant slay em I'll grab the Halo and toss it\nJust like I'm Gotenks verse villain.

At the same time, in the crowd,\ntwo guys in the back were about to square off with their squads, so this easliy turns into a big ass Brawl. Jenny runs up on\non the fight between the dude and Kevin and the dude (at this point, there on the ground wrestling; yes still on the stage)\ntells her to get somewhere safe. Jenny runs off and avoids the skirmish to get to the balcony her and the dude were on.\n\nShe left right on time. *scenes*\n\n*That simultaneous split camera look where it shows both people*\nThe bucket hat guy: Ahh sh*t, looks like we came back to late!\nShane: Looks like we came right on time. *Him and Pip park right next to two dudes fighting*\nPip: *They get out the car* THERE GOES THE CHARGER THAT ONE NIGGA WAS DRIVING!!\nShane: HAHAAA, I TOLD YOU THEY WERE HERE!!\nPip: Now where are these b*tches at!?! *They scan the situation*\nShane: LOOK!

Wait a second... *Squints eyes*\nPip: Whatcha' seein'?\nShane: THAT'S THE B*TCH'S BOYFRIEND! ON THE STAGE FIGHTING!\nPip: LET'S GO THEN! *They rush through the Brawl*\n\nTHE DUDE AND CORBIN throws Kevin off the stage to finish him and the rest of his squad off. Then they turn around and notice Fun.,\nReggie, & CR$CNT grabbing their instruments & hiding them, & themselves, behind the stage. Then they hear a helicopter thinking it's\npolice already showing up, but instead, it's G-Eazy's helicopter coming to get him the f*ck out of there, so now the place just\nlooks wild. A ladder drops down from the helicopter and as G is about to climb up he tells the dude that he had fun and that\nhe won that rap battle and the fight. Also that he's party'd with Ricky before, so he had that helicopter on standby out of\npreparation. Then he climbs up the ladder and flys off. As the dude watched this happen he gets pounced on from behind by a\nlivid Kevin. Corbin helps get him off the dude, but as soon as they get up, they swiftly lock up with each other again.\nAs the dude is wrestling with Kevin he tells Corbin to go find Jenny so they can get the hell out of there. Just as Corbin\nleaves, the dude looks to the left and sees no other than Shane and Pip. He has a quick moment of despair on his face then\ntosses Kevin out his way and takes off to the right. Shane and Pip trail him. The dude hops off the stage and runs through\nall the commotion happening. He catches a glimpse of Lonny also running away from the stage through the commotion but loses\nsight of .... He's dodged at least 1000 people at this point, tripping and looking back. He finally gets to an opening near\nthe downstairs area of the house. He takes off towards the inside of the house once he realizes this opportunity, but then\nhe goes deaf out of nowhere. This distracted him from the fact that his movement has slowed. He feels loose. Looser\nthan he ever has before. Then one sound breaks through his deaf ears. One he's normally hears through speakers, usually while\nwatching his Sunday Netflix films. Now he's heard this type of sound several times today... but this one sounds more sinister\nthan before. Mostly because now the sound is directed at him. *slow motion* A pistol erects from the crowd of people with a black\nleather glove behind it, then a body in biker attire, then a face... with evil intention written all over it. Shane has shot the\ndude square in the back. The dude falls to the ground rolling forward. His eyes rolling to back of his and his eye lids\nclosing immediately after. The smoke from Shane's pistol still rises as he holds pose for a moment as if he wanted\neveryone to know he's the culprit of the event that just occurred. The whole commotion behind him stops as everyone analyzes\nwhat just happened. The crowd of people towards the middle and back didn't take part in this analyzation as they wasted 0\ntime to get the f*ck out of there (Guess we know where the black people were at now). Pip finally gets adjacent to Shane as\nhe finally puts the pistol back in his holster.\n\nShane: *Without looking at him* You know what Pip? *Pip looks at him* ...I think this kill\nwas better. This is gonna hurt this b*tch mentally and physically.. haha *Looks at Pip* and\nthat's how Nolan would've wanted it. Let's get the hell out of here. *He turns and walks away/\nPip looks at the dude on the floor then follows Shane*\n\nBefore they could turn around, the crowd nearest to them already started scattering like roaches. The two kind of just\ndisappear into the crowd as even more commotion brewed to get out the vicinity. Next thing you hear is a scream that stands\nout from all the other screams and sounds going at the moment. It's Jenny running up to the dude on the floor with Corbin\nright behind her as if she broke from a grip he had on her right before she ran. Lonny runs up to the 3 simultaneously with\na large scar on ... face. Jenny sits down and holds the dude in her arms as she sobs and gets blood all over her in the process.\nCorbin and Lonny stand over them and watch while fighting off their tears. The police and paramedics finally arrive. It's\nweird because no one heard them coming. A paramedic runs up and checks the dude for a pulse then prys the dude's body from\nJenny's arms. Another paramedic comes and they put the dude on a stretcher with a breathing apparatus over his mouth.\nCorbin holds Jenny back as they wheel him into the ambulance. You could see one of the paramedics walk up and tell Jenny\nsomething to calm her down. The effort was futile in this situation. There's hasn't been any sound since the paramedics\nshowed up. Everything has been moving, but there has been 0 sound. *That camera angle where it shows the whole city/\nthe camera pans up and shows the Moon/fades out on the Moon/scenes*\n\n*X.X/O.O Starts playing/The camera moves left from darkness to view of a hospital bed with surgeons all around it*\nOne of the surgeons pulls his mask down with bloody finger tips on his gloves. He has an uncertain look on his face.\nAnother surgeon walks away from the table with his hands up in front of his face. Another is stitching up an open\nwound on the dude. His heart rate monitor shows his heart is beating (*Legally Blind Girl Voice* Barely.)\nJenny, Corbin, & Lonny are in the Emergency Waiting Room sitting next to each other. Corbin has his head back with\nhis eyes closed. He's not asleep, he just has them closed. Lonny is sitting upright with ... down.\nJenny is laying her head on Corbin with her eyes deadlocked to the floor. Jenny's never been one to hide her\ncurrent emotion or feeling. Her face is an open book. Right now she's not just sad, or angry, or any of that.\nShe's afraid. Not just of losing the dude, but afraid of the future. When she was with the dude, she was fearless\nof everything, especially the future. She's afraid because she knows she'd never meet anyone else like him.\nShe's afraid because she would've never thought something like this can happen to someone like the dude.\nThe fact she was just with em' hours ago and now he might be gone made her realize she could die at any moment.\nI think that was the vibe of everyone in the waiting room at the moment. Everyone started valuing life after one\nmight of been lost. I feel like that's too late And right on time. A doctor walks out with a clipboard and looks at\nthe 3 of them. They all jump up, Jenny being the first to him, and listen for what the doctor's about to say.\nHe tells them that the dude has lost a lot of blood but no vital organs had been hit. Jenny asks him will he be\nokay and the doctor tells her that his heart rate is moving slow so there's really no telling at this point.\nHe adds that they've stitched him up and got the bullet out, but it's up to his body now to keep\npushing. Corbin asks if they can see him and the doctor nods and turns around. They all look at each\nother then follow him. As they're walking up, they hear a panic going on in the room. A loud noise\nis resonating through the hallway. The doctor runs into the room to see what's going on and it turns\nout the loud noise is the dude's heart rate monitor. He's flatlining. Jenny speeds up and realizes\nwhat's going on and sprints into the surgery room crying. The doctor tries to get Jenny out the\nroom. Corbin & Lonny come from behind simultaneously and try to grab her. Jenny keeps yelling\nat the surgeons to help him as she fights off all three people. Then yells at the dude to fight\noff whatever's happening.\n\nThen she gives out one of the most distressed & heartfelt screams anyone's ever heard from her...\n\n\"no, No, NO!! JIMMY, I SAID WAKE UP!!!!\"\n\n(But Then We All Finally Realize, I Am In This Fuckin' Story)\n\nEveryone stops. Not just the people in the room. But everyone in the hospital that\nheard her. It's silent for what seems like eternity. Then a sound breaks the\nsilence. It's the heart beat monitor. First it's just one beat. Then it\npicks up more and more. Nobody has said a word yet. Everybody's eyes are just\nlocked on to the monitor. Jimmy's beats become greater and greater\nby the second. Then he opens his eyes. The first thing he sees is\nJenny's curly *ss hair in his face, because she has her head on\nhis chest crying. She says \"Don't scare me like that again,\nI thought I lost you!\" He struggles to move his arm but manages\nto get it around her and says \"Alright... but ya' cryin'\nmore than Drake at an onion factory and he just got a text\nsaying 'It's over', get it together baby girl.\" She laughs\nand says \"Okay.\" He looks around the room and sees everyone\njust staring at them with smiles on their faces. He looks\nat Corbin and says \"What happened to the two niggas?\"\nJust as Corbin was about to reply, one of the doctors\nsay \"The two men responsible for this were found and\n& arrested a little after you left in the ambulance.\nThey were found at the after party with underage females.\nThey have video evidence from several people there at\nmansion party on every popular social network, including\nWorldStarHipHop. All is safe.\" Jimmy replies \"Good,\ncuz' you know, EYYEE was about TO PUT, THEE PAWS\non THEM! *They all laugh* I DON'T KNOW WHY Y'ALL\nLAUGHIN' I'M DEAD ASS!\" Jenny leans over and says\n\"Shut up *kisses him* I love you.\" Jimmy replies\n\"I love you too youngin'.\" Then Lonny says\n\"Aww, y'all so cuuttee.\" Then Jimmy says\n\"Huh? What? I DON'T SPEAK BROKE NIGGA, TALK\nREGULAR!\" *They all laugh* One of the doctors\nsays \"Alright, you guys head back to the\nwaiting room, this one right here has some\nhealing to do.\" Corbin, Lonny, and Jenny\nall say see you later and walk out with an\nupbeat mood now. You can see Jenny through the\nwindow jumping all over the place on the way\nback. Some of the doctors take their gloves\noff, sanitize themself, and walk out\nshaking each other hands commending each\nother. The last doctor writes 12:34 on his\nclipboard and checks Jimmy's IV as he's\nabout to say something. The doctor says\n\"You're a really lucky guy, ya' know that?\nManaged to survive a gunshot wound.\nDidn't become paralyzed from it. Having\nclose friends who actually care about you...\nYou have it made.\" Jimmy chuckles and\nsays \"Well, I always for sure knew I\nwasn't normal. Luck had nothing to do with\nit really. Luck implies coincidences,\nand I don't believe in those.\nThere's a reason I met those guys.\nThere's also a reason why I ended\nup here almost dead.

private\nI\u2019ll take the steak, the strip, and the salad\nCause growing up in Memphis, Tennessee I couldn\u2019t have it\nNow come correct\n\n[Chorus]\nLean and dab, lean and dab\nLean and dab, lean and dab\nLean and dab, lean and dab\nLean and dab, lean and dab\n(I said I'll show you how I)\nLean and dab, lean and dab\nLean and dab, lean and dab\nLean and dab, lean and dab\nLean and dab, lean and dab\n[Outro]\nHit the Quan on em, hit the Quan on em\nHit the Quan on em, hit the Quan on em\nSnap em up, pose, snap em up, pose\nSnap em up, pose, snap em up, pose\nChop-a-chop chopped salad, chop-a-chop chop\nChop-a-chop chopped salad, chop-a-chop chop\nYou can google me, you can google me\nYou can google me, you can google me13Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12,

needed proof\nYou saw her bathing on the roof\nHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya\nShe tied you to her kitchen chair\nAnd she broke your throne and she cut your hair\nAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\n\n[Chorus]\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\nHallelujah\n\n[Verse 3]\nBut baby I've been here before\nI've seen this room and I've walked this floor\nYou know, I used to live

(Episode 12) LyricsOUTSIDE HARLEM'S PARADISE\nThe ESU team is shackling Luke for arrest.\n\nCOP: All right, here's the plan. Triple-cuff him. Alpha team, you take point positions in the convoy. Bravo team will bring up the rear. Remember, we're clear to engage, so if he so much as looks at you funny, light him up.\n\nCOP: Copy that. You hear that, freak? I got something special for you.\n\nLUKE: This isn't necessary.\n\nCOP: Yeah, it is.\nMisty is looking on from her ambulance. She gets up and starts walking towards Luke.\n\nPARAMEDIC: No. You need to let us finish. Ms. Knight...Ms. Knight!\n\nMISTY: It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine. (to the ESU guy) I need a moment with Cage.\n\nESU GUY: Misty, we have special orders.\n\nMISTY: Mario, come on. I was just held hostage. I just need a minute with him.\n\nESU GUY: All right. We'll be right here. We got your back.\n\nCOP: Clear!\n\nMISTY (ostentatiously): You going down. It's about damn time. Cottonmouth, Officer Albini, what just popped off in there? ...Look, your friend is in the wind. They've got public enemy number one in handcuffs for the whole world to see so they're not looking for anybody else. Every officer in your detail has those modified Judas bullets. I wouldn't try anything if I were you...before I got to the precinct.\nYou're not that crazy, are you?\n\nLUKE: Always.\n\nMISTY: Take his ass to jail.\n\nCOP: Come on.\n\nCOP: All right, let's go. We're rolling.\n\nThey load Luke into the truck and drive away. The two cops in the front seat discuss him.\nCOP 1: Three sets of cuffs? Isn't that overkill?\n\nCOP 2: The camera's on. We need to look like we're in control.\n\nCOP 1: It's a shit detail. You'd think ESU would be in the back with those guns pointed at him.\n\nCOP 2: We've got the same guns and bullets they do.\n\nCOP 1: You know, my wife says it's the end of days, people like him popping up.\n\nCOP 2: They've been saying that since Eve bit the apple. Cage? He's evolution.\n\nCOP 1: Whatever he is, it's just scary. Makes me feel small. Insignificant.\n\nCOP 2: Insecure? You know what they say. Once you go black, you never go back. At least that's what your wife keeps telling me.\n\nCOP 1: I was fast asleep when she came home. Your daughter already wore me out.\n\nIn the back of the van, Luke easily breaks his shackles.\n\nCOP 2: Just sit tight.\n\nCOP 1: God damn it. Homeless lady. Can't they move her out of the way?\n\nCOP 1 (To the woman, over megaphone): You are in the path of a police convoy. Clear the road immediately.\nLuke breaks out of the van and runs.\n\nCOP 1 (over megaphone): Cage must not escape. Fire at will!\n\nThe cops chase Luke through alleys. Luke comes to a dead end and slams into a side door. He slips through the building and ocmes out on the other side. He sees a police car drive past him and relaxes, but then hears the sound of a shotgun behind him.\n\nCOP 2: Young cops always wanna chase somebody. Me? I'd rather be where they're already going. They told us these Judas bullets can kill someone like you. You don't want to die? Don't run.\n\nLUKE: I'd rather die than go back to prison.\n\nCOP 2: Live free or die? You wanna get all New Hampshire about this shit? Fine with me. Cop killers don't survive these streets.\n\nLUKE: I didn't kill a cop. My problem isn't with you or yours. It's much bigger than that.\n\nCOP 2: Some people are calling you a hero for what you did. Connie's, Pop's...\n\nLUKE: I'm no hero. But I do need to take out the person responsible for all this.\n\nCOP 2: You don't recognize me, do you?\n\nLUKE: I've seen you at Pop's before.\n\nCOP 2: Pop cut my hair for 12 years. He didn't think he was a hero, either. He was just trying to do some right after years of wrong....I hope I'm right about you. More people rooting for you than you think.\n\nThe cop lowers his gun.\nLUKE: What are you gonna tell your people?\n\nCOP 2: The truth. I had you in my sights, but you outran me. I'm getting old...Luke? You better catch that slippery son of a bitch.\n\nLuke turns and leaves.\nOPENING THEME\n\nDIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE\n\nTHEMBI WALLACE (newscast): Moments after the tumultuous events at Harlem's Paradise, fugitive and alleged cop killer Luke Cage was brought out in handcuffs. And now the city's most...\n\nTURK: Hey, I'm glad you called me, Willis. Luke Cage is on the run. They got Shades in bracelets, but they're gonna be onto you before long, brother. Best believe that. Getting ghost and liquidizing your cash, that was the right move.\n\nSTRYKER: I wouldn't touch any of that. People don't test me more than once.\n\nTURK: I overstand. What you need me for?\n\nSTRYKER: I understand you're a man of discretion and taste with numerous connections willing to pay full price for my wares. I can still collect from the shadows.\n\nZip comes in, wearing a pair of sunglasses.\n\nZIP: Bad news, Diamondback.\n\nSTRYKER: Take those off!\n\nZIP: I went to your crib. The files you had are gone.\n\nStryker walks over to Zip and grabs his throat, choking him and pushing him to the ground. He holds him there for a moment before he starts to laugh and lets him go.\n\nSTRYKER: I had you, didn't I? I couldn't resist. I like you, Zip. You've got ambition. It'll take you far as long as you stay in your place. The first of the 48 laws of power. Never outshine the master. That was the mistake Shades made. He questioned me. He doubted me. He tried to reach too far. He was on some Icarus shit. Do you know who that is?\n\nZIP:  Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.  Right?\n\nTURK: No Icarus was the boy who flew too close to the sun with fake wings.\n\nZIP: Shades is no problem. He's still in custody.\n\nSTRYKER: Not for long.\n\nZIP: You gonna blow the joint up?\n\nSTRYKER: No, he's going to be bailed out.\n\nZIP: The hell for? That don't make no sense!\n\nSTRYKER: See? The questioning. That's how it starts...I'm gonna have an opening. You gonna step up?\n\nZIP: I'm down to do whatever you need. No problem.\n\nSTRYKER: Good boy. So are you down?\n\nTURK: I'm down. As long as the business is business, I'm good with it. Till then, I'm out of here, man.\n\nZIP: Show Turk out, Zip.\n\nTURK: Romeo would roll over in his grave, the way you hop-skipping with these cats nowadays. He was a man on these streets. You's a boy.\n\nZIP: What the hell are you talking about? You're down here in his pocket, same as me.\n\nTURK: I'm doing business with him, yes. But I ain't his boy. And I definitely ain't his bitch.\n\nTurk leaves, and Zip walks back to Stryker.\n\nZIP: These old-ass niggas talkin' about shit they don't even know about. So what's in the box?\n\nSTRYKER: One of the seven deadly sins, my boy which I plan to unleash on dear old Carl.\n\nZIP: Which one?\n\nSTRYKER: Wrath.\n\nCOLON'S GYM\n\nERNESTO (in Spanish): This Diamondback needs to be dealt with.\n\nADVISER (in Spanish): Ernesto is right, Domingo. This is the perfect time to do it. We've got the muscle. Plus, with the Cuban, Jamaican, Dominican and Haitian leaders dead, we can control the drugs, guns, all of it and walk out like kings.\n\nDOMINGO (in English): I was there when he took them all out. Right next door. We got the drugs. We got that money. But with the guns, we can control everything. Here, the islands, further south...We'd be unstoppable. Hmm?\n\nERNESTO (in Spanish) So what are you saying?\n\nDOMINGO: We take him out. We go after what's ours. Let's go find Diamondback.\n\nTHE STATIONHOUSE\nShades is standing for his mugshot. Misty watches him through the window.\n\nOFFICER: Turn and face the camera.\n\nRIDLEY: You're supposed to be in the hospital. Push yourself too hard too soon and you could make it worse, you know.\n\nMISTY: I appreciate your concern.\n\nRIDLEY: No, you don't. I need you at 100%.\n\nMISTY: I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.\n\nRIDLEY: Well, the hostages have all been consistent that Luke Cage never held them at gunpoint.\n\nMISTY: He was set up. You know it, Priscilla. Half this damn department knows it. We need to be going after Willis Stryker.\n\nRIDLEY: Well, then why is Luke Cage running?\n\nMISTY: He's a black man being chased by the cops oh, with special bullets. Accused of killing a cop, and you're asking why he's running? Come on.\n\nRIDLEY: Look at how relaxed Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez is. He knows he's not going anywhere anytime soon, so he's resting up. He knows he's guilty. See this perp? Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous. No wonder his street name is Sugar. I don't even have to say a word, and here come the waterworks. He's probably innocent or less guilty than whoever he's about to give up.\n\nMISTY: That's a detectives' wives' tale. You can't prove guilt or innocence by that.\n\nRIDLEY: Oh, but you can...because Luke gave you his word.\n\nMISTY: Luke...\n\nRIDLEY: Right now, his actions are speaking louder than his words.\n\nMISTY: Luke Cage saved my life.\n\nRIDLEY: I don't dispute that we should be bringing in Diamondback, but to get to the truth, we need to bring them both in.\n\nMISTY: Okay, well, let me lead the charge. Make sure Luke is brought in safely.\n\nRIDLEY: He threw away his chance when he jumped out that damn van. Now they will shoot him on sight with the mayor's blessing.\n\nMISTY: You know what? At least let me take a crack at Shades. He's in deep with all the players. He doesn't scare me.\n\nRIDLEY: Detective...\n\nMISTY: I can handle him.\n\nRIDLEY: You just got shot. I need you to go home, get some rest. I'll interview Shades.\n\nTHE RUINED HARLEM'S PARADISE\n\nMARIAH: My grandmother loved Harlem's Paradise. She took care of all the small details. She loved it. From the murals the glasswork, all the way down to the table linens. No fine point was overlooked. This was her legacy. My family's in tatters, and it's all because of Diamondback. Shit! Uh, I know, I know I need to get out in front of this. Release a statement about Damon Boone and how much I respected him.\n\nALEX: That is not what I was gonna say.\n\nMARIAH: Well, yeah, just Please, no lectures.\n\nALEX: This is just a thing. Things can be rebuilt, and when you do, you rebuild it as your legacy. Not just the clubs. I want to be a part of that...Here's what I think. Controlling the narrative is everything. We can't have any loose threads. So anyone who might have overheard anything you said to Diamondback or Shades in here is a threat.\n\nMARIAH: You're absolutely correct.\n\nALEX: How may I be of service?\n\nMARIAH: I wouldn't want you to do anything untoward.\n\nALEX: Never.\n\nMARIAH: Okay.\n\nTHE STREETS OF HARLEM\nLuke is skulking around in daylight, in his bullet-riddled hoodie.He hides from a police car, then sees two men pull on balaclavas and enter a bodega.\n\nLUKE: I don't have time for this.\n\nInside the bodega, one robber is holding a gun on the owner and Method Man while the other empties the register.\n\nROBBER 1: Don't move. He'll blow your head off. He's crazy like that. Don't try no shit.\n\nThe robber suddenly recognizes Method Man. He pulls up his mask\n\nROBBER 1: My bad, Meth. I grew up on that Wu-Tang shit. But you know how it is.\n\nMETHOD MAN: Are you serious? Are you really trying to have a conversation right now?\n\nROBBER 1: I'm just tryin'...I'm just sayin'...You're the man, yo.\n\nROBBER 2: Pull your mask down! You supposed to be watchin' the damn door, Bryce!\n\nBRYCE: What I say about using my government name, Michael?\nLuke walks in\n\nBRYCE: Damn, homie. You look like you went through a cheese grater. Oh, snap, you Luke...\n\nLuke smacks Bryce hard enough to knock him into a display. Michael panics and shoots at Luke several times.\n\nMICHAEL: I ain't mean that.\n\nLUKE: Give me your phone. The phone, fool.\n\nMICHAEL: Yo, my bad, man. You know, I just got a little nervous and shit when you threw my mans across the...\n\nLuke flicks Michael in the head and knocks him out.\n\nMETHOD MAN: It's you. Yeah, it's you.\n\nLUKE: No, man, it's you. Yo, man, \"P.L.O. Style\" was my joint back in the day. Sweet Christmas. Yeah, man, one second.\n\nLuke makes a phone call.\n\nLUKE: Hey, it's me...Yeah, they'll be looking for me. I'll lay in the cut. I'll see you in a few.\n\nLuke puts the phone away, looks to Method Man.\n\nLUKE: You a double XL?\n\nMETHOD MAN: Way ahead of you, homie.\n\nThey trade hoodies. Luke takes a minute to destroy the robbers' gun.\n\nLUKE: Call the cops.\n\nBODEGA OWNER: I know a lot of people who would pay you for this kind of protection.\n\nLUKE: They can keep their money.\n\nMETHOD MAN: Salute...You ever see anything like that before?\n\nBODEGA OWNER: Harlem, baby. Harlem.\n\nTHE STATIONHOUSE\nMisty is walking down the hall. Her phone rings.\n\nMISTY: Hello?\n\nCANDACE: Detective Knight?\n\nMISTY: Candace?\n\nCANDACE: Yeah.\n\nMISTY: What number are you calling me from?\n\nCANDACE: A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS. I need to see you.\n\nMISTY: Come into the precinct.\n\nCANDACE: No. No. You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.\n\nMISTY: You didn't wanna talk to me before. What makes you trust me now?\n\nCANDACE: Because Luke Cage does. He saved my life. And you saw right through me. You want the truth, right?\n\nMISTY: Where are you?\n\nCANDACE: Look, if you can't help...\n\nMISTY: Candace.\n\nCANDACE: Tell me a place, and I will be there.\n\nINTERROGATION ROOM\n\nRIDLEY: You should be at Rikers right now, but I held you because I think you have something to say.\n\nSHADES: Lawyer.\n\nRIDLEY: I know your record, Mr. Alvarez. Came up in Harlem, rolled around with Cottonmouth in the late '90s, spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing, then you made it to the big time, went to Seagate.\n\nSHADES: Lawyer.\n\nRIDLEY: Cornell Stokes is dead, but you're still alive. And I've never seen an arraignment happen so quickly. Two million dollar bail and someone paid it in cash. Who's your new sponsor? Is it Willis Stryker?\n\nSHADES: Law...yer.\n\nRIDLEY: You were part of a hostage situation, Hernan. Even if your lawyer does get you out you won't be walking away from that. That's multiple kidnapping and weapons charges. How does 25 years to life sound to you? Minimum.\n\nSHADES: Are you serious?\n\nRIDLEY: Yep.\n\nSHADES: Okay. Okay. I I was in the club. I saw what happened. I know who did it.\n\nRIDLEY: Okay. We can protect you, but I need a name to verify. Who was it? Was it Stryker?\n\nSHADES: He goes by...lawyer. You need me to spell it?\n\nShades laughs Ridley out the door.\nTHE WATERSIDE\n\nCANDACE: You call this safe?\n\nMISTY: We're hiding in plain sight. I've got you...For now. Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away from here, and you are on your own.\n\nCANDACE: It's not bullshit.\n\nMISTY: We'll see. How did you even get out of Harlem's Paradise without being stopped?\n\nCANDACE: They were so busy trying to arrest Luke, I just walked away.\n\nMISTY: So what is it? What do you need to tell me that's so important?\n\nCANDACE: I was at the club the night Cottonmouth died.\n\nMISTY: I already know that.\n\nCANDACE: I mean right after.\n\nMisty deliberately takes out her phone and holds it up so Candace can see her touch the \"record\" button.\n\nCANDACE: Mariah killed him.\n\nMisty pictures herself in Harlem's Paradise as Shades and Mariah cover up the crime.\n\nSHADES (flashback):The trash bag is for the clothes you're wearing now. Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too. Someone from Spurlock's will incinerate them....The secret to any good lie is it has to run parallel to the truth....\n\nMISTY: How do you know this?\n\nCANDACE:  I heard them talking about it.\n\nSHADES (flashback): ...do what I say...\n\nCANDACE: The guy who always wears sunglasses, he was there. It was his idea to say Luke Cage killed Cottonmouth. I was so scared. I snuck out of there, back to the lockers.\nAnd, um, I was trying to calm myself down. When I went upstairs, the guy with the glasses offered me $50,000 to tell a story. So I told one.\n\nMISTY: Why are you coming clean now?\n\nCANDACE: 'Cause I can't live with this. Especially after Luke saving my life. If you can guarantee my safety, I will testify about everything I just told you.\n\nMisty stops recording and puts her phone away.\n\nMariah scares me more than Cottonmouth. I asked her if she thought Luke did it, mostly to see if I could trust her. To see if she would tell me the truth. She looked me right in my eye and said \"You never know what anyone is capable of.\" It was the way she said it. She...she would kill me if she knew I was speaking to you, I truly believe that. Thank you for helping me.\n\nMISTY: I'm gonna nail Mariah Dillard's ass to the wall. Who else knows that you're here?\n\nCANDACE: Just my friend Leslie.\n\nMISTY: Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie. As a matter of fact, give me your phone. Come on.\n\nCANDACE: Okay.\n\nMisty hands her a new burner.\n\nMISTY: Now, I picked this up on the way, just in case. It's already got my number programed in there, so if I call or text, you know it's me.\n\nCANDACE: Is your arm okay?\n\nMISTY:  My trigger finger is just fine.\nCome on, let's go.\n\nCANDACE: Where?\n\nMISTY: Soledad's. Her daughter Claire is the one who treated your ankle at Harlem's Paradise. She'll be there, too. I'm gonna take you there myself.\n\nNearby, Alex watches them from a car.\nSWAY'S STUDIO\n\nMETHOD MAN: No lie. Bullets was flying everywhere and shit.\n\nHEATHER B:You trying to tell me that those are bullet holes? Man, Meth, I love you, but get out of here. I don't believe that.\n\nMETHOD MAN: HB, I thought the same thing until shorty pulled the biscuit and let two off on Cage and they bounced off. Bullets ricochetin' and shit. Look, I'm telling y'all the truth. I see y'all over there, y'all don't believe it.\nTrust me, it's the truth. And after he smacked fire out these dudes, he left the hoodie, told me and Gomez to call the police...You know I ain't calling no po-po...Then he bounced.\n\nSWAY: Say word.\n\nMETHOD MAN: Word, Sway. I'm telling you. He even balled the dude's gun up like some old homework.\n\nHEATHER B: But my thing is, though, if he innocent, so what he running for?\n\nMETHOD MAN: Bulletproof always gonna come second to being black. HB, you should know that. You from Jers. Jers!\n\nSWAY: Wow! Sound like he stunted on you right there.\n\nHEATHER B: He did stunt. It was a stunt. It was a stunt. Why you gotta stunt on me?\n\nMETHOD MAN: No, I mean, seriously. Seriously, though, what I'm just saying, like, if that was me, and I was on the run...Why even get involved? But he did. And those dudes was nervous, so anything could've happened. As far as I'm concerned, Luke Cage saved my life, man.\n\nSWAY: That's what's up, man. You know what, that don't sound like no cop killer to me.\n\nMETHOD MAN: For real, for real. You know, there's somethin' powerful about seeing a black man that's bulletproof and unafraid. Come on, y'all. You know? Streets got mad love for Cage. I got mad love for Cage, man, and and he one of ours.\n\nSWAY: But you know what? We got mad love for you, too.\n\nHEATHER B: No doubt.\n\nSWAY: You one of ours, man. You know, the show's almost over, man. You gonna spit for us?\n\nMETHOD MAN: Of course.\n\nSWAY: Oh, man! He 'bout to spit! Citizens, you are in for a treat. One of the best to pick up the mic, the one and only Method Man!\n\nMETHOD MAN: Hey, yo, Sway. You all ready? I'mma dedicate this one to the hardest individual on the street right now. Luke Cage, you already know. \"Bulletproof Love\" your way, brother.\nDuring this song we see a montage of cops trying to track down Luke Cage, stopping black men with bullet-riddled hoodies. However, the whole of Harlem has started to wear them. Gomez the bodega owner is selling them to a huge crowd.\n\nLet's get it.\nListen.\nMan, it is what it is\nCan't understand a man if you ain't lived what he lived\nRoaches in the crib, ain't got no food up in the fridge\nPlus the crime running rampant and it's screwing up the kids\nSway, admit, what kind of paradise is this?\nI just want my 40 acres and some carats on the wrist\nBut these snakes is trying to gather in the pit\nWhen you get a cottonmouth, plucking ashes off the clip\nOff the rip, now a challenger exists\nAnd he bulletproof, shoot, what kind of caliber is this?\nGot thugs in the store with the barrel on your lips\nSaying, \"empty out the drawer\" before he pound you with the grip\nLord, who to call when no one obeys the law\nAnd there ain't no Iron Man that can come and save us all?\nPower to the people and Luke Cage the cause\nAnd the cops got it wrong, we don't think Cage involved\nLook, dog, a hero, never had one\nAlready took Malcolm and Martin, this is the last one\nI beg your pardon, somebody pulling a fast one\nNow we got a hero for hire and he a black one\nAnd bullet-hole hoodies is the fashion\nWe in Harlem's Paradise, tell the Captain\nThat I'm about to trade the mic for a Magnum\nGive up my life for Trayvon to have one\n\n[Hook: Method Man]\nYeah, 'cause this is bulletproof love\nAnd you already know what a bulletproof does\nSo you can take it from a bulletproof thug\nThe hood got his back, dog, bulletproof love\nThe blood thicker than mud\nAnd who am I to judge if you get a gun in the club?\n'Cause you already know what a bulletproof does\nWhen the hood got your back, dog, bulletproof love\n\n[Outro: Method Man]\nYeah, shoutout to Pop. RIP, my brother. The streets is crazy nowadays. People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one whether you like it or not. Luke Cage, please believe it, sir. The streets got your back. You already bulletproof love, baby\nThe streets is crazy right now, you know what I'm sayin'? People say we don't need another hero, but now we got one. Whether you like it or not, Luke Cage, please believe it, sir, the streets got your back. You're already bulletproof love, baby!\n\nSWAY: Yeah! That was dope. You got it right here on Sway's Universe. The homie, Method Man, HB, and the bulletproof thug, Luke Cage.\nLaw enforcement is in a frenzy looking for Luke Cage.\n\nTHE BARBERSHOP\n\nTHEMBI WALLACE NEWSCAST: There have been numerous false sightings, with some people wearing hoodies with holes as a sign of solidarity with an outlaw some people still perceive to be a hero.\n\nSWAY: Sway in the Morning. What's on your mind, citizen?\n\nCALLER: Yo, I remember when Larry Davis was on the run back in the day. Cops came at him 'cause they were just as corrupt, dangerous and jacked up as he was. I don't think we're getting the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.\n\nFish is listening to Sway and watching Thembi on the news at the Barbershop.\n\nSWAY: I wouldn't put it past the government, man. Um, you know, we're gonna be searching for the answers for you, and once we get the facts, we're gonna put it right here on Sway's Universe, all right? Thanks for your call, citizen. We got another person on the line...\n\nFish changes the station to jazz. Plainclothes officers rush in to raid the shop.\n\nOFFICERS: Now! Come on! All right.\n\nFISH: Oh, come on, man. You know he's not here.\n\nSmith walks over to Fish's chessboard.\n\nSMITH: I understand playing against the computer, but, um, how do you beat yourself?\n\nFISH: Chess is a game of anticipation. If you know every single possible move, you can anticipate your adversary's next move before he does.\n\nSMITH: Oh. That's deep. If we find out you've been hiding him, there'll be hell to pay.\n\nFISH: Yeah, well, just don't break the hinges on that door on your way out. I just got it fixed.\nThe cops drive away. Luke watches them go and comes into the shop.\n\nFISH: That was a close shave.\n\nLUKE: Bad pun.\n\nFISH: What the hell did you even come back for, man?\n\nLUKE: I had to. For Harlem. Take care of Diamondback before he made it bad for everybody.\n\nFISH: Well, forget Harlem. Forget your brother! You're on the road in a brand new car and a woman that fine? And you're bulletproof. You'd have never seen my black ass again. I'd rob the occasional bank and never look back. You got every cop in the city looking for you, brother. Negroes writing Luke Cage ballads and shit. So what's the plan?\n\nLUKE: To box in all the players.\n\nFISH: Well, Shades is in jail. Mariah's out, but she ain't exactly on your side. Now you could tail both of 'em, but no telling how long that'll take for them to lead you to your prey. What about Misty?\n\nLUKE:  No, she's got her hands full already. She's trying to clear my name inside the precinct and bring me in at the same time. We gotta be careful with her.\n\nFISH: That leaves you one other option. Someone else to find Diamondback. Here. Turk.\n\nFish gets up and goes to the wall phone.\n\nLUKE: Turk may be a pawn, but he's not dumb. If he thinks he's being set up, he'll disappear.\n\nFISH: You let me worry about that. Hey, Turk, it's Bobby. Listen, I might be able to get my hands on about 30 pairs of Jordans. They're the vintage Air Jordan 5s.\nLet's just say they fell off the back of a truck...Okay, when?\n\nINTERROGATION ROOM\nRidley walks in with an unfamiliar woman.\n\nSHADES: Who's this?\n\nRIDLEY: First name \"Law,\" last name \"Yer.\" Must be pretty damn connected to get a lawyer and not even know who she is.\n\nSHADES: Membership has its privileges.\n\nIn the hall, Misty bumps into Shades on his way out.\n\nMISTY: He sprung you? You think this is funny, don't you? You got this all figured out, huh?\n\nSHADES: No. Actually, I don't.\n\nUNDER A BRIDGE\nZip, Shades, and some minions get out of a car.\n\nSHADES: When did Diamondback bring in new hires?\n\nZIP: Well, after the club, he had to change things up. Recruit some new faces.\n\nThey all walk into an abandoned factory.\n\nZIP: I bet while you were inside, cops tried to do some recruiting of their own.\n\nSHADES: Don't ever question my loyalty.\n\nThey all step into a old service elevator.\n\nSHADES: The man upstairs?\n\nZIP:  You are just full of questions. Matter of fact...\n\nZip wraps a cord around Shades' neck to strangle him. The other minions wait impassively. Shades struggles until he grabs a minion's gun and starts shooting, taking out the minions before even breaking free from Zip. He turns on Zip last, holding the gun on him.\n\nSHADES: Let's go to the penthouse.\n\nTHE ROOF\n\nZIP: I was just following orders!\n\nSHADES: You're a goddamn puppet. Who gave you the order? Who?\n\nZIP: Diamondback! You stopped playing your position. Asked too many questions. Diamondback said you needed to be dealt with.\n\nSHADES: Romeo would be ashamed of you. You're such a disappointment.\n\nZIP: You're the second person who told me that today. I'm my own man, Shades.\n\nSHADES: Tell him yourself.\n\nShades shoots Zip in the head. He finds the sunglasses in Zip's pocket.\n\nSHADES: Nice...Sorry, Romeo He had to go.\n\nMARIAH'S BROWNSTONE\n\nMARIAH: It's a good thing her friend Leslie knew where she was. I'm glad you found the park. So where is she now?\n\nALEX: She left with Detective Knight. Traffic got thick and I lost them. I'm sorry. I'm not used to doing anything like this.\n\nMARIAH: We'll find her again. Just knowing that she can't be trusted is helpful. You did a good job, Alex. Hey, you're my rock! Later.\n\nMariah's phone rings. She puts in an earbud before she answers to speak on her headset.\n\nMARIAH: What do you want?\n\nSTRYKER (over the phone): That's no way to speak to a business partner.\n\nMARIAH: After what you did to my club, do you really think I'm gonna shuck and jive with you?\n\nSTRYKER (over the phone): You might wanna check your attitude. If you're not of any use to me, then you're not useful to anyone. Shades would tell you, if he was still alive.\n\nMARIAH: What the hell are you talking about?\n\nSTRYKER (over the phone): I had to let him go.\nSo now, I'm giving you the chance to tell me where you stand. I've taken Shades and Damon Boone off the table so you can grow. I'd hate for us to part, too.\n\nMARIAH: I wasn't particularly fond of Shades and the death of Damon Boone, although unnecessary, was appreciated. But you need to know this. I'm out of the political game. I'm focusing on Harlem's Paradise. Using it for a a power base for community relations.\n\nInstead of answering over the phone, Styker comes into the room.\n\nSTRYKER: That's a smart move. But you've made some dumb ones also. You should never talk about murder on an open line.\n\nHe drops a duffel bag in front of her.\n\nSTRYKER: Open it. Seed money for your New Harlem Renaissance project and refurbishing the club. My apologies.\n\nMARIAH: It's a very generous donation but nothing in this world is free.\n\nSTRYKER: You're right. My only condition is loyalty. Stick with me and Harlem will be remade in your own image. We'll be doing this for years to come.\n\nMARIAH: Harlem is already in my image. You staying?\n\nSTRYKER: Once I'm finished with Carl, I'll evaporate. But don't worry. You'll still feel the occasional cool breeze. Sweet dreams, Mariah.\n\nTHE STREETS OF HARLEM\nTurk is walking down the street. Luke grabs him and pulls him into an alley.\n\nLUKE: You ratted out Chico. You got Pop killed.\n\nTURK: Man, the writing was on the wall. Somebody would have seen him. Might as well be me. How was I supposed to know Tone was gonna shoot up the shop? Whole damn world know Pop's was Switzerland. Forever.\n\nLUKE: I should crush you.\n\nTURK: You won't, though. You need me.\n\nLUKE: Where's Diamondback?\n\nTURK: I don't know.\n\nLuke picks Turk up and holds him high in the air, then throws him into a dumpster and starts to crush it around Turk's body.\n\nLUKE: You still stalling?\n\nTURK: All right! All right! He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River. Near 145th, all right? I gave you what you wanted! Now let me out!\n\nLUKE: Sit tight, Mr. Barrett. Trash pickup is tomorrow. You can breathe just fine. There's food in there, too.\n\nTURK: You can't leave me in here! There's baby diapers in here, man! Hey! Come on!\n\nDIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE\nDomingo and his minions are walking through the abandoned warehouse.\n\nDOMINGO: Looks like you downgraded. I liked the club better.\n\nSTRYKER: I'm a man who needs his space.\n\nDOMINGO: Space is a good thing. Especially when you come to kill a man.\n\nSTRYKER: Whoa, whoa.\n\nDomingo and his guys pull their guns on the seemingly lone Stryker. Stryker's men emerge from the shadows, equally armed.\n\nDOMINGO: Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies. That's not Cage's style so I'm guessing Shades didn't appreciate you bailing him out.\n\nSTRYKER: You know when a rattlesnake is at its most dangerous, Domingo? When it's cornered.\n\nStryker pulls out his guns and starts shooting. There is a long shootout.\n\nDOMINGO: I'm gonna rip your head off!\n\nEventually Stryker escapes the melee and goes into another room. He opens a crate and a red glow illuminates his face.\n\nSTRYKER: \"And behold a pale horse and he that sat upon him, his name was Death.\"\nMARIAH'S BROWNSTONE\nMariah is counting Stryker's cash and drinking. She gets up and opens a gold box in her living room that has the pearl-handled gun that Cottonmouth used to kill Uncle Pete. Shades comes into the room.\n\nSHADES: You really need a security system. You waiting for me?\n\nMARIAH: No.\n\nSHADES: I bet he told you I was dead. Diamondback got to you, didn't he?\n\nMARIAH: No, he didn't.\n\nSHADES: What are you doing with a gun? It's not you.\n\nMARIAH: Shut up.\n\nSHADES: I have something for you. Figured you'd want this.\n\nHe holds out the bottle she used to hit Cottonmouth over the head when she killed him.\n\nSHADES: Your prints, Cornell's blood.\n\nMARIAH: Then you'll have nothing to blackmail me with.\n\nSHADES: I don't need it. We're in this together now.\n\nMARIAH: You and I have come a long way. You know, sometimes you have to reach across the aisle to get things done.\n\nSHADES: You're talking about Luke Cage? It's incredible how much you and I think alike. We're at war. And right now, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n\nMARIAH: Maybe. But it might not take. You did beat his ass and give him his powers. And Cornell's flunky killed Pop. You think he really is gonna jump? Just jump on our bandwagon?\n\nSHADES: Absolutely. 'Cause we have something that he wants more than anything.\n\nHe pulls an official looking manila envelope out of his bag.\n\nHis old life. A chance to clear his name. Right here.\n\nMARIAH: If we send Luke after Diamondback and they kill each other all of our problems are swept away. No matter who wins.\n\nSHADES: Even better.\n\nDIAMONDBACK'S WAREHOUSE\nLuke breaks the metal door down and sees the results of the firefight. The warehouse is filled with dead bodies. He finds Domingo Colon, who isn't quite dead yet.\n\nDOMINGO: I should've known you'd turn up.\n\nLUKE: What the hell happened here?\n\nDOMINGO: Diamondback.\n\nLuke hears beeping. He follows it to that side room and finds Stryker's crate. It has a bomb inside with a countdown at 45 seconds.\n\nLUKE: Sweet sister.\n\nCut to Luke running out of the warehouse carrying Domingo.\n\nLUKE: Slow. Take it easy. What did he use? How did Diamondback do that?\n\nDOMINGO: Something I've never seen before. Even you can't stop him.\n\nDomingo dies.\nTHE STATIONHOUSE\nThe shot of Domingo's death becomes a crime scene photo on Misty's wall.\n\nMISTY: These just came in.\n\nBAILEY: Elephant punches all over again.\n\nMISTY: Mmm-hmm.\n\nBAILEY:That's gotta be Cage, right?\n\nMisty's cell phone rings.\n\nMISTY: Hello?\n\nLUKE (over the phone): Hey, it's me. You guys find Domingo?\n\nMISTY: Yeah.\n\nLUKE: Meet me.\n\nMISTY: Where?\n\nShe quickly gathers her things and leaves.\nTHE STREETS OF HARLEM\nMisty stops in front of the grated window of an abandoned building. Luke is inside, talking to her through the window.\n\nMISTY: Should I thank you for this?\n\nLUKE: All credit goes to Diamondback.\n\nMISTY: I don't suppose we'll find his body. We found Zip's, though, and two other thugs in an old building. Shot up. Right after they picked up your other boy.\n\nLUKE: Shades. Don't you ever get tired of people getting out?\n\nMISTY: Yes. Look, it's not safe for you to be here. If you don't find Diamondback...\n\nLUKE: Then he wins, and my life is forever a living hell.\n\nMISTY: Is there anything I can do?\n\nLUKE: See what else Turk knows. He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd. Near Mount Olivet and the shop.\n\nMISTY: A dumpster?\n\nOUTSIDE MOUNT OLIVET CHURCH\nMariah and Shades are sitting in a car.\n\nMARIAH: Even if we handle Diamondback he's not gonna forgive us for framing him for Cornell's death.\n\nSHADES: We could hurdle that easy. The only people who know what really happened in the club are you and me.\n\nMARIAH: I'll regret that night for the rest of my life.\n\nSHADES: You did what you had to do. You shouldn't regret that.\n\nMARIAH: What were you even doing at the club that night?\n\nSHADES: I was going there to kill him. You beat me to it.\n\nMARIAH: Cornell never needed my political money. And he was never going to pay it back. He just wanted me in all the way.\n\nSHADES: So what are you saying?\n\nMARIAH: He saw things in me that I avoided my whole life. Now I am becoming that person he always saw and I always denied.\n\nSHADES: You ready?\n\nMARIAH: I stay ready, baby.\n\nThey climb out of the car and walk into\nTHE BARBERSHOP\n\nFISH: I should've kept my coat on. Hell just froze over.\n\nMARIAH: Where's Luke Cage?\n\nLUKE: I'm right here.\n\nSHADES:We have a problem.\n\nLUKE: So do I. I can't decide which one of you I'm gonna knock out first. Where's Diamondback?\n\nSHADES: I don't know. The parley between the three of us is more important.\n\nLUKE: You have the nerve to use that term? Right here? Where Pop died? Cough up Diamondback's location, or I'll stomp you like we were back at Seagate.\n\nFISH: Luke, be cool, brother.\n\nMARIAH: Whoa, whoa. No one needs to stomp anyone. Pops made this place Switzerland for a reason. Cage, we have a mutual enemy, and the only way to bring him down is for us all to come together.\n\nLUKE: There's no way I'm helping you.\n\nMARIAH: We came to offer you a truce. In exchange for helping you find Diamondback, you drop your beef with us.\n\nLUKE: You both framed me for murder. There's nothing you can offer me that's going to make me let that go.\n\nSHADES: How about your freedom? Right here is everything you need to prove that Diamondback framed Carl Lucas.\n\nLUKE: Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated Luke Cage is now wanted for the murder of Cottonmouth.\n\nMARIAH: I'll tell them the truth. Diamondback killed Cornell and Damon Boone. You'll go free.\n\nMisty emerges from the back room.\n\nSHADES:What the hell is this?\n\nMISTY: Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest for the murder of Cornell Stokes.\n\nLUKE: I thought you said you were going after Turk?\n\nMISTY: I've been tracking you since you called. I wasn't going to let you just ghost me again.\n\nLUKE: Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shades, back off! Misty, stand down. We're working this out.\n\nMISTY: Oh, so you workin' with them now?\n\nLUKE: He knows where Diamondback is.\n\nSHADES: I didn't say that.\n\nMISTY: Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you should share it with the whole class.\n\nSHADES: I ain't telling you shit.\n\nSomething drops to the ground right outside the shop.\n\nLUKE: Grenade!\n\nEveryone drops to the ground (with Luke between them and the door) to cover their heads. The grenade goes off, blowing out all the windows of the shop. In the chaos Misty drops her phone and Shades picks it up. Stryker comes in wearing a green suit and helmet.\n\nFISH: What the hell? What type of Jean Paul Gaultier shit is this? What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?\n\nSTRYKER: No, I'm the angel of death.\n\nSHADES (aside to Mariah): You told him to meet us here?\n\nMARIAH: No.\n\nSTRYKER: Damn! Look at Hernan the cockroach. Your mama should have named you Pedro.\nShades lifts his gun and fires at Stryker. The bullets ricochet off of his suit.\n\nMARIAH: Shades!\n\nFISH: God damn it! I just fixed this place up all perfect and shit! Y'all can't take this outside?\n\nLUKE & STRYKER: No.\n\nFISH: All right, just just sayin'.\n\nLUKE (to Misty): Don't let Mariah get away.\n\nMISTY: I won't. Kick his ass, Luke.\n\nSTRYKER: You know I'm gonna kill 'em all later, right?\n\nLUKE: You have to get past me first.\n\nSTRYKER: Oh, I don't go past.

better weather\nInstead of us playing games forever\nShe says whatever\nI says whatever\nWho get you wetter than the half moon wearer?\nHSTRY sweater\nSerendipity when you with me\nSwear you love that one thing we did\nThat one time in that one place\nBlew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home\nI'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42\nI've accomplished my goals, it's only you\nYou and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape\nJust my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight\nEsco\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nYou ain't gotta question it, oh\nYou already know the answer\nThe

Lyrics[Intro]\nYeah\nI woke up feeling like fucking up some paper\nFreebandz, Freebandz\n\n[Chorus]\nI blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi\nI blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy\nI blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe\nI blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe\nI blow a bag today, I blow a bag today\nI blow a bag today, Chyna gon' fuck me so crazy\nI blow a bag today, I blow a bag today\nI blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi\n[Verse 1]\nI had a bag today, I blow the bag today\nI had to grab the Wraith, I had to grab the Wraith\nI had to change the safe, I had to change my bitch\nMoney'll change a nigga, the fame'll change a bitch\nI know I came from poverty, I got my name from poverty\nI know for sure, for sure\nIf my granddad was livin', I know he'd be proud of me\nI know for sure, for sure\nIf Snupe was living, I know he'd be proud of me\nI know for sure, for sure\nIf Lonzo was livin', he never would've doubted me\nI know for sure, for sure\nI live with these diamonds, just check out my clarity\nGotta just check out these clarity\nI get so fly like a parachute\nI pull up right now and embarrass you\nI sold the crack on my avenue\nOnly the strong survive\nI'm just enjoying my life\n\n[Chorus]\nI blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi\nI blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy\nI blow a bag today, hope out the whip on 'em, babe\nI blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe\nI blow a bag today, I blow a bag today\nI blow a bag today, Chyna gon' fuck me so crazy\nI blow a bag today, I blow a bag today\nI blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI ran it up with the same niggas\nGet that money and stay with the same niggas\nI know that money can change niggas\nThey don't look at you like you the same nigga\nI just hope I can remain humble\nHop out a Ghost in the jungle, I did it\nSell all the dope out them apartments, I did it\nI'm 'bout to cut off some niggas I know that ain't with me\nRunnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas\nThat get it and niggas who strive\nAnd the real niggas is all they come across, yeah\nI know either way it goes, Sunny gon' be there\nI know either way it goes, Doe Boy gon' be there (Young Metro!)\nEven when a nigga was broke, Scooter was always there\nI be pourin' up this 4, they thought we wouldn't be here\nI told you, come a time when we had to persevere\nI knew there'd come a time when we'd all be here\n\n[Chorus]\nI blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi\nI blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy\nI blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe\nI blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe\nI blow a bag today, I blow a bag today\nI blow a bag today, Chyna gon' fuck me so crazy\nI
