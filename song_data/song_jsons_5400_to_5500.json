superstitions\nThen maybe you'd see the signs\nBut lord knows that this world is cruel\nAnd I ain't the lord, no I'm just a fool\nLearning loving somebody don't make them love you\n\n[Chorus 1]\nMust I always be waiting, waiting on you?\nMust I always be playing, playing your fool?\n[Verse 2]\nI sang your songs, I danced your dance\nI gave your friends all a chance\nBut putting up with them wasn't worth never having you\nAh, maybe you've been through this before\nBut it's my first time so please ignore\nThe next few lines 'cause they're directed at you\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI can't always be waiting, waiting on you\nI can't always be playing, playing your fool\n\n[Bridge 1]\nI keep playing your part\nBut it's not my scene\nWant this plot to twist\nI've had enough mystery\nKeep building it up\nBut then you're shooting me down\nBut I'm already down\n\n[Bridge 2]\nJust wait a minute\nJust sitting, waiting\nJust wait a minute\nJust sitting, waiting\nSee Jack Johnson LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like[Verse 3]\nWell if I was in your position\nI'd put down all my ammunition\nI'd wonder why'd it taken me so long\nBut lord knows that I'm not you\nAnd if I was I wouldn't be so cruel\n'Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do\n\n[Chorus 1]\nMust I always be waiting, waiting on you?\nMust I always be playing, playing your fool?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nNo I can't always be waiting, waiting on you\nI can't always be playing, playing your fool\n\n[Outro]\nFool, hm hm10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/110030", "artist_names": "Ashanti",

Lyrics[Intro]\nDown, down, down\nDown, down, down\nDown, down, down\nDown, okay\nGuess who's back, back again\nShady's back, tell a friend\nNow everyone report to the dance floor\nTo the dance floor, to the dance floor\nNow everyone report to the dance floor\nAlright, stop, pajama time\n[Verse 1]\nCome here, little kiddies, on my lap\nGuess who's back with a brand new rap?\nAnd I don't mean \"rap\" as in a new case\nOf child molestation accusations\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries\nPapa's got a brand new bag of toys\nWhat else could I possibly do to make noise?\nI done touched on everything but little boys\nAnd that's not a stab at Michael\nThat's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho\nI go a little bit crazy sometimes\nI get a little bit out of control with my rhymes\nGood God, dip, do a little slide\nBend down, touch your toes, and just glide\nUp the center of the dance floor\nLike TP for my bung-hole\nAnd it's cool if you let one go\nNobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?\nGive a little poot-poot, it's okay\nOops, my CD just skipped\nAnd everyone just heard you let one rip\n[Chorus]\nNow I'm gonna make you dance\nIt's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass\nWhoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, you know you're my world\nAlright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nJust lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nGo crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nOh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)\nYou

feelin' kinda breezy\nLet the top down and my hair blow\nI don't know where I'm goin', all I know is\nWhen I get there someone's gonna touch my body\n\n[Verse 2]\n'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk\nBut I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work\nCould you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?\nSpit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)\nNow, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?\nMan, you must be up out your mind\nDre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind\nI'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I'm gonna make you dance\nIt's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass\nWhoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, you know you're my world\nAlright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nJust lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nGo crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nOh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)\n[Post-Chorus]\nWell, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up\nI'm in jail and I don't know what happened\nThey say I was runnin' butt-naked\nDown the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)\nYour honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember\nAll I know is this much, I'm not guilty\nThey said, \"Save it, boy, we got you on tape\"\nYellin' at an old lady to touch my body\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow this is the part where the rap breaks down\nIt gets real intense, no one makes a sound\nEverything looks like it's 8 Mile now\nThe beat comes back and everybody lose themselves\nNow snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit\nYo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man\nChubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby\nI don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby\nFellas (What?) Fellas (What?)\nGrab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)\nBlack girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls\nTall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls\nEveryone report to the dance floor\nIt's your chance for a little romance or\nButt squeezin', it's the season\nJust go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I'm gonna make you dance\nIt's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass\nWhoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, you know you're my world\nAlright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nJust lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nGo crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nOh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby,

It offers an exploratory examination of hip-hop feminism in an effort to map out an agenda for the twenty-first century. The essay is not concerned with hard-and-fast answers to the combination of feminism and hip-hop but rather with what hip-hop feminism might add to current conversations surrounding race, class, gender, and sexuality. By examining the conscious/commercial rap dichotomy, the discussions surrounding video models, lyrics by rapper Jean Grae, and the work of contemporary women authors, this essay opens the door for further dialogue about women, rap, and hip-hop feminismI know I\u2019m on the right path\nTo who I\u2019m gonna be at last\nSo don\u2019t rush me\nI know I\u2019m wrong and right\nAt the same time both, I\u2019m the dark and light\nAnd they say life means everything to live\nAt the same time I got everything to give\nSo don\u2019t rush me Don\u2019t rush me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-Jean Grae, \u201cDon\u2019t Rush Me\u201d\n\nTrying to capture the voice of all that is young black female was impossible. My goal, instead, was to tell my truth as best I could from my vantage point on the spectrum. And then get you to talk about it. This book by its lonesome won\u2019t give you the truth. Truth is what happens when your cumulative voices fill in the breaks, provide the remixes, and rework the chorus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-Joan Morgan, When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: A Hip-Hop Feminist Breaks it Down[79]\nThe epigraphs from rapper Jean Grae and hip-hop feminist Joan Morgan hint at the varieties and contradictions embedded in hip-hop feminism.1 The third-wave feminist leanings, along with black feminist and womanist agendas, make for a study in shifts and unevenness. The third wave represents the generation of feminists that hip-hop feminism is a part of. This generation of feminists is best represented theoretically in anthologies such as Listen Up: Voices from the Next Feminist Generation (Findlen 1995), To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism (Walker 1995), The Fire This Time: Young Activists and the New Feminism (Labaton and Martin 2004), Colonize This! Young Women of Color on Today\u2019s Feminism (Hernandez and Rehman 2002), and Catching a Wave: Reclaiming Feminism for the 21st Century (Dicker and Piepmeier 2003). The black feminist and womanist agendas are agendas that hip-hop feminists, the majority of whom are black women, share with their foremothers who saw their struggles with gender oppression as intimately connected to their struggles with race and class oppressions. They were women whose agendas kept firmly in sight the survival of the entire people. A hip-hop state of mind\u2014one that freely samples, mixes, and remixes\u2014influences the theoretical underpinnings of hip-hop feminism as well as the activism of hip-hop feminists. This essay highlights some of the ways hip-hop feminist agendas have taken shape while always keeping in mind, as the epigraphs from Jean Grae and Joan Morgan show, there won\u2019t be just one truth but multiple ones. In fact, sometimes the contradictions that make for the \u201cwrong and right . . . dark and light\u201d of it will help feminists to better do what Joan Morgan suggests feminism needs to do\u2014be \u201cbrave enough to fuck with the grays\u201d (1999, 59). This essay is an exploratory essay that seeks to examine the various articulations of hip-hop feminist expressions as a way to provide a starting point and possible template for a hip-hop feminist agenda\n\nWomen have been representing in hip-hop culture ever since the mid 1970s, when the culture got its start in the South Bronx, and they represent still. They have been and still are B-girls, women breakers, graffiti artists, deejays, and emcees. Today, we can add to the mix women writing and thinking about the culture who call themselves hip-hop feminists. I take the stance that hip-hop is a cultural phenomenon that expands beyond rap music. Hip-hop has been defined by many as a way of life that encompasses everything from way of dress to manner of speech. Hip-hop as a culture originally included graffiti writing, deejaying, break dancing, rap music, and the oft-forgotten fifth element, knowledge. [80] It has recently expanded to include genres such as film, spoken word, autobiographies, literature, journalism, and activism. It has also expanded enough to include its own brand of feminism. The writing of third-wave black feminist writers such as Ayana Byrd, Denise Cooper, Eisa Davis, Eisa Nefertari Ulen, Shani Jamilla, dream hampton, Joan Morgan, Tara Roberts, Kristal Brent-Zook, and Angela Ards is expanding black feminist theory and black women\u2019s intellectual traditions in fascinating ways. What started out as a few young black feminist women who loved hip-hop and who tried to mesh that love with their feminist and womanist consciousness is now a rich body of articles, essays, poetry, and creative nonfiction. But what exactly is a hip-hop feminist? And what does hip-hop feminism do? I maintain that although we now have a relatively clear idea of what constitutes a hip-hop feminist, we are less certain about what a hip-hop feminist agenda should be\n\nHip-hop feminists are women and men who step up and speak out against gender exploitation in hip-hop. From the Feminism and Hip-Hop Conference at the University of Chicago in 2005 to the B-Girl Be conferences in Minneapolis and countless symposiums and smaller conferences on the status of women in hip-hop to the list serves and Yahoo groups devoted to women, feminism, and hip-hop, there appears to be a surge in women and men thinking and talking about gender issues in hip-hop and combining that talk with action. From the publication of several key essays and Joan Morgan\u2019s pivotal book When Chickenheads Come Home To Roost in the 1990s to the Spelman women who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly to Essence Magazine\u2019s \u201cTake Back the Music\u201d campaign, we can begin to see the ways this movement\u2019s knowledge-building and consciousness-raising have taken shape. It might be too soon to talk about the impact that the movement has had, but it is not too soon to think about some of the key concerns and agendas that the movement seems to be taking up. I aim to flesh some of this out by building on some of the work that I did in my book Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture and the Public Sphere (2004) and by examining a few areas where women have used hip-hop to claim a public voice. I want to look at the spaces where hip-hop feminism can make interventions as starting points for a possible feminist agenda in hip-hop. However, they will not all be feminist spaces or even have outright feminists messages. Instead, they are spaces where hip-hop feminists, activists, and thinkers can possibly evoke change\n\nKrista Ratcliffe (2006) writes about giving her students a feminist literacy through which to read society. Elaine Richardson carefully details the ways in which the young women who listen to and love hip-hop process the images and have thoughtful and critical conversations about the culture and the music when she examines female hip-hop literacies in her book Hiphop Literacies (2006). [81] And it has me thinking seriously about what a hip-hop feminist literacy would allow us to do and why we need one. Thinking of recent controversies such as Don Imus calling the Rutgers women\u2019s basketball team \u201cnappy-headed hoes\u201d and Michael Richards\u2019s meltdown in which he boldly and blatantly brandished the n-word at black men he thought were hecklers and the quick way just about everyone quickly made a move to blame hip-hop has me seriously considering what a worldwide hip-hop feminist literacy could give us in these situations. Would we continue to have conversations that blame rappers for white racist men doing what white racist men do all day every day? Or would we instead be able to really look at the nuances of the situation and see, for example, that while there was some racism underlying Imus\u2019s statement, the sexism and underlying homophobia were palpable. And like racism, the sexism and homophobia predates hiphop in Imus\u2019s politics and certainly in this country that deals with both on a regular. But even as we had these conversations and teased out these issues with our hip-hop feminist lens, we would still be able to critique hip-hop for its sexism and homophobia as well. We just wouldn\u2019t blame hip-hop when people old enough to know better show their true colors, colors they have been showing all along. The fact is that young women who listen to rap music and participate in hip-hop culture already have critiques of sexism and misogyny. They have things to say about the culture and the world around them if we are prepared to listen. This essay is therefore an attempt at understanding what they might offer the larger society the next time we have such public pedagogical moments as those offered by Imus and Richards\n\nSo, Shorty\u2019s a Feminist?\n\nSeveral black and third-wave feminists have started to approach the tenuous relationship between rap music/hip-hop culture and feminism in their writing. They offer a variety of different feminist perspectives on rap, rappers, and women. Some condemn the sexism in rap and encourage others to do the same. Others offer complicated analyses that critique the larger societal issues that contribute to rap\u2019s sexism, production, and consumption. Some offer third-wave feminist critiques that question how one can be a child of the hip-hop generation, love the music, and still critique and actively speak out against the sexism. They all offer examples of how feminists have begun to deal with, think about, and write about rap music and hip-hop culture\n\nMost hip-hop feminists believe that some of the needs of the hip-hop generation require new strategies and different voices. They have a strong [82] relationship to the \u201cself,\u201d and they connect their personal narratives with theoretical underpinnings and critique. They hold themselves and their peers responsible for effecting change in the present and future by encouraging people to recognize and combat their own complicity. In terms of rap music and hip-hop culture, they want to find ways to move beyond counting the amount of times a particular rapper says the word \u201cbitch\u201d or \u201cho\u201d to a focus on what they consider to be larger issues and concerns. For example, they also want to begin to complicate understandings of women\u2019s complicity in the objectification of women especially as it pertains to video-hoes. And as Joan Morgan reminds us, \u201cthe focus of Black feminists has got to change. We can\u2019t afford to keep expending energy on banal discussion of sexism in rap when sexism is only part of a huge set of problems\u201d (1999, 76). They are concerned with and spend a lot of time writing about black women\u2019s relationships with black men. They want to encourage a dialogue between black men and women, men rappers and women\n\nA hip-hop feminist is more than just someone who likes to listen to rap music and feels conflicted about it. A hip-hop feminist is someone who is immersed in hip-hop culture and experiences hip-hop as a way of life. Hip-hop as a culture, in turn, influences his or her worldview or approach to life. In fact, one of the reasons why Elaine Richardson, Aisha Durham, Rachel Raimist, and I decided to edit Home Girls Make Some Noise: A Hip-Hop Feminism Anthology (2007) was because we wanted to think about hip-hop feminism beyond the conflicted, \u201cI\u2019m a feminist and I love hip-hop, woe-is-me\u201d standpoint. We wanted to create a space to talk across disciplines through activism, the arts, and academia to better understand the very important and vital work going on in this area. Hip-hop feminists are working as community activists. They are working for reproductive justice. And they are trying to think about ways to combat the growing prison-industrial complex in relation to women of color and the equally astounding HIV/AIDS rates. And they are also still very much concerned with representations of women of color in rap music videos and the harm that these images can do. So, I want to move now to one area that hip-hop feminism continues to grapple with: the video vixen\n\nShorty Wants to be a Star: Video Vixens Representing Women of Color?\n\nIn her groundbreaking book, Prophets of the Hood, Imani Perry notes the following about the recent trends in hip-hop music videos: \u201cIt seemed to happen suddenly. Every time one turned on BET (Black Entertainment [83] Television) or MTV, one encountered a disturbing music video: Black men rapped surrounded by dozens of black and Latina women dressed in bathing suits, or scantily clad in some other fashion. Video after video proved the same, each one more objectifying than the former. Some took place in strip clubs, some at the pool, at the beach, or in hotel rooms, but the recurrent theme was dozens of half-naked women\u201d (2004, 175). With the release of Karrine Steffans\u2019s tell-all memoir, Confessions of a Video Vixen (2005), the topic of women, music videos, and objectification is once again on everyone\u2019s minds. But even more so, the questions surrounding objectification have become complicated in important ways. No longer can we make claims about what is happening to the women in the videos without complicating the discussion by adding their voices. Although Steffans says that she wrote the book as a cautionary tale for little girls who want to grow up and be video girls, the book reads more like a how-to with just enough name-dropping and gossip to fill inquiring minds. In fact, with the release of It\u2019s No Secret by Carmen Bryan, rapper Nas\u2019s ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child, it seems as if some marketing person in the publishing industry figured out a way to capitalize on mixing the current Zane-inspired erotica fervor with hip-hop glitterati in order to cater to a gossip-obsessed culture and recent trends in reality programming. These kinds of books appeal to a variety of people because of the way they play into the genres listed above. However, what does come across clearly as one reads the Steffans\u2019s memoir and Bryan\u2019s tell-all are the ways in which some women have chosen to buy into the sexism and misogyny that limits the roles that women can play in hip-hop culture\n\nThe issues of representation and objectification in hip-hop offer many variables that all must be considered if we are going to have a meaningful conversation about the topic. The ways in which the men artists and male and female video directors objectify the women in their lyrics and videos is one aspect. The ways in which the women video models and hip-hop artists choose to objectify themselves in a quest to make money and earn a living is another. And the way these images straddle the very thin line between validation of black women bodies and objectification is yet another aspect. The truth of the matter is that we are now in a(n) historical moment where the bodies of women of color flood popular culture in ways that they never have before. As hip-hop culture expands and dominates mainstream popular culture, the hip-hop video becomes more than just a music video. The impact of these videos on women of color is vast. Hip-hop music videos are spreading representations of U.S. women of color around the globe. [84]\nI have written elsewhere that hip-hop culture did not spring up full grown on its own and that it builds on other legacies that exist in the culture and the community that we are not always willing to own (see Pough 2001). Others have noted that hip-hop does not exist in a social-cultural vacuum, that as a part of the larger culture it takes on elements of the larger culture as well (see Potter 1995; Rose 1994). So when we look at the hip-hop centerfolds that exist in Source Magazine and XXL, with their monthly \u201cDime Piece\u201d and \u201cEye Candy\u201d sections, we cannot discuss them in isolation and certainly not without at least mentioning the long-running Jet Magazine \u201cBeauty of the Week.\u201d And when we talk about the ways in which hip-hop videos are similar to pornography, we cannot have the conversation without looking at the ways in which pornography has infiltrated the larger culture as well. Can you say \u201cgirls gone wild\u201d?\n\nNone of this is meant to take away from the damage that these pornographic images of women of color in hip-hop do. What I do want to look at, however, are the ways in which these tropes impact our thoughts about women of color and how they in turn impact the lives of young women. The words of women like Zulaika Jumaralli (2005) who claim \u201cMusic Videos Broke My Spirit\u201d come to mind as I think about the power of these videos and the impact that they have. I think of women like the black women students at Duke, who, outraged by the recent alleged gang rape of a black woman by white members of the university lacrosse team, loudly proclaim, that they are \u201cnot your video ho.\u201d In an article written by Fiona Morgan (2006), these students share stories of being expected to be sexually available and inappropriately propositioned by white men on campus just because of their race. One student says, \u201cAs a black female, you go to a party. You\u2019re expected to dance. You\u2019re expected to be sexually provocative. You are expected to want to be touched, to be grabbed, to be fondled.\u201d Another student adds, \u201cAs if they\u2019re reenacting a rap video or something. As if we\u2019re their video ho, basically. We can\u2019t just be regular students here. We can\u2019t just go to a party and enjoy ourselves\u201d (F. Morgan 2006). As much as we try to move away from allowing negative images to impact our lives, there are real implications that we need to contend with. Add to this the multiple stories of black women who have traveled to other parts of the world only to be approached as if they are a video vixen by the men in the countries they are visiting, and we can see how far these attitudes about women of color extend\n\nI also think about the hip-hop feminist warriors who are bringing wreck in the public sphere by talking back\u2014women like the Spelman women, who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly after viewing his derogatory video [85] \u201cTip Drill,\u201d only to have that attempt at dialogue stilted and to receive criticism themselves for being elitist college women looking down their noses at the women who are making an honest living in the video and the poor artist who only wants to share his art with the world. While I offer the statements above in a tongue-in-cheek manner, several interviews in which Nelly spoke about his \u201cordeal\u201d painted the Spelman women in this way. I am also informed by hip-hop feminist writers like Karen R. Good, who, fed-up with the whole images, representation, and objectification debates, offers her own treatise:But as of late, many of hip-hop\u2019s children have been playing the cheapest trick: depending on undulating female, colored bodies to entice weak minds and compensate for weak rhymes. Or our bodies are used for verbal target practice. I am way past anger. Shock went the way of \u201cBitches Ain\u2019t Shit.\u201d Don\u2019t feel like being sad. I just wonder about the worth of a black girl. You know, like the difference between what happens when little white girls go missing and little black girls go missing. Or get raped. Pissed on. That type of shit. . . . That said, not one more lecture. I put my hands up. Man, if you want to swipe a credit card down the crack of a woman\u2019s behind, or Miss, if you want to let yo ass be the machine, fine. To each his own. The culprit is not hip-hop, which is undergoing a beautiful evolution, by the way (hear Mos Def\u2019s \u201cThe Rape Over\u201d), it\u2019s our reliance on the baser nature as opposed to the higher mind. Hip-hop is the thinker\u2019s form. (2005, 29\u201330)As I think about the video vixen and her relationship to a hip-hop feminist agenda, I do so keeping the fervor and the sentiment of these very different responses to the images in mind. As the black women students at Duke remind us, the images have the power to hurt. As the negative backlash to the Spelman women shows us, when we speak out or try to initiate a dialogue, we open ourselves up for criticism. And as Karen Good reminds us, the images are not the sum and total of hip-hop and certainly not what is representative of the culture, which is in constant evolution. But they do exist and we do need to interrogate them. And when we do, we need to add to the mix the voices, stories, and reasons these women give for participating in the objectification. Only then will we get a more nuanced and complicated discussion of the video vixen\n\nBy adding their voices, we indeed get a discussion that highlights the gray areas that Joan Morgan writes about. These women see the videos as their entry into the world of stardom. They are aspiring actresses, models, singers, and even rappers themselves. They gladly pose in the magazines and preen in the videos, and the best and brightest of them are paid very well [86] to do so. Some even make up to $3,000 a day.2 These are not necessarily the poor, victimized women of old. Some of them have a critique of the business, and they recognize their role in a society in which sex sells. Video girl Tawny, interviewed by Jeanne Amber for Essence Magazine, notes: \u201cIf video girls are being exploited, then every female artist who is out there being sexy should be blamed too. To me, it\u2019s all bull\u2014\u2014\u201d (Amber 2005, 165). Former video model, BET host, and entrepreneur Melyssa Ford notes of her own career and decisions:I\u2019m the highest-paid video girl to date. I\u2019ve endured all the snide comments and ignorant remarks from people who presume to know me because I\u2019m on their television screens and in the pages of their magazines. But I\u2019m not the promiscuous twit I\u2019m often mistaken for. I am a business-woman who has used videos to launch a multimedia career. My product is me. Besides being the lead girl in hip-hop and R&B videos, I am a sex columnist for a men\u2019s magazine. I star in my own DVD. I\u2019ve hosted television shows, and I\u2019ve produced my own calendar, which I sell on the internet. My job is to sell fantasy and perfection. When the cameras go on, I detach myself and play the sexy vixen who will turn a nigga out. (quoted in Byrd and Solomon 2005, 219\u201320)The fact is, these women are making decisions\u2014decisions informed by a variety of variables\u2014to be in these videos, to pose for these magazines. While I do not pretend that their decision-making takes away from the systems of oppression surrounding them that make not making the decision to objectify themselves difficult, I do not want to ignore the agency, real or imagined, that these women have. How does their agency complicate our discussions of objectification? I don\u2019t pretend to have the answer to this, and I don\u2019t even want to suggest that there is one cut-and-dry answer. But I do know that as feminists, we can no longer have these conversations without including their voices and their stories. And when we add their voices and stories to the mix, they bring with them those dark and light, wrong and right mixtures that Jean Grae raps about and the subtle shades of gray that Joan Morgan writes about\n\nThe video vixen\u2019s agency is important, and the work of visual artist Ayanah Moor adds layers to this conversation by thinking about the ways these women may be exhibiting agency even as they participate in the demeaning videos. Her collection of video shots, \u201cSTILL,\u201d is one example of the way Moor uses her art to complicate the discussion. The text that goes along with the montage of video stills represented in the collection states: [87]STILL Images of women surrounding male rap stars in music videos is as common as the jewel encrusted subject matter of today\u2019s rap lyrics. Females are seen in packs hovering around male rap stars, playing the part of enthusiastic cheerleader or die-hard groupie. Rap music videos sell not only hiphop culture, but also the very image of its women. They serve as eye candy designed to satisfy an assumed male video audience, affirming critiques of the culture as hyper masculine and misogynist. STILL is a series of photographs from contemporary rap music videos. These artworks invite a second look at the hip-hop video vixen, displaying an interest in moments unintended by music video narratives. Some stills reveal agency rather than victimization, while others provide reminders of the narrow representations of women in hip-hop. (Moor 2006)Moor\u2019s \u201cSTILL,\u201d the hip-hop feminist discussions surrounding video models, and the video models voices and stories show, I hope, what a rich space the issues of video images and representation can be if we think about issues of agency in more complicated ways. Combining these might allow us to better interrogate the following questions. For example, what does it mean that hip-hop has the capability to make a woman a pseudosuperstar, sought after by magazines and video directors based on solely on how she looks? And how does this further complicate our understandings of how black women respond to things like the ideal beauty image? Does the influx of other kinds of beauty\u2014meaning black and women of color\u2014into the mainstream disrupt the norm? Does it simply add yet another impossible ideal for women to yearn for that now makes women of color, particularly black women, vulnerable in ways that they haven\u2019t been in the past? All of these questions are complicated and warrant far more space than this cursory look at possible hip-hop feminist agendas allows. But they are spaces in which hip-hop feminism can make meaningful interventions. I will now move to another space in which there are possibilities for a hip-hop feminist agenda by examining female emcee Jean Grae\n\nShorty Got Love for the Game: Jean Grae,Hip-Hop, Feminism, and change (Or ... Simply... I wish she were a feminist...)\n\nWhat would happen if we had feminist emcees moving millions toward a critique of gender that motivated them toward change? Why haven\u2019t we had any women emcees with this kind of feminist agenda? What would happen if we could harness the power that rap music has to make people dance and make them work toward change in women\u2019s lives? When studying [88] feminism in relation to hip-hop, one thing becomes abundantly clear: most women emcees are not checking for the F word. They won\u2019t claim it. Won\u2019t label themselves with it. Will not touch it. This is not to say that there are no feminist women rappers. However, the fact remains that as much as we champion and claim certain women rappers for their lyrics, their outreach activities, their \u201cpositive\u201d messages, or their \u201cprowoman\u201d messages, very few women rappers will go on record saying that they are feminist\n\nTaking a page from black feminist theorist Patricia Hill Collins, who in her essay \u201cWhat\u2019s in a Name? Womanism, Black Feminism, and Beyond\u201d (1999) ultimately comes to the conclusion that quibbling over what we call ourselves is less important than the work we do to evoke change, I posit that while we cannot in good conscience place the label of \u201cfeminist\u201d\u2014hip-hop, thirdwave, black feminist, or womanist\u2014on most contemporary women rappers, we can\u2014as feminist scholars and activists\u2014use the music they produce and the issues they raise to begin to enact change. In this regard, rising hip-hop artist Jean Grae becomes an interesting case study for hip-hop feminism even if she denounces feminism for herself: \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist by any means, I just want people to enjoy the music\u201d (Thomas 2004). In much of her music to date\u2014her two CDs, Attack of the Attacking Things: The Dirty Mixes and This Week, as well as her EP, The Bootleg of the Bootleg\u2014we can easily see the concerns of hip-hop feminists put to music\n\nGrae\u2019s two albums and EP have garnered critical acclaim, and just about every review I have read noted her stellar lyrics and vocal delivery but bemoaned the production and the lack of killer beats. What comes across in most interviews is the fact that she is going to make music and have a career on her own terms. We won\u2019t see her taking off her clothes to sell records. But she is quick to stop interviewers who want to label her the Anti\u2013Lil\u2019 Kim, Anti\u2013Foxy Brown, or Anti-Trina. She does not have a problem with her fellow women rappers. She has a problem with an industry that won\u2019t allow a fullness of black womanhood to be represented. She notes: \u201cYou know what, that\u2019s not me. That\u2019s not how I live. And that\u2019s not how I do. But there are females that do. I think it\u2019s messed up that there is not an opportunity for someone who is not doing that to have an equal chance. And that is the problem. It\u2019s like there has to be some choice . . . have some other shit. Balance it all out. Apparently for some odd reason, that is not allowed\u201d (Bloom 2004). She knows what she is willing to do and she knows what she has to offer: \u201cI want to break the formula, and make history for myself. I want people to know I\u2019m a skilled writer and lyricist that isn\u2019t afraid to be honest. I\u2019m stubborn. I refuse to change myself [89] for a machine\u201d (Dyer 2004). I have to admit, when it comes to hip-hop, I am all about the lyrics. The beat is important, yes\u2014couldn\u2019t be a true hip-hop head and not acknowledge that. But the beat is not going to make me buy the record. In fact, I\u2019m much more excited when the beat takes me back to the essence, the simple boom bap. So, the reviews that bemoaned the lack of cutting-edge production and beats on Jean Grae\u2019s CDs didn\u2019t faze me. Her lyrics blew me away. Her lyrics, style, and delivery are like one part Jigga, two parts Nas, a healthy dose of gender consciousness, race consciousness, and, lo and behold, a pinch of a global awareness for good measure\n\nOn her first album, Attack of the Attacking Things, Jean Grae critiques the sexism in hip-hop. In the song \u201cKnock\u201d she raps, \u201cAsk me bastard if I\u2019m signed / I rhyme sick / but niggas is quick to turn they back on spitters with clits / Hit em with this, and ridiculous phrase flow that exit my lips / Hey yo, I mean my face, though / they still want chicks with tits and ass out / my respect is worth more than your advance cash-out.\u201d In the song \u201cWhat Would I Do?\u201d she raps: \u201cI\u2019m Jean Grae, honorable team player for years / Emceeing on the low, in videos devoid of the hoes / For sho\u2019 it\u2019s crunch time / I\u2019m the one they sent to piss your label off / they won\u2019t fuck with me unless I\u2019m parading and taking it off.\u201d She is very conscious of the sexism in the music industry and the exploitation of women in particular. And her lyrics and her interviews show that she is raging against that machine\n\nPerhaps what is most worthy of mention is the way that the song \u201cWhat Would I Do?\u201d aims to inspire change. The chorus asks: \u201cWhat, what, what would I do? / If like my people said, I left it to you. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I didn\u2019t try a verse, if I didn\u2019t rhyme. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I just hated and did nothing to change it\u201d The chorus makes the listeners question themselves as well. For all of us complaining about the status of hip-hop, what are we doing to change it? Listening to Attack of the Attacking Things is almost like reading Joan Morgan\u2019s When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Although the outright feminist agenda is missing from Jean Grae\u2019s album, the themes that come out in Morgan\u2019s book about the need for change and the vulnerability of wanting to be loved are all there\n\nPerhaps the most poignant representation of a hip-hop feminist state of mind and potential agenda comes across in the song \u201cP.S.\u201d from Grae\u2019s latest CD, This Week. The song is a series of e-mails, which are basically apologies to people she has wronged in the past, a friend she betrayed, a lover she [90] cheated on, and herself. The song calls to mind the hip-hop feminist need to question our complicity in our oppression. She questions it and owns it. In the last verse she raps:Dear Jean\nI see you\u2019re doing big things\nCongratulations, hey I even saw that big ring\nWho would of thunk it huh? LOL\nYou even seem content\nI notice that you\u2019re more focused\nDrinking less as well\nAnyways it\u2019s been too many months having henny days\nI think it\u2019s plenty brave, plus you get your pennies saved up\nAnd say what?!? Second album?\nWhatever happened to the thought of ending rapping?\nStill living in Manhattan?\nSidetracking note, just on the low\nAll apologies, I used to hate your fucking guts\nPlease pardon me, tried to kill you more than once\nI\u2019ve acted horribly, and all my pessimism towards your life\nStill bothers me\nBut you\u2019re a big girl now\nYou\u2019ve fought and made it through\nBest of luck homie\nAnd everything I say is true\nXOXO Space Smiley Face dot dot dot\nComma Much Love, youThe fact that the speaker in this rap is writing this particular e-mail to her \u201cself\u201d is telling; it brings to mind many questions about how young black women internalize the negative influences bombarding them. Hip-hop feminist writings have dealt with some of these issues. What has been criticized as a self-absorption and an excessive focus on the individual in most hiphop feminist writings is really a genuine concern and a search for meaning, particularly what it means to be a young woman in often dangerous urban environments; what it means to be a woman who participates in and loves a culture that doesn\u2019t always love you; and how you deal with it when some of the hatred aimed at you becomes internalized and affects how you treat others and how you feel about yourself. Jean Grae\u2019s \u201cP.S.\u201d is all of those hip-hop feminist questions and issues put to music. And in a world where young black women grapple with so many images that objectify and sexualize them, such artistry is needed. I move now to a discussion of one of the most [91] problematic images that young women who listen to contemporary hip-hop face: the ride-or-die chick\nShorty Wanna Ride? Ride or Die Chicks and Real Black GirlsBut got a women that ain\u2019t afraid\nTo tuck the toast in the escalade\nPop on niggas that showin me shade\nBut only for the Rule \u2019cause that\u2019s my baby\nGot me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don\u2019t care\nBlazed by the shots and flares\nGirl c\u2019mon, follow me, and bust back at police\nConceal ya heat\n-- Ja Rule, \u201cDown Ass Bitch\u201dShorty, you ridin\u2019 with me?\nStic tell \u2019em bought them RBGs\nI like \u2019em real trill\nGold in the grill\nCold as Pam Grier swoll in the rear\nHard, smart, strong in the heart\nSexy thong when we alone in the dark\nDark skin, red bone, slim in the waist\nThem legs so long\nQueen earth, jean skirt, head wrapped up\nPimping them converse\nAnd she down for the dirt\nFor better or for worse\nGot my gun in her purse\nIn case a nigga get searched\nShe got a mind like Assata\nA body like Trina\nA heart like my momma\nNigga tell me have you seen her?\n-- Dead Prez, \u201cReal Black Girl (Revolutionary Love)\u201dFinding a way to combine feminism and hip-hop in politically meaningful ways is one of the premier goals of hip-hop feminism. This is not easy work. The negative lyrics of most contemporary hip-hop are enough to make even the most die-hard hip-hop feminist contemplate giving up the music and the culture. Articles by dream hampton (2001) and Eisa Nefertari Ulen and Tara Roberts (2000) both speak volumes about the frustration of being a hip-hop head who is also a feminist. [92]\n\nThe fastest-growing prison population statistically in this country is black women. They are going to jail largely because of their relationships with men who are involved with criminal activities. They are going to jail for things like smuggling drugs; they are women like Kemba Smith, who simply fell in love with the wrong man and was too afraid to leave. As Smith recounts, \u201cAt age 24, without so much as a parking ticket on my record, I was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison\u2014without parole. Technically, I was convicted of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine, but I contend that I went to jail for dating a drug dealer.\u201d She was finally pardoned as a last minute act of President Clinton, but she still feels that justice was not served. She notes, \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d have been doing cartwheels when I was released. Truthfully, my feelings were in conflict. It was tough to leave behind the incredible women I met in prison\u2014especially since many of them were victims of the same laws that put me away\u201d (Booth 2001, 86). The incarceration rate for black women continues to grow because of the messages young women are getting from the videos. Messages from contemporary rap lyrics about being a \u201cdown ass chick\u201d are everywhere, and they are not just coming from men. Women rappers also rap about the illegal things they would do for their men\n\nIn my book (Pough 2004), I critiqued the image of the ride-or-die chick as it is represented in hip-hop, the girl willing to do whatever she can for her man, a girl that the lyrics of Ja Rule\u2019s \u201cDown Ass Chick\u201d call to mind. I urged black feminists in particular to look at these representations as a threat to young black womanhood and to find ways to have conversations with young women and reach out to them before we lose an entire generation. The situation was and still is that dire for me. However, I\u2019d like to complicate things just a little by thinking about what I see as another version, albeit a revolutionary version, of the down ass chick. The recent revolutionary but gangsta messages from rap group Dead Prez have also included some interesting messages for what they call Real Black Girls\u2014girls who are \u201cdown for the dirt, / for better or for worse, / got my gun in a purse / in case a nigga get searched.\u201d\n\nGiven the hip-hop feminist fondness for all things \u201970s and revolutionary, it is easy to see how a RBG (Real Black Girl/Revolutionary but Gangsta) image is more appealing than a Down Ass Chick. The reggae beat of the song and the reggae chant of the first stanza calls to mind those Black Panther sisters we see in all the footage of that time but never hear about. Or the revolutionary sisters who are still in prison as political prisoners for their acts against the establishment but whose names we have yet to learn, let alone start a Free (fill in the blank) Movement for. [93]\n\nNow, I\u2019m not going to argue that down ass chicks and real black girls are problematic for the same reasons. That\u2019s not the point of the comparison. The point of the comparison is to look at the ways in which a mentality of being down for whatever\u2014even when that whatever is revolution\u2014can add to the growing black women prison rate. The point is also to complicate our thinking about hip-hop in ways that stop us from creating dichotomies that place rappers like Ja Rule in one category labeled commercial, negative, and therefore bad, and rappers like Dead Prez and others in another pile labeled conscious, underground, revolutionary, and therefore good. The point isn\u2019t to single out Dead Prez, because they do build on a legacy of the Black Power Movement that had its own gender issues to work out. Even though one would hope that in the twenty-first century conscious rappers would not be replicating those dated and retrograde ideas in such problematic ways. And even though I have no problem with the concept of doing what we have to do for the revolution, per se, I have to ask, if we are talking about a revolution, then what is my role in it, brother? Is a woman\u2019s role in the revolution still pussy power and prone and now I have to conceal your weapon to boot? All of that aside, my point in using Dead Prez\u2019s \u201cReal Black Girl\u2019s (Revolutionary Love)\u201d as an example is simply to say that if we are pushing hip-hop feminism forward as a movement concerned with creating change in the culture and eventually change in the world, we cannot be one-sided with our critiques. Everyone gets called out if they need to be called out. Thinking about \u201cReal Black Girls\u201d as a derivative of the \u201cDown Ass Chick\u201d is one area that we could exam that would allow us to break apart some of the false dichotomies between conscious and commercial hip-hop\n\nIn her novel Picture Me Rollin\u2019 (2005), Black Artemis tells the tale of a young woman who has been released from jail on a mandatory gun possession charge. The protagonist, Esperanza, was dating a street entrepreneur who dabbled in armed robbery when she got caught in the getaway vehicle with a gun that he gave her. She was the only one out of the crew to serve time, mainly as a lesson because she refused to testify\u2014to snitch\u2014against the guys. When the novel opens, Esperanza is being released from jail, and throughout the novel she grapples with several things. The first is \u201cThug Life,\u201d an obsession with rapper 2Pac Shakur that is so delusional she thinks that the rapper is still alive and chilling in Cuba with Assata Shakur. The second is her newfound knowledge of women of color feminism, thanks to her older sister\u2019s community college course books. And the third is her old life as a drug dealer and generic ride-or-die chick for her drug dealer boyfriend Jesus. Esperanza [94] tries throughout the novel to make a better life for herself, and Black Artemis does an excellent job of showing another side\u2014a female side\u2014of growing up in the urban environments and landscapes made famous by hip-hop\n\nThe character Esperanza offers some insight that we all need to consider as we grapple with and complicate the down ass chick. In the prologue to the novel, Esperanza is getting ready to be released from prison and is having a talk with fellow prisoner and roommate Isoke, a political prisoner jailed for her activity with the Black Liberation movement. Isoke is trying to get Esperanza to move beyond an embrace of Tupac\u2019s \u201cThug Life\u201d in order to join the larger struggle. Isoke also works in the prison library, so she has given Esperanza a lot of things to read. At this point, however, if it isn\u2019t related to 2Pac, Esperanza is not really interested in reading it. When Isoke flat-out asks her if she is going to be a thug or a revolutionary the older political prisoner lectures to Esperanza: \u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid that brother 2Pac was wrong. Thug Life is not the new Black Power. It makes no sense to rage against the machine without purpose or principle. You cannot be both a gangsta and a soldier, Esperanza, so you must choose.\u201d In response to this, Esperanza sighs and thinks \u201cneither \u2019cause either way I\u2019ll end up back in this muthafucka or dead.\u201d When Esperanza speaks, she responds, \u201cAll I know is that I am never coming back here\u201d (Artemis 2005, 2). Esperanza\u2019s words bring the connection between the lyrics of Ja Rule\u2019s \u201cDown Ass Chick\u201d and Dead Prez\u2019s \u201cReal Black Girls\u201d home in powerful ways. We can see that when it comes down to it, there really isn\u2019t that much difference between the oppression and the limitations placed on women; that patriarchy in criminal circles is not better or worse than patriarchy in revolutionary circles; that patriarchy in gangsta rap is no worse or better than patriarchy in conscious rap\n\nWhat the novel and the lyrics highlight to me is a real need for hip-hop feminism to be engaged with all aspects of black girls\u2019 lives\u2014we don\u2019t want to be accused of being irrelevant to young black women in the ways that some of us have categorized academic black feminism. It makes no sense to pick and choose images and the artists who create the images and lyrics by deeming some negative and some positive, all the while creating false dichotomies. The issues and the artists are much more complicated than these simplistic readings allow. Rappers like 2Pac Shakur, Dead Prez, Common, Mos Def, and others are nothing if not complicated and sometimes conflicted young men. A cursory look at their work shows us that. Hip-hop feminism needs to be bolder in its critiques, even if it means calling out the so-called good guys every once and a while. [95]\n\nShorty Wrote this Book Yo!: Hip-hop and Feminism, Is it Fiction?\n\nIn her 2001 novel, The Haunting of Hip-Hop, author, lecturer, and scholar Bertice Berry tells the chilling tale of a Harlem brownstone haunted by souls tortured due to U.S. racism and oppression. One of the souls, a former enslaved African, has a message for the hip-hop generation: \u201cWe gave the drum back to your generation in the form of rap, but it\u2019s being used to send the wrong message\u201d (Berry 2001). The novel tells the story of rap producer Harry \u201cFreedom\u201d Hudson and his lawyer Ava Vercher\n\nIf Freedom represents hip-hop in the novel, then Ava represents the consciousness that echoes in hip-hop\u2019s ear and tries to keep it on a righteous path. Ava Vercher is a new-age Afrocentric womanist with uplift tendencies. Freedom is a producer who makes two kinds of music: one is the kind of commercial music record companies want and the other is \u201cmusic that no major record label would ever release because it was filled with the messages of love he longed for and the revolution he dreamed of starting\u201d (Berry 2001, 16). You see that the ghost of the enslaved African has been haunting Freedom ever since he was a child, and he hopes to influence Freedom to do the right thing with the drum before it is too late\n\nI\u2019ve found the most compelling representations of hip-hop feminist representations in hip-hop literature. This is not to say that we should discount the music or the nonfiction writings of hip-hop feminists but simply to offer other spaces within hip-hop culture in which people are trying to imagine a better way. I closed Check It While I Wreck It with the call for us all to imagine a better way to use the culture of hip-hop to enact change. I believe that some women writers of popular fiction have begun to do just that\n\nIn the \u201cReader\u2019s Guide: A Conversation with Black Artemis\u201d at the end of her first novel Explicit Content, Black Artemis defines hip-hop fiction as fiction \u201cabout hip-hop as a subculture, as something that gives people voice and their lives meaning.\u201d For her, \u201chip-hop is a form of cultural power and whether that power is a force for progress or destruction depends on how people use it, whether you use it on the street or in the studio, for fun or for profit, to build or destroy\u201d (2004, 338). Of the recent trend to call urban fiction hip-hop fiction, she notes:I think that street life should be referred to as street life fiction, period, and that the term \u201chip-hop fiction\u201d should be reserved for novels that are about hip-hop. Eventually, there\u2019ll be some works that can be referred to as both, but something that has nothing to do with hip-hop subculture should not [96] be referred to as hip-hop fiction, especially if it perpetuates the myth that hip-hop is all about violence, drugs, misogyny, etc. These phenomena are not the sum total of hip-hop, and hip-hop is not the only subculture in which those elements exist so it is wrong to treat them as if they are one and the same. (2004, 339)Her distinction has caused me to rethink many of my earlier definitions about what constitutes hip-hop fiction and cinema. The distinction is necessary and important for those of us looking for ways to more fully use the youth culture to enact change. And it does not rely on a dichotomy of positive and negative, conscious and commercial. The work simply has to be about one of the elements of hip-hop culture to be classified as such\n\nBlack Artemis\u2019s Explicit Content documents the story of two women rappers, one black and one Latina. The novel explores what it is like to be a female with rapping skills trying to gain recognition in the music industry. It follows the women into the world of hip-hop and examines their hopes and dreams. It\u2019s also a novel about female friendship, with just enough drama to keep the average hip-hop head focused and interested. The two women are a rap duo to rival all rap duos until a gangsta rap label comes between them. Of her work Black Artemis notes, \u201cin these times when hip-hop is often used as a cultural weapon of destruction, my mission as a hip-hop artist and activist is to tell stories that relay the power of hip-hop as a tool of transformative expression\u201d (2004, 340). The activist in her comes across in her fiction. It is fiction with a mission; in the tradition of the poets and playwrights of the Black Arts Movement who created art for people\u2019s sake, Black Artemis\u2019s art has an activist goal and agenda in mind\n\nAnother writer who has political threads in her work is L. A. Banks. Her Vampire Huntress Legends focus on the life of spoken word artist and vampire huntress, Damali Richards. She is the Neturu, which means God\u2019s divine power latent within humans. She is the only Neturu to span two millennia. Damali uses her art\u2014her spoken word music\u2014to bring the light. Her lyrics are about hope in a time of hopelessness. And her band is also her vampire hunting crew. When I asked Banks why she decided to write horror and focus on vampires, she replied: \u201cI wrote this series because I\u2019m a mother living in the urban environment\u2014and horror, because I have been horrified by what I see on the nightly news, and hear on the trolleys and subways, and by what I read in the newspapers. Vampires\u2014because they suck blood, in a metaphor, they suck the life-blood out of the community as predators, and really have no sense of mortality or moral compass. I [97] wanted to create a cautionary tale, but one that also delved into the social, economic, and political infrastructure within our own society that creates predators\u201d (Pough 2005, 168). Each of the novels in the series uses art to highlight the pitfalls of excessive materialism. Each of the novels work as metaphors for the age-old fight between good and evil. However, by making Damali a young spoken word artist, Banks is making a huge statement about the power at hand for young women, the power to change the world. And as for hip-hop, she hasn\u2019t given up hope. Banks notes, \u201cI see plenty of room for Hip-hop as an awesome catalyst, and I\u2019m not so ready to give up on all Hip-hop artists, their messages, or their lyrics. I think what has happened, as metaphorically alluded to in the novels, is that vampires have infiltrated the genre of music, have co-opted the culture, and have twisted it. But there are still some very young, savvy, ready-to-stand-for-their-beliefs young folk out there. . . . that\u2019s the message, that\u2019s my hope. . . . guess it\u2019s really my prayer\u201d (Pough 2005, 171). Like Black Artemis, L. A. Banks has a mission in her art, and that mission is in line with many of the goals that hip-hop feminists have set out. Their novels offer hope and a spark for hiphop culture, at least in terms of having a political mission aimed at change. Race, class, sex, gender, and the intersections of these are present in this new fiction in startling, surprising, and uplifting ways. Writers like L. A. Banks and Black Artemis, rappers like Jean Grae, and the hip-hop feminists that I have mentioned here can in varying degrees be seen as pushing the hip-hop feminist agenda forward. They represent\u2014along with the video vixens and the women hip-hop heads who buy the music and support the culture\u2014a small sampling of women in contemporary hip-hop culture. Together their stories offer versions of the truth that Joan Morgan suggests we could achieve. Together they also give us a glimpse at the possibility for change and a sign that hip-hop feminism just might be on the right path to what it is going to be at last. And then we might be a little less concerned with \u201cwhat it do\u201d because we would be so awed by all that the movement has done\n\nEndnotes\n\n1. I realize that the word \u201cshorty\u201d as a term that is often used to refer to women in hiphop culture and rap music is problematic. Although not as derogatory as some other terms, such as \u201cchickenheads,\u201d \u201cbitch,\u201d \u201cho,\u201d and so forth, it is still a term that more often than not objectifies women. It is also a term in hip-hop culture that refers to younger people, often children. Because \u201cshorty\u201d is used within the culture to refer to women and children, [98] it can be argued that the term therefore infantilizes women; thus, it is not a term I use lightly. I use \u201cshorty\u201d throughout this essay because of its multiple meanings, because it showcases just how fraught the relationship between hip-hop and feminism is. And I also use it because it calls forth the generational issues between hip-hop feminists and older black feminism. In a sense, hip-hop feminists are the shorties, the next generation of feminists on the \u201ccome up\u201d ready to continue the legacy of black women\u2019s intellectual traditions and activism\n\n2. Most of my information about the dreams and aspirations of video models and how much they make comes from a survey of the interviews and photo spreads I\u2019ve read of in the Source Magazine\u2019s monthly \u201cDime Piece\u201d section and XXL\u2019s monthly \u201cEye Candy\u201d section. Each month these magazines pick a video girl to highlight. And while most of the \u201ccoverage\u201d is the photo shoot of the scantly-clad woman, there is usually a two- to three-page write-up and interview of each girl. And it is in these limited spaces that we get their voices, hopes, and dreams\n\nReferences\n\nAmber, Jeannine. \u201cDirty Dancing,\u201d Essence Magazine, March 2005, 162\u201366, 203\n\nArtemis, Black.

Hope you got yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you got yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you got yourself a gun\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nMy first album had no famous guest appearances\nThe outcome, I'm crowned the best lyricist\nMany years on this professional level\nWhy would you question who's better? The world is still mine\nTattoo's real, with \"God's Son\" across the belly, the boss of rap\nYou saw me in Belly with thoughts like that\nTo take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie\nMe and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle\nYou lames could huddle, your team's shook\nY'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field\nThrowin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel\nBut the QB don't stand for no quarterback\nEvery word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft\nAnd I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in\nIt's for the hood by the corner store\nMany try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]\nI got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou want beef?

Y'all awaited the true savior\nPuffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too\nPapi chu's, tore up, wake up in a hospital\nThrow up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps\nYou Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death\nY'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos\nCall me God's Son with my pants low\nI don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo\nThis is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow\nWhat could beat that? Not a soul reppin'\nHit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Alabama 3]\nI got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou want beef?

Is he still in the Bridge?\nDoes he really know how ill that he is?\nGot all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels\nHop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that\nIt's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains\nLook at my tennis shoes, I iced that\nWho am I?

crackin'\nSince I'ma drive the Porsche, I tell 'em push the blue Benz\nCause when it's over straight parkin lot pimpin'\nSo once I find my keys to the ride\nHit the spot around 11:45\nCuz everybody knows that's when it gets hot\nTonight I'm gonna find a lil' shorty for a player to cop, yeah\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI need a hot girl for me\nA sexy lil' mommy\nKnows how to turn me on\nFreak me from the night to the early morn\nA girl who knows just what she wants\nIf you see it baby don't front\nHair fly and nails done lookin' she got one\nThat's the kind I like\n\n[Chorus]\nI like them girls between the sheets\nLike them girls iced up like me\nI like them girls in the fly Gucci\nRollin deep in the 6, Cartier on the wrist\nI like em thick\nSmall waist with the big ol' hips\nI like them girls in the drop Bentley\nThat's the kind of girl I need\n\n[Verse 2]\nOut the corner of my eye spot a shorty\nIce so bright baby lightin' up the party\nShe got the Prada fitting right on her body\n36-24 how could I let her pass me\nI approached her with the game on tight\nSaid you's the kind of flavor I like\nShe said what's up with later tonight\nGonna do whatever feels right to you\nYou

records\nUnseen but well heard, do not disturb\nThe only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word\nI flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge\nFrom the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't

Lyricswhat a band that people love finally\ncomes back after a long hiatus everyone collectively loses it but when said bad who was a part of the rock scene completely leaves it and tells people they're still doing rock and we just accept what they say that's when we\nshould be regretting the past thanks to Michael a patron who donated to my patreon page he is asked that I take a look at a band that he hates and has been hoping someone would rip apart fora long time every evil girl's Dreamboats\nFall Out Boy well I named the Triforce of sake too last year with Creed Nickelback and limp Biskit michael has a similar idea for the Triforce of whining which includes simple plan good Charlotte and Fall Out\nBoy yeah Fall Out Boy however is a little bit different than the other two is that band has a very split public opinion about them so much so in fact that a little over a month ago I had a quick\nunadvertised poll on Twitter for 24 hours asking if Fall Out Boy was good or not the final results was pretty close on both sides as for me I really don't think Fall Out Boy's bad however I do think they are one of the most overrated\nbands easily in the past 10 years I understand people like the ban and they are definitely a big deal back in the mid-2000s with their pop rock hits on the radio and concert selling out everywhere but wow is there a following\nfor these guys that makes fans of 30-years shake their head in jealousy I don't get it their music isn't bad but it's not great I don't get the obsession outside of teenage girls who love these guys back\nthen who then grew up to be women who love these guys after they returned and it's after that hiatus we are going to talk about when Fall Out Boy announced their return in 2011 social media collectively dropped their panties and\nwe're ready for a Fall Out Boy love fest and along with our touring came to return album save rockin whoo it's hard to say the title of this album when you know what's involved Fall Out Boy's save rock and roll I really think Fall Out\nBoy belongs in a rock conversation when talking about their previous albums like their most well known Under the Cork Tree whether people like that up not you can at least understand how they are included in the overall genre then comes\nan album like save rock and roll if I save you mean totally separate yourself from it then yeah you totally saved it this album was the turning point for Fall Out Boy in the sense that they left Rock completely and jumps straight into\npop that's fine if that's what they wanted to do but when you title your album save rock and roll and then jump into another style then you really aren't saving anything you're just pulling a bait and switch on your fans\nunless the joke is that they saved rock and roll by removing themselves from rock wow I'm surprised that was come to that logical conclusion yet I feel Fall Out Boy are fine for what they are I don't hate them but I truly think they\nare not the Beatles although apparently they are some superfans who think the Beatles can't hack it under the court tree along with Fall Out Boy but after said hiatus in return this was the album Fall\nOut Boy came roaring back with a platinum selling album multi-platinum selling singles and plenty of charting positions and with all that it ends up being the least talked about album from the band and that album that shall not\nbe named amongst Fall Out Boy fans so why is it so passed over they even made a full video series for a music video for every song on this album called the Youngblood chronicles but even with all that effort this is still talked about\nas the wars Fall Out Boy album why well thanks to a patrons donation let's see why Fall Out Boy belong in the Triforce of whining and see why we should regret this platinum selling album save rock n roll\nokay this doesn't sound too bad so far down to metal okay the build up actually sounds nice what was I worried about oh I thought I would be hearing a band and not a bunch of studio engineers\nrunning music through production software and mixers and filters I get the problem now I'm not by any means saying the song is awful because it's really not it has a great build-up and the vocals sound fine my problem with\nthe opening track of save rock and roll is that it's filled with overly produced digitally modified instruments that sound like they were played through the guitar and bass sound effect on a Casio keyboard that's not rock and roll\nchiptunes players can do that as the song goes on it becomes more clear just how produced and modify this music is the good drumbeat eventually sounds like it's from an electronic drum machine the melody is coming almost completely from\nPatrick stumps vocals if the guitar bass was never strummed once in this song I wouldn't be surprised at all I love Ted you have to have guitar in your band to be a part of rock you don't but you definitely need more than a\nvocal melody and what sounds like 10 studio engineers making your rock song get used to these finger quotes by the way because every time I say rock it might be in sarcasm like that but this is as good of a spot as any to really\naddress my issue with Fall Out Boy the lyrics this is why so many people are split on the band are the lyrics deep witty and well delivered or are they whiny cliche and melodramatic all of the above you cannot deny that something\ncompany are putting in effort in writing lines and trying to do something more than just sing generic sentences the problem is how much of a mess it comes out in the end when you really piece it all together look at the first verse in\nthe first song on this album audibly it flows but it makes zero sense metaphorically and it keeps changing themeaning it's trying to get across we're in a bad spot we have to work together to move forward that's a good message in\na song the lines make no sense at all in describing this situation constantly though you are a brick dragging me down you're a jack-o-lantern lining up the sky here comes the tide put on your war paint it's like they took the nearest\nbook just flip through a random page andpulled out words and lines and just madea verse out of it you're not laying Brady you can't do that I repeat that I really don't think this song is bad but lyrically it's just a lot to take in and\nit doesn't make much sense a lot with a lot of repeated phrases and ants Kermit sounded like they were played through digital audio modifying soft where they found online that adds up to one big problem it's not rock and roll\nit's just not I mean I get that Fall Out Boy's considered a pop rock band but it's 100% pop at this point it's like calling Kid Rock rock or country for rap or calling anything - Kid Rock does actual music looks like this isn't rock\nmy songs know what you did in the dark is the big song from the album that was the first thing Fall Out Boy fans heard after their quote hiatus in instantly shot up the charts at NASA today has been certified five times platinum for a\nsingle that is huge most rock bands have trouble getting a single to go gold let alone five times platinum the members of Fall Out Boy collectively said that this I was the most representative of the album it's the best representation and\nheart of save rock and roll I still have trouble saying the name as for the song itself it really kind of echoes the same things I said about the Phoenix stump sounds fine vocally and there's a hook that's easy to get into the issue is\nhaving instruments in chords sound like they were programmed and coded as opposed to scrubbed and played compile that with another oddly worded anti love song with a conflicting message and you have the Fall Out Boy standard it's not\na bad song it's just not Rock it's hot completely it'd be fine if this album was called safe pop which it probably should have been now that I think about it millions of sales tons of usage on TV programs and lyrics about hating the\nperson you love but needing them in your life written like they were set by someone drunk on sudafed that hasn't left his typewriter in a month and with all that you have what millions of lovestruck girls and nostalgic fanboys\ncrave is it bad no but it's labeled as rock which it's not I think that's why Fall Out Boy's so polarizing also that and they have lyrics that really make you question the relationships these guys have been in\nand what some of their fangirls that our teenagers really want to hear about okay I'm starting to get the point about the whining now while it's definitely not to the level of simple plan whining it's really sinking in on why Fall Out\nBoy can be seen on the levels of whining entitled adolescent complaints these are broken heart ballads about being in love with someone you shouldn't be even close to but you keep trying anyway not saying it's a bad subject to sing about but for\nevery song with wildly random lyrics it comes off a bit the odd it's the whole live journal writing style of making your problems something bigger than they are but at least teens on LiveJournal would\ntry to explain situations instead of riding in one line proces that barely connect to each other no one will ever understand how I feel about her it's not my fault I'm a maniac she treats me like a stallion she loves it when I'm broken\nlast night we were alone together than today at school she spit my face when her friends were around this is the road to ruin stop smothering me the song doesn't sound bad and it has a nice beat the chorus with the chanting yeah sounds\nnice it also sounds as far away as rock though as Celine Dion does it's produced as pop and that's fine if that's what they want but hiding it under the banner of rock makes zero sense I know I've said this isn't rock a lot so far but\nthis album keeps giving me examples to reinforce that thought see what I mean happy really any better example than that let's show it one time for the new viewers that number to our songs to try\nto pass off Lala's Nonna's and Dooku's as legit lyrics the electronic beat and rhythm sound good and Patrick Stump doesn't sound bad on the mic it really doesn't come off as something people could hate but anyone that calls this\nrock let alone something that could save rock and roll needs to clean the Greer's out with bleach lyrically the track does sound more like an actual cohesive song that you can actually follow along with the problem there are more na na Na's in\nthis song than the Nana Nana Nana insults song on a playground even with the NHANES I can still see that Fall Out Boy was at least trying to do something with this track but these bad romance songs are really getting repetitive save\nrock and roll should have just been titled save me from the psycho girl anything you say yes to policy was that a pick-up line hang on a second turns out that's definitely a pick-up\nline and a lame one at that the pacing and dynamic steady beat compliment everything in this track and even though I laugh the pickup line there actually is some good riding in here I'm convinced that the lion I trade all my\ntomorrows for just one yesterday will be a line in a teenage romance comedy someday do you see what I mean now about the album not being Rock though after every song it feels a little more like it goes further into radio pop\nsing-along anthems follow poi have always had elements of that but a song like this really enforces it also that pickup line about anything you say can be held against you is really weak come on even be cheesy 100% with your pickup\nline or don't even try there's way better pickup lies out there than that how do you save rock and roll bring in a rapper for your pop song makes sense if you don't think about it for one second my\nthe mighty fall doesn't really have much in terms of bringing something to the table I actually have one for bringing in someone into a song if they really contribute something different but in this case it feels like it's just\nextending a track for a verse that doesn't even need to exist in the first place lyrically it's about the same as the other tracks unless I missed something yeah yeah I'm a big girl a big dancer\nyou what hell yeah my dig girl a big dance you stupid freakazoo okay this track actually feels like they decided not to play their instruments inside digital effects and a tone finder it sounds quick and it's easy to get\ninto I mean it's not rock and it's not great but it's better than the other songs on here I mean it this song is not some bad at all miss missing you could have been turned into a rock track it has the writing structure of in and it's\nas close to pop hunt that Fall Out Boy gets on this album the problem though is that it gets repetitive fast and there's really no change up in the rhythm or chord for over three minutes assuming a real guitar was actually used in the\nrecording of this I won't deny that there's a sense of fun to be had while listening because there definitely is an upbeat vibe even if the song sounds likemorbid Valentine's Day cards but the writing is becoming more shallow almost\nlike stumping company we're running out of fortune cookie lines about love you know who's good at pop rocker alt pop but still feel like they belong at a rock category walk the moon listen to both of their albums you'll see just how\ntalented they are while being upbeat and having a lot of generic pop lyrics that aren't very deep it still has a lot of fun to listen to though and you can hear just how talented the guitar and rhythm section are even a band like AWOLNATION\nwhich uses a lot of effects with their instruments and their latest album run is quite a bit softer still feels much more like an alternative rock band I mean jeez even the California Dreams have more rock and roll than this. the vocals sound awful it's like a bad auto-tune program what the heck happened here the singing truly sounds terrible it has a bad reverb and it sounds like it's being sang through a White Castle Drive through speaker box there actually is a two second guitar chord melody though I'd call it a solo but you know two seconds isn't exactly a guitar solo and about a minute left in the track everything devolves into a bad dance\nclub remix it's like they made their own song but decided they had to make it just a touch more douchey so college campus dorm room so it has something to play while guys and pop collars could try to impress a girl they just met I\ncould at least make an argument for the other songs on the album so far but Death Valley sucks I mean it's a low point for this album as low as Death Valley I'm bad with puns it just sucks okay there's no way this saw was meant\nto be taken seriously as a pop rock anthem this was made specifically for some company to buy it out and use it in their commercials really think about it just imagine a target commercial playing this in the background that hasn't been\nwhat this was for play some of this in front of a target commercial and it blends right in I can't believe they played this on the radio without people changing the channel not because it sucks but because people would\ninstinctively think it's a commercial beginning this is a simple light-hearted song but it also feels pretty light in meaning and depth this feels like filler why was chosen as a single I'll never know the last couple songs and now this\none have now made it more clear that they couldn't even make a full pop album that sounded good we're nine tracks in and I don't expect any rock at this point I mean this was the triumph at Fall Out Boy return where are the big\nguns what are they really gonna pull in to save this thing it's corny bitch you brought in Courtney Love okay first of all in my humble opinion the phrase a featuring Courtney Love is never a good thing\nRatatat had potential take out Courtney Love and change up the chorus and you can totally feel a rock vibe in this song in fact if save rock and roll would have been written in this style I think a lot of people would not have regarded\nthis as Fall Out Boy's worst we finally get something that feels like rock I can't deny it with the bassline it has a punk buy but then the lyrics about bad love and the chorus don't do justice with what this song could be\nCourtney Love just kind of uh rants over the song and it actually kind of ruins the track just like Fred Durst into that Aaron Lewis live song it feels more like pop rock or at least it's in the category kind of it's still bad I mean\nthe slogs a mess but at least it's a little bit more rock I don't know and also on a side note having save rock and roll by bringing in Courtney Love might be the worst idea ever you got Elton John\nI knew the economy was bad in 2011 but I didn't think everyone needed an extra payday hearing those opening piano notes by Sir Elton John is kind of surreal it's not something I would have ever expected on a Fall Out Boy album the\nbuild-up is gorgeous and you hear a little more delivery and emotion and stumps Wars than just the same embellishment that's been pretty flat line through the second half of this album as for a title track it's great\neven the lyrics about saving rock and roll in the chorus sound good but slow and melodic and the added string section sound great and when Elton John starts singing even just for a little bit it caps off the album but again after\nCourtney Love I'm pretty sure anyone sounds good I honestly could see myself listening to the song again with the whole chanting lyrics if we don't know when to quit really are fun to get behind and Elton's contribution is great\nand that's what puts the exclamation mark of what I've been saying this entire review this is a pop album and an 11-track album there is roughly one song namely this title track that feels like something a rock band would want to\nlisten to and even this track doesn't feel like rock at its core despite the lyrics there might be a fast bassline or energetic build in the opening song but that's it the rest is as poppy is Radio Disney like I said before they're going\nto be a lot of diehard Fall Out Boy fans who see this video title and comment without listening to anything I say I get that but when it comes down to it the album is OK the first how the album has some good pop songs for sure but\nthen it gets pretty old hearing the same style and beat thrown some guest musicians and somehow they saved rock and roll I don't think I possess enough sarcasm to really go on about how they saved rock and roll again when Fall Out\nBoy came back in 2011 a lot of people lost and had high hopes and for many of their fans they were still happy with the result I kind of get why - because not everything that follow boy has done since 2011 has been completely wretched\nthe big factor in that though is that they have changed whether it's a new direction or they just evolve or they decided they could cash in easier on Bad Romance songs that they are targeted outside of the rock audience the result\nis that Fall Out Boy is a pop band now but even after all that this is not the worst thing I've ever heard there are some saving moments on it it's just not Rock and that's fine but don't tell people it's rock that's\nwhy this is worth we're grey even for Fall Out Boy fans Fall Out Boy has done better than this also whether you like the band or not I think you can agree with that there mid-2000 days actually represented alt rock in a fashion and\nwhile I stand by they are very overrated I still don't think they are terrible but despite that this album still falls into the category of openly supporting an album the second it comes out just because it's from a band people love in\nthis case you make it the bait and switch from what you expect rock and roll wasn't said's because it didn't need saving especially from Fall Out Boy we should regret when a band no matter how popular loved sells us on\nwhat they are going to do and then do something not even close as a result in this case being rock this album isn't terrible neither is Fall Out Boy but I do think Fall Out Boy is one of the most overrated bands in a long time they are\nput on a high pedestal for very generic and odd sounding pop rock especially with the writing which I do agree there should be a Triforce of whining and after an album like this kind of hard to deny that they don't belong in there but\nyou like Fall Out Boy like them I can kind of see the appeal for some people but there's one thing we can all agree on we need to: stop asking Courtney Love to make music!\n[Cue a Hole performance, with only Courtney's isolated guitar and vocals during \"Celebrity Skin\"]\n\nPeople paid money to hear that?!\n\n[Some more painful seconds of

sick\n[Verse 1]\nHe was doing 8-0 on the freeway\nIn the 6 double O, bumping Islay\nHe was getting kind of close, kind of touch-ay\nBecause he had a little too much Hennessy\nHe told me that he wanna go home\nWith me up on the hill to my condo\nTold me he would keep it all on the low-low\nBut I told him, \"Boo, I don't really know though\"\nHe got closer to me, it started getting deep\nHe had me in a zone\nWhen he started to show me things I never saw before\nBaby was smooth, but I knew it was game\nHell-of-a cool, but you men are the same\nThe way he licked his lips and touched my hips\nI

Shady please stand up?\nI repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?\nWe're gonna have a problem here...\n\n[Verse 1]\nY'all act like you never seen a white person before\nJaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door\nAnd started whoopin' her ass worse than before\nThey first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)\nIt's the return of the \"Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding\nHe didn't just say what I think he did, did he?\"\nAnd Dr. Dre said\u2026 nothing, you idiots!\nDr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)\nFeminist women love Eminem\n\"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him\nLook at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what\nFlippin' the you-know-who,\" \"Yeah, but he's so cute though\"\nYeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose\nBut no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms\nSometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose\nBut can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose\n\"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips\"\nAnd if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss\nAnd that's the message that we deliver to little kids\nAnd expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is\nOf course, they're gonna know what intercourse is\nBy the time they hit fourth grade\nThey've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?\nWe ain't nothin' but mammals\u2014well, some of us, cannibals\nWho cut other people open like cantaloupes\nBut if we can hump dead animals and antelopes\nThen there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope\nBut if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote\nWomen, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes\u2014\n[Chorus]\nI'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWill Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)\nWell, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!\nYou think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?\nHalf of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me\n\"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?\"\nWhy, so you guys could just lie to get me here?\nSo you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?\nShit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs\nSo I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst\nAnd hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first\nLittle bitch put me on blast on MTV\n\"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee\"\nI should download her audio on MP3\nAnd show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)\nI'm sick of you little girl and boy groups\nAll you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you\nAnd there's a million of us just like me\nWho cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me\nWho dress like me; walk, talk and act like me\nAnd just might be the next best thing, but not quite me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you\nThings you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room\nThe only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all\nAnd I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all\nI just get on the mic and spit it\nAnd whether you like to admit it, I just shit it\nBetter than ninety percent of you rappers out can\nThen you wonder: \"How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?\"\nIt's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty\nI'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting\nPinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens\nAnd I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working\nIn every single person there\u2019s a Slim Shady lurking\nHe could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings\nOr in the parking lot, circling, screaming, \"I don't give a fuck!\"\nWith his windows down and his system up\nSo will the real Shady please stand up\nAnd put one of those fingers on each hand up?\nAnd be proud to be outta your mind and outta control\nAnd one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?\n[Chorus]\nI'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\n[Outro]\nHa ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us\nFuck it, let's all stand up!\n[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]430Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/122487", "artist_names": "Robbie Williams",

Should I blast myself?\nI'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black\nMy stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch\nCops give a damn about a negro\nPull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero\n\"Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?\nOne less hungry mouth on the welfare\"\nFirst ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers\nGive 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other\n\"It's time to fight back,\" that's what Huey said\nTwo shots in the dark, now Huey's dead\nI got love for my brother\nBut we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other\nWe gotta start makin' changes\nLearn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers\nAnd that's how it's supposed to be\nHow can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh\nI'd love to go back to when we played as kids\nBut things change, and that's the way it is\n[Chorus: Talent]\n(Come on, come on)\nThat's just the way it is (Changes)\nThings'll never be the same\nThat's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)\nAww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)\n(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)\nThat's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)\nThings'll never be the same\n(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)\nThat's just the way it is (Way it is)\nAww, yeah (Come on, come on)\n[Verse 2: 2Pac & Talent]\nI see no changes, all I see is racist faces\nMisplaced hate makes disgrace to races\nWe under, I wonder what it takes to make this\nOne better place, let's erase the wasted\nTake the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right\n'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight\nAnd the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)\nIt takes skill to be real, time to heal each other\nAnd although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)\nIt ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact\nThe penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks\nBut some things will never change (Never change)\nTry to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)\nNow tell me, what's a mother to do?\nBein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)\nYou gotta operate the easy way\n\"I made a G today,\" but you made it in a sleazy way\nSellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), \"I gotta get paid\" (Oh)\nWell hey, well that's the way it is\nYou might also like[Chorus:

is)\nAww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)\n\n[Interlude: 2Pac]\nWe gotta make a change\nIt's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes\nLet's change the way we eat\nLet's change the way we live\nAnd let's change the way we treat each other\nYou see, the old way wasn't workin'\nSo it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac & Talent]\nAnd still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?\nIt's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)\nInstead of war on poverty\nThey got a war on drugs so the police can bother me\nAnd I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do\nBut now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)\nDon't let 'em jack you up, back you up\nCrack you up and pimp-smack you up\nYou gotta learn to hold your own\nThey get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone\nBut tell the cops they can't touch this\nI don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this\nThat's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool\nMy mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)\nAnd as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped\nAnd I never get to lay back\n'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback\nSome buck that I roughed up way back\nComin' back after all these years\n\"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,\" that's the way it is\n[Chorus: Talent & 2Pac]\n(Uh)\nThat's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nThings'll never be the same (Yeah)\nThat's just the way it is (The way it is)\nAww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)\n(I'm tryna make a change)\n(You're my brother, you're my sister,

Lyrics[Intro: Nicole]\nA few questions that I need to know\nHow you could ever hurt me so\nI need to know what I've done wrong\nAnd how long it's been going on\nWas it that I never paid enough attention\nOr did I not give enough affection?\nNot only will your answers keep me sane\nBut I'll know never to make the same mistake again\nYou can tell me to my face\nOr even on the phone\nYou can write it in a letter\nEither way, I have to know\nDid I never treat you right?\nDid I always start the fight?\nEither way, I'm going out of my mind\nAll the answers to my questions, I have to find\n[Verse 1: Melanie & All]\nMy head's spinning\nBoy, I'm in a daze\nI feel isolated\nDon't wanna communicate\nI'll take a shower, I will scour\nI will roam\nTo find peace of mind, the happy mind\nI once owned, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Shaznay]\nFlexing vocabulary runs right through me\nThe alphabet runs right from A to Z\nConversations, hesitations in my mind\nYou got my conscience asking questions that I can't find\nI'm not crazy\nI'm sure I ain't done nothing wrong, no\nI'm just waiting\n'Cause I heard that this feeling won't last that long\n\n[Chorus: All]\nNever ever have I ever felt so low\nWhen you gonna take me out of this black hole?\nNever ever have I ever felt so sad\nThe way I'm feeling, yeah, you got me feeling really bad\nNever ever have I had to find\nI've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind\nI've never ever had my conscience to fight\nThe way I'm feeling, yeah, it just don't feel right\nNever ever have I ever felt so low\nWhen you gonna take me out of this black hole?\nNever ever have I ever felt so sad\nThe way I'm feeling, yeah, you got me feeling really bad\nNever ever have I had to find\nI've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind\nI've never ever had my conscience to fight\nThe way I'm feeling, yeah, it just don't feel right\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Melanie & All]\nI'll keep searching\nDeep within my soul\nFor all the answers\nDon't wanna hurt no more\nI need peace, gotta feel at ease\nNeed to be\nFree from pain, I'm going insane\nMy heart aches, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Shaznay & All]\nSometimes vocabulary runs through my head\nThe alphabet runs right from A to Z\nConversations, hesitations in my mind\nYou got my conscience asking questions that I can't find\nI'm not crazy\nI'm sure I ain't done nothing wrong\nAnd now I'm just waiting\n'Cause I heard that this feeling won't last that long\n\n[Chorus: All]\nNever ever have I ever felt so low\nWhen you gonna take me out of this black hole?\nNever ever

kissed goodbye\nAll our \"I love you\"s were just not enough to survive\nSomething your eyes never told me\nBut it's only now too plain to see\nBrilliant disguise when you hold me\nAnd I'm free\n\nI've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude\nSometimes the distance is more than two people can use\nBut how could I have known girl\nIt was time and not space you would need\nDarling tonight I could hold you and you would know\nBut would you believe\nThere's a light in your eyes that I used to see\nThere's a place in your heart where I used to be\nWas I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me\nThere's a light in your eyes\nDid you leave that light burning for me\n\nCards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you\nConstant reminder of all the things you get used to\nIs there a chance in Hell or Heaven\nThat there's still something here to build on\nOr do you just pick up the pieces after they fall\nBut after all\n\nThere's a light in your eyes that I used to see\nAnd a song in the words that you spoke to me\nWas I wrong to believe in your melody\nThere's a light in your eyes\nDid you leave that light burning for me\n\nShould I keep on waiting or does love keep on fading away\nFading away\n\nIt's been a while since I've seen you so how have you been\nDid you get my letter I wrote you that I did not send\nI tried to call your old number\nBut the voice that I heard on the phone\nI recognized but she told me the number was wrong\nYou might also likeThere's a light in my eyes it's too bright to see\nAnd a pain in my heart where
