got a touch of Tuesday Weld\nShe's wearing Ambush and a French twist\nShe's got us wild and she can tell\nShe loves to limbo, that much is clear\nShe's got the right dynamic for the new frontier\n[Hook]\nWell I can't wait 'til I move to the city\n'Til I finally make up my mind\nTo learn design and study overseas\n\n[Verse 2: Fagen]\nDo you have a steady boyfriend\nCause honey I've been watching you\nI hear you're mad about Brubeck\nI like your eyes, I like him too\nHe's an artist, a pioneer\nWe've got to have some music on the new frontier\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Hook]\nWell I

love\nJumped up, fell back, cut off from romance\nHow could I fall without a shove?\n\nTip-toed like thunder on my feeling\nYou rock me gently with your sighs\nMy knees are weak, my head is reeling\nConsumed by the fire in your eyes\n\nDon'tcha know why?\nGoodness no! Why?\nStepped in and shattered my defenses\nJust playing hooky with my heart\nSlipped through the window by the back door\nAnd took the keys to my poor heart\nYes, my poor heart\n\nOh!\nTry as I might, try as I may\nYes, I'll try anything to make you stay\n'Cause I need your love\nYes, I need you, love\nYes, I need your love\nOh, I need you, love\n\nI'm looking high, I'm looking low\nCan't find where did my baby go\nGotta find out why she ran away\nI don't know, where did my baby stay?\nTry as I might, try as I may\nI'll try anything to make you stay\n\nFire down the Boulevard d'Amour\nShot through the neon in the night\nHotfoot through alleys, check the doorways\nTry that old parking lot on Ninth\nThere's three-course kissing in the same place\nOh, but that don't help me out no more\nI've been away so long, I'm dreaming\nLittle girl, ain't I seen you before?\n(Oh, little girl)\nYou might also like[Outro guitar solo]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

people called it self-deceiving\nBut my heart helped me hold the memories\n\nAs I walk through the world I find around me\nSomething new yet familiar's in the air, I feel it everywhere\nLike a child's eyes on a Christmas night\nI'm looking at you now, finding answers to my prayers\n\nIt's a new day for those good old dreams\nOne by one it seems they're coming true\nHere's the morning that my heart had seen\nHere's the morning that just had to come through\nSame old stage but what a change of scene\nNo more dark horizons only blue\nIt's a new day for those good old dreams\nAll my life I've dreamed of loving you\n\nYou're a spark of a long forgotten fire\nYou're a touch of a slowly growing wind\nYou're a taste of the ever changing seasons\nTelling me there are some things that don't end\n\nWe have left all the darkness far behind us\nAll those hopes that we held along the way, have made it to this day\nLike an old love song, gone for much too long\nYou hear it once again and it carries you away\n\nIt's a new day for those good old dreams\nOne by one it seems they're coming true\nHere's the morning that my heart had seen\nHere's the morning that just had to come through\n\nSame old stage but what a change of scene\nNo more dark horizons only blue\nIt's a new day for those good old dreams\nAll my life I've dreamed of you\n\nIt's a new day for those good old dreams\nAnd it's all because of youYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1337462", "artist_names": "Leif Garrett", "full_title": "Runaway Rita

up at me and say she was lonely\nI don't understand the world today, I don't understand what she needed\nI gave her everything, she threw it all away on nothin'\n\n[Chorus 1]\nShe's a woman in love, she's a woman in love\nAnd he's gonna break her heart to pieces\nShe don't wanna see\nShe's a woman in love, but it's not me\n\n[Outro]\nShe's a woman in loveYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type":

go away from this city\nWe'll go back, girl, back to our home\nSome day I promise I'll take you\nCause so far away we've roamed\n\nAnd the bells, they will ring\nFrom the mountain through the

a party and this fella said to me\n\"Something bad is happening, I'm sure you do agree\nPeople care for nothing, no respect for human rights\nEvil times are coming, we are in for darker nights\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI said, \"Who are you to talk about impending doom?\"\nHe got kinda wary as he looked around the room\nHe said, \"I'm a minister, a big shot in the state\"\nI said, \"I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great\nBrother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?\"\nHe said, \"Keep on rocking baby, till the night is gone\"\n[Chorus]\nOn and on and on\nKeep on rocking baby, till the night is gone\nOn and on and on\nTill the night is gone\nOn and on and on\nKeep on rocking baby, till the night is gone\nOn and on and on\nTill the night is gone\n\n[Verse

And this, Episode Twelve is the final week, final episode of Season One of this podcast.\nIt\u2019s been a year since I first contacted Adnan and I\u2019m still talking to him regularly. I\u2019m still asking him the basics, still thinking, I dunno, that he\u2019ll remember something or maybe he\u2019ll just get so frustrated with me that he\u2019ll crack.\nI still want to know what you were doing that afternoon. I want to know who had your phone and I want to know what you were doing that afternoon.\nAdnan Syed\nI don\u2019t remember anything more.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThis is from Saturday night, just this past Saturday. I mean we\u2019re down to the wire here.\nOh man.\n\nAdnan Syed\nSo you don\u2019t really have, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, you don\u2019t really have no ending? Like it\u2019s just--\n\nSarah Koenig\nI mean, do I have an ending? Um...\nOf course I have an ending. We\u2019re going to come to an ending today. Plus, a smattering of new information, a review of old information cast under a different light and an ending. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, my thoughts about Adnan\u2019s case, about who is lying and why, have not been fixed over the course of this story. Several times, I have landed on a decision, I\u2019ve made up my mind and stayed there, with relief and then inevitably, I learn something I didn\u2019t know before and I\u2019m up ended. Sometimes the reversal takes a few weeks, sometimes it happens within hours. And what\u2019s been astonishing to me is how the back and forth hasn\u2019t let up, after all of this time. Even into this very week and I kid you not, into this very day that I\u2019m writing this. Because I\u2019m learning new information all the time.\nFor instance, I talked to Don. Eight months ago he told me he did not want to talk to me for this story and then last week he talked to me for this story. He didn\u2019t want me to use tape of his voice or his last name but he said I could use what he said. Spoiler here: Don does not appear to know what happened to Hae, or why it happened to her, or whether Adnan is guilty. But it was interesting to hear what he said he remembered about the day Hae disappeared and about her and about the trial. Here\u2019s what he told me. Don said Hae was at his house in a town north of Baltimore City on the night of January 12, the night before she went missing. He said she wanted to spend the whole next day with him too. She wanted him to call Woodlawn High School and pretend to be some authority figure, tell the office Hae couldn\u2019t be in school that day. She wanted it to be an excused absence rather than just plain hooky. But he didn\u2019t. He says he thought she should go to school and besides, he told her he had to work the next day at 9am. It was supposed to be his day off from the LensCrafters at the Owings Mills Mall where they both worked, but Don said he arranged to fill in for a friend at the store in Hunt Valley. Don said he and Hae had made plans to meet up later that night of the 13th after her work shift ended at 10 p.m. When the cops recovered Hae\u2019s car there was a note inside with Don\u2019s name on it. \u201cHey cutie, sorry I couldn\u2019t stay. I have to go to a wrestling match at Randelstown High, but I promise to page you as soon as I get home, ok? Till then, take care and drive safely. Always, Hae.\u201d In a P.S. on the note, Hae mentions a tv interview that had been taped that day. The local station had done a student athlete segment on her. So the note was written on the 13th, the day she went missing. This note was one of the reasons I\u2019d initially written to Don, way back when. \u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t stay,\u201d is confusing. I didn\u2019t understand what she\u2019d planned to do with the note, put it on his car maybe, but his car was so far away in Hunt Valley. But the note stumped Don too. He said he didn\u2019t know about it until I sent it to him and he didn\u2019t have a guess as to what her plan was for that afternoon. When Hae went missing, Don was one of the first people the cops called. He says he knew immediately he\u2019d be a suspect. He said, \u201cthat was the first thought when they said she\u2019s missing. I said, \u2018well ok, they\u2019re going to try to blame it on me because she was with me last night. I\u2019m the new boyfriend, I\u2019m obviously going to be one of the first suspects, me and Adnan.\u2019\u201d He said he immediately made sure he knew where he was. \u201cWhen someone calls you up and tells you \u2018have you seen this person? They went missing, they haven\u2019t been seen since school,\u2019 you automatically retrace everything you did that day. Did I see them, did I hear from them, did they page me, did they call me, where was I at this time, what was I doing at that time, yeah.\u201d\nMaybe you\u2019re all noting, as I did, that that wasn\u2019t Adnan\u2019s stated reaction to getting called by the cops on the 13th. I\u2019m tempted to make a judgment right here, but I\u2019m going to pull a benefit of the doubt because Adnan was seventeen, he was stoned, he\u2019s a different person, but noted, right? Also note however, there was one similarity in how they reacted to Hae\u2019s disappearance. You know how Adnan says he doesn\u2019t remember calling Hae after the 13th? Guess who else doesn\u2019t remember trying to call Hae after the 13th - Don. Like everyone else, he said he wondered whether maybe she\u2019d gone to California, she\u2019d told him her father lived there. He says it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t think about what had happened or didn\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just that he didn\u2019t know what to do. Don\u2019s alibi was solid. His computer generated time card said he\u2019d arrived at work at 9:02 a.m. on the 13th, taken lunch from 1:10 to 1:42, clocked out at 6 p.m. But Don\u2019s manager at the Hunt Valley store was his Mom, so that didn\u2019t look great. Don said he was anxious throughout the investigation.\n\u201cThey never, up until the day they arrested Adnan, I had no idea what was going on\u201d he said. \u201cThey never said you\u2019re cleared as a suspect. It was left hanging and until they arrested him I had no idea. I suspected they might try to say we were in on it together. I didn\u2019t know Jay existed until I started listening to the podcast.\u201d\nDon had met Adnan once. According to Hae\u2019s diary it was December 23. It was a snowy day and she had a minor car accident on the way into work and she\u2019d called Adnan to come help her out. They were broken up by this time but he came to the rescue. In the parking lot outside LensCrafters, Adnan and Don converged. Hae writes, \u201cDon and Adnan took a look at my car and told me not to drive it unanimously. Ah! Mommy is going to be so mad. But I swear it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d\nDon told the cops back then that he and Adnan had a perfectly nice conversation. At trial he said Adnan said something to him like \u201cok, well, I just want to make sure you\u2019re an ok guy.\u201d Don told me the same. \u201cWe sat and talked and just as everyone else described him, he was very polite, articulate, just really the typical what you\u2019d expect of the ex-boyfriend meeting the new boyfriend, sizing each other up. We joked, we spent a good 10-15 minutes talking after we checked out the car.\u201d At trial, for whatever reason, this episode is firmly timestamped as having happened in January, after Hae and Don had started dating, though it\u2019s clear from the diary it was December 23rd. In any case, Don\u2019s testimony at both trials, he\u2019s the State\u2019s witness, is milquetoast. He just says, \u201cyeah, I met him, it was cordial.\u201d Which made me wonder why the State even called Don and according to Don, prosecutor Kevin Urick might have been wondering the same thing. Don said, \u201cwhen I testified, they pulled me in a back room and let me tell you how fun that was, to have the prosecutor afterwards yelling at me because I did not make Adnan sound creepy,\u201d he said, \u201cthey wanted me to make him sound creepy. So creepy that I felt intimidated, which I did not. Adnan, he was very personable. He was funny, he was everything I already said. He was somebody that I would have hung out with if I knew him in school.\u201d Don\u2019s memory is that Urick yelled at him after both the first and second trials. \u201cOh, he was irate\u201d Don said, \u201cwhen I say yelling, he was literally yelling about it at me.\u201d I ran this by Kevin Urick but he said he was not authorised to talk about the case.\nDon says he loved Hae, that he still loves her. It\u2019s not something that goes away he said. Even though they only officially dated for thirteen days, he says she meant a lot to him. She was totally unshy he said, confident. She pursued him, he said, for all of December whenever she saw him at work, he said she\u2019d ask him when he was going to take her out. Constantly she asked him, followed him into the lunch room on his break, pestered him. He was dating someone else at the time but then that ended and so on New Year\u2019s Eve they made their first date for the next day. He fell for her pretty quickly he says. \u201cYou could not not like this girl. She was aggressive, intelligent, assertive is a better word than aggressive. Generally nice person. Anything I\u2019ve heard anybody say about her since, it\u2019s not like \u2018oh I don\u2019t want to talk bad about the dead,\u2019 it\u2019s just being honest. It\u2019s hard for me to explain. If you didn\u2019t like her, you didn\u2019t like her because she was so likeable. But then you couldn\u2019t even be annoyed by her because she wasn\u2019t annoying. She was charming.\u201d\nDon said Hae actually changed him, changed the way he thought about himself. He said he\u2019d come off a couple of bad relationships, girls who had cheated on him. \u201cShe basically in no uncertain terms told me to knock it off,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I\u2019m worth, that I have worth. I don\u2019t remember the words she used. I can\u2019t paraphrase it at this point but I am worth having self esteem, that I should think that I am good enough, and I took it to heart, especially after I found out that she had died.\u201d\n\nJosh\nI\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m throwing it so late in the game here, but I didn\u2019t even know that this existed until Friday.\n\nSarah Koenig\nYeah, that ok, no that\u2019s ok, that\u2019s ok.\nHere\u2019s another guy I just heard from, and speaking of him, all of a sudden I was hearing Jay\u2019s perspective. Or at least this guy\u2019s perspective of Jay\u2019s perspective.\nJosh\nHe was scared. I mean, like terrified.\nSarah Koenig\nThis guy\u2019s name is Josh. He asked that I not use his last name. He said he worked with Jay at South West Video, the porn store. Josh was twenty-one at the time. They weren\u2019t close friends he said, but Josh would give Jay rides and they\u2019d smoke weed together, hang out a little bit. Josh said that on the night that Jay was first picked up by the cops, so late at night on February 27 and into the morning of the 28, Jay called him at home and asked him to come into the store because he didn\u2019t want to be alone there. He was that scared.\nJosh\nHe was, I mean, frightened out of his mind and not of the police. They were the secondary fear. I mean, he was afraid of going to jail, but not like he was afraid of-- Adman, I guess is how you say his name, I don\u2019t know.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAdnan?\n\nJosh\nAdnan, that\u2019s it.\n\nSarah Koenig\nJosh says Jay actually never told him Adnan\u2019s name, but Josh has listened to the podcast so he knows the name now. But back then, he didn\u2019t. He says Jay told him he was afraid that people were after him. People connected to the murderer.\nJosh\nAcross the street from the video store was a parking lot for the Amtrak commuter trains. And the parking lot was usually empty in the evening. Well, that particular night there was a van in that parking lot, which I\u2019m pretty positive had nobody in it, but Jay was afraid. I mean, to the point-- he was almost in tears.\n\nSarah Koenig\nYeah.\n\nJosh\nHe didn\u2019t want to go outside, he didn\u2019t even want to look out the door because he really thought the van that was across the street was people waiting to get him.\n\nSarah Koenig\nBut the people you\u2019re talking about, is it only in retrospect that you\u2019re thinking it\u2019s Adnan\u2019s people, or did he say that to you at the time?\n\nJosh\nOh no, he said it. He said it was-- I guess Adnan, had threatened him.\nSarah Koenig\nRight, but you\u2019re saying that you didn\u2019t know, he never told you the name of the person. I\u2019m just trying to imagine is it possible that it was somebody else entirely who he was afraid of.\n\nJosh\nYeah, I guess it could have been but whoever he was afraid of is obviously the person that committed the crime.\n\nSarah Koenig\nRight, but so I\u2019m saying did you-- did he express to you at the time that this was a person with Pakistani relatives--\n\nJosh\nYeah.\n\nSarah Koenig\nOh, he did, he said that at the time?\n\nJosh\nYeah, he definitely said it was somebody, the guy was Middle Eastern.\nSarah Koenig\nJosh says Jay told him it was the ex-boyfriend who\u2019d killed Hae. It was Josh\u2019s impression that Jay had called the cops himself that night, because he told Josh the cops were coming to get him, and he seemed anxious that it was taking them so long to get there. Josh says Jay was pacing, checking his watch, that he kept asking him to look outside to see if the van was still there. At trial, Jay testifies that the cops showed up at the video store on their own, that he didn\u2019t know they were coming. In his taped interview with the police that same night, February 28, Jay doesn\u2019t mention a white van, or that he\u2019s terrified of Adnan\u2019s people. But he does tell the cops that he\u2019s talked to Adnan either yesterday or the day before and that Adnan was threatening him in a general way. Here\u2019s tape from that February 28 interview. Detective Ritz talks first.\n\nDetective Ritz\nWhen was the last conversation you had with Adnan?\n\nJay\nI think it was either yesterday or the day before.\n\nDetective Ritz\nThe most recent conversation you had with him, what was the content of that conversation?\n\nJay\nI learned that you guys were looking for me.\nDetective Ritz\nHow did you learn that?\n\nJay\nPeople told me. Friends of mine told me you guys were coming to question me. So I went to him and said, \u201cwhat did you get me wrapped up in?\u201d and he just told me, \u201cjust calm down, everything will be ok.\u201d\nDetective Ritz\nWhere did this conversation take place?\n\nJay\nI believe it was in front of my house in (inaudible) Park.\n\nDetective Ritz\nOther than you saying, \u201cwhat the fuck did you do? Why did you get me wrapped up in this?\u201d what did he say?\n\nJay\nHe just told me, \u201cain\u2019t nothing that happened. They don\u2019t know shit,\u201d and \u201cstay cool.\u201d\n\nDetective Ritz\nIs there anything else said during that conversation?\n\nJay\n(pause) He told me that he knew somebody. (pause) I used to be involved in a lot of illegal activity and people on the West Side-- basically the gist of what he told me was that he knew the West Side hitman. So I wouldn\u2019t call it a threat, but he was letting me know.\nDetective Ritz\n--in a roundabout way that if you said something to the police that--\n\nJay\nYeah, because I told him, if they come to me I ain\u2019t going to fuck around, I\u2019m just going to tell them what the gig is, and he was like, \u201cyou know who I know.\u201d That\u2019s what he said to me.\n\nSarah Koenig\nOK, so the West Side Hitman? It\u2019s so strange, I find Josh\u2019s version of Jay\u2019s fear so much more believable than Jay\u2019s version of Jay\u2019s fear. Which makes me wonder if it\u2019s all just in the delivery. When Jay first told Josh weeks before that he knew something about the missing girl who was all over the news, Josh says he didn\u2019t believe him.\nJosh\nI said something about him not really being involved and then he\u2019s like, \u201cno man, you don\u2019t understand, I helped to bury the body.\u201d It seemed like he was kind of bragging, I mean that\u2019s kind of the guy that Jay was. It\u2019s not that he bragged about stuff that he did, sometimes he made up things that he didn\u2019t do and so that\u2019s kind of what I thought he was doing. Why would you say that, why would you tell somebody that you really don\u2019t know that well-- and I guess it\u2019s why I didn\u2019t believe him. If I had done it, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have told me.\n\nSarah Koenig\nRight.\n\nJosh\nMaybe my best friend or something like that, but not not somebody that you work with at a porn store.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThe version of the crime that Josh says Jay eventually told him, it\u2019s pretty close to the version that Jay\u2019s friend Chris told me too. That Jay was out somewhere and that Adnan came to him and showed him the body and said something to the effect of \u201cyou gotta help me.\u201d Josh says he can\u2019t remember where Jay said he was when this happened, but he is certain the words \u201cBest Buy\u201d were never attached to the story. Josh went to that Best Buy all the time and he says he definitely would have remembered that. He said when he heard in the podcast that Chris had mentioned the pool hall thing, that sounded right to him but he can\u2019t say for sure. Josh says he also had the impression, like Chris, that it had all gone down later in the day, not mid afternoon. Josh says at first, Jay seemed afraid the cops were going to figure out he was involved through fingerprints or DNA or something, but that as time went on he seemed more and more afraid of the guy who did it, that he was threatening Stephanie. It was, \u201cyou\u2019d better keep your mouth shut or else.\u201d He says Jay told him the threats were getting more forceful. To Josh, Jay was so not the type to be involved in a murder. Maybe he tried to act tough he said, but he wasn\u2019t. He said he himself had friends who got in serious fights or who\u2019d been locked up for grand theft auto, but Jay was not in that category at all he said. He was a nice guy.\nJosh\nHe wasn\u2019t the type of guy that you really got the sense he could do something real. He wasn\u2019t a killer and he wasn\u2019t a thug. If anything, he was kind of the opposite. He seemed like he was in way over his head.\nSarah Koenig\nYeah.\n\nJosh\nI remember feeling bad for him.\n\nSarah Koenig\nWas there any point-- I mean I don\u2019t mean to sound judgy or something, but was there any point where you\u2019re like \u201cwell, you should go tell the cops then, if you know who did this. Go tell the cops.\u201d\nJosh\nNo, not really. I know that\u2019s probably what I should have said but I didn\u2019t really believe him and like I said, when it comes to reputation, on the street you don\u2019t want to be the guy that\u2019s \u201coh, go snitch.\u201d You don\u2019t want anybody to see you\u2019re weak and all that stuff and so I didn\u2019t ever say go to the cops because that would be like the bitch thing to do.\nSarah Koenig\nJosh says what never quite made sense to him, what he never entirely understood was why Jay would help Adnan bury Hae.\n\nJosh\nEven if I didn\u2019t call the cops, I definitely wouldn\u2019t grab a shovel and help him dig a grave.\n\nSarah Koenig\nRight, I know. I know, I know. That\u2019s what\u2019s hard about the story is that you just figure there\u2019s something that\u2019s not computing here.\n\nJosh\nIt definitely never sounded right which is why I never believed him until the cops actually picked him up.\n\nSarah Koenig\nJosh says he only remembers seeing Jay one more time after that, he thinks maybe Jay came by the store to pick up his check and when Josh asked him, \u201cso what happened?\u201d Josh says Jay told him he couldn\u2019t talk about it.\nIn preparation for this episode, Julie and Dana, the producers of this show, went back over everything we had. All the police files, the attorney files, the interviews I\u2019ve done, the cell records. They did one final sweep just to be sure we\u2019d weighed everything and because old details can have startling new meaning after a year\u2019s worth of research is behind us. They came across a couple of things they wanted me to know.\nFirst and foremost, the Nisha call. I\u2019d asked them, \u201cis there any other viable explanation for the Nisha call on Adnan\u2019s cell record?\u201d Here\u2019s Julie.\n\nJulie Snyder\nWe\u2019d always been under the impression that the Nisha call was a no-way-around-it call.\nSarah Koenig\nIt looks terrible for him.\n\nJulie Snyder\nIt looks terrible for him and it\u2019s 2 minutes and 22 seconds.\nSarah Koenig\nTo remind you, the Nisha call is the one that happens at 3:32pm on January 13. It\u2019s to that girl that Adnan has been flirting with who lived near Silver Spring. The Nisha call is the one that\u2019s always stuck out to me and I think to most people who\u2019ve looked at Adnan\u2019s case closely because it happens on the afternoon that Hae disappeared at a time when Adnan has said, insisted even, that he was not with his phone, that Jay had his phone while he was in school. Jay had told the detectives that Adnan had called some girl in Silver Spring that afternoon and briefly put Jay on the phone with her. That\u2019s why the call is so important. Not only does it put Adnan together with his phone in the middle of the afternoon, it puts Adnan together with Jay in the middle of the afternoon. It corroborates Jay\u2019s story. I\u2019ve always had some suspicion about this call because Nisha said to the cops and at trial that there was a day when Adnan put his friend Jay on the phone, but Nisha has consistently said it happened toward the evening at the video store where they worked. Jay didn\u2019t have the video store job on January 13. He started that job at the end of the month. So I never bought the idea that the thirteenth was the day she talked to Jay. But even so, it didn\u2019t look good for Adnan because who was calling Nisha in the middle of the afternoon then? Jay didn\u2019t know Nisha. So for me this call has remained one of the pillars of the case against Adnan. That\u2019s what Julie means when she says \u201cno way around it.\u201d But now, I think the Nisha call might be moving from the \u201cno way around it, this looks bad for Adnan\u2019 column\u201d into \u201ceh, now I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d Adnan says that Nisha\u2019s number was programmed into his cellphone, so he\u2019s always said to me, \u201cmaybe the button got pushed accidentally, like a butt dial and then the answering machine picked up.\u201d The problem with that explanation besides how convenient it sounds for Adnan is that there was not answering machine on that line. That\u2019s what Nisha says at trial. This call shows up not just on the call log but on Adnan\u2019s AT&T bill. He got charged for it. So this was our quest, or really Dana and Julie\u2019s quest: to find out, is it possible that this call would have shown up on Adnan\u2019s bill even if it went unanswered. This proved so elusive, first we got one answer, then another, then another, then another. AT&T was not helping us, then finally, Dana and Julie figured out exactly what they needed to answer this question. An AT&T customer service agreement circa 1999. They found one, in a class action lawsuit against AT&T that included as an exhibit, the very document we needed.\n\nJulie Snyder\nLuckily that class action lawsuit was filed in New York so Dana was able to go down to the--\n\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s the photo you sent.\n\nDana Chivvis\nThat\u2019s the Old Records Department of the New York Supreme Court or something like that, yeah.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThat\u2019s so awesome. It looked like the Mad Hatters archive room. Were you the first humanoid who\u2019d come down in like fifteen years? (laughing)\n\nDana Chivvis\nYeah, they were like, \u201cwhat news do you bring?\u201d\n\nJulie Snyder\nSo Dana goes down there, pulls the service agreement, takes pictures of the contract, sends the first picture, the first picture says on the contract, it says \u201cwe do not bill for unanswered calls.\u201d\n\nSarah Koenig\nOh!\nMeaning the Nisha had to have been answered because it shows up on the bill. But there was fine print to the fine print. When Dana flipped through to the last page of the contract she found a loophole. The loophole says AT&T won\u2019t charge for unanswered calls unless the call isn\u2019t terminated within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d So if you call someone and it rings and rings and you don\u2019t hang up within a \u201creasonable time,\u201d AT&T will charge you for that call even if it\u2019s unanswered. So what is a reasonable amount of time, or rather, an unreasonable amount of time? That loophole actually still exists today and the unreasonable amount of time today is thirty seconds or longer, they\u2019ll charge. We saw one contract from \u201899 that specified sixty seconds or longer, so it stands to reason that two minutes were probably covered. They probably did charge. The folks at AT&T told us the only reason a contract would have varied back then in \u201899 was if the State had passed particular legislation to address it. We didn\u2019t find anything in the Maryland rules about it, so after all this work we feel pretty confident that AT&T would have charged for a call that rang and rang for more than two minutes in Maryland in 1999.\nSo either way if it\u2019s two minutes and twenty-two seconds it\u2019s probably unreasonable.\n\nJulie Snyder\nIt\u2019s probably unreasonable.\n\nDana Chivvis\nThat seems unreasonable\n\nSarah Koenig\nIt an unreasonable amount of time to be listening to a phone ring, I gotta say, without it being answered so (laughs)--\n\nJulie Snyder\nIt\u2019s an unreasonable amount of work going in trying to figure this out. (laughs)\n\nSarah Koenig\nI know that\u2019s a long and perhaps way too detailed way of explaining it but all this adds up to something important. It means the Nisha call could conceivably have been a butt dial that no one answered. It means there isn\u2019t only one explanation for the Nisha call. There are alternative scenarios. It could be that Adnan called Nisha, or it could be that Jay was with somebody else who called Nisha, or maybe Jay or someone else called Nisha by accident. A butt dial and no one was ever the wiser because no one ever picked up. If there are alternative scenarios, then that means the list of things we know, actually definitively know, facts we can show about the evidence against Adnan, that list just got shorter.\nIn a way the only hard evidence in the case against Adnan is his cellphone record for January 13. That\u2019s what the cops and prosecutor used to corroborate Jay\u2019s statements. So Dana and Julie looked at that same record all over again, the call log and the cell tower map, teased it all apart, to see if they could figure out what happened. To figure out if there was anything else I could know about what Jay and Adnan were doing that day. We\u2019ve talked about the call log a lot already, we already knew it didn\u2019t match Jay\u2019s explanations of where they went and when. But when Julie looked again, she realized, when she tried to assign the calls some semblance of a narrative, her picture of the day crumbled even more. Instead of answering any of her questions, the call log raised bigger ones, such as was everyone lying about that day?\nMy original question going into this whole endeavour, this whole story was either Jay\u2019s lying or Adnan\u2019s lying. But what if it\u2019s not either or, what if it\u2019s both and? The call log evidence is screwy right from the beginning. Jay said that when he met up that morning, when Adnan drove over to Jay\u2019s to give him his car, they\u2019d gone shopping at the mall. Adnan has said various things, but not that they went shopping. What seems most likely according to what Adnan told his attorney at the time is that Adnan hung out with Jay until about 12:45-1:00 p.m. and then went back to school. There\u2019s a 12:07 call and a 12:41 call. The first pings a tower out west in Ellicott City. The next pings a tower back east toward Baltimore City. They\u2019re pretty far apart from each other. Here\u2019s Julie.\n\nJulie Snyder\nGoing to Ellicott City, and then going into Baltimore City, where the phone is pinging off of Edmonson Avenue area, which is actually near drug strips where Hae\u2019s car was dumped. That sort of area of Baltimore. That\u2019s not mentioned by Adnan. So, \u201cI don\u2019t remember what we did. I know we didn\u2019t go shopping. I\u2019m not really sure.\u201d I feel more concerned and suspicious-- I feel suspicious, of being like, \u201chuh,\u201d because I can see being-- I can see where the phone was moving. I know Jay\u2019s story about Security Square Mall is not true because of the phone, if they had the phone. But I don\u2019t think Adnan\u2019s is true either.\n\nDana Chivvis\nCan I also add that at one point, Jenn says to the detective that she remembers one of those phone calls she answered and talked to Jay and Jay had said that he was downtown with Adnan.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThe prosecutor at trial said, \u201cwe don\u2019t really know what they were doing, but it doesn\u2019t matter, because Hae was in school at that time. Alive.\u201d That\u2019s true. But still the phone record tells us that there\u2019s something they\u2019re not telling us. Why, and is it related to what happened later. The next call is the incoming 2:36 call. The supposed \u201cBest Buy\u201d call from the phone booth that we\u2019re pretty solidly convinced wasn\u2019t the \u201ccome and get me\u201d call.\nI do have something of an update there. We have not found evidence of a phone booth outside the Best Buy on the sidewalk, like Jay draws on his map for the cops. But we have now seen two anecdotal reports that there was a payphone inside the vestibule. We haven\u2019t been able to verify these reports, but we did get a look at the 1994 architectural plans for that Best Buy, and indeed on the plans there is a teeny little rectangle in the vestibule on the left as you walk in, labeled \u201cpayphone.\u201d So, maybe there was one. Inside.\nAnyway, back to the call log. Julie spent a long time thinking about the 3:21 call. It opened a whole new mystery for her, because it\u2019s confusing on about three different levels. It\u2019s an outgoing call, from Adnan\u2019s cell to Jenn\u2019s house phone. Jay and Jenn both talk about some call that afternoon that comes into her landline. Someone supposedly looking for Jay.\n\nJulie Snyder\nJenn says she remembers Jay getting phone calls while he was at her house. Jay says he remembers getting phone calls while at the house. Both of them also reference a landline call. Jay says, \u201cI get a call on the landline, and that\u2019s when I leave.\u201d\n\nSarah Koenig\nMeaning, right? This incoming landline call is Adnan calling in looking for Jay.\n\nJulie Snyder\nWhy would Adnan be calling you on the landline? The whole point of him giving you the cell phone was so that he could call you on the cell phone. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. But there is a 3:21 call made from the cell phone to Jenn\u2019s house.\nSarah Koenig\nHere\u2019s the second confusing thing. Jay eventually told the cops the 3:21 call was a call he made. To Jenn asking if she knew whether this guy Patrick was around. Jay was looking for weed from Patrick. Jenn, by the way, testified this never would have happened, that Jay would never call her asking about Patrick, but anyway. Here\u2019s the third thing. The confusing kicker. Both Jay and Jenn also say Jay was at Jenn\u2019s house until about 3:45 p.m. that day.\n\nJulie Snyder\nThat also has always confused me. If Jay is at Jenn\u2019s house until 3:45, how is he calling Jenn\u2019s house at 3:21? Why would he be calling the house that he\u2019s sitting in it?\n\nSarah Koenig\nUnless Adnan has the phone.\n\nJulie Snyder\nUnless Jay doesn\u2019t have the phone. I\u2019m not saying who has the phone. I have no idea who has the phone. But it leads me to believe that there is the possibility that Jay doesn\u2019t have the phone.\n\nSarah Koenig\nSo what\u2019s the evidence that Jay does have the phone? Jenn tells the police that she saw Jay with the phone that afternoon. She has an image of the cell phone in her mind sitting on the coffee table at her house. But at 3:21, the tower that\u2019s pinged isn\u2019t the one that covers Jenn\u2019s house. If Jay doesn\u2019t have the phone though, then who has the phone? More to the point, if Jay doesn\u2019t have the phone, then what was going on that afternoon? Then I have no idea what was going on.\nThere are discrepancies unresolved like this all throughout the afternoon and evening right up until the end of the night when there\u2019s a big one. We noticed it right at the beginning, and while Adnan\u2019s attorney does bring it up at trial, no one dwells on it too long. But it\u2019s odd. Jenn and Jay tell different stories about where she picked him up on the night of the thirteenth, and about where and when they got rid of Jay\u2019s clothes and boots. Jenn says she picked Jay up at Westview Mall, where she saw Adnan too. Jay says, that didn\u2019t happen. He says, she picked him up at his house, and that he dumped his clothes that same night, the thirteenth, the first time he tells it, he says he threw them out in the trash at his own house. But Jenn say, she and Jay tossed his clothes in some dumpsters the next day, though there would have been a terrible ice storm happening, but maybe. Anyway, pretty different stories.\nJulie Snyder\n--and it hasn\u2019t been reconciled. They actually both kinda dig in on it.\nSarah Koenig\nYeah, I know.\n\nJulie Snyder\n--admit to it. Somebody is wrong, and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s an oversight. But I cannot work my head around what is the-- what is the lie that is minimizing what?\n\nSarah Koenig\nRight. What\u2019s the utility of which lie?\n\nJulie Snyder\nYeah. What\u2019s the utility of which lie? Yeah.\n\nSarah Koenig\nYou can apply that same question, \u201cwhat\u2019s the utility of which lie?\u201d to this entire case. There\u2019s so much that is murky, all you can do at a certain point is speculate, and believe me, we have. Dana and Julie and I speculate about all sorts of things. Like crazy we speculate. Rest assured that in the privacy of our office, we\u2019ve turned over every possibility, no matter how remote. 99% of what we speculate I cannot report, because, well, we can\u2019t back it up, it\u2019s speculation. But here\u2019s one I can tell you we\u2019ve recently discussed. We loop-de-looped all the way back to motive. I know I dismissed the motive the state supplied way back in episode two but we put it back on the table, just to see where it took us. Here\u2019s where we got.\nWe\u2019ve always said Adnan was over the breakup. It had been a month already. But just for arguments sake, let\u2019s say he wasn\u2019t over it. Adnan and Hae had broken up and gotten back together a few times. When they break up in mid-December, maybe Adnan thinks she\u2019ll change her mind again. They\u2019re still friendly; several people said to me they couldn\u2019t tell or didn\u2019t even know that Hae and Adnan had broken up, or said that Adnan was still referring to her as his girlfriend or said he told them they\u2019d get back together. Don said he never quite knew what the deal was between them. But judging from Hae\u2019s diary, by January, her romantic feelings are completely absorbed by Don. Remember their first date is January 1. But maybe Adnan didn\u2019t feel the full force of how she\u2019d moved on until they got back to school, after Christmas break. Here\u2019s what Dana realized recently. That first week of school, in \u201899, Adnan was absent two out of four days. Then Friday was a snow day. So maybe he doesn\u2019t get it, that he\u2019s really lost Hae until that first or second week back at school. Here\u2019s Dana.\n\nDana Chivvis\nMaybe that\u2019s when reality sets in for him and maybe that\u2019s when-- yeah. Maybe that\u2019s when the emotions hit him.\n\nSarah Koenig\n--and so does kinda lose it.\n\nDana Chivvis\n--and so maybe he does kinda lose it.\n\nSarah Koenig\nBut who else says this? Not one of Hae\u2019s or Adnan\u2019s friends whom I spoke to says they saw it like this at the time. They don\u2019t even speculate, now that they\u2019re adults, that maybe it could have been like this. So who are we to put this theory forward? This is the very obvious problem with speculation especially of the emotional variety. You can\u2019t prove it, so you have to drop it.\nSo where does this leave us? There\u2019s no point in trying to come up with a most likely scenario for what happened to Hae, because you could posit a hundred scenarios and so what? Bereft of more facts, better facts, even the soberest most likely scenario holds no more water than the most harebrained. In the equation of Adnan\u2019s case, all speculation is equally speculative. So instead of most likely, how about most logical? Dana has always been very logical about Adnan\u2019s case. She\u2019s the Mr. Spock of our staff. Her thing is, \u201cokay! Let\u2019s say he didn\u2019t do it. But if he didn\u2019t do it, then my god that guy is ridiculously unlucky.\u201d I\u2019m going to let her lay it out.\n\nDana Chivvis\nAdnan has always said it was his idea to loan Jay the car because he wanted Jay to go get Stephanie a birthday present, right? So, that\u2019s pretty crappy luck that you loaned this guy, who ends up pointing the finger at you for the murder that you loaned him your car and cell phone the day your ex-girlfriend goes missing. The next thing is that it seems pretty clear to me that Adnan asked Hae for a ride after school, because we\u2019ve got at least two of their friends saying they overheard him ask for a ride from Hae. Adnan himself tells the cop that day he asked her for a ride. In Jay\u2019s first interview with the detectives, he says to them: \u201cAdnan\u2019s plan was to get in Hae\u2019s car by telling her that his car was broken down and asking her for a ride.\u201d\nThen the next piece of bad luck is the Nisha call. I mean, even if the Nisha call could potentially be a butt dial, in the realm of possibility, maybe it was a butt dial, but what are the chances? That sucks for you that your phone butt dialed a girl that only you know and would call on this day that your ex-girlfriend goes missing that you happen to loan your car and your phone out to the guy who ends up pointing the finger at you. That sucks. Then the last thing that I think really sucks for him if he\u2019s innocent is that Jay\u2019s story and the cell phone records match up from about six o\u2019clock to about eight o\u2019clock which is when Jay is saying you are burying the body, and that\u2019s the time of the day you just have no memory of where you were. You have your dad saying you were at the mosque, and maybe Bilal your youth leader--\n\nSarah Koenig\nWho never testifies.\n\nDana Chivvis\n--who never testifies at the trial, but testifies at the grand jury, that--\n\nSarah Koenig\nHe says he saw him after dark at the mosque on the thirteenth.\n\nDana Chivvis\nBut you, Adnan, you don\u2019t really remember where you were that evening, and that blank spot in your memory, that\u2019s the window of time when Jay\u2019s story actually does seem to be corroborated by the cell phone records.\n\nSarah Koenig\nSeem to be corroborated, yes. But Jay\u2019s statement only roughly matches the Leakin Park calls and eight o\u2019clock calls. Really roughly. The geography matches, but not the timing. But, I take her point.\n\nDana Chivvis\nSo I guess, it just-- in order to make him completely innocent of this, you just have to think \u201cGod, that is-- you had so many terrible coincidences that day. There were so many-- you had such bad luck that day, Adnan.\u201d\nSarah Koenig\nA lot of people see it this way. All of us on staff have heard from people who say just so quickly, \u201coh yeah, he\u2019s totally guilty. News flash. People lie in murder cases. On the witness stand. Whoopdeedoo.\u201d We worried. Did we just spend a year applying excessive scrutiny to a perfectly ordinary case? So we called Jim Trainum back up. He\u2019s the former homicide detective we hired to review the investigation and we asked him, \u201cis Adnan\u2019s case unremarkable? If we took a magnifying glass to any murder case, would we find similar questions, similar holes, similar inconsistencies?\u201d Trainum said no. He said most cases, sure they have some ambiguity, but overall, they\u2019re fairly clear. This one is a mess he said. The holes are bigger than they should be. Other people who review cases, lawyers, a forensic psychologist, they told us the same thing. This case is a mess.\nWhile we\u2019ve been rabbit-holeing in our office, back out in the world, those lawyers from the University of Virginia Law School\u2019s Innocence Project Clinic have been coming up with their own most logical explanation, which couldn\u2019t be more different from Dana\u2019s. I haven\u2019t reported anything about it to now, but over the weekend there was a development of sorts, so now I can tell you. Deirdre Enright and her students have a motion in the works to test the DNA from Adnan\u2019s case that wasn\u2019t tested. The PERK kit, that\u2019s the swabs from Hae\u2019s body, the material from under her fingernails, the hairs found on her body. In a motion like this you have to give a viable reason to test this stuff. You have to show how it could potentially exculpate you and Deirdre\u2019s reason is, she thinks the DNA might match some other guy. The path to one of these other guys started way back when Dana and I went down to Charlottesville last February. Mario, one of her students, started looking online for possible signs of a serial killer basically. I\u2019d already told him about another strangling of a young woman who was also found in a Baltimore park, different park, and one thing led to another and he came upon yet another case. A cold case.\nMario\nI stumbled upon a website that categorized all the unsolved murders in Baltimore County and she was there.\n\nSarah Koenig\nDo you remember her name? I know your computer\u2019s not open now.\n\nMario\nI unfortunately do not remember--\n\nSarah Koenig\nWas it Annelise--\n\nMario\nHer last name was Lee.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAnnelise Hyung Suk Lee. I believe she was also Korean. She was twenty-seven when she was killed, strangled in her apartment in Owings Mills. She was found on December 13, 1999, exactly eleven months after Hae disappeared. I could see why Mario was interested.\n\nSarah Koenig\nSo, will you look into that now?\n\nMario\nAh, absolutely.\n\nSarah Koenig\nThen, months later I got a message to call Deirdre. She said she had huge news.\n(Phone ringing) oh please pick up.\n\nDeirdre Enright\nDeirdre Enright\n\nSarah Koenig\nHey it\u2019s Sarah.\nDeirdre Enright\nSarah! (sing-songy)\nSarah Koenig\nHer huge news and this is attorney huge, not necessarily reporter huge, but anyway. The news was that she\u2019d spoken to someone in the Baltimore County Police Department to ask about this unsolved case of Annelise Lee.\n\nDeirdre Enright\nSo I\u2019m going to tell you quickly because I have to get on this call at 2:30.\n\nSarah Koenig\nOK.\n\nDeirdre Enright\nBut I called sergeant something--\n\nSarah Koenig\nSergeant Something told her that they now had a suspect for this Owings Mills case from 15 years ago. They tested some old DNA and a match came back to this other guy who\u2019d done other crimes, mostly burglaries.\n\nDeirdre Enright\nHe said my guy was in prison a lot. He said he had a really tiny window of being out and about and he was very active while he was out and about. So, he said during that time that he was out we linked him to two rapes and a murder and the motives in all of them appeared to be burglary but he\u2019d always had sex with people.\nSarah Koenig\nOK.\n\nDeirdre Enright\n--and he said that he got out and became active for fourteen months, his release date was January 1, \u201899.\nSarah Koenig\nOh my God.\n\nDeirdre Enright\nRight?\n\nSarah Koenig\nSo, what\u2019s his name?\n\nDeirdre Enright\nHe wouldn\u2019t tell me his name.\n\nSarah Koenig\nOh for crying out loud.\n\nDeirdre Enright\nBut he accidently referred to him as Ronald--\n\nSarah Koenig\nAnd did he bury his victims?\n\nDeirdre Enright\nHe, I didn\u2019t, I think he felt like he was telling me too much already.\n\nSarah Koenig\nYeah yeah yeah yeah--\n\nSarah Koenig\nDeirdre later learned this guy\u2019s name was Ronald Lee Moore. Ronald Moore is dead now, he killed himself. But it seems like he committed lots of crimes. He\u2019d been in prison in Baltimore for a while on assault and burglary convictions and according to a Baltimore Sun article, in 2007 he was supposed to get transferred to a different jail in Anne Arundel County so he could be prosecuted for a different crime but the Baltimore officials released him by accident. He was arrested about a month later in Louisiana for burglary. They figured out who he was and that he was wanted back in Maryland. Anyhow, this is the guy the Baltimore County cops linked through DNA to the death of Annelise in Owings Mills. This is the guy that Deirdre and her gang are naming in their motion to test the DNA from Adnan\u2019s case. It\u2019s a long shot that there will be anything testable in those samples and it\u2019s a long shot that if there is, it\u2019ll match anyone but Hae, and most long shotty of all that if it does match someone else, that someone else happens to be Ronald Lee Moore. When I said that to Deirdre though, as I have several times, she always shoots right back, \u201cwhat makes mores sense? That little seventeen-year-old, never been in trouble with the law Adnan killed someone or that Ronald Moore, rapist and murderer who got out of prison thirteen days before Hae disappeared, that he killed someone?\u201d \u201cRight, I know,\u201d I say, \u201cBut what about Jay? He knew where Hae\u2019s car was. He had to be involved. How does that account for Jay?\u201d Deirdre says, \u201cBig picture Sarah, big picture.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Adnan\u2019s post conviction petition is still alive in the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. His attorney, Justin Brown, is working on a way to bring the issue of the Asia alibi before the court again. I spoke to Asia recently. She told me she stands by her memories of seeing Adnan that January afternoon in the public library and she stands by her affidavit. For post conviction purposes, Asia\u2019s alibi is still a big deal. It sure would seem to point to ineffective assistance of counsel. It\u2019s funny though, knowing what we now know about the State\u2019s garbled timeline and that Hae was maybe still alive at 2:45 or 3:00 p.m., Asia\u2019s library alibi doesn\u2019t pack the same punch for me as it once did.\nDeirdre and Justin Brown have been giving Adnan conflicting advice lately about how best to proceed, what to push for and when. But on Saturday Adnan finally gave Deirdre the go ahead to file the motion to test DNA. It was an emotional decision for him.\n\nAdnan Syed\nIt\u2019s just anything about my case, I want to know it. I don\u2019t want anyone to be able to say \u201cwell he didn\u2019t want to know so boom, we went and found out.\u201d No, I want to know. So I called Miss Deirdre and said \u201cLook Miss Deirdre, I wanted you to test things. I\u2019m the one that asked for this. You guys had it sitting for sixteen years and you never tested it. It\u2019s impossible for it to be sitting there for sixteen years and you guys never tested it. So that\u2019s fine, I want it tested.\nSarah Koenig\nYeah.\n\nAdnan Syed\nI want to see what it says. There\u2019s nothing about my case that I\u2019m afraid of.\nSarah Koenig\nSo back to Adnan\u2019s question. Do I have an ending?\nAdnan Syed\nI was just thinking the other day, I\u2019m pretty sure that she has people telling her, \u201clook, you know this case is-- he\u2019s probably guilty. You\u2019re going crazy trying to find out if he\u2019s innocent which you\u2019re not going to find because he\u2019s guilty.\u201d I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever have one hundred percent or any type of certainty about it. The only person in the whole world who can have that is me. For what it\u2019s worth, whoever did it. You know you\u2019ll never have that, I don\u2019t think you will.\n\nSarah Koenig\nAdnan told me all he wanted was to take the narrative back from the prosecution, just as an exercise. So people could see his case without makeup on, look at it in the eye up close and make their own judgments. He told me, he doesn\u2019t think I should weigh in.\n\nAdnan Syed\nI think you should just go down the middle. I think you shouldn\u2019t really take a side, I mean, it\u2019s obviously not my decision it\u2019s yours, but if I was to be you, just go down the middle. Obviously you know how to narrate it but I checked these things out and these are the things that look bad against him, these are the things that the State doesn\u2019t really have an answer for. I think in a way you could even go point for point and in a sense you leave it up to the audience to determine.\nSarah Koenig\nWhile I appreciate Adnan\u2019s blessing to take a powder, I\u2019m not going to. Dana\u2019s right to be skeptical. What are the chances that one guy got so unlucky? That everything lined up against him just so. Because yes, there\u2019s a police file full of information, circumstantial information that looks bad for Adnan. But let\u2019s put another file next to that one, side by side. In that second file let\u2019s put all the other evidence we have linking Adnan to the actual crime, the actual killing. What do we have? What do we know? Not what do we think we know, what do we know? If the call log does not back up Jay\u2019s story, if the Nisha call is no longer set in stone, then think about it. What have we got for that file? All we\u2019re left with is, Jay knew where the car was. That\u2019s it. That all by itself, that is not a story. It\u2019s a beginning but it\u2019s not a story. It\u2019s not enough, to me, to send anyone to prison for life, never mind a seventeen-year-old kid. Because you, me, the State of Maryland, based on the information we have before us, I don\u2019t believe any of us can say what really happened to Hae. As a juror I vote to acquit Adnan Syed. I have to acquit. Even if in my heart of hearts I think Adnan killed Hae, I still have to acquit. That\u2019s what the law requires of jurors. But I\u2019m not a juror, so just as a human being walking down the street next week, what do I think? If you ask me to swear that Adnan Syed is innocent, I couldn\u2019t do it. I nurse doubt. I don\u2019t like that I do, but I do. I mean most of the time I think he didn\u2019t do it. For big reasons, like the utter lack of evidence but also small reasons, things he said to me just off the cuff or moments when he\u2019s cried on the phone and tried to stifle it so I wouldn\u2019t hear. Just the bare fact of why on earth would a guilty man agree to let me do this story, unless he was cocky to the point of delusion. I used to think that when Adnan\u2019s friends told me \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure if he\u2019s innocent, but the guy I knew, there\u2019s no way he could have done this.\u201d I used to think that was a cop out, a way to avoid asking yourself uncomfortable, disloyal, disheartening questions. But I think I\u2019m there now too. Not for lack of asking myself those hard questions, but because as much as I want to be sure, I am not.\nWhen Rabia first told me about Adnan\u2019s case, certainty, one way or the other seemed so attainable. We just needed to get the right documents, spend enough time, talk to the right people, find his alibi. Then I did find Asia, and she was real and she remembered and we all thought \u201chow hard could this possibly be? We just have to keep going.\u201d Now, more than a year later, I feel like shaking everyone by the shoulders like an aggravated cop. Don\u2019t tell me Adnan\u2019s a nice guy, don\u2019t tell me Jay was scared, don\u2019t tell me who might have made some five second phone call. Just tell me the facts ma\u2019am, because we didn\u2019t have them fifteen years ago and we still don\u2019t have them now.\n\nSerial is produced by Julie Snyder, Dana Chivvis and me.

of us runs from the fire light\n[Chorus]\nI would love to believe, I believe what you say\nIn the drama of the moment\nOh no, there is no easy way, no one ever leaves\nEveryone stays close until the fire fades\nI would love to believe, I believe what you say\nIn the drama of the moment\nOh no, there is no easy way, no one ever leaves\nEveryone stays close until the fire fades\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo be the last to leave what caused the fearsome\nDivorce in the night, there was no competition\nWell, to survive, do it right and you believe in the five\nTo survive the distance everyone fights\nEveryone fights and the fire flies\nWhat happened to my feelings\nWhen heartbreak comes in the night?\nSome call it my nightmare, my five fireflies\nWell, like a sailing ship on one of love's rocks, no one\n\n[Outro]\nOf our love affair like a whip through the air\nI would love to believe, I believe what you say\nFirefliesYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,

You little fuckin' shit stain\nHow you gonna make fun of anybody's haircut when you haven't taken your hat off since 5th grade?\nDude, look at you 'Cane\nYou look good dude\nGot a longer beard, bought some Caustic schemes\nYou're right on time, looks like you dressed up as your favorite rapper for Halloween\nWho wrote that bitch?\nFreestyle\nI said at the last event I was supposed to battle Bonnie, I was down for the scrap\nAt Battle Of The Sexes they offered 'Cane 40 B.A.R.R.S\nHe was like, \"Yeah...how much is that?\"\nYo, you were 33 when you battled Corey Charron\nThat was in 2010\nMy dude, you are confirmed: at least 40 years old\nYou're 40? You're 40\nNo\nYou're 40 years old\nStill tryin' to make it with music?\nI guess, at this age, gettin' a 30 dropped on you is a major improvement!\nSo 30 is the new 40, this kid is too corny, it's an instant vic-tory\nYou always makin' up lies, every week it's a different story\nIsn't it boring, bitch, you get animated, shit'll get gory\nI'm killin' this random fuckin' Pickle Rick Morty!!!\nSee, all those bars you spit for Chedda, that was shit I was never meant to sell\nAnd then, after Bargate came out, your little rap career got put up on the shelf\nI mean it makes sense, you had those IKEA bars\nEverything fell apart when you tried to put it together by yourself!\nOh, that's fire! What's wrong with y'all?\nOh my gawd, that's amazing!\nSo, go sit somewhere else, there ain't room at our table\nEverything happens for a reason, 'Cane\nYou know what the reason is? God hates you!\nI'm bringin' you back down to Earth\nI'll turn Arcane into archangel\nIf any of these fans bought that bullshit you sold 'em...surprise, they Arcane'd you\nYo, you can try to pull that shit on these casual-ass new jack fans\nAnd let these losers think you're Wolverine, when, truthfully, it's just a huge act, man\nIf you think all he bought was punchlines then shit will really fuck your head up\nCause check this out, Diz' was in on the shit the whole time bitch, the only thing you bought was a setup\nYo, you are fuckin' trash\nYou are fuckin' trash\nLook at your fuckin' life\nDude, I mean I was patient with him, waited for him to admit that it was blatant plagiarism\nBut instead he switched and played the victim and blamed all of y'all\nLike all of y'all put a gun to his head and made him pay for writtens\nThe fuck?\nActin' like I can't beat you\nAnd thanks to this contract and Organik, I'mma keep this rap peaceful\nBut the next time you decide to bite the hand that feeds you\nMake sure that it can't reach you\nBitch\n\n[Round 3: Arcane]\nI said yo, I could've predicted this clown was gonna start talkin' 'bout his hands early\nWell here's a free lesson; real bosses don't get they hands dirty\nI brought a room full of goons that's ready to stretch this man's jersey\nSo eat a dick you piece of shit I'm 'bout to fuckin' catch this damn 30\nI got your fate in my hands like I'm flippin' Tarot cards\nYou got flat lines I don't I don't hear no heart\nThey said, \"Watch it he spread gossip.\" I said, \"Let that weirdo prepare those parts\nHe needs gossip to compensate for havin' zero bars.\"\nI'm one of the great, I chop heads off and hung 'em on stakes\nIn that Grand Prix y'all seen me in one of my hungriest states\nAs far as Chedda, that was just somethin' I ate\nYou was starvin' watchin' me eat and you're lucky I tossed you a couple crumbs from my plate\nThen you battled Jefferson: what a fuckin' disgrace\nYou sold your soul for a priceless when Soul punched you in the face\nSo that's when I looked up his name in a thesaurus, and consider it luck\n\"Caustic\" is another word for \"bitter\", which makes sense 'cause you bitter as fuck!\nThat's why you doin' all this fuckin' extra shit tryin' to act more tough\nWell I brought a jackknife and a semi: that's a transport truck\nI'll park that Mac on his grill like a transport truck\nAnd if that don't kill him, the sixteen will like a transport truck\nC'mon man, y'all should've read the warning signs\n\"Caustic\" means \"slightly corrosive\"\nBut me? I write my best content under pressure, this material highly explosive\nNone of the bars he has are just poison and he just talks sick with his motives\nSo I came to mop the floor with Caustic make sure he gets properly disposed of\nSo I brought that rat poison cause he's the type to squeak and squeal\nAnd I brought my peoples to keep that steel if the beef gets real\nSo please just chill or this geek gets killed\nThis battle is about who's the better writer and this biter can't compete with skill\nSo if you wanna spar lyrically, you're no match for my artillery\nYour bars filler-y, I'm a killer with dark imagery\nGet scared physically\nIt's a violent story, your mining quarry better have the iron or be ready to start drillin' B\nI'm back ho\nYour lines aren't nothin' to get bowled over\nIf mine's bolder you get bowled over like a bull dozer\nGet it? Iron, ore, mines, boulder, back hoe, bulldozer\nStrip mine down into layers and y'all can see the gold closer\nI'm cookin'\nFor that chicken, I'mma spit like a slow roaster\nNo holster, the snub nose in the air, that's a cold shoulder\nI let one ring it rattle his cage like a goal poster\nHis wig get split and get pushed sideways like his combover\nAnd normally, I'm not the type to beef with critics\nI'm the type to burn your fuckin' house down to the ground with your family sleepin' in it\nThe last thing you'll see is me light the match to the kerosene and flick it\nTo be specific, if I take a trip out west it's not for scenic visit\nI'm focused player, you've been nothin' but smoke and mirrors your whole career, I'm so sincere\nYou don't got a leg to stand on, that's a broken chair\nWe don't compare\nYou was never even top 10, you on the lowest tier\nAnd I bet your buddies wrote more bars for this battle than you've wrote in years\nAnd when it comes to all your Fresh Coast pals, I've been known to roast your peers\nI took the chain from Dizaster and The Saurus when they were the most revered\nSo if the whole Fresh Coast writes for you then it's only fair\nFor that chain I'm on a lookout to keep in the 6ix, I just made sure his whole coast is clear\nMake some fuckin' noise y'all!\n\n[Round 3: Caustic]\nSo he said he's gonna kill my whole family\nThat's this dude keepin' it real wit me\nDude, with as many fuckin' verses as you've taken it makes sense you're from Steel City\nAye, do you guys remember when Drake was like actually at all these events?\nAnd you can see him in the crowd he's just fuckin' happy as it gets\nThere was no drama back then we were just rappin' with our friends\nThen you can see his face change as 'Cane gets exposed for being a massive piece of shit\nHe fuckin' grabbed his keys and dipped and we fuckin' haven't seen him since\nSo let's all congratulate him; Alex Drake, it's hip hop's known bitch\nBut don't feel bad kiddo at least you're not the only Drake in Canada that doesn't write his own shit\nIf he wants to dig up dirt me, he's just jealous cause I'm legendary\nIf I wanted to dig up dirt on him I'd walk to the cemetery where his mom and sister are buried\nOh my god, when it comes to this disrespect shit I swear to God I'm a visionary\nSo fuck your mother, bitch!\nYour mother puts the fuckin' \"bitch\" in \"obituary\"\nYo...this shit just got incredibly real\nLuckily for me, I don't fuckin' care how you feel\nBut we've been in this situation before, haven't we, Alex? So let's make a deal!\nI said you can try to sucker-punch, oh my God I'll fuck you up\nIf they dug your little sister up she wouldn't be the only thing that stiffened up\nOh, so what your mom died, Arcane? I don't give a fuck!\nYou want me to quit spittin' the rest of this round? That's an extra 500 bucks!\nI mean I don't know what else to say to you\nThey fuckin' died to get away from you!\nI wrote all your shit back in the day cause on your own you wasn't capable\nI mean let's face facts, half your fuckin' family died cause no one could relate to you\nI guess in the last five years not that much has changed for you\nI mean look at the fuckin' clothes that you've got on\nI mean you're so fuckin' underground Arcane, do you feel any closer to your mom?\nYo, this fuckin' idiot used to hit my inbox like, \"Yo Caustic look at all this shit I wrote for this bum.\"\nAnd I was like, \"No, no, no Alex...this is how it's supposed to be done.\"\nYo, this cat's been salty since before I got my title shot\nHis writing was shaky like Michael Fox, so he sent me paper like Michael Scott\nIt all makes sense why he needed so much assistance with his writer's block\nI guess when half your family's in a coffin, it's a little hard to think outside the box\nSo this is it for you my guy, this round right here is do or die\nIt's either you or I and I'm a sick piece of shit\nDude I'll commit suicide just to go to your fuckin' family in Hell and tell 'em you said \"hi\"\nI hope you find a condom in your next fuckin' bologna sandwich\nI hope you slip into a coma after you get diagnosed with melanoma and colon cancer\nI hope for the rest of your shitty-ass life, you open shows for local rappers\nI hope you can't take it one day, and you call a suicide hotline...and no one answers\nSo I did this round for all of y'all who thought homie was more than average\nI mean, it's five years after Bargate, and he's still trying to control the damage\nSo, no one here needs to feel bad for Little Orphan Alex\n'Cause I just lit this guy up like Aurora Borealis!\nTime, bitch!

smile and your hungry heart\nFeel the bile rising from your guilty past\nWith your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters\nAnd the hammers batter down your door\nYou better run!\n[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]\nRun, run, run, run\nRun, run, run, run\nRun, run, run, run\nRun, run, run, run\n\n[Verse 2: Roger Waters]\nYou better run all day and run all night\nAnd keep your dirty feelings deep inside\nAnd if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight\nYou better park the car well out of sight\nCause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks\nThey're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box\nYou better run!\n[Synth Solo]\n[Instrumental Outro]You might also like11Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5464012",

Hudson", "lyrics": "Hampshire Days (Chap. 1) LyricsHERE, by chance, in the early days of December 1902, at the very spot where my book begins, I am about to bring it to an end.\n\nA few days ago, coming hither from the higher country at Silchester, where the trees were already nearly bare, I was surprised to find the oak woods of this lower southern part of the New Forest still in their full autumnal foliage. Even now, so late in the year, after many successive days and nights of rain and wind, they are in leaf still: everywhere the woods are yellow, here where the oak predominates; the stronger golden red and russet tints of the beech are vanished. We have rain and wind on most days, or rather mist and rain by day and wind with storms of rain by night; days, too, or parts of days, when it is very dark and still, and when there is a universal greyness in earth and sky. At such times, seen against the distant slaty darkness or in the blue-grey misty atmosphere, the yellow woods look almost more beautiful than in fine weather.\n\nThe wet woodland roads and paths are everywhere strewn, and in places buried deep in fallen leaves\u2014yellow, red, and russet; and this colour is continued under the trees all through the woods, where the dead bracken has now taken that deep tint which it will keep so long as there is rain or mist to wet it for the next four or five months. Dead bracken with dead leaves on a reddish soil; and where the woods are fir, the ground is carpeted with lately-fallen needles of a chestnut red, which brightens almost to orange in the rain. Now, at this season, in this universal redness of the earth where trees and bracken grow, we see that Nature is justified in having given that colour\u2014red and reddish-yellow\u2014to all or to most of her woodland mammals. Fox and foumart and weasel and stoat; the hare too; the bright squirrel; the dormouse and harvest-mouse; the bank-vole and the wood-mouse. Even the common shrew and lesser shrew, though they rarely come out by day, have a reddish tinge on their fur. Water-shrew and water-vole inhabit the banks of streams, and are safer without such a colour; the dark grey badger is strictly a night rover.\n\nSometimes about noon the clouds grow thin in that part of the sky, low down, where the sun is, and a pale gleam of sunlight filters through; even a patch of lucid blue sky sometimes becomes visible for a while: but the light soon fades; after mid-day the dimness increases, and before long one begins to think that evening has come. Withal it is singularly mild. One could almost imagine in this season of mist and wet and soft airs in late November that this is a land where days grew short and dark indeed, but where winter comes not, and the sensation of cold is unknown. It is pleasant to be out of doors in such weather, to stand in the coloured woods listening to that autumn sound of tits and other little birds wandering through the high trees in straggling parties, talking and calling to one another in their small sharp voices. Or to walk by the Boldre, or, as some call it, the Lymington, a slow, tame stream in summer, invisible till you are close to it; but now, in flood, the trees that grow on its banks and hid it in summer are seen standing deep in a broad, rushing, noisy river.\n\nThe woodpecker\u2019s laugh has the same careless happy sound as in summer: it is scarcely light in the morning before the small wren pours out his sharp bright lyric outside my window; it is time, he tells me, to light my candle and get up. The starlings are about the house all day long, vocal even in the rain, carrying on their perpetual starling conversation\u2014talk and song and recitative; a sort of bird-Yiddish, with fluty fragments of melody stolen from the blackbird, and whistle and click and the music of the triangle thrown in to give variety. So mild is it that in the blackness of night I sometimes wander into the forest paths and by furzy heaths and hedges to listen for the delicate shrill music of our late chirper in the thickets, our Thamnotrizon, about which I shall write later; and look, too, for a late glow-worm shining in some wet green place. Late in October I found one in daylight, creeping about in the grass on Selborne Hill; and some few, left unmarried, may shine much later. And as to the shade-loving grasshopper or leaf cricket, he sings, we know, on mild evenings in November. But I saw no green lamp in the herbage, and I heard only that nightly music of the tawny owl, fluting and hallooing far and near, bird answering bird in the oak woods all along the swollen stream from Brockenhurst to Boldre.\n\nThis race of wood owls perhaps have exceptionally strong voices: Wise, in his book on the New Forest, says that their hooting can be heard on a still autumn evening a distance of two miles. I have no doubt they can be heard a good mile.\nBut it is of this, to a bird lover, delectable spot in the best bird-months of April, May, and June that I have to write. The house, too, that gave me shelter must be spoken of; for never have I known any human habitation in a land where people are discovered dwelling in so many secret, green, out-of-the-world places, which had so much of nature in and about it. Grown-up and young people were in it, and children too, but they were girls, and had always quite spontaneously practised what I had preached\u2014pet nothing and persecute nothing. There was no boy to disturb the wild creatures with his hunting instincts and loud noises; no dog, no cat, nor any domestic creature except the placid cows and fowls which supplied the household with milk and eggs. A small old picturesque red-brick house with high-pitched roof and tall chimneys, a great part of it overrun with ivy and creepers, the walls and tiled roof stained by time and many-coloured lichen to a richly variegated greyish red. The date of the house, cut in a stone tablet in one of the rooms, was 1692. In front there was no lawn, but a walled plot of ground with old once ornamental trees and bushes symmetrically placed\u2014yews, both spreading and cypress-shaped Irish yew, and tall tapering juniper, and arbor vitae; it was a sort of formal garden which had long thrown off its formality. In a corner of the ground by the side of these dark plants were laurel, syringa, and lilac bushes, and among these such wildings as thorn, elder, and bramble had grown up, flourishing greatly, and making of that flowery spot a tangled thicket. At the side of the house there was another plot of ground, grass-grown, which had once been the orchard, and still had a few ancient apple and pear trees, nearly past bearing, with good nesting-holes for the tits and starlings in their decayed mossy trunks. There were also a few old ivied shade-trees\u2014chestnuts, fir, and evergreen oak.\n\nBest of all (for the birds) were the small old half-ruined outhouses which had remained from the distant days when the place, originally a manor, had been turned into a farm-house. They were here and there, scattered about, outside the enclosure, ivy-grown, each looking as old and weather-stained and in harmony with its surroundings as the house itself\u2014the small tumble-down barns, the cow-sheds, the pig-house, the granary with open door and the wooden staircase falling to pieces. All was surrounded by old oak woods, and the river was close by. It was an ideal spot for small birds. I have never in England seen so many breeding close together. The commoner species were extraordinarily abundant. Chaffinch and greenfinch; blackbird, throstle, and missel-thrush; swallow and martin, and common and lesser whitethroat; garden warbler and blackcap; robin, dunnock, wren, flycatcher, pied wagtail, starling, and sparrow;\u2014one could go round and put one\u2019s hand into half-a-dozen nests of almost any of these species. And very many of them had become partial to the old buildings: even in closed rooms where it was nearly dark, not only wrens, robins, tits, and wagtails, but blackbirds and throstles and chaffinches were breeding, building on beams and in or on the old nests of swallows and martins. The hawfinch and bullfinch were also there, the last rearing its brood within eight yards of the front door. One of his two nearest neighbours was a gold-crested wren. When the minute bird was sitting on her eggs, in her little cradle-nest suspended to a spray of the yew, every day I would pull the branch down so that we might all enjoy the sight of the little fairy bird in her fairy nest which she refused to quit. The other next-door neighbour of the bullfinch was the long-tailed tit, which built its beautiful little nest on a terminal spray of another yew, ten or twelve yards from the door; and this small creature would also let us pull the branch down and peep into her well-feathered interior.\n\nIt seemed that from long immunity from persecution, all these small birds had quite lost their fear of human beings; but in late May and in June, when many young birds were out of the nest, one had to walk warily in the grass for fear of putting a foot on some little speckled creature patiently waiting to be visited and fed by its parents.\n\nNor were there birds only. Little beasties were also quite abundant; but they were of species that did no harm (at all events there), and the weasel would come from time to time to thin them down. Money is paid to mole-catcher and rat-catcher; the weasel charges you nothing: he takes it out in kind. And even as the jungle tiger, burning bright, and the roaring lion strike with panic the wild cattle and antelopes and herds of swine, so does this miniature carnivore, this fairy tiger of English homesteads and hedges, fill with trepidation the small deer he hunts and slays with his needle teeth\u2014Nature\u2019s scourge sent out among her too prolific small rodents; her little blood-letter who relieves her and restores the balance. And therefore he, too, with his flat serpent head and fiery killing soul, is a \u201cdear\u201d creature, being, like the poet\u2019s web-footed beasts of an earlier epoch, \u201cpart of a general plan.\u201d\n\nThe most abundant of the small furred creatures were the two short-tailed voles\u2014field-vole and bank-vole; the last, in his bright chestnut-red, the prettiest. Whenever I sat down for a few minutes in the porch I would see one or more run across the stones from one side, where masses of periwinkle grew against the house, to the other side, where Virginia creeper, rose, and an old magnolia tree covered the wall. One day at the back of the house by the scullery door I noticed a swaying movement in a tall seeded stem of dock, and looking down spied a wee harvest-mouse running and climbing nimbly on the slender branchlets, feeding daintily on the seed, and looking like a miniature squirrel on a miniature bush.\n\nJust there, close to the door, was a wood-pile, and the hornets had made their nest in it. The year before they had made it in a loft in the house, and before that in the old barn. The splendid insects were coming and going all day, interfering with nobody and nobody interfering with them; and when I put a plate of honey for them on the logs close to their entrance they took no notice of it; but by-and-by bank-voles and wood-mice came stealing out from among the logs and fed on it until it was all gone.\n\nI was surprised, and could only suppose that the hornets did not notice or discover the honey, because no such good thing was looked for so close to their door. Away from home the hornet was quick to discover anything sweet to the taste, and very ready to resent the presence of any other creature at the table.\n\nAt the riverside, a few hundred yards from the house, I was sitting in the shade of a large elm tree one day when I was visited by a big hornet, who swept noisily down and settled on the trunk, four or five feet above the ground. A quantity of sap had oozed out into a deep cleft of the rough bark and had congealed there, and the hornet had discovered it. Before he had been long feeding on it I saw a little bank-vole come out from the roots of the tree and run up the trunk, looking very pretty in his bright chestnut fur as he came into the sunlight. Stealing up to the lower end of the cleft full of thickened sap he too began feeding on it. The hornet, who was at the upper end of the cleft, quite four inches apart from the vole, at once stopped eating and regarded the intruder for some time, then advanced towards him in a threatening attitude. The vole was frightened at this, starting and erecting his hair, and once or twice he tried to recover his courage and resume his feeding, but the hornet still keeping up his hostile movements, he eventually slipped quietly down and hid himself at the roots. When the hornet departed he came out again and went to the sap.\n\nWishing to see more, I spent most of that day and the day following at the spot, and saw hornet and vole meet many times. If the vole was at the sap when the hornet came he was at once driven off, and when the hornet was there first the vole was never allowed to feed, although on every occasion he tried to do so, stealing to his lower place in the gentlest way in order not to give offence, and after beginning to feed affecting not to see that the other had left off eating, and with raised head was regarding him with jealous eyes.\n\nRarely have I looked on a prettier little comedy in wild life.\n\nBut to return to the house. There was quite a happy family at that spot by the back door where the hornets were. A numerous family of shrews were reared, and the young, when they began exploring the world, used to creep over the white stone by the threshold. The girls would pick them up to feel their soft mole-like fur: the young shrew is a gentle creature and does not attempt to bite. Some of the more adventurous ones were always blundering into the empty flower-pots heaped against the wall, and there they would remain imprisoned until some person found and took them out.\n\nOne morning, at half-past four o\u2019clock, when I was lying awake listening to the blackbird, a lively squirrel came dancing into the open window of my bedroom on the first floor. There were writing materials, flowers in glasses, and other objects on the ledge and dressing-table there, and he frisked about among them, chattering, wildly excited at seeing so many curious and pretty things, but he upset nothing; and by-and-by he danced out again into the ivy covering the wall on that side, throwing the colony of breeding sparrows into a great state of consternation.\n\nThe river was quite near the house\u2014not half a minute from the front door, though hidden from sight by the trees on its banks. Here, at the nearest point, there was an old half-dead dwarf oak growing by the water and extending one horizontal branch a distance of twenty feet over the stream. This was the favourite drumming-tree of a green woodpecker, and at intervals through the day he would visit it and drum half-a-dozen times or so. This drumming sounded so loud that, following the valley down, I measured the distance it could be heard and found it just one-third of a mile. At that distance I could hear it distinctly; farther on, not at all. It seemed almost incredible that the sound produced by so small a stick as a woodpecker\u2019s beak striking a tree should be audible at that distance.\nIt is hardly to be doubted that the drumming is used as a love-call, though it is often heard in late summer. It is, however, in early spring and in the breeding season that it is oftenest heard, and I have found that a good imitation of it will sometimes greatly excite the bird. The same bird may be heard drumming here, there, and everywhere in a wood or copse, the sound varying somewhat in character and strength according to the wood; but each bird as a rule has a favourite drumming-tree, and it probably angers him to hear another bird at the spot. On one occasion, finding that a very large, old, and apparently dying cedar in a wood was constantly used by a woodpecker, I went to the spot and imitated the sound. Very soon the bird came and began drumming against me, close by. I responded, and again he drummed; and becoming more and more excited he flew close to me, and passing from tree to tree drummed at every spot he lighted on.\n\nThe other species have the same habit of drumming on one tree. I have noticed it in the small spotted, or banded, woodpecker; and have observed that invariably after he had drummed two or three times the female has come flying to him from some other part of the wood, and the two birds have then both together uttered their loud chirping notes and flown away.\n\nOn revisiting the spot a year after I had heard the green woodpecker drumming every day in the oak by the river, I found that he had forsaken it, and that close by, on the other side of the stream, a great spotted woodpecker had selected as his drumming-tree a very big elm growing on the bank. He drummed on a large dead branch about forty feet from the ground, and the sound he made was quite as loud as that of the green bird. It may be that the two big woodpeckers, who play equally well on the same instrument, are intolerant of one another\u2019s presence, and that in this case the spotted bird had driven the larger yaffle from his territory.\n\nOne of the prettiest spots by the water was that very one where the spotted bird was accustomed to come, and I often went there at noon and sat for an hour on the grassy bank in the shade of the drumming-tree. The river was but thirty to forty feet wide at that spot, with masses of water forget-me-not growing on the opposite bank, clearly reflected in the sherry-coloured sunlit current below. The trees were mostly oaks, in the young vivid green of early June foliage. And one day when the sky, seen through that fresh foliage, was without a stain of vapour in its pure azure, when the wood was full of clear sunlight\u2014so clear that silken spider webs, thirty or forty feet high in the oaks, were visible as shining red and blue and purple lines\u2014the bird, after drumming high above my head, flew to an oak tree just before me, and clinging vertically to the bark on the high part of the trunk, remained there motionless for some time. His statuesque attitude, as he sat with his head thrown well back, the light glinting on his hard polished feathers, black and white and crimson, the setting in which he appeared of greenest translucent leaves and hoary bark and open sunlit space, all together made him seem not only our handsomest woodpecker, but our most beautiful bird. I had seen him at his best, and sitting there motionless amid the wind-fluttered leaves, he was like a bird-figure carved from some beautiful vari-coloured stone.\n\n\nThe most interesting events in animal life observed at this spot relate to the cuckoo in the spring of 1900. Some time before this Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace said, in the course of a talk we had, that he very much wanted me to find out exactly what happened in a nest in which a young cuckoo was hatched. It was, I replied, an old, old story\u2014what could I see, supposing I was lucky enough to find a nest where I could observe it properly, more than Jenner, Hancock, Mrs. Hugh Blackburn, and perhaps other writers, had told us? Yes, it was an old story, he said, and he wanted it told again by some one else. People had lately been discrediting Jenner\u2019s account, and as to the other chief authority I had named, one writer, a Dr. Creighton, had said, \u201cAs for artists like Mrs. Blackburn, they can draw what they please\u2014all out of their own brains: we can\u2019t trust them, or such as them.\u201d Sober-minded naturalists had come to regard the habit and abnormal strength attributed to the newly-hatched cuckoo as \u201cnot proven\u201d or quite incredible; thus Seebohm had said, \u201cOne feels inclined to class these narratives with the equally well-authenticated stories of ghosts and other apparitions which abound.\u201d\n\nSince my conversation with Dr. Wallace we have had more of these strange narratives\u2014the fables and ghost stories which the unbelievers are compelled in the end to accept and all that Dr. Jenner or his assistant saw others have seen, and some observers have even taken snapshots of the young cuckoo in the act of ejecting his fellow-nestling. But it appears from all the accounts which I have so far read, that in every case the observer was impatient and interfered in the business by touching and irritating the young cuckoo, by putting eggs and other objects on his back, and making other experiments. In the instance I am about to give there was no interference by me or by the others who at intervals watched with me.\n\nA robin\u2019s nest with three robin\u2019s eggs and one of the cuckoo was found in a low bank at the side of the small orchard on May 19, 1900. The bird was incubating, and on the afternoon of May 27 the cuckoo hatched out. Unfortunately I did not know how long incubation had been going on before the 19th, but from the fact that the cuckoo was first out, it seems probable that the parasite has this further advantage of coming first from the shell. Long ago I found that this was so in the case of the parasitical troupials of the genus Molothrus in South America.\n\nI kept a close watch on the nest for the rest of that afternoon and the whole of the following day (the 28th), during which the young cuckoo was lying in the bottom of the nest, helpless as a piece of jelly with a little life in it, and with just strength enough in his neck to lift his head and open his mouth; and then, after a second or two, the wavering head would drop again. At eight o\u2019clock next morning (29th), I found that one robin had come out of the shell, and one egg had been ejected and was lying a few inches below the nest on the sloping bank. Yet the young cuckoo still appeared a weak, helpless, jelly-like creature, as on the previous day. But he had increased greatly in size. I believe that in forty-eight hours from the time of hatching he had quite doubled his bulk, and had grown darker, his naked skin being of a bluish-black colour. The robin, thirty or more hours younger, was little more than half his size, and had a pale, pinkish-yellow skin, thinly clothed with a long black down. The cuckoo occupied the middle of the deep, cup-shaped nest, and his broad back, hollow in the middle, formed a sort of false bottom; but there was a small space between the bird\u2019s sides and the nest, and in this space or interstice the one unhatched egg that still remained and the young robin were lying.\n\nDuring this day (29th) I observed that the pressure of the egg and young robin against his sides irritated the cuckoo: he was continually moving, jerking and wriggling his lumpish body this way and that, as if to get away from the contact. At intervals this irritation would reach its culminating point, and a series of mechanical movements would begin, all working blindly but as surely towards the end as if some devilish intelligence animated the seemingly helpless infant parasite.\n\nOf the two objects in the nest the unhatched egg irritated him the most. The young robin was soft, it yielded when pressed, and could be made somehow to fit into the interstice; but the hard, round shell, pressing against him like a pebble, was torture to him, and at intervals became unendurable. Then would come that magical change in him, when he seemed all at once to become possessed of a preternatural power and intelligence, and then the blind struggle down in the nest would begin. And after each struggle\u2014each round it might be called\u2014the cuckoo would fall back again and lie in a state of collapse, as if the mysterious virtue had gone out of him. But in a very short time the pressure on his side would again begin to annoy him, then to torment him, and at last he would be wrought up to a fresh effort. Thus in a space of eight minutes I saw him struggle four separate times, with a period of collapse after each, to get rid of the robin\u2019s egg; and each struggle involved a long series of movements on his part. On each of these occasions the egg was pushed or carried up to the wrong or upper side of the nest, with the result that when the bird jerked the egg from him it rolled back into the bottom of the nest. The statement is therefore erroneous that the cuckoo knows at which side to throw the egg out. Of course he knows nothing, and, as a fact, he tries to throw the egg up as often as down the slope.\n\nThe process in each case was as follows:\u2014The pressure of the egg against the cuckoo\u2019s side, as I have said, was a constant irritation; but the irritability varied in degree in different parts of the body. On the under parts it scarcely existed; its seat was chiefly on the upper surface, beginning at the sides and increasing towards the centre, and was greatest in the hollow of the back. When, in moving, the egg got pushed up to the upper edge of his side, he would begin to fidget more and more, and this would cause it to move round, and so to increase the irritation by touching and pressing against other parts. When all the bird\u2019s efforts to get away from the object had only made matters worse, he would cease wriggling and squat down lower and lower in the bottom of the nest, and the egg, forced up, would finally roll right into the cavity in his back\u2014the most irritable part of all. Whenever this occurred, a sudden change that was like a fit would seize the bird; he would stiffen, rise in the nest, his flabby muscles made rigid, and stand erect, his back in a horizontal position, the head hanging down, the little naked wings held up over the back. In that position he looked an ugly, lumpish negro mannikin, standing on thinnest dwarf legs, his back bent, and elbows stuck up above the hollow flat back.\n\nOnce up on his small stiffened legs he would move backwards, firmly grasping the hairs and hair-like fibres of the nest-lining, and never swerving, until the rim of the cup-like structure was reached; and then standing, with feet sometimes below and in some cases on the rim, he would jerk his body, throwing the egg off or causing it to roll off. After that he would fall back into the nest and lie quite exhausted for some time, his jelly-like body rising and falling with his breathing.\n\nThese changes in the bird strongly reminded me of a person with an epileptic fit, as I had been accustomed to see it on the pampas, where, among the gauchos, epilepsy is one of the commonest maladies;\u2014the sudden rigidity of muscle in some weak, sickly, flabby-looking person, the powerful grip of the hand, the strength in struggling, exceeding that of a man in perfect health, and finally, when this state is over, the weakness of complete exhaustion.\nI witnessed several struggles with the egg, but at last, in spite of my watchfulness, I did not see it ejected. On returning after a very short absence, I found the egg had been thrown out and had rolled down the bank, a distance of fourteen inches from the nest.\n\nThe young cuckoo appeared to rest more quietly in the nest now, but after a couple of hours the old fidgeting began again, and increased until he was in the same restless state as before. The rapid growth of the birds made the position more and more miserable for the cuckoo, since the robin, thrust against the side of the nest, would throw his head and neck across the cuckoo\u2019s back, and he could not endure being touched there. And now a fresh succession of struggles began, the whole process being just the same as when the egg was struggled with. But it was not so easy with the young bird, not because of its greater weight, but because it did not roll like the egg and settle in the middle of the back; it would fall partly on to the cuckoo\u2019s back and then slip off into the nest again. But success came at last, after many failures. The robin was lying partly across the cuckoo\u2019s neck, when, in moving its head, its little curved beak came down and rested on the very centre of that irritable hollow in the back of its foster-brother. Instantly the cuckoo pressed down into the nest, shrinking away as if hot needles had pricked him, as far as possible from the side where the robin was lying against him, and this movement of course brought the robin more and more over him, until he was thrown right upon the cuckoo\u2019s back.\n\nInstantly the rigid fit came on, and up rose the cuckoo, as if the robin weighed no more than a feather on him; and away backwards he went, right up the nest, without a pause, and standing actually on the rim, jerked his body, causing the robin to fall off, clean away from the nest. It fell, in fact, on to a large dock leaf five inches below the rim of the nest, and rested there.\n\nAfter getting rid of his burden the cuckoo continued in the same position, perfectly rigid, for a space of five or six seconds, during which it again and again violently jerked its body, as if it had the feeling of the burden on it still. Then, the fit over, it fell back, exhausted as usual.\n\nI had been singularly fortunate in witnessing the last scene and conclusion of this little bloodless tragedy in a bird\u2019s nest, with callow nestlings for dramatis personae, this innocent crime and wrong, which is not a wrong since the cuckoo doesn\u2019t think it one. It is a little curious to reflect that a similar act takes place annually in tens of thousands of small birds\u2019 nests all over the country, and that it is so rarely witnessed.\n\nMarvellous as the power of the young cuckoo is when the fit is on him, it is of course limited, and when watching his actions I concluded that it would be impossible for him to eject eggs and nestlings from any thrush\u2019s nest. The blackbird\u2019s would be too deep, and as to the throstle\u2019s, he could not move backwards up the sides of the cup-like cavity on account of the smooth plastered surface.\n\nAfter having seen the young robin cast out I still refrained from touching the nest, as there were yet other things to observe. One was the presence, very close to the nest, of the ejected nestling what would the parents do in the case? Before dealing with that matter I shall conclude the history of the young cuckoo.\n\nHaving got the nest to himself he rested very quietly, and it was not till the following day (July 1st) that I allowed myself to touch him. He was, I found, still irritable, and when I put back the eggs he had thrown out he was again miserable in the nest, and the struggle with the eggs was renewed until he got rid of them as before. The next day the irritability had almost gone, and in the afternoon he suffered an egg or a pebble to remain in the nest with him without jerking and wriggling about, and he made no further attempt to eject it. This observation\u2014the loss of irritability on the fifth day after hatching\u2014agrees with that of Mr. Craig, whose account was printed in the Feathered World, July 14, 1899.\n\nThe young cuckoo grew rapidly and soon trod his nest into a broad platform, on which he reposed, a conspicuous object in the scanty herbage on the bank. We often visited and fed him, when he would puff up his plumage and strike savagely at our hands, but at the same time he would always gobble down the food we offered. In seventeen days after being hatched he left the nest and took up his position in an oak tree growing on the bank, and there the robins continued feeding him for the next three days, after which we saw no more of him.\n\nI may add that in May 1901 a pair of robins built on the bank close to where the nest had been made the previous year, and that in this nest a cuckoo was also reared. The bird, when first seen, was apparently about four or five days old, and it had the nest to itself. Three ejected robin\u2019s eggs were lying on the bank a little lower down.\n\nIt is hardly to be doubted that the robins were the same birds that had reared the cuckoo in the previous season; and it is highly probable that the same cuckoo had returned to place her egg in their nest.\n\nThe end of the little history\u2014the fate of the ejected nestling and the attitude of the parent robins\u2014remains to be told. When the young cuckoo throws out the nestlings from nests in trees, hedges, bushes, and reeds, the victims, as a rule, fall some distance to the ground, or in the water, and are no more seen by the old birds. Here the young robin, when ejected, fell a distance of but five or six inches, and rested on a broad, bright green leaf, where it was an exceedingly conspicuous object; and when the mother robin was on the nest\u2014and at this stage she was on it a greater part of the time\u2014warming that black-skinned, toad-like, spurious babe of hers, her bright, intelligent eyes were looking full at the other one, just beneath her, which she had grown in her body and had hatched with her warmth, and was her very own. I watched her for hours; watched her when warming the cuckoo, when she left the nest and when she returned with food, and warmed it again, and never once did she pay the least attention to the outcast lying there so close to her. There, on its green leaf, it remained, growing colder by degrees, hour by hour, motionless, except when it lifted its head as if to receive food, then dropped it again, and when, at intervals, it twitched its body as if trying to move. During the evening even these slight motions ceased, though that feeblest flame of life was not yet extinguished; but in the morning it was dead and cold and stiff; and just above it, her bright eyes on it, the mother robin sat on the nest as before, warming her cuckoo.\n\nHow amazing and almost incredible it seems that a being such as a robin, intelligent above most birds as we are apt to think, should prove in this instance to be a mere automaton! The case would, I think, have been different if the ejected one had made a sound, since there is nothing which more excites the parent bird, or which is more instantly responded to, than the cry of hunger or distress of the young. But at this early stage the nestling is voiceless\u2014another point in favour of the parasite. The sight of its young, we see, slowly and dumbly dying, touches no chord in the parent: there is, in fact, no recognition; once out of the nest it is no more than a coloured leaf, or a bird-shaped pebble, or fragment of clay.\n\nIt happened that my young fellow-watchers, seeing that the ejected robin if left there would inevitably perish, proposed to take it in to feed and rear it\u2014to save it, as they said; but I advised them not to attempt such a thing, but rather to spare the bird. To spare it the misery they would inflict on it by attempting to fill its parents\u2019 place. They had, so far, never kept a caged bird, nor a pet bird, and had no desire to keep one; all they desired to do in this case was to save the little outcast from death\u2014to rear it till it was able to fly away and take care of itself. That was a difficult, a well-nigh impossible task. The bird, at this early stage, required to be fed at short intervals for about sixteen hours each day on a peculiar kind of food, suited to its delicate stomach\u2014chiefly small caterpillars found in the herbage; and it also needed a sufficient amount by day and night of that animal warmth which only the parent bird could properly supply. They, not being robins, would give it unsuitable food, feed it at improper times, and not keep it at the right temperature, with the almost certain result that after lingering a few days it would die in their hands. But if by giving a great deal of time and much care they should succeed in rearing it, their foundling would start his independent life so handicapped, weakened in constitution by an indoor artificial bringing up, without the training which all young birds receive from their parents after quitting the nest, that it would be impossible for him to save himself. If by chance he should survive until August, he would then be set upon and killed by one of the adult robins already in possession of the ground. Now, when a bird at maturity perishes, it suffers in dying sometimes very acutely; but if left to grow cold and fade out of life at this stage it can hardly be said to suffer. It is no more conscious than a chick in the shell; take from it the warmth that keeps it in being, and it drops back into nothingness without knowing and, we may say, without feeling anything. There may indeed be an incipient consciousness in that small, soft brain in its early vegetative stage, a first faint glimmer of a bright light to be, and a slight sensation of numbness may be actually felt as the body grows cold, but that would be all.\n\nPain is so common in the world; and, owing to the softness and sensitiveness induced in us by an indoor artificial life since that softness of our bodies reacts on our minds we have come to a false or an exaggerated idea of its importance, its painfulness, to put it that way; and we should therefore be but making matters worse, or rather making ourselves more miserable, by looking for and finding it where it does not exist.\n\nThe power to feel pain in any great degree comes into the bird\u2019s life after this transitional period, and is greatest at maturity, when consciousness and all the mental faculties are fully developed, particularly the passion of fear, which plays continually on the strings of the wild creature\u2019s heart with an ever varying touch, producing the feeling in all degrees from the slight disquiet, which is no sooner come than gone, to extremities of agonising terror. It would perhaps have a wholesome effect on their young minds, and save them from grieving overmuch at the death of a newly-hatched robin, if they would consider this fact of the pain that is and must be. Not the whole subject\u2014the fact that as things are designed in this world of sentient life there can be no good, no sweetness or pleasure in life, nor peace and contentment and safety, nor happiness and joy, nor any beauty or strength or lustre, nor any bright and shining quality of body or mind, without pain, which is not an accident nor an incident, nor something ancillary to life, but is involved in and a part of life, of its very colour and texture. That would be too long to speak about; all I meant was to consider that small part of the fact, the necessary pain to and destruction of the bird life around them and in the country generally.\n\nHere, for instance, without going farther than a hundred yards from the house in any direction, they could put their hands in nests in trees and bushes, and on the ground, and in the ivy, and in the old outhouses, and handle and count about one hundred and thirty young birds not yet able to fly. Probably more than twice that number would be successfully reared during the season. How many, then, would be reared in the whole parish! How many in the entire New Forest district, in the whole county of Hampshire, in the entire kingdom! Yet when summer came round again they would find no more birds than they had now. And so it would be in all places; all that incalculable increase would have perished. Many millions would be devoured by rapacious birds and beasts; millions more would perish of hunger and cold; millions of migrants would fall by the way, some in the sea and some on land; those that returned from distant regions would be but a remnant, and the residents that survived through the winter, these, too, would be nothing but a remnant. It is not only that this inconceivable amount of bird life must be destroyed each year, but we cannot suppose that death is not a painful process. In a vast majority of cases, whether the bird slowly perishes of hunger and weakness, or is pursued and captured by birds and beasts of prey, or is driven by cold adverse winds and storms into the waves, the pain, the agony must be great. The least painful death is undoubtedly that of the bird that, weakened by want of sustenance, dies by night of cold in severe weather. It is indeed most like the death of the nestling, but a few hours out of the shell, which has been thrown out of the nest, and which soon grows cold, and dozes its feeble, unconscious life away.\n\nWe may say, then, that of all the thousand forms of death which Nature has invented to keep her too rapidly multiplying creatures within bounds, that which is brought about by the singular instinct of the young cuckoo in the nest is the most merciful or the least painful.\n\nI am not sure that I said all this, or marshalled fact and argument in the precise order in which they are here set down. I fancy not, as it seems more than could well have been spoken while we were standing there in the late evening sunlight by that primrose bank, looking down on the little flesh-coloured mite in its scant clothing of black down, fading out of life on its cold green leaf. But what was said did not fail of its effect, so that my young tender-hearted hearers, who had begun to listen with moist eyes, secretly accusing me perhaps of want of feeling, were content in the end to let it be\u2014to go away and leave it to its fate in that mysterious green world we, too, live in and do not understand, in which life and death and pleasure and pain are inter-woven light and shade.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1094177", "artist_names": "Jefferson Starship", "full_title": "Girl with the Hungry Eyes by\u00a0Jefferson\u00a0Starship",
