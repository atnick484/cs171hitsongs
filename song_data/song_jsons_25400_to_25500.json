last great american dynasty Lyrics[Verse 1]\nRebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny\nHer saltbox house on the coast\u2005took\u2005her mind off\u2005St. Louis\nBill was the heir to\u2005the Standard Oil name and money\nAnd the town said, \"How\u205fdid\u205fa\u205fmiddle-class divorc\u00e9e do\u205fit?\"\nThe wedding was\u205fcharming, if a little gauche\nThere's only so far new money goes\nThey picked out a home and called it \"Holiday House\"\nTheir parties were tasteful, if a little loud\nThe doctor had told him to settle down\nIt must have been her fault his heart gave out\n[Chorus]\nAnd they said\n\"There goes the last great American dynasty\nWho knows, if she never showed up, what could've been\nThere goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen\nShe had a marvelous time ruining everything\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nRebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever\nFlew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city\nFilled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names\nAnd blew through the money on the boys and the ballet\nAnd losing on card game bets with Dal\u00ed\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd they said\n\"There goes the last great American dynasty\nWho knows, if she never showed up, what could've been\nThere goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen\nShe had a marvelous time ruining everything\"\n\n[Bridge]\nThey say she was seen on occasion\nPacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea\nAnd in a feud with her neighbor\nShe stole his dog and dyed it key lime green\nFifty years is a long time\nHoliday House sat quietly on that beach\nFree of women with madness, their men and bad habits\nAnd then it was bought by me\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $299You might also like[Chorus]\nWho knows, if I never showed

mean\nSome to throw, some to make a diamond ring\nYou know I didn't want to have to haunt you\nBut what a ghostly scene\nYou wear the same jewels that I gave you\nAs you bury me\n\n[Chorus]\nI didn't have it in myself to go with grace\n'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave\nAnd if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?\nCursing my name, wishing I stayed\nLook at how my tears ricochet\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I can go anywhere I want\nAnywhere I want, just not home\nAnd you can aim for my heart, go for blood\nBut you would still miss me in your bones\nAnd I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)\nAnd when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)\n\n[Chorus]\nI didn't have it in myself to go with grace\nAnd so the battleships will sink beneath the waves\nYou had to kill me, but it killed you just the same\nCursing my name, wishing I stayed\nYou turned into your worst fears\nAnd you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain\nCrossing out the good

supply and demand\nWhere my young niggas choppin' up grams\nAnd them choppers won't pry from they hands\nPackin' lead like they got a exam\nIf it's beef, my niggas look just like homewreckers\nThey got they eye on your mans\nI pray to God that it jam\nToo many done died in these parts\nSo we gotta be smart if we tryna see August\nSome niggas won't make it past summer regardless\nI'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits\nThese niggas be lookin' at me like I got it\nDeep down inside, though, I still feel as broke\nAs that nigga who just graduated from college\nScrapin' up change that got left in my pockets\nI'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar\nRidin' the train, way too shy to go holler\nJust watched her get off at her stop, I'm a coward\nFuck it, though, you got a way bigger target\nI'ma do it so big, they won't know what to call it\nSound like a whole Lambo' truck in my stomach\nBitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving\nGotta move mama from out them apartments\nGotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten\nGotta hit hoes you hang up in your locker\nGotta get rich, 'cause my granny picked cotton\nGotta make hits, 'cause if not, then I'm floppin'\nGotta stay me in the process\nNiggas dissed me, it was nonsense\nI sat 'em down like his father\nMy nigga asked, \"Why you bother?\nWe should've caught him and mobbed him\"\nI said, \"We gotta move smarter\"\nDon't wan' be the reason for one more sad song\nI tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long\nI hope that you see how they came and they went\nThey shots never hit, but they made they attempts\nMay have a good year like that name on the blimp\nBut you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?\nDedication on another level niggas never seen in they life\nCelebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price\nYoung Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice\nNiggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice\nPut the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God\nHalf the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?\nBut that's treacherous, that shows less of us\nI need y'all to see every part of me\nEvery scar and every artery\nEvery story that I can recall, then I can fall\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie\nI got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie\nI got real, real big

lie\nGot a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie (Uh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLately, I reflect on the times a nigga was low\nI got it up off the floor, I'm stronger than ever before\nI'm stronger than ever before just like I planned to be\nThey wanna see me fold, it ain't no thang to me\nThoughts when I was broke, if only I could be\nPockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me\nAt night, I hit my knees, I prayed for better days\nThen found a better me, I got my head on straight\n\n[Outro]\nUp, up, and away, just ridin' my wave, I ain't never gon' say nothin'\nNigga throw a shot my way, I just jot down names, ain't never gon' say nothin'\nKnow you be stressin', hate only block your blessin', I'm never gon' say nothin'\nQuit all that flexin', niggas live check to check, I'm never gon' say

they keep me up at night\nSaid I was okay, but I'm lying, feel like that I'm dying\nSoul screaming and crying, feel my brain frying\nTry to numb the pain, all the drugs I've been buying\nThis oxy gettin' pricey, pour the codeine in the Hi-C\nBlood red blend in the Hi-C\nI've been doing so much wrong, even though ma told me to do the right thing\nPoppin' pills all night long, in the studio pourin' out my feelings\nCan't explain this feeling\nKinda feels like I'm losing even though I'm winning\n[Chorus]\nDrain out bad energy (Drain out bad energy)\nForget the bad memories (Forget the bad memories)\nDrain out bad energy (Drain out bad energy)\nForget the bad memories (Forget the bad memories, ayy, ayy)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMulti-million dollars\nAll mine from the start\nCodeine kills the drama\nAnd the trauma in my heart\nJust got a call from the dark side\nStab wounds in my chest, but I'm alright\nI miss my friends, I hate this spotlight\nI love my girl, I hate the thot life\nYellow diamonds, shiny pearls\nI'm tryna give her the world\nI'm tryna show her the world\nShe ain't no ordinary girl\nI know she know, I know she know I'm down and out\nLife is a ocean, demons I've been drownin' out\nI watch the crowd and crack a smile\nI have a job to lead them out\n\n[Chorus]\nDrain out bad energy (Drain out bad energy)\nForget the bad memories (Forget the bad memories)\nDrain out

first time I slept on the couch, was our first New Year's Eve\nI heard words come out my mouth, that I still can't believe\nBroken hearts and shattered champagne\nWe both don't wanna feel that again\nThe second I apologized, you said, \"Boy, I don't know\"\nI said it 'cause I meant, but you still wouldn't let it go\nSo I swallow my pride, see it from your side\nI promise I'll do the best I can do\n[Chorus: Kane Brown & John Legend]\nI won't say I'm sorry over and over\nCan't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you\nI won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true\nI hope the last time I

guy, told me I was a star\nHe held the door, held my\u2005hand\u2005in the dark\nAnd\u2005he's perfect on paper, but he's\u2005lying to my face\nDoes he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd there's one more boy, he's from my past\nWe fell in love, but it didn't last\n'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away\nAnd I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway\nAnd I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you\n[Chorus]\nAll I want is love that lasts\nIs all I want too much to ask?\nIs it something wrong with me?\nAll I want is a good guy\nAre my expectations far too high?\nTry my best, but what can I say?\nAll I have is myself at the end of the day\nBut shouldn't that be enough for me?\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nAnd I miss the days when I was young and naive\nI thought the perfect guy would come and find me\nNow happy ever after, it don't come so easily\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I want is love that lasts\nIs all I want too much to ask?\nIs it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh\nAll I want is a good guy\nAre my expectations far too high?\nTry my best but what can I say?\nAll I have is myself at the end of the day\nAnd all I want is for that to be okayYou might also like36Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 21, "api_path": "/songs/5128894", "artist_names": "JACKBOYS & Sheck Wes", "full_title": "GANG GANG by\u00a0JACKBOYS\u00a0& Sheck Wes", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/4466bd043296ff7f2c2a2280f6512f11.300x225x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4466bd043296ff7f2c2a2280f6512f11.480x360x1.jpg", "id": 5128894, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1599419, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1645870486, "path": "/Jackboys-and-sheck-wes-gang-gang-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 57, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Jackboys-and-sheck-wes-gang-gang-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2019, "month": 12, "day": 27}, "release_date_for_display": "December 27, 2019", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Dec. 27, 2019", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fca0d7c70b220229aa1065fb14918ac0.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fca0d7c70b220229aa1065fb14918ac0.1000x1000x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 758750}, "title": "GANG GANG", "title_with_featured": "GANG GANG", "updated_by_human_at": 1667026391, "url": "https://genius.com/Jackboys-and-sheck-wes-gang-gang-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/2057732", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b2bd0e1ff282f2f7ff9f0f061c9eff98.400x222x1.jpg", "id": 2057732, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6bfd2e4e040d1851629acd019fe306f6.420x420x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "JACKBOYS & Sheck Wes", "slug": "Jackboys-and-sheck-wes", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Jackboys-and-sheck-wes"}, "artist": "JACKBOYS & Sheck Wes", "lyrics": "TranslationsPortugu\u00easFran\u00e7aisEnglishGANG GANG Lyrics[Intro: Sheck Wes]\nWhat the fuck is we doin'?\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Sheck Wes & Travis Scott]\nGang back in the stu' (Gang, gang, gang,\u2005gang,\u2005gang, gang, gang)\nUh,\u2005yeah, gang back in the stu'\u2005(Gang)\nYoung nigga win, win, win, win (Bitch), how can I lose?

Doin\u2019 Time (Srpski Prevod)Doin\u2019 Time Lyrics[Chorus]\nSummertime, and the livin's easy\nBradley's on the microphone with Ras MG\nAll the people in the dance will agree\nThat we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.\nMe, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party\nAnd dance to the rhythm, it gets harder\n\n[Verse 1]\nMe and my girl, we got this relationship\nI love her so bad, but she treats me like shit\nOn lockdown, like a penitentiary\nShe spreads her lovin' all over\nAnd when she gets home, there's none left for me\n[Chorus]\nSummertime, and the livin's easy\nBradley's on the microphone with Ras MG\nAll the people in the dance will agree\nThat we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.\nMe, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party\nAnd dance to the rhythm, it gets harder\n(Harder, yeah, harder, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, take this veil from off my eyes\nMy burning sun will, some day, rise\nSo, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?\nSaid, I'm gonna play with myself\nShow them how we come off the shelf\n\n[Chorus]\nSummertime, and the livin's easy\nBradley's on the microphone with Ras MG\nAll the people in the dance will agree\nThat we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.\nMe, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party\nAnd dance to the rhythm, it gets harder\n(Harder, yeah, harder, yeah)\n\n[Bridge]\nEvil, we've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely\nEvil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely\nThe tension, it's getting hotter\nI'd like to hold her head underwater\n(Summertime)\n(Ah, ah, ah)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSummertime, and the livin's easy\nBradley's on the microphone with Ras MG\nAll the people in the dance will agree\nThat we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.\nMe, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party\nAnd dance to the rhythm, it gets harder158Embed"}]
