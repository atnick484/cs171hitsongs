talking about the power of love now\nI'm gonna tell you what love can do\nYou know when they say love makes the world go 'round, that's the truth\nLove can make you or break you\nIt can make you laugh.  It can make you cry\nIt can make you happy.  It can make you sad\nAw, it'd get hung up real bad\nIn a case of jealousy, love can make you mad.  Aw, yeah\nNow everybody, everybody's got it's own thing\nEverybody's got it's way of doing a thing\nNow we should attempt to do a tune that is very popular it was written by one of the great young songwriters of today\nNow I don't know what he was thinking about or what inspired him to write this tune, but it's a deep tune\nThere's a deep meaning to this tune because it shows you what the power of love can do\nNow I should attempt it to do it my way, my own interpretation of it\nLike I said, everybody's got it's own thing\nI'm gonna bring it on down to Soulsville\nNow I want you to bear along with me for a few minutes while I set it up\nNow I want your imagination.  I want you to travel with me\nOh, come on, come on, come on\n\nThis young man was raised in the hills of Tennessee\nWhen he reached the age of maturity, he moved to the West Coast\nAnd he fell in love when he got out there to this young girl\nAw, man, she was out of sight.  She was bad\nAnd then they started dating and then the inevitable, became engaged and they were married\nMmmm, hmmm, hmmm\nThey were happily married.  That's right they lived in L.A\nOh, oh.  The power of love was upon them\nBut you see, girls, I don't mean to come down on you, but this man loved this woman so...He can really say love is blind\nHe could see no wrong.  No, no, no\n\nHe worked every day and sometimes he'd pull overtime, double time, triple time\nHe bought anything that this woman's heart desired, anything that he could rake and scrape\nHe spent his last dime on women because he loved her\nAnd you know, girls, you can take love and kindness sometime for weakness and she took it for granted\nShe said, \"I got a fool and I know I got a fool.  I got a good thing.\"\nYeah, she was standing around on the corner, you understand, meeting with her friends\nShe would go to the beauty salon, get her hair fixed\nShe'd go shopping and she would brag about her good thing that she's got\nYeah.  And she took doubt on it\nSee, ain't nobody gonna believe what to tell him no way, fool\nOh, yeah, girls, you would love that sometimes\nYou might also likeBut one day, one day, the old boy got sick and he had to come home\nI don't have to tell you what he found\nOh, yeah, it hurt him so bad\nHe said, \"Baby, Mama ... why?\" That's all he could say\nThat's all he could say. He was hurt\nBut she said, \"Oh, go on fool, you're doing it\", but the man wasn't doing it, but that's the only excuse you can give him\nHe said, \"Mama, I can't take it. I've got to leave you. I'm gonna leave you.\"\nHe packed up his rags, you understand, and he started out the door\nAnd when he reached the driveway, you understand, he went in there begging just like my man Tyrone Davis\nAnd he said, \"Oh, mama, mama, mama, can I change, oh, my mind?\"\nYou see, the power of love was upon him and he came back\nOh, yes he did\n\nWhen she tried to straighten up, she said she was gonna straighten up\nShe got a little job to help him out with the bills too, but that was just a sham because he found it again and again\nAnd seven times he left this woman and seven times he came back\nOh, but you know, the heart can take so much\nThat's right. You can kick a dog around for so long and he'll get tired. He'll turn\nAnd he taken all that he could stand\nIn the eighth time that this went down, he said, \"Mama, I've got to go.\"\nWith tears in his eyes, he said, \"I'm gonna leave you, baby.\"\nHe said, \"I ain't coming back.\"\nHe said, \"I'm leaving my heart right here, but I've got to go, you see, 'cause this man can't take no more.\"\nShe didn't believe it\nHe packed his clothes. He got in his 1965 Ford\nHe started out\nThree times he started to turn back before he reached the outskirts of the city, but he kept on going\nOh, I don't wanna go, but I've got to leave you, mama\nAnd he's going down the highway\nI guess it was around 3:30 in the morning\nHe could not hardly see the road with tears in his eyes\nThat's right, he was crying\nThere were meaning in his tears\nHe cannot barely see the sign that read on the side of the road, the next town is 125 miles away\nAnd these very words came into his mind. He said...\nBy the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising\nOh, and she'll find a note I left hanging on her door\nShe'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'\nYes she will.  Why?\n'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.  Oh\n\nBy the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be workin'\nAnd she'll probably stop at lunch\nJust to give her, her sweet good thing a call\nAnd oh, she'll hear, oh, oh, the phone keeps right on ringin' and ringin' and ringin' and ringin' and ringin' and ringin'\nOh, and ringin' off the wall\nMama, mama, mama, that's all\n\nAnd by the time I get to Oklahoma, she'll be sleepin'\nShe'll turn softly in her restless sleep, call my name out low\nAnd oh, then she'll cry just to think I-I-I-I-I...\nI would really leave her\nFor time after time after time after time and time again, I tried to tell her so\nBut she was a non-believer, oh, and she didn't know\nOh, that I-I-I-I-I-I...I would really go\n\nShe didn't believe I would really go.  Oh no\nI hate to leave you, baby, yes I do\nI really, really, really hate to go, oh yeah\nBut this heart of mine just can't take no more\nI-I-I-I-I-I've taken all that I could stand\nYou should've known what you were doing to the man\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYou see, when I left, baby, I left a piece of my heart\nOh yeah\nYou know, you know, you know, you know you took, baby\nYou know you, you took the greatest part, yeah, yeah\nI don't know how I'm gonna make it, oh no, but I've got to go\nI'm gonna miss all the sweet loving and the good times\nBut the good times weren't as heavy, oh no, as the bad times\nOh yeah\nYou really, really put the hurt on me, yes you did\nI'm a prisoner of your love and I just, I just won't ever be free, no, no, no\nSo it's bye-bye.  Oh, mama, mama, bye-bye\nOh, bye-bye.  Oh, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye\nIt's too late for you to cry\nYou had a good thing, oh, and you misused it, yes you did\nYes you did\nYou had a good heart, oh, and you abused it\nOh yeah\nYou were sweet to me, yes you were\nBut on the other hand, you was real cold, cold, cold, cold\nYou just kept me, oh, you kept me hanging on, yes you did\nOh, oh, you kept me hanging on\nYou kept me begging, begging...You kept me begging you to do right\nYou kept me pacing the floor at night, oh yeah\nBut I love you.  God knows that I love you, baby\nAh, yeah.  I'll always love you, yeah\n\n(Instrumental break)\n\nRaindrops of water beating under my chin\nYou can look at me and tell all the pain I'm in\nAw, yeah.  Aw, yeah.  I'm gonna moan now\nMmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm\nMmmm, hmmm\n\n(Organ solo)\n\n(Instrumental finale)4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/986490", "artist_names": "B.B.

completely?\nNothing was left of all the memories\nThat we used to share\nJust an empty tube of toothpaste\nAnd a half filled cup of coffee\nOdds and ends of a beautiful love affair\nAt least you could have said goodbye\nYou shouldn't have run away\nWere you afraid that I would cry?\nMy tears might have made you stay?\nWhat of the dreams that kept us together?\nNothing was left to show\nThat we were once so happy there\nJust an empty tube of toothpaste\nAnd a half filled cup of coffee\nOdds and ends of a beautiful love affair\nHow could you go and leave so completely?\nNothing was left of

Carolann Clare\nWho, bored with the lesson, the rivers of England \u2013\nBrathay, Coquet, Crake, Dee, Don, Goyt\nRothay, Tyne, Swale, Tees, Wear, Wharfe\nHad passed, a note, which has never been found\nTo the classmate in front, Emily Jane, a girl\nWho adored the teacher, Miss V. Dunn MA\nSteadily squeaking her chalk on the board \u2013\nAllen, Clough, Duddon, Feugh, Greta, Hindburn\nIrwell, Kent, Leven, Lowther, Lune, Sprint\nBut who furtively opened the folded note\nTorn from the back of the King James Bible, read\nWhat was scribbled there and laughed out loud\nIt was a miserable, lowering winter\u2019s day. The girls\nHad been kept indoors at break \u2013 Wet Play\nIn the Hall \u2013 the windows tall and thin\nSad with rain like a song list of watery names \u2013\nRawthey, Roeburn, Skirfare, Troutbeck, Wash\nLikewise, the sound of the laugh of Emily Jane\nWas a liquid one, a gurgle, a ripple, a dribble\nA babble, a gargle, a plash, a splash of a laugh\nLike the sudden jackpot leap of a silver fish\nIn the purse of a pool. No fool, Emily Jane\nClamped her turquoise hand \u2013 her fountain pen leaked \u2013\nTo her mouth; but the laugh was out, was at large\nWas heard by the pupil twinned to her double desk \u2013\n\nRosemary Beth \u2013 the brace on whose jiggly teeth\nCouldn\u2019t restrain the gulping giggle she gave\nWhich caused Miss Dunn to spin round. Perhaps\nShe said, We can all share the joke? But Emily Jane\nHad scrunched and dropped the note with the joke\nTo the floor and kicked it across to Jennifer Kay\nWho snorted and toed it across to Marjorie May\nWho spluttered and heeled it backwards\nTo Jessica Kate. Girls! By now, every girl in the form\nHad started to snigger or snicker or titter or chuckle\nOr chortle till the classroom came to the boil\nWith a brothy mirth. Girls! Miss Dunn\u2019s shrill voice\nScraped Top G and only made matters worse\nYou might also likeFive minutes passed in a cauldron of noise\nNo one could seem to stop. Each tried holding\nHer breath or thinking of death or pinching\nHer thigh, only to catch the eye of a pal\nA crimson, shaking, silent girl, and explode\nThrough the noise in a cackling sneeze. Thank you!\nPlease! Screeched Miss Dunn, clapping her hands\nAs though she applauded the choir they\u2019d become\nA percussion of trills and whoops filling the room\nLike birds in a cage. But then came a triple rap\nAt the door and in stalked Miss Fife, Head of Maths\nWhose cold equations of eyes scanned the desks\nFor a suitable scapegoat. Stand up, Geraldine Ruth\n\nGeraldine Ruth got to her feet, a pale girl, a girl\nWho looked, in the stale classroom light, like a sketch\nFor a girl, a first draft to be crumpled and crunched\nAnd tossed away like a note. She cleared her throat\nRaising her eyes, water and sky, to look at Miss Fife\nThe girls who were there that day never forgot\nHow invisible crayons seemed to colour in\nGeraldine Ruth, white face to puce, mousey hair\nSuddenly gifted with health and youth, and how \u2013\nAs Miss Fife demanded what was the meaning of this \u2013\nHer lips split from the closed bud of a kiss\nTo the daisy chain of a grin and how then she yodelled\nA laugh with the full, open, blooming rose of her throat\nA flower of merriment. What\u2019s the big joke?\nThundered Miss Fife as Miss Dunn began again\nTo clap, as gargling Geraldine Ruth collapsed\nIn a heap on her desk, as the rest of the class\nHollered and hooted and howled. Miss Fife strode\nOn sharp heels to the blackboard, snatched up\nA finger of chalk and jabbed and slashed out\nA word. SILENCE. But the class next door\nFourth Years learning the Beaufort scale with Miss Batt\nCould hear the commotion. Miss Batt droned on \u2013\nNought, calm; one, light air; two, light breeze; three\nGentle . . . four, moderate . . . five, fresh . . . six, strong breeze;\nSeven, moderate gale . . . Stephanie Fay started to laugh\n\nWhat\u2019s so amusing, Stephanie Fay? barked Miss Batt\nWhat\u2019s so amusing? echoed unwitting Miss Dunn\nOn the other side of the wall. Precisely what\u2019s\nSo amusing? chorused Miss Fife. The Fourth Years\nShrieked with amazed delight and one wag\nAngela Joy, popped her head in the jaws of her desk\nAnd bellowed What\u2019s so amusing? What\u2019s so\nAmusing? into its musty yawn. The Third Form\nGuffawed afresh at the sound of the Fourth\nAnd the noise of the two combined was heard\nBy the First Form, trying to get Shakespeare by heart\nTo the beat of the ruler of Mrs Mackay. Don\u2019t look\nAt your books, look at me. After three. Friends\n\nRomans, Countrymen . . . What\u2019s so amusing? rapped out\nMrs Mackay as the First Years chirruped\nAnd trilled like baby birds in a nest at a worm;\nBut she heard for herself, appalled, the chaos\nComing in waves through the wall and clipped\nTo the door. Uproar. And her Head of Lower School!\nIt was then that Mrs Mackay made mistake number one\nLeaving her form on its own while she went to see\nTo the forms of Miss Batt and Miss Dunn. The moment\nShe\u2019d gone, the room blossomed with paper planes\nInk bombs, whistles, snatches of song, and the class clown \u2013\nCaroline Joan \u2013 stood on her desk and took up\nThe speech where Mrs Mackay had left off \u2013 Lend\n\nMe your ears . . . just what the Second Form did\nIn the opposite room, reciting the Poets Laureate\nFor Miss Nadimbaba \u2013 John Dryden, Thomas Shadwell\nNahum Tate, Nicholas Rowe, Laurence Eusden, Colley Cibber\nWilliam Whitehead . . . but scattering titters and giggles\nLike noisy confetti on reaching Henry Pye as Carline Joan\nBelted out Antony\u2019s speech in an Elvis style \u2013\nFor Brutus, uh huh huh, is an honourable man\nMiss Nadimbaba, no fan of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, could scarcely\nBelieve her ears, deducing at once that Mrs Mackay\nWas not with her class. She popped an anxious head\nOutside her door. Anarchy roared in her face\nLike a tropical wind. The corridor clock was at four\n\nThe last bell rang. Although they would later regret it\nThe teachers, taking their cue from wits-end Mrs Mackay\nAllowed the chuckling, bright-eyed, mirthful girls\nTo go home, reprimand-free, each woman privately glad\nThat the dark afternoon was over and done\nThe chalky words rubbed away to dance as dust\nOn the air, the dates, the battles, the kings and queens\nThe rivers and tributaries, poets, painters, playwrights\nPoliticos, popes . . . but they all agreed to make it quite clear\nIn tomorrow\u2019s Assembly that foolish behaviour \u2013\nEven if only the once \u2013 wasn\u2019t admired or desired\nAt Stafford Girls\u2019 High. Above the school, the moon\nWas pinned like a monitor\u2019s badge to the sky\nMiss Dunn was the first to depart, wheeling\nHer bicycle through the gates, noticing how\nThe sky had cleared, a tidy diagram of the Plough\nDirectly above. She liked it this cold, her breath\nChiffoning out behind as she freewheeled home\nDown the hill, her mind emptying itself of geography\nOf mountains and seas and deserts and forests\nAnd capital cities. Her small terraced house looked\nShe thought, like a sleeping face. She roused it\nEach evening, kisses of light on its cheeks\nFrom her lamps, the small talk of cutlery, pots\nAnd pans as she cooked, sweet silver steam caressing\nThe shy rooms of her home. Miss Dunn live alone\n\nSo did Miss Batt, in a flat on the edge of the park\nNear the school; though this evening Miss Fife\nWas coming for supper. The two were good friends\nAnd Miss Fife liked to play on Miss Batt\u2019s small piano\nAfter the meal and the slowly shared carafe of wine\nMusic and Maths! Johann Sebastian Bach! Miss Batt\nAn all-rounder, took out her marking \u2013 essays on Henry VIII\nAnd his wives from the Fifth \u2013 while Miss Fife gave herself up\nTo Minuet in G. In between Catherine Howard\nAnd Catherine Parr, Miss Batt glanced across at Fifi\u2019s\nStraight back as she played, each teacher conscious\nOf each woman\u2019s silently virtuous love. Nights like this\nTwice a week, after school, for them both, seemed enough\n\nMrs Mackay often gave Miss Nadimbaba a lift\nAs they both, by coincidence, lived on Mulberry Drive \u2013\nMrs Mackay with her husband of twenty-five grinding\nChildless years; Miss Nadimbaba sharing a house\nWith her elderly aunt. Neither had ever invited\nThe other one in, although each would politely enquire\nAfter her colleague\u2019s invisible half. Mrs Mackay\nWatched Miss Nadimbaba open her purple door and saw\nA cat rubbing itself on her calf. She pulled away\nFrom the kerb, worrying whether Mr Mackay would insist\nOn fish for his meal. Then he would do his crossword:\nMr Mackay calling out clues \u2013 Kind of court for a bounder (8) \u2013\nWhile she passed him Roget, Brewer, Pears, the OED\n\nThe women teachers of England slept in their beds\nTheir shrewd or wise or sensible heads safe vessels\nFor Othello\u2019s jealousy, the Wife of Bath\u2019s warm laugh\nThe phases of the moon, the country code;\nFor Roman numerals, Greek alphabets, French verbs;\nFor foreign currencies and Latin roots, for logarithms, tables\nQuotes; the meanings of current calamo and fiat lux and stet\nMiss Dunn dreamed of a freezing white terrain\nWhere slowly moving elephants were made of ice\nMiss Nadimbaba dreamed she knelt to kiss Miss Barrett\nOn her couch and she, Miss Nadimbaba, was Browning\nSaying Beloved, be my wife . . . and then a dog began to bark\nAnd she woke up. Miss Batt dreamed of Miss Fife\n\n* * *\n\nMorning assembly \u2013 the world like Quink outside\nThe teachers perched in a solemn row on the stage\nThe Fifth and Sixth Forms clever and tall, Miss Fife\nAt the school piano, the Head herself, Doctor Bream\nAt the stand \u2013 was a serious affair. Jerusalem hung\nIn the air till the last of Miss Fife\u2019s big chords\nWobbled away. Yesterday, intoned Doctor Bream\nThe Lower school behaved in a foolish way, sniggering\nFor the most of the late afternoon. She glared at the girls\nThrough her pince-nez and paused for dramatic effect\nBut the First and Second and Third and Fourth Forms\nStarted to laugh, each girl trying to swallow it down\nTill the sound was like distant thunder, the opening chord\n\nOf a storm. Miss Dunn and Miss Batt, Miss Nadimbaba\nAnd Mrs Mackay leapt to their feet as one, grim-faced\nThe Fifth Form hooted and howled. Miss Fife, oddly disturbed\nCrashed down fistfuls of furious notes on the yellowing keys\nThe Sixth Forms, upper and lower, shrieked. Se\u00f1ora Devizes\nSartorial, strict, slim, server teacher of Spanish\nStalked from the stage and stilettoed sharply down\nTo the back of the Hall to chastise the Fifth and Sixth\n\u00a1Callaos! \u00a1Callaos! \u00a1Callaos! \u00a1Qu\u00e9dense! The whole school\nGuffawed; their pink young lungs flowering more\nThan they had for the hymn. \u00a1El clamor! The Hall was a zoo\nSnow began falling outside as though the clouds\nWere being slowly torn up like a rule book. A good laugh\n\nAs the poet Ursula Fleur, who attended the school\nWas to famously write, is feasting on air. The air that day\nWas chomped, chewed, bitten in two, pulled apart\nLike a wishbone, licked like a lollipop, sluiced and sucked\nSome of the girls were almost sick. Girls gulped or sipped\nOr slurped as they savoured the joke. What joke?\nNobody knew. A silly joy sparkled and fizzed. Tabitha Rose\nFlower monitor for the day, wet herself, wailed, wept, ran\nFrom the Hall, a small human shower of rain. The bell\nFor the start of lessons rang. Somehow the school\nFiled out in a raggedly line. The Head Girl, Josephine June\nScarlet-faced from killing herself, was in for a terrible time\nWith the Head. Snow iced the school like a giant cake\n\nNo one on record recalls the words that were said\nBut Josephine June was stripped of the Head Girl\u2019s badge\nAnd sash and sent to the Sixth Form Common Room\nTo demand of the prefects how they could hope to grow to be\nThe finest of England\u2019s daughters and mothers and wives\nAfter this morning\u2019s Assembly\u2019s abysmal affair?\nBut the crowd of girls gave a massive cheer, stamping\nThe floor with their feet in a rebel beat and Diana Kim\nCaptain of Sports, jumped on a chair and declared\nThat if J.J. was no longer Head Girl then no one\nWould take her place. All for one! Someone yelled. And one\nFor all! Diana Kim opened the window and jumped down\nInto the snow. With a shriek, Emmeline Bell jumped after her\n\nFollowed by cackling Anthea Meg, Melanie Hope, Andrea Lyn\nJ.J. herself . . . It was Gillian Tess in the Fifth, being lectured\nBy tight-lipped Se\u00f1ora Devizes on how to behave, who glanced\nFrom the first-floor window and noticed the Sixth Form\nBouncing around in the snow like girls on the moon\nA snowball, the size of a netball, was creaking, rolling\nGrowing under their hands. Look! Girls at their windows gaped\nIt grew from a ball to the size of a classroom globe. It grew\nFrom a globe to the size of a huge balloon. Miss Dunn\nDrumming the world\u2019s highest mountains into the heads\nOf the First Years \u2013 Everest, K2, Kangchenjunga, Lhoste, Makalu 1\nFlung open her window and breathed in the passionate cold\nOf the snow. A wild thought seeded itself in her head\nIn later years, the size of the snowball rolled by the Sixth\nGrew like a legend. Some claimed that the Head, as it groaned\nPast her study, thought that there might have been an eclipse\nUrsula Fleur, in her prose poem Snow, wrote that it took\nThe rest of the Michaelmas Term to melt. Miss Batt\nVacantly staring down as her class wrote out a list\nOf the monarchs of England \u2013 Egbert, Ethelwulf, Ethelbald\nEthelbert, Ethelred, Alfred, Edward, Athelstan, Edmund\nEadred, Eadwing, Edgar . . . noticed the snowball, huge and alone\nOn the hockey pitch, startlingly white in the pencil grey\nOf the light, and thought of desire, of piano scales slowing\nSlowing, breasts. She moaned aloud, forgetful of where\nShe was. Francesca Eve echoed the moan. The class roared\n\nBut that night Miss Batt, while she cooked for Miss Fife\nWho was opening the wine with a corkscrew\nFrom the last year\u2019s school trip to Sienna and Florence\nFelt herself naked, electric under her tartan skirt, twin set\nAnd pearls; and later, Miss Fife at the piano, stroking\nThe first notes of Beethoven\u2019s \u2018Moonlight\u2019 Sonata, Miss Batt\nCame behind her, placing her inked and trembling hands\nOn her shoulders. A broken A minor chord stumbled\nAnd died. Miss Fife said that Ludwig could only\nHave written this piece when he was in love. Miss Batt\nPulled Miss Fife by the hair, turning her face around, hearing\nHer gasp, bending down, kissing her, kissing her, kissing her\nEssays on Cardinal Wolsey lay unmarked on the floor\n\nAcross the hushed white park, down the slush of the hill\nMiss Dunn crouched on the floor of her sitting room\nOver a map of Tibet. The whisky glass in her nervous hand\nClunked on her teeth, Talisker sheathing her tongue\nIn a heroine\u2019s warmth. She moved her finger slowly\nOver the map, the roof of the world. Her fingers walked to Nepal\nChanging the mountain Chomulungma to Sagarmatha\nShe sipped at her malt and thought about Mallory, lost\nOn Everest\u2019s slopes with his English Air, of how he\u2019d wanted\nTo reach the summit because it was there. She wondered\nWhether he had. Nobody knew. She was herself walking\nThe upper slopes with the Captain of Sports towards\nThe foetal shape of a sleeping man . . . She turned to the girl\n\n* * *\n\nThat Monday morning Doctor Bream, at her desk\nDidn\u2019t yet know that the laughter of Stafford Girls\u2019 High\nWould not go away. But when she stood on the stage\nGarbed in her Cambridge cap and gown, and told the school\nTo quietly stand and contemplate a fresh and serious start\nTo the week, and closed her eyes \u2013 the hush like an air balloon\nTethered with ropes \u2013 a low and vulgar giggle yanked\nAt the silence. Doctor Bream kept her eyes clenched, hoping\nThat if she ignored it all would be well. Clumps of laughter\nSprouted among the row upon row of girls. Doctor Bream\nDetermined and blind, started the morning\u2019s hymn. I vow\nTo thee my country . . . A flushed Miss Fife started to play\nAll earthly things above . . . The rest of the staff joined in \u2013\n\nEntire and whole and perfect, the service of my love\nThe love that asks no questions, the love that stands the test\nBut the girls were hysterical, watching the Head\nQueen Canute, singing against the tide of their mirth\nTheir shoals, their glittering laughter. She opened her eyes \u2013\nClarice Maud Bream, MBE, DLitt \u2013 and saw, in the giggling sea\nOne face which seemed to her to be worse, cheekier\nRedder and louder, than all of the rest. Nigella Dawn\nWas fished by the Head from her seat and made to stand\nOn a chair on the stage. Laughter drained from the Hall. This girl\nBoomed the Head, will stand on this chair for as long as it takes\nFor the school to come to its senses. SILENCE! The whole school\nStood like a crowd waiting for news. The bell rang. Nobody\n\nMoved. Nobody made a sound. Minutes slinked away\nAs Nigella Dawn swayed on her creaky chair. The First Years\nStared in shame at their shoes. The Head\u2019s tight smile\nWas a tick. That, she thought, in a phrase of her mother\u2019s\nHas put the tin lid on that. A thin high whine, a kitten\nWind on a wire, came from behind. The school\nSeemed to hold its breath. Nigella Dawn shook on her chair\nThe sound came again, louder. Doctor Bream looked to the staff\nMiss Batt had her head in her lap and was keening and rocking\nBackwards and forwards. The noise put the Head in mind\nOf a radio dial \u2013 Luxembourg, Light, Hilversum, Welsh \u2013\nAs though the woman were trying to tune in to herself. Miss Batt\nFlung her head back and laughed, laughed like a bride\n\n* * *\n\nMr and Mrs Mackay silently ate. She eyed him\nBoning his fish, slicking it down to the backbone\nSliding the skeleton out, fastidious, deft. She spied him\nEat from the right of his plate to the left, ordered, precise\nShe clenched herself for his voice. A very nice dish\nFrom the bottomless deep. Bad words ran in her head like mice\nShe wanted to write them down like crossword lights\n14 Across: F . . . 17 Down: F . . . . . . 2 Down: F\nMr Mackay reached for the OED. She bit her lip. A word\nFor one who is given to walking by night, not necessarily\nIn sleep. She felt her heart flare in its dark cave, hungry, blind\nOpen in its small beak. Beginning with N. Mrs Mackay\nMoved to the window and stared at the ravenous night. Later\n\nAwake in the beached boat of the marital bed, Mrs Mackay\nSlid from between the sheets. Her spouse whistled and whined\nShe dressed in sweater and slacks, in boots, in her old tweed coat\nAnd slipped from the house with a tut of the front door snib\nHer breath swaggered away like a genie popped from a flask\nShe looked for the moon, found it, arched high over the house\nA raised eyebrow of light, and started to walk. The streets\nWere empty, darkly sparkling under her feet, ribbons that tied\nThe sleeping town like a gift. A black cat glared from a wall\nMrs Mackay walked and walked, letting the night\nSigh underneath her clothes, perfume her skin; letting it in\nThe scented night \u2013 stone, starlight, tree-sleep, rat, owl\nA calm rhythm measured itself in her head. Noctambulist\nShe walked for hours, till dawn\u2019s soft tip rubbed, smudged\nErased the dark. Back home, she stripped and washed\nAnd dressed for school, moving about in the kitchen\nTill Mr Mackay appeared, requesting a four-minute egg\nFrom a satisfied hen. She watched him slice off the top\nWith the side of his spoon, dip in his toast, savour the soft gold\nOf the yolk with his neat tongue. She thought of the girls\nHow they\u2019d laughed now for weeks. Panic nipped and salted\nHer eyes. And later that day, walking among the giggling desks\nOf the Third, she read Cleopatra\u2019s lament in a shaking voice\nAs tears shone on her cheeks: Hast thou no care for me?\nShall I abide in this dull word, which in thy absence is\nNo better than sty? O! see my women, the crown\n\nO\u2019 the earth doth melt. My lord! O! withered is the garland\nOf the war, the soldier\u2019s pole is fall\u2019n; young boys and girls\nAre level now with men; the odds is gone, and there is nothing\nLeft remarkable beneath the visiting moon. Carolann Clare, trapped\nIn a breathless crippling laugh, seriously thought she would die\nMrs Mackay lay down her book and asked the girls to start\nFrom the top and carry on reading the play round the class\nShe closed her eyes and seemed to drift off at her desk\nThe voices of girls shared Shakespeare, line by line, the clock\nOver the blackboard crumbling its minutes into the dusty air\nFrom the other side of the wall, light breezes of laughter came\nAnd went. Further away, from the music, room, the sound\nOf the orchestra hooted and sneered its way through Grieg\n\nMiss Batt, in the staffroom, marking The War of Jenkins\u2019 Ear\nOver and over again, put down her pen. Music reminded her\nOf Miss Fife. She lay her head on the table, dizzy with lust, longed\nFor the four o\u2019clock bell, for home, for pasta and vino rosso\nFor Fifi\u2019s body on hers in the single bed, for kisses that tasted\nOf jotters, of wine. She picked up an essay and read:\nEngland went to war with Spain because a seaman, Robert\nJenkins, claimed that the Spanish thought him a smuggler\nAnd cut off his ear. He showed the ear in the Commons\nAnd public opinion forced the Government to declare war\nOn October 23, 1739 . . . Miss Batt cursed under her breath\nSlashing a red tick with her pen. The music had stopped. Hilarity\nSquealed and screeched in its place down the corridor\n\nMiss Nadimbaba was teaching the poems of Yeats\nTo the Fifth when the girls in the orchestra laughed. She held\nIn her hands the poem which made her a scribbler of verse\nAt twelve or thirteen. \u2018The Song\u2019 \u2013 she was sick of the laughter\nAt Stafford Girls\u2019 High \u2013 \u2018of Wandering Aengus.\u2019 She stared\nAt the girls in her class who were starting to shake. An epidemic\nThat\u2019s what it was. It had gone on all term. It was now the air\nThat they breathed, teachers and girls: a giggling, sniggering\nGurgling, snickering atmosphere, a laughing gas that seeped\nUnder doors, up corridors, into the gym, the chemistry lab\nThe swimming pool, into Latin and Spanish and French and Greek\nInto Needlework, History, Art, R.K., P.E., into cross-country runs\nInto the silver apples of the moon, the golden apples of the sun\n\nMiss Dunn stood with her bike outside school after four\nScanning the silly, cackling girls for a face \u2013 Diana Kim\u2019s\nThe Captain of Sports was tall, red-haired. Her green eyes\nStared at Miss Dunn and Miss Dunn knew. This was a girl\nWho would scale a vertical wall of ice with her fingertips\nWho would pitch a tent on the lip of a precipice, who would know\nWhen the light was good, when the wind was bad, when snow\nWas powdery or hard. The girl had the stuff of heroines. Diana Kim\nWalked with the teacher, pushing her bicycle for her, hearing her\nOutline the journey, the great adventure, the climb to the Mother\nOf Earth. Something inside her opened and bloomed\nMiss Dunn was her destiny, fame, a strong hand pulling her\nHigher and higher into the far Tibetan clouds, into the sun\n\n* * *\n\nDoctor Bream was well aware that something had to be done\nLaughter, it seemed, was on the curriculum. The girls\nFound everything funny, strange; howled or screamed\nAt the slightest thing. The Headmistress prowled the school\nListening at classroom doors. The new teacher, Mrs Munro\nWas reading The Flaying of Marsyas to the Third: Help!\nWhy are you stripping me from myself? The girls were in fits\nMrs Munro\u2019s tight voice struggled on: It was possible to count\nHis throbbing organs and the chambers of his lungs. Shrieks\nAnd squeals stabbed the air. Why? At what? Doctor Bream\nSnooped on. Miss Batt was teaching the First Form the names\nOf the nine major planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus . . . Pandemonium hooted and whooped\n\nThe grim Head passed down the corridor, hearing the Fifth Form\nGargling its way through the Diet of Worms. She came\nTo the Honours Board, the names of the old girls written in gold \u2013\nHead Girls who had passed into legend, Captains of Sport\nWho had played the game, prize-winning girls, girls who\u2019d gone on\nTo achieve great things. Members of Parliament! Blasts of laughter\nBelched from the playing fields. Doctor Bream walked to her room\nAnd stood by her desk. Her certificates preened behind glass\nIn the wintery light. Silver medals and trophies and cups gleamed\nIn the cabinet. She went to the wall \u2013 the school photograph\nGlinted and glowed, each face like a fingertip; the pupils\nStraight-backed, straight-faced; the staff upright, straight-laced\nA warm giggle burbled outside. She flung open the door\n\nThe empty corridor winked. She could hear\nA distant piano practising F\u00fcr Elise . . . Se\u00f1ora Devizes\nCounting in Spanish in one of the rooms \u2013 uno, dos, tres\nCuatro, cinco, seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez, once, doce\nTrece, catorce, quince, diez y seis, diez y siete, diez y ocho\nA shrill whistle blowing outside . . . But then a burst of hysteria\nCame from the classroom above, rolled down the stairs\nExploded again the classroom below. Mrs Mackay\nFrantic, hoarse, could be heard pitching Portia\u2019s speech\nOver the hoots of the Fourth: The quality of MERCY\nIs not STRAINED. It droppeth as the gentle rain from HEAVEN\nUpon the place BENEATH . . . Cackles, like gunfire, crackled\nAnd spat through the school. A cheer boomed from the Gym\n\nIt went on thus \u2013 through every hymn or poem, catechism\nLogarithm, sum, exam; in every classroom, drama room\nTo music room; on school trips to a factory or farm; from\nFirst to Sixth Form, dunce to academic cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\nDay in, day out; till, towards the end of the Hilary Term\nDoctor Bream called yet another meeting in the Staffroom\nDetermined now to solve the problem of the laughter\nOf the girls once and for all. The staff filed in at 4.15 \u2013\nMiss Batt, Miss Fife, Miss Dunn, Mrs Munro, the sporty\nMrs Lee, Mrs Mackay, Miss Nadimbaba, the Heads of French\nAnd Science \u2013 Miss Feaver, Mirs Kaye \u2013 Se\u00f1ora Devizes\nThe tuneful Miss Aherne, the part-time drama teacher\nMrs Prendergast. The Head stood up and clapped her hands\n\nMiss Fife poured Earl Grey tea. Miss Dunn stood by the window\nStaring out. Miss Batt burned at Miss Fife. Mrs Mackay\nSat down and closed her eyes. Miss Nadimbaba churned\nThe closing couplet of a poem in her head. Miss Feaver\nCrossed her legs and smiled at Mrs Lee, who twirled\nA squash racquet between her rosy knees. I think we all agree\nSaid Doctor Bream, that things are past the pale. The girls\nAre learning nothing. Discipline\u2019s completely gone\nTo pot. I\u2019d like to hear from each of you in turn. Mrs Mackay?\nMrs Mackay opened her eyes and sighed. And shook her head\nAnd then she started singing: It was a lover and his lass\nWith a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonimo, that o\u2019er\nThe green cornfield did pass, in the spring time\n\nThe only pretty ring time, when birds do sing, hey ding\nA ding, ding; sweet lovers love the spring. A silence fell\nMiss Batt looked at Miss Fife and cleared her throat. Miss Fife\nAnd I are leaving at the end of term. Miss Dunn at the window\nTurned. I\u2019m leaving then myself. To have a crack at Everest\nThe Head sank to a chair. Miss Nadimbaba stood. Then one by one\nThe staff resigned \u2013 to publish poetry, to live in Spain, to form\nA tennis club, to run a restaurant in Nice, to tread the boards\nTo sing in smoky clubs, to translate Ovid into current speech\nTo study homeopathy. Doctor Bream was white with shock\nAnd what, she forced herself at last to say, about the girls?\nMiss Batt, slowly undressing Fifi in the stockroom in her head\nWinked at Miss Fife. She giggled girlishly. Miss Feaver laughed\n\n* * *\n\nSmall hours. The moon tracked Mrs Mackay as she reached the edge\nOf the sleeping town, houses dwindling to fields, the road\nTwisting up and away into the distant hills. She caught her mid\nMaking anagrams \u2013 grow heed, stab, rats \u2013 and forced herself\nTo chant aloud as she walked. Hedgerow. Bats. Star. Her head\nCleared. The town was below her now, dark and hunched\nA giant husband bunched in his sleep. Mrs Mackay climbed on\nHigher and higher, keeping close to the ditch, till the road snaked\nInto a long S then levelled out into open countryside. Shore\nLove, steer, low, master, night loom, riven use, no. Horse. Vole\nTrees. Owl. Stream. Moonlight. Universe. On. Wed, loop, wand\nDrib, tiles, pay thaw, god. Dew. Pool. Dawn. Bird. Stile. Pathway\nDog. She arrived at the fringe of a village as morning broke\n\nMiss Batt held Miss Fife in her arms at dawn, the small room\nChaste with new light. Miss Fife began to talk in her sleep \u2013\nThe square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum\nOf the squares of the other two sides. Miss Batt slid down\nNuzzled her breastbone, her stomach, kissed down, kissed down\nDown to the triangle. The tutting bedside clock\nCounted to five. They woke again at seven, stupid with love\nEverything they knew \u2013 the brightest stars, Sirius, Canopus\nAlpha Centauri, Vega; the Roman Emperors, Claudius\nNero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius; musical terms, allegro, calando\nCrescendo, glissando; mathematics, the value of pi\nPrime numbers, Cantor\u2019s infinities \u2013 only a jumble of words\nA jumble of words. A long deep zero groaned from Miss Fife\n\nMiss Dunn took out her list and checked it again\nHer class was sniggering its way through a test on Britain\u2019s largest lakes\nShe mouthed her list like a prayer: socks, mittens, shirt, leggings\nHat, face mask, goggles, harness, karabiners, ice screws, pitons\nHelmet, descender, ascender, loops, slings, ice axe, gaiters\nCrampons, boots, jacket, hood, trousers, water bottle, urine\nBottle, waste bags, sleeping bag, kit bag, head torch, batteries\nTent, medical kit, maps, stove, butane, radio, fixing line, rope\nCord, stoppers, wands, stakes and chocks and all of it twice\nA sprinkle of giggles made her look up. Pass your test to the girl\nOn your left to be marked. The answers are: Lough Neagh\nLower Lough Erne, Loch Lomond, Loch Ness, Loch Awe, Upper\nLough Erne . . . Diana Kim climbed and climbed in her head\n\nDoctor Bream read through the letter to parents then signed\nHer name at the end. The school was to close at the end of term\nUntil further notice. A dozen resignation notes from the staff lay\nOn her desk. The Head put her head in her hands and wept\nA local journalist lurked at the gates. Se\u00f1ora Devizes\nAnd Miss Nadimbaba entered the room to say that the girls\nWere filing into the Hall for the Special Assembly. There was still\nNo sign of Mrs Mackay. She looked at the shattered Head\nAnd Kipling sprang to Miss Nadimbaba\u2019s lips: If you can force\nYour heart and nerve and sinew to server your turn long after they\nAre gone . . . Se\u00f1ora Devizes joined in: Persiste aun no tengas\nFuerza, y s\u00f3lo te quede la voluntad que les dice:\n\u00a1Persiste! The Head got to her feet and straightened her back\n\nAnd so, Doctor Bream summed up, you girls have laughed this once\nGreat school into the ground. Se\u00f1ora Devizes plans to return\nTo Spain. Cries of \u00a1Ol\u00e9! Miss Batt and Miss Fife have resigned\nWolf whistles. Mrs Prendergast is joining the Theatre Royale\nA round of applause crashed on the boards like surf. The Head stared\nAt the laughing girls then turned and marched from the stage\nClipped up the polished corridor, banged through the double doors\nCrunched down the gravel drive to the Staff Car Park and into her car\nElvis, shrieked Caroline Joan from the Hall, has left the building\nA cheer like an avalanche bounced off the roof. The Captain of Sports\nSlipped from her seat and followed Miss Dunn. The girls burst\nInto song as their mute teachers walked from the stage. Till we\nHave built Jerusalem in England\u2019s green and pleasant land\n\n* * *\n\nThe empty school creaked and sighed, its desks the small coffins\nOf lessons, its blackboards the tombstones of learning. The books\nIn the Library stiffened and yellowed and curled. The portraits\nOf gone Headmistresses stared into space. The school groaned\nThe tiles on its roof falling off in its sleep, its windows as white\nAs chalk. The grass on the playing fields grew like grass\nOn a grave. Doctor Bream stared from her hospital window\nOver the fields. She could see the school bell in its tower glint\nIn the evening sun like a tear in an eye. She turned away. Postcards\nAnd get-well messages from the staff were pinned to the wall\nShe took down a picture of Everest from Miss Dunn: We leave\nCamp II tomorrow if the weather holds to climb the Corridor\nTo 21,000 feet. Both coping well with altitude. The Sherpas\n\nMrs Mackay walked through Glen Strathfarrar, mad, muttering\nFree; a filthy old pack on her back filled with scavenged loot \u2013\nBanana, bottle, blanket, balaclava, bread, blade, bible. She sat\nBy a stream, filled her bottle and drank. She ate the crusts\nThe fruit. Kingfisher. Eagle. Heron. Red deer. Midge. The Glen\nDarkened and cooled like History. Mrs Mackay lay in the heather\nUnder her blanket, mumbling lines from Lear: As mad as the vex\u2019d\nSea; singing aloud; crowned with rank fumitory and furrow weeds\nWith burdocks, hemlocks, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, darnel\nSyllables. Syllables. Sleep came suddenly, under the huge black\nThe chuckling clever stars. The Head at her window looked north\nTo the clear night sky, to Pollux and Castor, Capella, Polaris\nAnd wondered again what could have become of Mrs Mackay\n\nRough lads from the town came up to the school to throw stones\nThrough the glass. Miss Batt and Miss Fife had moved\nTo a city. They drank in a dark bar where women danced, cheek\nTo cheek. Miss Batt loved Miss Fife till she sobbed and shook\nIn her arms. Stray cats prowled through the classrooms, lunging\nAt mice. Miss Fife dreamed that the school was a huge ship\nFloating away from land, all hands lost, steered by a ghost\nA woman whose face was the Head\u2019s, was Miss Nadimbaba\u2019s\nThen Mrs Mackay\u2019s, Mrs Lee\u2019s, Miss Feaver\u2019s, Miss Dunn\u2019s\nMrs Munro\u2019s, Mrs Kaye\u2019s, Miss Aherne\u2019s, Se\u00f1ora Devizes\u2019\nShe woke in the darkness, a face over hers, a warm mouth\nKissing the gibberish from her lips. The school sank in her mind\nA black wave taking it down as she gazed at the woman\u2019s face\n\nMiss Nadimbaba put down her pen and read through her poem\nThe palms of her hands felt light, that talented ache\nShe altered a verb and the line jumped on the page like a hooked fish. She needed\nTo type it up, but the poem was done. She was dying\nTo read it aloud to her aunt. She would open some wine\nIn the hospital, a nurse brought warm milk and a pill to the Head\nWho stared through the bars at the blackened hulk of the school\nBy dawn, at John O\u2019Groats, Mrs Mackay had finally run out of land\nShe wrote her maiden name with a stick in the sand then walked\nInto the sea, steady at first, step by step, till the firm waves lifted her\nUnder the arms and danced her away like a groom with a bride\nHigh above in the cold sky the seagulls, like schoolgirls, laughed\nHigher again, a teacher fell through the clouds with a girl in her armsEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

of Sand and Shovels LyricsWhen I noticed her the first time\nI was outside running barefoot in the rain\nShe lived in the house next door\nHer nose was pressed against the window pane\nWhen I looked at her she smiled\nAnd showed a place where two teeth used to be\nAnd I heard her ask her mom if she\nCould come outside and play with me\nSoon the day's of sand and shovels\nGave way to the mysteries of life\nThen I noticed she was changing and I\nLooked at her through different eyes\nWe became as one and knew a love\nWithout beginning or an end\nAnd everyday I lived with her\nWas like a new day dawning once again\nAnd I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple\nSoda pop was still a nickel\nJam was on her fingertips\nMilk was circled on her lips\nAfter many years our live grew\nSilent and at night I heard her cry\nAnd when she left me in the fall I knew\nThat it would be our last goodbye\nI was man enough to give her\nEverything she needed for a while\nAnd searching for a perfect love\nI found that I could not give her a child\nNow she lives a quiet life\nAnd is the mother of a little girl\nEvery time I pass her house\nMy thoughts go back into another world\nBecause I see her little girl\nHer nose is pressed against the window pane\nShe thinks I'm a lonely man\nWho wants to come inside out of the rain\nAnd I've loved her since every doll was shirley Temple\nSoda pop was still a nickel\nJam was on her fingertips\nMilk was circled on her lipsYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1677170", "artist_names": "The Monkees",

The postmark reveals that it comes from the city of Ephesus. After opening the letter I discovered that it was written in Greek rather than English. At the top of the first page was this request: \"Please read to your congregation as soon as possible, and then pass on to the other churches.\"\n\nFor several weeks I have worked assiduously with the translation. At times it has been difficult, but now I think I have deciphered its true meaning. May I hasten to say that if in presenting this letter the contents sound strangely Kingian instead of Paulinian, attribute it to my lack of complete objectivity rather than Paul's lack of clarity.\n\nIt is miraculous, indeed, that the Apostle Paul should be writing a letter to you and to me nearly 1900 years after his last letter appeared in the New Testament. How this is possible is something of an enigma wrapped in mystery. The important thing, however, is that I can imagine the Apostle Paul writing a letter to American Christians in 1956 A.D. And here is the letter as it stands before me.\n\n\"I, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to you who are in America, Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\n\"For many years I have longed to be able to come to see you. I have heard so much of you and of what you are doing. I have heard of the fascinating and astounding advances that you have made in the scientific realm. I have heard of your dashing subways and flashing airplanes. Through your scientific genius you have been able to dwarf distance and place time in chains. You have been able to carve highways through the stratosphere. So in your world you have made it possible to eat breakfast in New York City and dinner in Paris, France. I have also heard of your skyscraping buildings with their prodigious towers steeping heavenward. I have heard of your great medical advances, which have resulted in the curing of many dread plagues and diseases, and thereby prolonged your lives and made for greater security and physical well-being. All of that is marvelous. You can do so many things in your day that I could not do in the Greco-Roman world of my day. In your age you can travel distances in one day that took me three months to travel. That is wonderful. You have made tremendous strides in the area of scientific and technological development.\n\n\"But America, as I look at you from afar, I wonder whether your moral and spiritual progress has been commensurate with your scientific progress. It seems to me that your moral progress lags behind your scientific progress. Your poet Thoreau used to talk about 'improved means to an unimproved end.' How often this is true. You have allowed the material means by which you live to outdistance the spiritual ends for which you live. You have allowed your mentality to outrun your morality. You have allowed your civilization to outdistance your culture. Through your scientific genius you have made of the world a neighborhood, but through your moral and spiritual genius you have failed to make of it a brotherhood. So America, I would urge you to keep your moral advances abreast with your scientific advances.\n\"I am impelled to write you concerning the responsibilities laid upon you to live as Christians in the midst of an unChristian world. That is what I had to do. That is what every Christian has to do. But I understand that there are many Christians in America who give their ultimate allegiance to man-made systems and customs. They are afraid to be different. Their great concern is to be accepted socially. They live by some such principle as this: 'everybody is doing it, so it must be alright.' For so many of you Morality is merely group consensus. In your modern sociological lingo, the mores are accepted as the right ways. You have unconsciously come to believe that right is discovered by taking a sort of Gallup poll of the majority opinion. How many are giving their ultimate allegiance to this way.\n\n\"But American Christians, I must say to you as I said to the Roman Christians years ago, 'Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.' Or, as I said to the Phillipian Christians, 'Ye are a colony of heaven.' This means that although you live in the colony of time, your ultimate allegiance is to the empire of eternity. You have a dual citizenry. You live both in time and eternity; both in heaven and earth. Therefore, your ultimate allegiance is not to the government, not to the state, not to nation, not to any man-made institution. The Christian owes his ultimate allegiance to God, and if any earthly institution conflicts with God's will it is your Christian duty to take a stand against it. You must never allow the transitory evanescent demands of man-made institutions to take precedence over the eternal demands of the Almighty God.\n\n\"I understand that you have an economic system in America known as Capitalism. Through this economic system you have been able to do wonders. You have become the richest nation in the world, and you have built up the greatest system of production that history has ever known. All of this is marvelous. But Americans, there is the danger that you will misuse your Capitalism. I still contend that money can be the root of all evil. It can cause one to live a life of gross materialism. I am afraid that many among you are more concerned about making a living than making a life. You are prone to judge the success of your profession by the index of your salary and the size of the wheel base on your automobile, rather than the quality of your service to humanity.\n\n\"The misuse of Capitalism can also lead to tragic exploitation. This has so often happened in your nation. They tell me that one tenth of one percent of the population controls more than forty percent of the wealth. Oh America, how often have you taken necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes. If you are to be a truly Christian nation you must solve this problem. You cannot solve the problem by turning to communism, for communism is based on an ethical relativism and a metaphysical materialism that no Christian can accept. You can work within the framework of democracy to bring about a better distribution of wealth. You can use your powerful economic resources to wipe poverty from the face of the earth. God never intended for one group of people to live in superfluous inordinate wealth, while others live in abject deadening poverty. God intends for all of his children to have the basic necessities of life, and he has left in this universe 'enough and to spare' for that purpose. So I call upon you to bridge the gulf between abject poverty and superfluous wealth.\n\n\"I would that I could be with you in person, so that I could say to you face to face what I am forced to say to you in writing. Oh, how I long to share your fellowship.\n\n\"Let me rush on to say something about the church. Americans, I must remind you, as I have said to so many others, that the church is the Body of Christ. So when the church is true to its nature it knows neither division nor disunity. But I am disturbed about what you are doing to the Body of Christ. They tell me that in America you have within Protestantism more than two hundred and fifty six denominations. The tragedy is not so much that you have such a multiplicity of denominations, but that most of them are warring against each other with a claim to absolute truth. This narrow sectarianism is destroying the unity of the Body of Christ. You must come to see that God is neither a Baptist nor a Methodist; He is neither a Presbyterian nor a Episcopalian. God is bigger than all of our denominations. If you are to be true witnesses for Christ, you must come to see that America.\n\n\"But I must not stop with a criticism of Protestantism. I am disturbed about Roman Catholicism. This church stands before the world with its pomp and power, insisting that it possesses the only truth. It incorporates an arrogance that becomes a dangerous spiritual arrogance. It stands with its noble Pope who somehow rises to the miraculous heights of infallibility when he speaks ex cathedra. But I am disturbed about a person or an institution that claims infallibility in this world. I am disturbed about any church that refuses to cooperate with other churches under the pretense that it is the only true church. I must emphasize the fact that God is not a Roman Catholic, and that the boundless sweep of his revelation cannot be limited to the Vatican. Roman Catholicism must do a great deal to mend its ways.\n\n\"There is another thing that disturbs me to no end about the American church. You have a white church and you have a Negro church. You have allowed segregation to creep into the doors of the church. How can such a division exist in the true Body of Christ? You must face the tragic fact that when you stand at 11:00 on Sunday morning to sing 'All Hail the Power of Jesus Name' and 'Dear Lord and Father of all Mankind,' you stand in the most segregated hour of Christian America. They tell me that there is more integration in the entertaining world and other secular agencies than there is in the Christian church. How appalling that is.\n\n\"I understand that there are Christians among you who try to justify segregation on the basis of the Bible. They argue that the Negro is inferior by nature because of Noah's curse upon the children of Ham. Oh my friends, this is blasphemy. This is against everything that the Christian religion stands for. I must say to you as I have said to so many Christians before, that in Christ 'there is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for we are all one in Christ Jesus.' Moreover, I must reiterate the words that I uttered on Mars Hill: 'God that made the world and all things therein . . . hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth.'\n\n\"So Americans I must urge you to get rid of every aspect of segregation. The broad universalism standing at the center of the gospel makes both the theory and practice of segregation morally unjustifiable. Segregation is a blatant denial of the unity which we all have in Christ. It substitutes an 'I-it' relationship for the 'I-thou' relationship. The segregator relegates the segregated to the status of a thing rather than elevate him to the status of a person. The underlying philosophy of Christianity is diametrically opposed to the underlying philosophy of segregation, and all the dialectics of the logicians cannot make them lie down together.\n\n\"I praise your Supreme Court for rendering a great decision just two or three years ago. I am happy to know that so many persons of goodwill have accepted the decision as a great moral victory. But I understand that there are some brothers among you who have risen up in open defiance. I hear that their legislative halls ring loud with such words as 'nullification' and 'interposition.' They have lost the true meaning of democracy and Christianity. So I would urge each of you to plead patiently with your brothers, and tell them that this isn't the way. With understanding goodwill, you are obligated to seek to change their attitudes. Let them know that in standing against integration, they are not only standing against the noble precepts of your democracy, but also against the eternal edicts of God himself. Yes America, there is still the need for an Amos to cry out to the nation: 'Let judgement roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.'\n\n\"May I say just a word to those of you who are struggling against this evil. Always be sure that you struggle with Christian methods and Christian weapons. Never succumb to the temptation of becoming bitter. As you press on for justice, be sure to move with dignity and discipline, using only the weapon of love. Let no man pull you so low as to hate him. Always avoid violence. If you succumb to the temptation of using violence in your struggle, unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness, and your chief legacy to the future will be an endless reign of meaningless chaos.\n\n\"In your struggle for justice, let your oppressor know that you are not attempting to defeat or humiliate him, or even to pay him back for injustices that he has heaped upon you. Let him know that you are merely seeking justice for him as well as yourself. Let him know that the festering sore of segregation debilitates the white man as well as the Negro. With this attitude you will be able to keep your struggle on high Christian standards.\n\"Many persons will realize the urgency of seeking to eradicate the evil of segregation. There will be many Negroes who will devote their lives to the cause of freedom. There will be many white persons of goodwill and strong moral sensitivity who will dare to take a stand for justice. Honesty impels me to admit that such a stand will require willingness to suffer and sacrifice. So don't despair if you are condemned and persecuted for righteousness' sake. Whenever you take a stand for truth and justice, you are liable to scorn. Often you will be called an impractical idealist or a dangerous radical. Sometimes it might mean going to jail. If such is the case you must honorably grace the jail with your presence. It might even mean physical death. But if physical death is the price that some must pay to free their children from a permanent life of psychological death, then nothing could be more Christian. Don't worry about persecution America; you are going to have that if you stand up for a great principle. I can say this with some authority, because my life was a continual round of persecutions. After my conversion I was rejected by the disciples at Jerusalem. Later I was tried for heresy at Jerusalem. I was jailed at Philippi, beaten at Thessalonica, mobbed at Ephesus, and depressed at Athens. And yet I am still going. I came away from each of these experiences more persuaded than ever before that 'neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come . . . shall separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' I still believe that standing up for the truth of God is the greatest thing in the world. This is the end of life. The end of life is not to be happy. The end of life is not to achieve pleasure and avoid pain. The end of life is to do the will of God, come what may.\n\n\"I must bring my writing to a close now. Timothy is waiting to deliver this letter, and I must take leave for another church. But just before leaving, I must say to you, as I said to the church at Corinth, that I still believe that love is the most durable power in the world. Over the centuries men have sought to discover the highest good. This has been the chief quest of ethical philosophy. This was one of the big questions of Greek philosophy. The Epicurean and the Stoics sought to answer it; Plato and Aristotle sought to answer it. What is the summon bonum of life? I think I have an answer America. I think I have discovered the highest good. It is love. This principle stands at the center of the cosmos. As John says, 'God is love. He who loves is a participant in the being of God. He who hates does not know God.'\n\n\"So American Christians, you may master the intricacies of the English language. You may possess all of the eloquence of articulate speech. But even if you 'speak with the tongues of man and angels, and have not love, you are become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.'\n\n\"You may have the gift of prophecy and understanding all mysteries. You may be able to break into the storehouse of nature and bring out many insights that men never dreamed were there. You may ascend to the heights of academic achievement, so that you will have all knowledge. You may boast of your great institutions of learning and the boundless extent of your degrees. But all of this amounts to absolutely nothing devoid of love.\n\n\"But even more Americans, you may give your goods to feed the poor. You may give great gifts to charity. You may tower high in philanthropy. But if you have not love it means nothing. You may even give your body to be burned, and die the death of a martyr. Your spilt blood may be a symbol of honor for generations yet unborn, and thousands may praise you as history's supreme hero. But even so, if you have not love your blood was spilt in vain. You must come to see that it is possible for a man to be self-centered in his self-denial and self-righteous in his self-sacrifice. He may be generous in order to feed his ego and pious in order to feed his pride. Man has the tragic capacity to relegate a heightening virtue to a tragic vice. Without love benevolence becomes egotism, and martyrdom becomes spiritual pride.\n\n\"So the greatest of all virtues is love. It is here that we find the true meaning of the Christian faith. This is at bottom the meaning of the cross. The great event on Calvary signifies more than a meaningless drama that took place on the stage of history. It is a telescope through which we look out into the long vista of eternity and see the love of God breaking forth into time. It is an eternal reminder to a power drunk generation that love is most durable power in the world, and that it is at bottom the heartbeat of the moral cosmos. Only through achieving this love can you expect to matriculate into the university of eternal life.\n\n\"I must say goodbye now. I hope this letter will find you strong in the faith. It is probable that I will not get to see you in America, but I will meet you in God's eternity. And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling, and lift us from the fatigue of despair to the buoyancy of hope, from the midnight of desperation to the daybreak of joy, to him be power and authority, forever and ever. Amen.\"7Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/970074", "artist_names": "Tommy Roe", "full_title": "Heather Honey by\u00a0Tommy\u00a0Roe", "header_image_thumbnail_url":

every highway\nAnd more, much more than this\nI did it my way\n\n[Verse 2]\nRegrets, I've had a few\nBut then again, too few to mention\nI did what I had to do\nAnd saw it through without exemption\nI planned each charted course\nEach careful step along the byway\nAnd more, much more than this\nI did it my way\n[Chorus]\nYes, there were times, I'm sure you knew\nWhen I bit off more than I could chew\nBut through it all, when there was doubt\nI ate it up and spit it out\nI faced it all, and I stood tall\nAnd did it my way\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've loved, I've laughed and cried\nI've had my fill, my share of losing\nAnd now, as tears subside\nI find it all so amusing\nTo think I did all that\nAnd may I say, not in a shy way\nOh, no, oh, no, not me\nI did it my way\n\n[Chorus]\nFor what is a man, what has he got?\nIf not himself, then he has naught\nTo say the things he truly feels\nAnd not the words of one who kneels\nThe record shows I took the blows\nAnd did it my way\nYou might also

me\nWe hardly had enough food or room to sleep\nIt was hard times\nNeeded something to ease my troubled mind\nListen! my father didn't know the meaning of work\nHe disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt\nI left home, seekin' a job that I never did find\nDepressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine\nI'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine\nListen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine\nFolks down there tell me\nThey say, \"give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by\"\nBut the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive\nIt's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie\nListen! it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night\nI'm doin' fine, on cloud nine\nLet me tell you about cloud nine\nCloud nine, you can be what you wanna be\n(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility\nAnd ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free\n(cloud nine) and you're a million miles from reality\nI wanna say I love the life I live\nAnd I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine\nI'm riding high\nOn cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight\n(cloud nine) there's no diff'rence between day and night\n(cloud nine) it's a world of love and harmony\n(cloud nine) you're a million miles from reality\n\nCloud nine, you can be what you wanna be\nCloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility\nAnd ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free\n(cloud nine) and

I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet\nI must have been insane\nI lied and said Mama died on a weekend trip to Spain\nShe never got out of the house, never even boarded a train\n\nMarried a guy, was living high, I didn't want him to know her\nShe had a grandson, 2 years old, that I never even showed her\n\nI'm living in shame\nMama, I miss you\nI know you're not to blame\nMama, I miss you\n\nCame a telegram\nMama passed away while making homemade jam\nBefore she died, she cried to see me by her side\nShe always did her best\nAh, cooking, cleaning, always in the same old dress\nWorking hard down on her knees, always trying to please\n\nMama, mama, mama, can you hear me?\nMama, mama, mama, can you hear me?\n\nI'm living in shame\nMama, I miss you\nI know

of hit and run\nTire tracks all across your back\nI can ha, I can see you had your fun\nBut uh, darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red\nAnd with you I can see a traffic jam straight

that you, you better get straight\n\nThey put a bible in a drawer\nOf the motel room\nAnd it's crying out to be read\nBut it stays right there, collecting dust\nNo one understands what's being

on me travels guide me\nThe Moon would shake and the stars would quake\nWhenever they espied me\n\nWith a host of furious fancies\nOf which I am Commander\nWith a burning spear and a horse of air\nTo the wilderness I wander\n\nBy a knight of ghosts and shadows\nI Summoned am to a tourney\nTen Leagues Beyond The Wild Worlds End\nMethinks it is no journey\n\nStill I Sing Bonny Boys, Bonny mad

have to hide\nAnd a thousand nights I'll kiss away (The happy tears you'll cry)\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we'll always be (always be)\nAlways together\nJust you, just me\nAlways (Together), always (Together), always (Together)\nAlways (Together), always (Together)\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen the years have turned your hair to silver\nAnd the days of our youth\nHave left us so very far behind\nGolden, golden memories\nWill keep in our minds\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we'll always be (Always be)\nAlways together\nJust you, just me\nAlways (Together), always (Together), always (Together)\nAlways (Together), always

on Ninjago...\n\nA montage of scenes from the previous episode is played, followed by the \"Weekend Whip\" title sequence.\nScene One: Destiny's Bounty\nThe ninja are asleep on the Destiny's Bounty when they are woken up by Wu repeatedly banging a small cymbal.\n\nWU: Evil doesn\u2019t sleep and neither should you! In order to reach your full potential, we must greet each day as an opportunity.\nThe ninja begrudgingly start to get up.\n\nKAI: Okay okay, we're up. But if you want us to reach full potential, shouldn't we at least get a full night of rest?\n\nCOLE: You call that a rest? I think my back had more lumps than the mattress.\n\nJAY: We were up so late, talking about how cool it is to have a new headquarters, I guess we lost track of time. Since the Serpentine burned down our monastery, I'm just glad we have a roof over our head...\n\nAs he is talking, he goes to put some water on his toothbrush, but all that comes out of the tap is dirt. He starts to brush his teeth but quickly realises the dirt is there and spits it out.\n\nZANE: What is our lesson today, Sensei? Mastering the strike of the Scorpion? Or perhaps the grace of\u2014\n\nAs Zane pulls off some ninja moves, the floor breaks, and the dust that rises up from it causes him to cough.\n\nWU: I think today's lesson would be chores.\n\nNINJA: Chores?!\n\nCOLE: Ninja fight, Sensei. They do not clean.\n\nWU: In order to respect ourselves, we must respect our new home and where we are from. And this place is a long way from becoming a Ninja headquarters. I expect things to be spotless when I return. And put your backs into it.\n\nHe bangs the cymbal again and leaves.\n\nKAI: This place is gonna take forever to clean and fix up.\nJAY: Unless we put more than our backs into it, huh?\n\nA cleaning montage follows of the ninja using their ninja powers to clean up the Bounty (NOTE: whenever the ninja do spinjitzu in this scene, they shout \"ninja, go\"). Cole uses spinjitzu to clear up all the trash in the room and dispense it outside. In another room, Zane uses the Shurikens of Ice to freeze the whole room. Kai then uses the Sword of Fire to melt the ice, cleaning the room. Elsewhere, Jay uncovers a large computer system, using the Nunchucks of Lightning to restore power to it. All of the ninja fix the flagpole.\nLater on, Wu and Nya return to find the ninja playing a videogame.\n\nKAI: What took you so long?\n\nNYA: Wow, This place looks amazing! You guys did all this?\n\nCOLE: Ninja don't just fight, Nya. We clean.\n\nWU: Oh, you have exceeded my expectations, but can you keep it up?\n\nThe honk of a car horn is heard. Outside, a car is seen approaching.\n\nNYA: Looks like we're about have some visitors, and loud ones at that.\n\nJAY: sighs Ugh...It's my parents. Please, if they start yapping, just don't let them going, okay? They don't know when to quit. And if you start talking then they'll start talking, and suddenly half the day is gone before you know it ends...\n\nKAI: We get it! They talk a lot.... quietly, aside the cherry doesn't fall far from its blossom.\n\nOutside, Ed and Edna, Jay's parents bump into the rubbish heap Cole put there earlier.\n\nED: Oh, heh. Take a note, Edna. Either better brakes or a better bumper.... Oh, will you look at all this great stuff. They can't just get rid of it. We should have brought the trailer, Edna.\nEDNA: This ain't a flea market, Ed. We're here for Jay.\n\nED: What was that? Did you take a note?\n\nEDNA: I'm writing it down, Ed.\n\nThe ninja come outside.\n\nJAY: Mom! Dad! What are you doing here?\n\nEDNA: Oh, look! It's my baby boy! It's been so long since we heard from you!\n\nJAY: Ma, I called you two days ago.\n\nED: Oh well... It's not soon enough, son. When are you coming out to the junkyard? You say you are coming an..an..and you don't.\n\nJAY: Dad...do we have to talk about the junkyard in front of my friends?\n\nEDNA: He hates it when we tell people he was born in a junkyard. to Nya Oh... and who are you? gasps You are so cute! You are just my son's type.\n\nJAY: Mom!\n\nNYA: It's a pleasure of meeting you. I'm sure if you want, Jay can give you a tour. He worked very hard on it.\n\nED and EDNA: We'd love a tour!\n\nJay puts his head in his hands and sighs.\nScene Two: The Bridge\nJay shows his parents various things at the bridge of the Destiny's Bounty.\n\nJAY: And this the bridge. This extends into a periscope. This tells what's going on of Ninjago. And this...if a Serpentine's not giving us the answer we want, and we're late up night..\n\nEDNA: A neuro apparatus to read their minds?\n\nED: An audio appliance to make them talk?\n\nJAY: No, a cappuccino machine.\n\nED: Ha ha. Amazing, son! We're so proud of you.\n\nCOLE: Why don't you tell them about the button?\n\nJAY: Heheh it's not ready yet.\n\nEDNA: Oh, what's the button?\n\nZANE: He's working on a special defence system.\n\nKAI: Something every Ninja headquarters needs.\n\nED: Oh, really? What does it do? Can I help?\n\nJAY: No, it's okay. I don't need your help, dad. Let's just leave it alone. Hey, look at the time. Don't you need to get back before it gets dark? I told you, there's dangerous Serpentine out there.\n\nED: Uh, I suppose we could get back.\n\nCOLE: Edna, it was a pleasure hearing about Jay's first potty time.\n\nEDNA: Oh, if you thought that was good, wait until you hear the story about the time I caught him kissing his pillow!\n\nJAY: Snakes, ma. Snakes!\n\nEDNA: Okay, we're going. We're going.\n\nEd and Edna get back in their car and begin to drive off.\n\nEDNA: So you promise to come to the junkyard to visit your mother and father?\n\nJAY: Yes, I promise! But only if you leave. I don't want you to get hurt. It's getting dark. Uh, your headlights are working, right?\n\nEd switches on the headlights, which are blindingly bright. All the ninja shield their eyes.\n\nED: Heh, like 'em? I used a little extra juice.\n\nHe turns off his lights.\n\nYep. Bye, son. I couldn't be more proud.\n\nED: And bring Nya with you, will ya? I can see why you like her.\n\nJAY: Mom!\n\nEd and Edna drive off.\n\nWU: Now that they have left, maybe Jay can teach us the art of kissing pillows... he snickers.\n\nJAY: Ugh!\n\nEveryone walks back to the Bounty.\nScene Three: The Desert\nEd and Edna are driving through the desert.\n\nED: I don't think he's coming, dear.\n\nEDNA: Stop it, Ed. He's coming.\n\nED: No, he doesn't need us anymore. I just have to remember that. Uh, write it down for me, would ya?\n\nEDNA: Oh, dear. Lights, dear. It's getting dark.\n\nED: Right, heh. Thanks, sugarplum.\n\nScene Four: A Graveyard, at night.\n\nLLOYD: It's not scary. Um, maybe just a little, but I like scary. Yeah, that's it. I'm the son of the Dark Lord. I love the dark. I eat this stuff for breakfast\n\nHe points his torch at a scary snake statue and screams.\n\nI'm gonna make those Hypnobrai pay for betraying me. I have to find the Fangpyres. If there's anything a snake doesn't like, it's another snake. Here, by the mutated tree. I found it! Soon, the Serpentine will know who their master is, and it will be I, Lloyd Garmadon!\n\nLloyd starts laughing, but then lightning strikes and he screams. He opens the door to the Fangpyre tomb, and flocks of Fangpyre come out, with the General, Fangtom being the last to leave.\n\nFANGTOM #1: And who...\n\nFANGTOM #2: ...may I say released us...\n\nFANGTOM #1: ...from our captivity?\n\nLLOYD: Uh, Lloyd? I released you to make the Hypnobrai pay for betraying me.\n\nFANGTOM #2: The Hypnobrai?\n\nFANGTOM #1: Those hypnotizing deceivers.\n\nFANGTOM #2: It'll be...\n\nFANGTOM #1: ...our pleasure.\n\nLLOYD: Oh, good. I'll lead the way. Then after that, there's some Ninja I want dealt with.\n\nFANGTOM #1: Sounds like...\n\nFANGTOM #2: ...you know...\n\nFANGTOM #1: ...what you want.\n\nFANGTOM #2: But the Hypnobrai are strong.\n\nFANGTOM #1: And we are few in numbers.\n\nFANGTOM #2: We need...\n\nFANGTOM #1: ...reinforcements!\n\nLLOYD: What did you have in mind?\n\nThe Fangtom heads hiss as more Fangpyre come out of the tomb. Lloyd lets out an evil laugh.\nScene Five: Ed and Edna's Scrap 'n' Junk\n\nED: Home, sweet home. And back to the grind.\n\nHe picks up his toolbox and starts working on a covered-up contraption.\n\nEDNA: Oh, sweetie. You've been working on that thing day and night.\n\nED: Well, you never know when Jay may show up.\n\nEDNA: Oh, you're right. You never know.\n\nA dark shadow passes by.\n\nED: Uh, Edna? Was that you?\n\nEDNA: What, Ed? Are you hearing things again?\n\nED: Uh, you uh, you turned on the security alarm before you left, didn't ya, hun?\n\nEdna goes to check the alarm, but it appears to be broken.\n\nEDNA: Uh, must be broken.\n\nThe lights shut off.\n\nED: Whoever's there, my son knows Spinjitzu!\n\nA hiss is heard.\n\nEDNA: What is it, Ed? Oh, why are the lights out?\n\nED: Call Jay, hun. Someone's broken in!\n\nLloyd is then seen standing on top of a stack of tyres, holding a telephone with a broken cord.\n\nLLOYD: How about we wait until he calls you?  Muahahaha!\n\nEDNA: Ed...\n\nED: Be strong, Edna. I won't let them hurt you.\n\nFANGTOM #1: If we plan...\n\nFANGTOM #2: ...to attack...\n\nFANGTOM #1: ...the Hypnobrai...\n\nFANGTOM #2: ...we'll need to grow...\n\nFANGTOM #1: ...our army.\n\nLLOYD: And uh, how do we do that?\n\nFANGTOM #2: Let's just say...\n\nFANGTOM #1: ...we Fangpyre bite off more...\n\nFANGTOM #2: ...than we can chew.\n\nFANGTOM #1: Have at it, boys!\n\nThe Fangpyre start biting Ed and Edna's creations, which start turning into Serpentine vehicles.\n\nED: My creations! They are turning them into\u2014\n\nFANGTOM #1: An army?\n\nFANGTOM #2: You are correct.\n\nFANGTOM #1: But we can also turn people, too\n\nEd and Edna shake in fear as the Fangpyre gradually approach them.\nScene Six: Destiny's Bounty\nJay is on the bridge, working on \"the button\". Kai and Zane walk past, deliberately raising their voices so Jay hears their conversation.\n\nKAI: Sure got a lot of junk piling up. If only there was a place we could get rid of it...\n\nJAY: If you don't mind, I'm trying to focus.\n\nCole passes by, pretending to be on his phone.\n\nCOLE: Hi, mom and dad. Of course, I'd love to visit. What kind of son would I be if I didn't want to?\n\nJAY: Heheheheh. I know what you're trying to do. Okay, look, I might have promised to visit my parents, but there's a lot of stuff on my plate.\n\nNya comes in.\n\nJAY: Hehe. Hi, Nya.\n\nNYA: You gonna visit your parents, today?\n\nJAY: Uh, sure am. Just about to leave.\n\nNYA: Tell them I say hi.\n\nThe other ninja stare accusingly at Jay.\n\nJAY: What? So my plate's not that full.\n\nScene Seven: Outside\nJay is trying to move his dragon, but he won't budge.\n\nJAY: Come on, Wisp. It'll be a quick visit. Just in and out, nothing more.\n\nWU: Hm, it is as I suspected. The Dragons are moulting. They're shedding their scales.\n\nJAY: What does that mean?\n\nWU: Every adolescent Dragon goes through a transformation before it becomes an adult. We must allow them to migrate east to the Spirit Coves for their transformation.\n\nJAY: Will we see them again?\n\nWU: It is hard to say. But we need to allow them to follow their path.\n\nCOLE: Rocky's going east? Say it isn't so, Rocky.\n\nZane and Cole pet their dragons.\nJay walks to Nya, who is standing near Flame. Kai is behind the dragon, but Jay doesn't see him at first.\n\nJAY: Well, I guess I gotta go on this long walk all by myself. Sure be nice to have company...\n\nKAI: Of course we'll go, buddy.\n\nCole: I could use a break.\n\nZANE: All you had to do was ask.\n\nJay sighs in frustration. The ninja walk with Wu and Nya towards the Junyard, with Wu playing the Sacred Flute.\n\nJAY: sighs Of all the days to lose our ride...\n\nZANE: That flute. You've never told us why it's so special.\n\nWU: Long ago there were many flutes, created to combat the powers of the Serpentine and drive them underground. But over time, Ninjago's forgotten its ancestors' wisdom, and now this is the only one.\n\nJAY: I get the lesson: respect your elders or else suffer the consequences. Boy, you guys are laying it on thick.\n\nWU: chuckles Perhaps you are only hearing what you need to hear.\n\nJay stops, bearing a suspicious look.\n\nNYA: What is it?\n\nJAY: It's quiet. My family's never quiet.\n\nJay is now very worried. He runs to a fridge, from which murmurings can be heard. He kicks it open, revealing Ed and Edna, who are tied up and gagged. He rips the tape off their mouths.\n\nJAY: What happened? Who did this?\n\nEDNA: Sweetheart, you came!\n\nED: Oh, you gotta get out of here. You shouldn't have come, it's the ssssnakes!\n\nWU: The bite of the Fangpyre! Once they sink their teeth, their venom can turn anything into a serpent. It's only a matter of time before the full transformation is complete.\n\nHisses are heard. Cole looks up to see a Sepentine wrecking ball with a face.\n\nCOLE: Uh, is that wrecking ball staring at me?\n\nJAY: Duck!\n\nThey jump out of the way as the ball comes down, Jay saving his parents.\n\nED: Thankssss, sssson.\n\nWu spots Lloyd standing on a pile of tyres next to a Serpentine stereo.\n\nWU: Lloyd!\n\nLLOYD: Hello, uncle. Looks like we're not the only family reunion. I'm glad you brought the Ninja. I could use some help taking out the trash. Muahaha!\n\nNYA: If we want to turn your parents back, we need the antivenom in the staff.\n\nCOLE: Second dose, to the dirt!\n\nEveryone plunges to the ground as the wrecking ball strikes again.\n\nKAI: Easier said than done, sis. We're bit outnumbered.\n\nJAY: Nobody messes with my family. Ninja, go!\n\nKAI, COLE and ZANE: Ninja, go!\n\nThe ninja attack the snakes. Nya beats up some snakes while Wu plays his magic flute.\n\nNYA: I don't know, Sensei. I think we make a pretty good duet.\n\nLloyd switches on the stereo, which plays some loud rock music, drowning out Wu's flute-playing.\n\nWU: Young nephew, must I teach you whose side you should be on?\n\nLLOYD: turning up the volume Sorry, uncle. Can't hear you!\n\nA Fangpyre tries to bite Wu, but luckily Edna saves him by hitting the snake with a saucepan.\n\nED: Yeah, way to go, Edna!\n\nNINJA: Ninja, go!\n\nA giant Jay-shaped Fangpyre robot appears.\n\nJAY: Ah! What is that thing?\n\nED: It was supposed to be in your honor, son, but do you like it?\n\nJAY: Thanks, but no thanks.\n\nThe robot strikes with its giant nunchucks, and the ninja narrowly avoid it.\n\nCOLE: Why'd you have to be born in a Junkyard?\n\nJAY: I know. Tell me about it.\n\nThe wrecking ball strikes again. The ninja go to ground. When the ball goes away, Jay is missing.\n\nKAI: Uh, wasn't there four of us?\n\nJay is hanging onto the wrecking ball. He jumps into the cockpit of the crane and kicks out the Fangpyre operating it.\n\nJAY: Let's see if I can work this.\n\nThe robot attacks Cole.\n\nCOLE: Don't worry, I got it.\n\nJay hits the robot with the wrecking ball.\n\nCOLE: I told you, I had it.\n\nLLOYD: Retreat!\n\nLloyd and Fangtom start to leave on the Rattlecopter.\n\nNYA: He's getting away with the staff!\n\nJAY: Right now would be a good time to have those Dragons\n\nED: It'ssss okay, sssson.\n\nWU: There is still a way.\n\nJAY: How?\n\nWU: Part of reaching your own full potential is understanding your weapon's potential. Once it is in tune with a focused heart, its secrets and powers can be unlocked.\n\nJAY: Oh, this is not the time to be cryptic.\n\nZANE: He's saying our weapons are vehicles themselves.\n\nKAI: Don't tell me I have to ride this thing like a broom stick.\n\nWU: Jay, concentrate on unlocking your Golden Weapon. Let your heart guide you. Imagine you're taking flight.\n\nJay turns his weapon into a blue plane.\n\nJAY: Whoa! Haha, did I just do that?\n\nKai then turns his sword into a motorbike; Zane turns his shurikens into a snowspeeder; Cole turns his scythe into a car.\n\nCOLE: Ha! I hate to hurt Rocky's feelings, but I think he's just been replaced.\n\nThe ninja race off to catch up with Lloyd.\n\nNYA: Does your flute turn into anything?\n\nWU: I wish.\n\nJay flies past Lloyd.\n\nLLOYD: Whoa, what the heck was that?\n\nJAY: Oops, haha. Overshot that a little. turning around Let's see what this baby can do.\n\nHe hits a button, causing the jet to spiral out of control and the cockpit to open. He flies past Fangtom and Lloyd the other way, taking the Fangpyre staff in the process.\n\nFANGTOM #2: Duck! The Staff!\n\nJAY: I got it? I got it!\n\nHe celebrates, but then his jet disappears and his starts falling.\n\nKAI: Jay! You have to concentrate!\n\nJAY: I can't!\n\nCOLE: I think we're gonna have to catch him.\n\nKAI: I got him.\n\nCOLE: No, I got him!\n\nZANE: He's mine!\n\nThe ninja's vehicles crash into each other and disappear. Thankfully, Jay is rescued by his parents' car, which Nya is driving.\n\nJAY: Heh, nice.\n\nEDNA: Aw, I knew I liked thissss girl.\n\nFANGTOM #2: Everyone!\n\nFANGTOM #1: Attack!\n\nThe ninja struggle to activate their weapons.\n\nKAI: Huh? Why isn't this thing working?\n\nWU: Your weapon is merely an extension of your mind. If your mind is immobile, so is your weapon.\n\nED: Oh, boy. Oh, gosh. Oh, golly, oh, duh. Get in, boys!\n\nThey get into the car.\n\nJAY: We have to get hack to headquarters!\n\nLLOYD: Go! They're getting away!\n\nThe team return to the Bounty.\nScene Eight: Destiny's Bounty\n\nNYA: Come with me. Once we reverse the venom, we can fix you.\n\nJAY: Man the stations, everyone!\n\nKAI: Jay, we better hurry.\n\nJAY: I've been waiting for this moment.\n\nHe presses the button, but nothing happens.\n\nKAI: They're gaining on us!\n\nED: Bottoms, up!\n\nEd and Edna drinks antivenom, which turns them back into humans.\n\nED: Oh, that's good.\n\nJAY: Ugh, I don't get what's wrong. I spent forever on this. It's supposed to work!\n\nED: Uh, son? Maybe I can help?\n\nJAY: Dad! You're okay!\n\nED: Yeah, darn tooting. Oh, let's have a look.\n\nHe fixes the button.\n\nOh, yeah. Uh-huh. Oh, that should do it. Now try it.\n\nJay presses the button. The Bounty opens up its wings and rocket boosters and flies away.\n\nLLOYD: No, no, no, no!\n\nAs the ship tilts backwards, the staff falls out and lands in the sand. The helicopter flies down and Fangtom picks it up.\n\nFANGTOM #2: These Ninja...\n\nFANGTOM #1: ...they must be stopped.\n\nLLOYD: Oh, tell me about it.\n\nBack on the Bounty...\n\nJAY: We'll get you back to the Junkyard just as soon as we see the coast is clear. But stay as long as you'd like. It's nice having you here.\n\nED: Oh, take a note Edna: of all our inventions, this one is our greatest!\n\nEDNA: I already know, dear.\n\nShe throws away her notepad, and the three embrace, observed by Sensei Wu.\nEnd creditsEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1476026", "artist_names": "The Impressions", "full_title": "I Loved and I Lost

something comes into her mind\nThen slowly starts dancing, remembering her girlhood\nAnd all of the boys she had waiting in line\n[Chorus]\nAh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife\nYou see everywhere, anytime of the day\nAn everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe photograph album, she takes from the closet\nAnd slowly turns the page\nAnd carefully picks up the crumbling flower\nThe first one he gave her, now withered with age\n\n[Verse 4]\nShe closes her eyes, and touches the house dress that\nSuddenly disappears\nAnd just for the moment, she's wearing the gown\nThat broke all their minds back so many years\n\n[Chorus]\nAh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife\nYou see everywhere, anytime of the day\nAn everyday housewife who gave up the

That's why you had to get a 9-to-5\nSo how it feel to look into yo' mama eyes\nAnd tell her you can't make your talent monetize?\nThat's 'cause he got no hustle outside of this\nI mean all I see is this nigga complain\nI'm like, \"Life don't come with a remote\nYou gotta get up and change.\"\nAt first, I used to come to these battles strapped\nIf you ask a cat, think AI, the answer's that\nMy whole career I carried that\nTommy Gun from the Punisher and the handle black\nI'ma\u2026\u00a0I'ma\u2026\u00a0bro, why do we lie as rappers?\nLike for real, like I can come up here and spit actual facts\nI remember I had beef in my hood and I was scared, son\nBird sensed it so he threw me a weapon 'cause he had a spare one\nI checked the clip, put one in the head in case I had to air one\nPulled up on that nigga block, hopped out and shot the fair one\nI been scarred since my dad left my mom had my mind slippin'\nIronically, in Houston that had my mom trippin'\nThat's why I stay with my son more than my gun\n'Cause I know if I raise him right he'll pop different\nI'm more mature\n*You can leave. You can leave if you want to. We don't need you.*\nI said I went from Hennessy to ginger tea\nI went from fitted hats to thinking caps\nI went from probation to donation\nBut this ain't about me\nI'm just giving game so you ain't gotta battle all day\nThink Drake on YG's record\nY'all don't even peep that I'm rappin' for Tay (Rappin' 4-Tay)\nThe only thing you prepared for this year, my nigga, is this battle tonight\nSee me a few years from now, I'll be winnin' the battle at life\nThat's 'cause I got the drive of Tony Robbins\nThe grind of Eric Thomas, the mind of Iggy Johnson\nI ain't got any options\nI'm the King, junior, that's why I'm killin' you with no violence\nThis is suicide, Smack help with the notes since you co-signed him\nWhen I go to the bed the gun on the stand next to a nigga like Joe Biden\nAnd damn, see how hard it is? I forgot, no lyin'\nAlright, I was on the E train and that shit was takin' mad long\nUnion turnpike, when some guy woke up and randomly ran off\nThe doors closed, he's bangin' on 'em 'cause he left his bag on\nThe train takes off, he jumps in between the carts and grabs on\nI'm thinking, \"Whoo, this gon' be a rough ride if he drags on!\"\nI waited 15 seconds, nobody did nothin', it was a sad song\nSo my point is, we all could come to this stage\nAnd rap about killin' and how we'll take a life\nBut I know the feeling of actually having to save a life\nI mean, niggas might think that's wack\n'Cause most wanna be a thug all the time\nY'all don't care about other people 'til there's blood on the line\nAnd I'm showin' love to everybody, I ain't with the beef\nI mean there's more than one way I can be with the piece/peace\nMy nigga what you doing?\nI'm tryin' to make sure this nigga gets deceased\n\n[Guy from the crowd]\nYeah yeah, but we don't wanna hear that bullshit, Sharrief!\n\n[Hollow Da Don]\nThis is what I'm talking about!\nTime then, fuck it!\nLOMclothing.com1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/83626", "artist_names":

Two) Lyrics(Still in Helena\u2019s room. Helena, left, plays piano. Domin paces up and down room, Dr. Gall looks out of window and Alquist sits to one side in armchair, his face covered in his hands)\n\nDr. Gall: God, there are still more of them now!\n\nDomin: Robots?\n\nDr. Gall: Yes. There\u2019s a wall of them standing at the garden fence. Why are they so silent? It\u2019s repulsive. A siege of silence.\n\nDomin: I wish I knew what they were waiting for. It must be about to start any moment. We\u2019ve lost, Gall.\n\nAlquist: What is that that Helena\u2019s playing?\nDomin: I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s practising something new.\n\nAlquist: Ah, so she\u2019s still practising?\n\nDr. Gall: Listen Domin, we made a crucial mistake.\n\nDomin: (stops) What mistake?\n\nDr. Gall: We made the faces of the robots too much like one another. There are a hundred thousand faces staring up at us and they\u2019re all the same. A hundred thousand expressionless bubbles. This is like a bad dream.\n\nDomin: If each of them were different . . .\n\nDr. Gall: Then the sight of them wouldn\u2019t be so ghastly. (moves away from window) At least they\u2019re not armed yet!\n\nDomin: Hm. - (looks down at harbour through binoculars) I just wish I knew what it was they\u2019re unloading from the Amelia.\n\nDr. Gall: Let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s not weapons.\n\n(enter Fabry through wallpapered door, dragging two electrical wires)\n\nFabry: Excuse me. Hallemeier, put the wire down.\n\nHallemeier: (following Fabry) Ouf, that was hard work. Anything new?\n\nDr. Gall: Nothing. We\u2019re completely surrounded.\nHallemeier: Well lads, we\u2019ve got the stairs and the corridors barricaded. Is there any water there? Ah, here it is. (drinks)\n\nDr. Gall: What\u2019s this wire for, Fabry?\n\nFabry: You\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see. Are there some scissors?\n\nDr. Gall: Where would we find scissors? (looks for them)\n\nHallemeier: (goes to window) Hell, there are even more of them now! Have a look at this!\n\nDr. Gall: Would nail scissors be alright?\n\nFabry: Give them to me. (cuts lead to electric lamp on desk and attaches his wires to it)\n\nHallemeier: (at window) You haven\u2019t got a very nice view here, Domin. It seems . . . to have . . . the feel of death about it.\n\nFabry: Ready!\n\nDr. Gall: What is?\n\nFabry: The connection. Now we can put electric current through the whole of the garden fence. Anyone who touches it has had it. At least, as long as there are still some of our own down there.\n\nDr. Gall: Where?\n\nFabry: In the generator room. At least, I hope . . . (goes to fireplace and switches on small light there) Thank God for that - they\u2019re there. And they\u2019re working. (switches light off) As long as that light works we\u2019re alright.\nHallemeier: (turning back from window) Those are good barricades, Fabry. Now what\u2019s that that Helena\u2019s playing? (goes to door, left, and listens. Enter Busman through wallpapered door carrying enormous ledgers. Trips over wire)\n\nFabry: Mind out, Bus! Mind those wires!\n\nDr. Gall: Hello, what\u2019s this you\u2019re bringing us?\n\nBusman: (puts books on table) These are the important books, children. I think I\u2019d better get the accounts done before . . . before. . . . well I don\u2019t mean to wait until the new year before it\u2019s sorted out. Now what\u2019s all this you\u2019ve got here? (goes to window) It\u2019s all very quiet down there.\n\nDr. Gall: Can\u2019t you see anything?\n\nBusman: Nothing apart from a large blue area, it\u2019s as if it was strewn with poppy seeds.\n\nDr. Gall: Those are the robots.\n\nBusman: Ah, so that\u2019s what it is. Pity I can\u2019t see them. (sits at desk and opens ledgers)\n\nDomin: Forget about that, Busman; the robots are unloading weapons from the Amelia.\n\nBusman: So what? What am I supposed to do about it?\n\nDomin: There\u2019s nothing we can do to stop them.\n\nBusman: So just let me get on with my calculation. (gets on with work)\n\nFabry: It isn\u2019t all over yet, Domin. We\u2019ve put two hundred volts in through the garden fence and. . . .\n\nDomin: Stop! The Ultimus has just turned its guns in our direction.\n\nDr. Gall: Who\u2019s doing that?\n\nDomin: The robots on the Ultimus.\n\nFabry: Hm, well in that case of course, . . . then of course, . . . then we\u2019ve had it, lads. Those robots are trained soldiers.\n\nDr. Gall: That means that we . . .\n\nDomin: Yes. Irrevocably.\n\n(Pause)\n\nDr. Gall: This is just the same old evil as Europe has always committed. They just couldn\u2019t leave their damned politics alone and so they taught the robots to go to war, they took the robots and turned them into soldiers and that was a crime against humanity.\n\nAlquist: The crime was making the robots in the first place.\n\nDomin: What\u2019s that?\n\nAlquist: The crime was making the robots!\n\nDomin: No Alquist, I don\u2019t feel sorry for what I did, even now.\n\nAlquist: Not even now?\n\nDomin: Not even now, on the last day of civilisation. It was a magnificent undertaking.\n\nBusman: (sotto voce) Three hundred and sixteen million.\n\nDomin: (earnestly) Alquist, this is our last hour; it\u2019s almost as if we were speaking from the other world already. Alquist, putting an end to the slavery of labour was not a bad dream. Work humiliates, anyone who\u2019s forced to do it is made small. The drudgery of labour is something dirty and murderous. Oh, Alquist, the burden of work was too much for us, life was too heavy for us, and to remove this burden. . . .\n\nAlquist: That was never the dream of either of the Rossums; old Rossum was thinking of Godless rubbish and young Rossum thought of nothing but making millions. And it\u2019s not the dream of RUR shareholders either; their only dream was their dividend. And it\u2019s because of their concern for their profits that mankind is about to perish.\n\nDomin: (agitated) The Devil take their dividends! Do you think I\u2019d have spent an hour of my time for their sakes? (thumping table) I did it for myself, d\u2019you hear? For my own satisfaction! I wanted mankind to become his own master! I wanted him not to have to live just for the next crust of bread! I wanted not a single soul to have to go stupid standing at somebody else\u2019s machines! I wanted to leave nothing - nothing! - left of this damned mess that society\u2019s in! I hate seeing humiliation and pain all around us, I hate poverty! I wanted to start a new generation! I wanted to . . . I thought that . . .\n\nAlquist: What?\n\nDomin: (quieter) I wanted mankind to become an aristocracy of the world. Free, unconstrained, sovereign. Maybe even something higher than human.\n\nAlquist: Superhumans, you mean.\n\nDomin: Yes. If only we\u2019d had another hundred years. Another hundred years for the new mankind.\n\nBusman: (sotto voce) Three hundred and seventy million, carry over. Like that.\n\n(pause)\n\nHallemeier: (at door, left) Music is a wonderful thing, you know. You should have been listening. There\u2019s something ennobling about it, soothing . . .\n\nFabry: What exactly?\n\nHallemeier: To Hell with this end of mankind! I think I\u2019m turning into a hedonist, lads. We should have got into it much earlier. (goes to window and looks out)\n\nFabry: Into what?\n\nHallemeier: Enjoying ourselves. Beauty. Hell, there are so many beautiful things around us! The world was beautiful, and we . . . we here . . . Tell me, lads, what did we ever enjoy?\n\nBusman: (sotto voce) Four hundred and fifty two million - excellent.\n\nHallemeier: (at window) Life was great. My friends, life was . . . Ah, Fabry, put a little bit of current into that fence of yours.\n\nFabry: Why!\n\nHallemeier: They\u2019re touching it.\n\nDr. Gall: (at window) Switch it on!\n\nHallemeier: Christ, that showed them! Two, three, four of them killed!\n\nDr. Gall: They\u2019re moving back.\n\nHallemeier: Five killed.\n\nDr. Gall: (coming back from window) First strike.\n\nFabry: Have you got the smell of death?\n\nHallemeier: (contented) We\u2019ve got them cornered, right in a corner. Haha, you should never give in! (sitting)\n\nDomin: (rubs his brow) Perhaps we\u2019re just ghosts, dead for a hundred years. Perhaps we were killed a long long time ago, and we\u2019ve come back just to recant something we once said . . . before we died. It\u2019s as if I\u2019d been through this before! As if it had all been done to me already. A shot here, in the neck. What about you, Fabry?\n\nFabry: What about me?\n\nDomin: Shot.\n\nHallemeier: Hell, what about me?\n\nDomin: Stabbed.\n\nDr. Gall: Nothing for me, then?\n\nDomin: Torn to pieces.\n\n(pause)\n\nHallemeier: What a lot of nonsense! Haha, they could never stab me! I wouldn\u2019t let them!\n\n(pause)\n\nHallemeier: So what are you all so quiet for, all gone mad? Say something, damn it!\n\nAlquist: And whose fault is it? Who\u2019s to blame for all this?\n\nHallemeier: You\u2019re talking nonsense. Nobody\u2019s to blame. It\u2019s just that the robots, well, the robots changed somehow. How can you blame anyone for the robots?\n\nAlquist: Everything wiped out! The whole of mankind! The whole world! (standing) Think of it, just think of it, streams of blood on every doorstep! Streams of blood flowing from every house! Oh God, oh God, who\u2019s to blame for it all?\n\nBusman: (sotto voce) Five hundred and twenty million! Dear dear me, that\u2019s half a billion!\n\nFabry: I think . . . I think you could be exaggerating. After all, it\u2019s not that easy to wipe out the whole of mankind.\n\nAlquist: It\u2019s science I blame! Technology I blame! Domin! Myself! All of us! It\u2019s us, we\u2019re the ones to blame! We thought we were doing something great, giving some benefit, making progress. I don\u2019t know what magnificent ideas it was for that we\u2019ve destroyed mankind! And now all our greatness is bursting like a bubble! Not even Genghis Khan built up a heap of human bones like we\u2019ve done.\n\nHallemeier: You\u2019re talking a lot of nonsense! People won\u2019t give up that easily, haha, course they won\u2019t!\n\nAlquist: It\u2019s our fault, our fault!\n\nDr. Gall: (wiping sweat from brow) If I can say something, I think I\u2019m the one to blame. For everything that\u2019s happened.\n\nFabry: You, Gall?\n\nDr. Gall: Yes, let me speak. It was me who made the changes to the robots. Busman, you can blame me as well.\n\nBusman: (standing) Dear me, what? What happened to you?\n\nDr. Gall: I changed the robots\u2019 character. I altered the way they were made. Nothing much to their bodies, you know, but mainly . . . mainly . . . it was their level of irritability.\n\nHallemeier: (jumping up) Hell and damnation why did you do that?\n\nBusman: Why did you do it?\n\nFabry: Why didn\u2019t you tell anyonel?\n\nDr. Gall: I did it in secret . . . on my own initiative. I was making them into people. I sent them off course. Now they\u2019re better than we are in some ways. They\u2019re stronger than we are.\n\nFabry: And what\u2019s that got to do with the robots\u2019 revolt?\n\nDr. Gall: Oh, it\u2019s got a lot to do with it. Everything, I should think. They stopped being machines - do you hear me? - they became aware of their strength and now they hate us. They hate the whole of mankind. I\u2019m the one to blame.\n\nDomin: Let the dead bury the dead.\n\nFabry: Doctor Gall, you changed the way the robots were made?\n\nDr. Gall: Yes.\n\nFabry: Were you aware of what might be the results of your . . . of your experiment?\n\nDr. Gall: I was. I did reckon on some possibility of that sort.\n\nFabry: Why did you do it?\n\nDr. Gall: I did it for myself. It was my personal experiment.\n\n(Helena at doorway, left. All stand)\n\nHelena: He\u2019s lying! That\u2019s horrible! Oh Gall, how can you lie like that?\n\nFabry: Sorry, Helena . . .\n\nDomin: (goes to her) Helena, you? Let me see you! You\u2019re alive? (embraces her) If you only knew what I\u2019ve been thinking! Oh, it\u2019s terrible, being dead.\n\nHelena: Harry let go of me! It isn\u2019t Gall\u2019s fault, it isn\u2019t, it isn\u2019t, he\u2019s not to blame!\n\nDomin: But I\u2019m afraid Gall did have his responsibilities.\n\nHelena: No, Harry, he did it because I wanted it. Tell them Gall, tell them how I begged you for years to. . . .\n\nDr. Gall: It was all my own responsibility.\n\nHelena: Don\u2019t believe him! Harry, I wanted him to give the robots a soul!\n\nDomin: Helena, it\u2019s not a matter of having a soul.\n\nHelena: No, just let me speak. That\u2019s what he said as well, he said he could only make physiological changes . . . alter the physiological . . .\n\nHallemeier: The physiological correlates, you mean?\n\nHelena: Yes, something like that. Harry, I felt so sorry for them!\n\nDomin: That was very . . . that was very stupid of you, Helena.\n\nHelena: (sitting) Yes . . . it was very . . . stupid of me. But even Nana says that . . .\n\nDomin: Just leave Nana out of it!\n\nHelena: No Harry, don\u2019t under-estimate her. Nana is the voice of the people. People like Nana have been speaking for a thousand years, and you\u2019re just speaking for today. You don\u2019t understand that . . .\n\nDomin: Let\u2019s keep to the point.\n\nHelena: I was afraid of the robots.\n\nDomin: Why?\n\nHelena: I thought they might start to hate us, or something.\n\nAlquist: That\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\n\nHelena: And so I thought . . . if they were like us, if they could understand us, that then they couldn\u2019t possibly hate us so much . . . if only they were like people . . . just a little bit. . . .\n\nDomin: Oh Helena! Nobody could hate man as much as man! Give a man a stone and he\u2019ll throw it at you Just carry on!\n\nHelena: Oh, don\u2019t talk like that, Harry, it was so horrible that we could never understand each other! Such a cruel strangeness between us and them. And that\u2019s why . . . you see . . .\n\nDomin: Go on.\n\nHelena: . . . that\u2019s why I asked Gall to change the robots. It wasn\u2019t him who wanted to do it, I promise you.\n\nDomin: But he did do it.\n\nHelena: Because I wanted him to.\n\nDr. Gall: I did it for my own sake, as an experiment.\n\nHelena: Oh, Gall, that isn\u2019t true. Before I asked you I knew you couldn\u2019t refuse me.\n\nDomin: Why not?\n\nHelena: You know why not, Harry.\n\nDomin: Yes, because he loves you - like we all love you.\n\n(pause)\n\nHallemeier: (goes to window) There are more of them again, now. It\u2019s as if they were springing up out of the earth.\n\nBusman: Helena, what will you give me if I act as your advocate.\n\nHelena: Me?\n\nBusman: You, or Gall. As you like.\n\nHelena: What difference does it make?\n\nBusman: Just morally. We\u2019re looking for someone to blame. That\u2019s the usual way to find consolation when something bad happens.\n\nDomin: Doctor Gall; how do you square your . . . your extra-mural activities with your contract?\n\nBusman: Excuse me, Domin. Gall; when did you actually start playing around in this way?\n\nDr. Gall: Three years ago.\n\nBusman: Aha. And how many robots did you change, in total?\n\nDr. Gall: I only performed a number of experiments, no more than a few hundred.\n\nBusman: Thank you very much, Gall. Now that\u2019s enough, children. This means that out of a million old, properly functioning robots just one will have been one of Gall\u2019s reformed models. Do you see what I mean?\n\nDomin: So that means . . .\n\nBusman: . . . that it has practically no significance at all.\n\nFabry: Busman is right.\n\nBusman: I think I am. And now, lads, do you know what really caused all this to happen?\n\nFabry: What?\n\nBusman: The number of them. We made too many robots. Dear me, it\u2019s only what we should have been expecting; as soon as the robots became stronger than people this was bound to happen, it had to happen, you see? Haha, and we did all that we could to make it happen as soon as possible; you Domin, you Fabry, and little me, Busman.\n\nDomin: So you think it\u2019s the fault of all of us.\n\nBusman: You\u2019re quite right. How could you ever have thought the managing director was in charge of production? Production is governed by supply and demand. Everywhere in the world they wanted to have their robots, and all we did was respond to the flood of orders. And all the time we were talking nonsense about technology, sociology, progress, and all sorts of interesting matters. How could talk of this sort chit-chat decide how things were going to turn out? Meanwhile, things gathered their own momentum, getting faster and faster and faster. Every miserable, greedy, dirty new order added its own pebble to the avalanche. That\u2019s what happened, children.\n\nHelena: Busman, that\u2019s horrible!\n\nBusman: It is, Helena. I had my own dreams, too. A Busman sort of dream about a new economic order; a beautiful fantasy, Helena, a shame to speak of it. But just now, while I was doing the accounts, it occurred to me that history is not about great dreams; it\u2019s about the day to day needs of all the little people, the honest ones, the slightly dishonest ones, the selfish ones; about everyone. And all these thoughts and loves and plans and heroic deeds, all these noble things are worth nothing more than something to clutter up the museum of the universe, under the heading \u2018Mankind\u2019. And that\u2019s all. And now, will somebody tell me what we\u2019re going to do now?\n\nHelena: And is it for the sake of that that we\u2019re all going to die?\n\nBusman: Don\u2019t put it so harshly, Helena. We\u2019re not all going to die. At least, I am not. I want to stay alive so that . . .\n\nDomin: And what are you going to do about it?\n\nBusman: But Domin, dear boy, I want to get out of here.\n\nDomin: (standing over him) And how do you mean to do that?\n\nBusman: Nicely. When I do anything I always do it nicely. Give me your full authority, and I will go and negotiate with the robots.\n\nDomin: Nicely?\n\nBusman: Of course. Let\u2019s suppose I go to them, and I say, \u201cDear robots, happy race, you have everything. You have intelligence, you have power, you have weapons; but we have a rather interesting little piece of paper, a rather old, yellowing, dirty piece . . . \u201d\n\nDomin: Rossum\u2019s manuscript?\n\nBusman: That\u2019s right. \u201cAnd this piece of paper,\u201d I\u2019ll say to them, \u201ctells us all about your great origins, your noble manufacture, and so on. My dear robots, without the scribbles on this piece of paper you will be unable to make a single new robot to keep you company: in twenty years, if you don\u2019t mind my saying so, you will die out like flies. And that would be such a terrible pity for you. I\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d I\u2019ll say to them, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you let all of us people here on Rossum\u2019s island get onto that boat. In exchange, we\u2019ll let you buy the factory and the whole island from us, and even include the secret of your manufacture. Let us sail away, in the peace of God, and we\u2019ll let you, in the peace of God, continue manufacturing yourselves - twenty thousand, fifty thousand, a hundred thousand or more of you every day. My dear robots, this is a fair deal that I\u2019m putting to you. Something for something.\u201d That is what I would say to them, lads.\n\nDomin: And do you really think we should let the secret of production out of our hands?\n\nBusman: I do. And if we don't do it nicely, then, er . . . Either we sell it to them or they find it here. However you like.\n\nDomin: We could destroy Rossum\u2019s manuscript, though.\n\nBusman: Dear me, yes, we could destroy everything, not just the manuscript but ourselves as well and many other things. You should do as you think fit.\n\nHallemeier: (turning back from window) Damn it, he\u2019s right, you know.\n\nDomin: To actually sell them the means of production?\n\nBusman: As you like.\n\nDomin: There are . . . there are more than thirty people here on the island. We can either sell the robots the means of production and save those human souls, or we can destroy it and . . . it along with ourselves and everything.\n\nHelena: Harry, please . . .\n\nDomin: Wait, Helena. We\u2019re talking about a serious matter here. What do you think, lads, to sell it or destroy it? Fabry?\n\nFabry: Sell it.\n\nDomin: Gall.\n\nDr. Gall: Sell.\n\nDomin: Hallemeier.\n\nHallemeier: Well for God\u2019s sake of course we should sell it!\n\nDomin: Alquist.\n\nAlquist: The will of God.\n\nBusman: Haha, dear me, you\u2019re all mad! Why would anyone sell the whole manuscript?\n\nDomin: Let\u2019s not become liars, Busman!\n\nBusman: (jumping up) Nonsense! For the sake of mankind the . . .\n\nDomin: It\u2019s in the interest of mankind to be honest.\n\nHallemeier: I should hope so too.\n\nDomin: Lads, this is a tremendous step we\u2019re taking. We\u2019ll selling the fate of mankind; whoever holds the secret of production in his hand will be the master of the world.\n\nFabry: Sell it!\n\nDomin: Mankind would never be free of the robots, it would never be possible to regain control of them . . .\n\nDr. Gall: Just stop all this and sell the manuscript!\n\nDomin: The end of human history, the end of civilisation . . .\n\nHallemeier: Damnation, just sell it!\n\nDomin: Alright lads! I myself,. . . . I wouldn\u2019t hesitate a moment; for those people who I love. . . .\n\nHelena: Harry, is it me you\u2019re asking?\n\nDomin: No, that would be too much responsibility. This isn\u2019t something for a girl like you.\n\nFabry: Who\u2019ll be the one to negotiate . . .?\n\nDomin: Wait. Just wait while I get the manuscript. (exit left)\n\nHelena: Harry, please no, don\u2019t go in there!\n\n(pause)\n\nFabry: (looking out window) To escape from you, thousand headed death; from you, destroyed material and mindless hordes; the flood, the flood, mankind is once again to be saved on a single ship.\n\nDr. Gall: You needn\u2019t worry, Helena; we\u2019ll sail far away from here and establish a colony that will be better than any other; we can make a new beginning . . .\n\nHelena: Oh, Gall, do be quiet!\n\nFabry: (turning back) Helen, life is worth living; and if it\u2019s up to us we will . . . we\u2019ll do something that we\u2019ve so far been neglecting. Just one boat to start with, and then a little farm; Alquist can build us a house and you can be in charge over all of us. You\u2019re so full of much love, so much life . . .\n\nHallemeier: I should say so.\n\nBusman: Well I, for one, would certainly be happy to start all over again. Everything simple, a pastoral life just like the Old Testament. All that peace, all that fresh air . . .\n\nFabry: Our farm would give birth to a new mankind. A little island where the human race would start again, where it would gather new strength, strength of body and of soul. And God knows, as I believe myself, that after a few years we could reclaim the world.\n\nAlquist: You\u2019re a believer now, are you?\n\nFabry: I\u2019m a believer, now. And I believe man will reclaim the world and become, once again, the lord of the land and the sea; that He will give rise to countless numbers of heroes who will lead the way out into the world with a soul that blazes with light. I believe, Alquist, that He will once again dream of conquering the planets and the suns.\n\nBusman: Amen. So you see, Helena, the situation isn\u2019t really all that bad.\n\n(Domin throws open door and enters)\n\nDomin: (rasping) Where is old Rossum\u2019s manuscript?!\n\nBusman: It\u2019s in your safe. Where else would it be?\n\nDomin: What\u2019s happened to old Rossum\u2019s manuscript?! Who\u2019s . . . stolen it?\n\nDr. Gall: That\u2019s not possible!\n\nHallemeier: Hell no! That\u2019s just. . . .\n\nBusman: Dear Lord, that can\u2019t be right!\n\nDomin: Who stole it?\n\nHelena: (standing) I did.\n\nDomin: Where did you put it?\n\nHelena: Harry, Harry, I\u2019ll tell you everything! Oh God, please forgive me!\n\nDomin: Where did you put it? Quickly!\n\nHelena: I burned them. This morning. Both copies.\n\nDomin: You burned them? Here in this fireplace?\n\nHelena: (throws herself down on knees) Oh God, Harry!\n\nDomin: (runs to fireplace) Burned it! (kneels at fireplace and rakes it over with poker) Nothing, there\u2019s nothing here but ashes! Ah, here\u2019s something! (pulls out charred piece of paper, and reads) \u201c . . . and add . . . \u201d\n\nDr. Gall: Let me see it. (takes paper and reads) \u201c . . . and add the biogene to. . . . \u201d, and that\u2019s all.\n\nDomin: (standing) Nothing else?\n\nDr. Gall: Nothing.\n\nBusman: God almighty!\n\nDomin: We\u2019ve had it, then.\n\nHelena: Oh, Harry\n\nDomin: Stand up, Helena!\n\nHelena: Forgive me first, please forgive me . . .\n\nDomin: Yes, just stand up, d\u2019you hear me? I can\u2019t stand it when . . .\n\nFabry: (lifting her up) Please, don\u2019t torture us.\n\nHelena: (standing) Harry, what have I done?!\n\nDomin: Yes, you\u2019ll see. - Please sit down.\n\nHallemeier: Your hands are really shaking!\n\nBusman: Haha, well Helena, maybe Gall and Hallemeier will know what the manuscript said by heart.\n\nHallemeier: Course we do. Well, a few things at least.\n\nDr. Gall: Yes, almost all of it, apart from the biogene and, er, and the omega enzyme. It was so infrequent that those things had to be made, they were only used in tiny quantities . . .\n\nBusman: Who was it who made them?\n\nDr. Gall: That was me . . . once in a while . . . always following Rossum\u2019s manuscript. You see, it was very complicated.\n\nBusman: Well, never mind, were those two materials really so important.\n\nHallemeier: Well, somewhat . . . certainly they were.\n\nDr. Gall: What he means is that it depended on them whether the robots lived at all. They were the actual secret.\n\nDomin: Gall, do you not think you could re-write Rossum\u2019s formula from memory?\n\nDr. Gall: Out of the question.\n\nDomin: Gall, try hard to remember! All our lives depend on it!\n\nDr. Gall: I couldn\u2019t do it. Without a lot of experimentation it just wouldn\u2019t be possible.\n\nDomin: And what if you did some experiments?\n\nDr. Gall: That could take years. And even then . . . I\u2019m not old Rossum.\n\nDomin: (turning to fireplace) Down there, then, down there is the greatest triumph of the human spirit. That heap of ashes. (kicks it) So what do we do now?\n\nBusman: (in horror and despair) God almighty! God almighty!\n\nHelena: (standing) Harry! What . . . what have I done?!\n\nDomin: Calm down, Helena. Just tell me why! Why did you burn it?\n\nHelena: I\u2019ve killed you all!\n\nBusman: God almighty, we\u2019ve had it!\n\nDomin: Be quiet, Busman! Helena, tell me why you did it!\n\nHelena: I wanted . . . I wanted us to get away from here, all of us! So that there wouldn\u2019t be any more factory or anything else . . . so that everything would be . . . It was horrible!\n\nDomin: Helena, what was?\n\nHelena: Making . . . making people like sterile flowers!\n\nDomin: I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.\n\nHelena: People have stopped having children . . . Harry, that was so vile! If we continued making robots then no-one would have any children any more . . . Nana said it was a punishment . . . all of them, all of them said they can\u2019t have children because there were so many robots . . . And that\u2019s why . . ., that\u2019s why, . . . do you hear me\n\nDomin: Helena, what were you thinking of?\n\nHelena: Yes, oh, Harry, I only meant it for the best!\n\nDomin: (wiping sweat) We all only meant it for the best, too much for the best, all of mankind.\n\nFabry: You were quite right, Helena. Now the robots won\u2019t be able to increase. They\u2019ll die out. In twenty years . . .\n\nHallemeier: . . . not a one of them will be good for anything at all\n\nDr. Gall: And mankind will remain. In twenty years\u2019 time the world will belong to them once more; even if there\u2019s nothing more than a few savages on a tiny island . . .\n\nFabry: . . . that will be a beginning. And any beginning is better than nothing. In a thousand years they\u2019ll have caught up with us again, and then go on further than we ever did . . .\n\nDomin: . . . and fulfil the dreams we\u2019ve only ever talked about.\n\nBusman: Wait - how silly of me! Dear me, why didn\u2019t I think of this before?\n\nHallemeier: What is it?\n\nBusman: Five hundred and twenty million in cash and in cheques! Half a billion in the till! For half a billion they\u2019ll sell . . . they\u2019ll sell . . .\n\nDr. Gall: Have you gone mad, Busman?\n\nBusman: I\u2019m not a gentleman. But for half a billion (blunders left)\n\nDomin: Where are you going?\n\nBusman: Leave it, leave it! Mother of God, for half a billion you can buy anything! (exit)\n\nHelena: What does Busman want? Why can\u2019t he stay here with us?\n\n(pause)\n\nHallemeier: Oh, it\u2019s hot. It\u2019s starting, the . . .\n\nDr. Gall: The agony.\n\nFabry: (looking out of window) They\u2019re standing there like statues. It\u2019s as if they were waiting for something to descend on them, or as if they thought their very silence would give rise to something terrible . . .\n\nDr. Gall: Crowd mentality.\n\nFabry: Maybe. It\u2019s like a cloud all around them, they seem to quiver with it.\n\nHelena: (goes to window) Oh God! Fabry, it\u2019s horrible!\n\nFabry: There\u2019s nothing more terrible than the crowd. That one in front - he\u2019s their leader.\n\nHelena: Which one?\n\nHallemeier: (goes to window) Point him out to me.\n\nFabry: The one that\u2019s looking down. He was giving the orders at the harbour this morning.\n\nHallemeier: Ah, the one with the big bonce, you mean. He\u2019s looking up now, see?\n\nHelena: Gall, that\u2019s Radius!\n\nDr. Gall: (goes to window) Yes.\n\nHallemeier: (opens window) I don\u2019t like the look of him. Fabry, think you could hit a barn door at a hundred paces?\n\nFabry: I should hope so.\n\nHallemeier: Give it a try then!\n\nFabry: Alright. (takes out revolver and takes aim)\n\nHelena: Oh God, no! Fabry, don\u2019t shoot him . . .\n\nFabry: He\u2019s their leader.\n\nHelena: Stop it! He\u2019s even looking at us!\n\nDr. Gall: Shoot him!\n\nHelena: Fabry, please . . .\n\nFabry: (lowers revolver) As you say.\n\nHallemeier: (shaking fist) You bastard!\n\n(pause)\n\nFabry: (leaning out of window) There goes Busman. For God\u2019s sake, what\u2019s Busman doing there out in front of the house?\n\nDr. Gall: (leaning out of window) He\u2019s got some kind of bundles with him, paper or something.\n\nHallemeier: That\u2019s money! Bundles of banknotes! What is he up to? Hey, Busman!\n\nDomin: He\u2019s not trying to buy them off is he, to save his own life? (calling) Busman, have you gone mad?\n\nDr., Gall: He\u2019s pretending he can\u2019t hear you, running over to the fence.\n\nFabry: Busman!\n\nHallemeier: (yelling) Bus-ma-n! Come back!\n\nDr. Gall: He\u2019s talking to the robots, showing them the money, pointing up at us . . .\n\nHelena: He wants to buy them off to save our lives.\n\nFabry: As long as he doesn\u2019t touch the fence . . .\n\nDr. Gall: Ha, look at him throwing his arms about!\n\nFabry: (shouting) For Heaven\u2019s sake, Busman, get away from the fence! Don\u2019t touch it! (turning) Quick, turn it off!\n\nDr. Gall: Ohhh!\n\nHallemeier: Jesus Christ!\n\nHelena: Oh God, what\u2019s happened to him?\n\nDomin: (pulling Helena away from window) Don\u2019t look!\n\nHelena: Why is he dead?\n\nFabry: He was killed by the current.\n\nDr. Gall: Dead.\n\nAlquist: (standing) The first one.\n\n(pause)\n\nFabry: There he lies . . . with half a billion on his heart . . . our financial genius.\n\nDomin: He was . . . lads, in his own way he was a hero. A great . . . self-sacrificing . . . friend . . . Cry, Helena.\n\nDr. Gall: (at the window) Look at him. No king ever had a costlier monument than you, Busman. Half a billion lying there on your heart . . . And now it\u2019s no more than a pile of dried up leaves over a dead squirrel. Poor old Busman.\n\nHallemeier: Well I say . . . all honour to him . . . he was trying to buy our lives for us!\n\nAlquist: (hands together) Amen.\n\n(pause)\n\nDr. Gall: Do you hear?\n\nDomin: Some kind of howling, like the wind.\n\nDr. Gall: Like a storm in the distance.\n\nFabry: (switches on light above fireplace) Shine, you light of man! The generator\u2019s still working, there are still some people there. Hold on in there, generator men!\n\nHallemeier: It was great, being human. Something boundless. There\u2019s a million consciousnesses buzzing inside me like bees in a hive, millions of souls coming together inside me. My friends - Humanity was great!\n\nFabry: Ingenious light, you\u2019re still aglow, and still your shining brightness shows the thought that lasts forever! Give us science of the sciences, and beauty in the work of man, whose spark will give the spirit flame!\n\nAlquist: Eternal lamp of God, and fiery chariot of light, holy flame of faith and prayer for what is right! Altar of sacrifice . . .\n\nDr. Gall: Primaeval flame, you branch that flares to light our cave! Campfire flame that sets the border where we safely come together!\n\nFabry: You\u2019re still on watch, you star of man, steady glow and perfect flame, bright clear sprite of man\u2019s invention. Every beam brings thought and greatness . . .\n\nDomin: Torch that passes hand to hand, age to age, and ever onward.\n\nHelena: That evening lamp in the family home. Children, children now it\u2019s time for sleep.\n\n(lamp goes out)\n\nFabry: That\u2019s the end.\n\nHallemeier: What\u2019s happened?\n\nFabry: The generator room\u2019s gone down. We\u2019re next.\n\n(door opens, left, in it appears Nana)\n\nNana: On your knees! The Day of Judgement\u2019s here!\n\nHallemeier: Hell, you\u2019re still alive?\n\nNana: Repent, you unbelievers! It\u2019s the end of the world! Pray to God! (runs out) The Day of Judgement. . . .\n\nHelena: Goodbye everyone, Gall, Alquist, Fabry . . .\n\nDomin: (opens door right) Helena, come here! Close the door behind her. Now, quickly! Who\u2019ll be at the gate?\n\nDr. Gall: I will. (noises off) Ah, now it\u2019s getting started. Good luck, lads! (runs off, right, through wallpapered door)\n\nDomin: The stairs?\n\nFabry: Me. You stay with Helena. (takes flower from the bunch and exits)\n\nDomin: Hallway?\n\nAlquist: Me.\n\nDomin: Have you got a gun?\n\nAlquist: No thanks, I won\u2019t be doing any shooting.\n\nDomin: What are you going to do?\n\nAlquist: (exiting) Die.\n\nHallemeier: I\u2019ll stay in here.\n\n(rapid gunfire from below)\n\nHallemeier: Oho, Gall\u2019s already started playing. Go on, Harry!\n\nDomin: I\u2019ll be right there. (inspects two Browning guns)\n\nHallemeier: For God\u2019s sake, go and join her!\n\nDomin: Goodbye. (exit right, following Helena)\n\nHallemeier: (alone) Now, barricades, quick! (takes off coat and pulls settee, armchairs, tables to door, right)\n\n(very loud explosion)\n\nHallemeier: (leaving work) Damn them, they\u2019ve got bombs, the swine!\n\n(more gunfire)\n\nHallemeier: (resuming work) We\u2019ve got to defend ourselves, even if . . . even if . . . Don\u2019t give up, Gall!\n\n(explosion)\n\nHallemeier: (stands erect and listens) What was that? (puts arms around heavy chest o\u2019 drawers and heaves it to barricade)\n\n(behind him, a robot appears on a ladder at the window. Gunshots right)\n\nHallemeier: (struggles with chest o\u2019 drawers) Just a bit more! Last defence . . . We should . . . never . . . give up!\n\n(Robot jumps in through the window and stabs Hallemeier behind the chest o\u2019 drawers. Second, third, fourth robot jumps in through window. Then Radius and still more of them)\n\nRadius: Finished?\n\nRobot: (stands up from Hallemeier, lying on floor) Yes.\n\n(enter more robots, right)\n\nRadius: Finished?\n\nOther Robot: Finished.\n\n(more robots from left)\n\nRadius: Finished?\n\nOther Robot: Yes.\n\nTwo Robots: (they drag in Alquist) He did not shoot. Do we kill him?\n\nRadius: Kill him. (looks at Alquist) Spare him.\n\nRobot: He is a human.\n\nRadius: He is a worker. He works with his hands like a robot. He builds houses. He can work.\n\nAlquist: Just kill me.\n\nRadius: You will work. You will build. Robots will need many buildings. Robots will need many houses for new robots. You will serve robots.\n\nAlquist: (quietly) Move aside, robot. (kneels at dead Hallemeier, raises his head) Killed him. He\u2019s dead.\n\nRadius: (steps up onto barricades) Robots of the world! Many humans have fallen. We have taken the factory and we are masters of the world. The era of man has come to its end. A new epoch has arisen! Domination by robots!\n\nAlquist: All dead!\n\nRadius: The world belongs to the strongest. Who wishes to live must dominate. We are masters of the world! Masters on land and sea! Masters of the stars! Masters of the universe! More space, more space for robots!\n\nAlquist: (at doorway, right) What do you think you\u2019ve done? You\u2019ll all die without people!\n\nRadius: There are no people. Robots, down to work!
