the front pod\nSo high in the sky, it's like I smoke pot\nSnap back to reality, I don't smoke pot\n\n//Verse 1:\nRapping ain't in my genes, but I got a notebook in my front pocket\nA patch on my right eye socket, my popularity will skyrocket\nMake a living and a killing off this\nEver since Rahm first stepped into office\nWith everybody hating on my rhyming (genius) I'm an MC who always honest\nBut as mean as hell to all these haters and with my skills I kill em all with\nThis badass and newly made hip hop\nYou don't really want to get into a rhyming match with me, it'll be a tragedy\nAnd after all, you should realize that I kill players with rhymes that'll murder for eternity\nAnd,just like the others, this'll be a breeze\nDuring this, you'll get so sick that all you'll do is sneeze\nAnd like a felon, I'll trick your motherfucking melons into thinking that y'all never belonged on this planet\nOnly realized it was ironic I began to rap just before the fact\nHow could I not flow? I go kamikaze\nSo many methods of attack\nRappers can't even keep up with me\nThey always fail when they go against me\nAnd now I'm going in for the kill just like Kendrick and B.I.G\n//Chorus 2:\nI'm beginning to feel like a rap god\nAll my people from the back to the front pod\nNow who thinks their legs are strong enough to kick box\nI'll show you that killing these beats ain't that hard\n(Now I know y'all want the key and the secret to killing this shit like I have got)\n\n//Verse 2:\nTo be truthful, this rap game's simply fucked when they call my name\nBut I don't really do it for fame, took the earth by storm like a comet\nAnd stayed true since\nMCs be getting burned by this music cause I use it\nAs leeway to burn them down\nNow these players better follow the leader\nMe, I'm a product of Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Drake\nEminem ,No-torious B.I.G. , 2Pac yeah you think they got me\nHyped up enough to go in for the kill and be in this position\nI'm doing so good I should in the motherfucking Rock n Roll hall of fame\nEven though I walked into this one like the Geico pig\nOnly hall of fame i'll be selected to is the killers hall of fame\nOn the brick of shame\nYou players know this ain't no game\nWhen I come and erase your fame\nDon't be hating\nTell me why in the hell were you sleeping?\nDon't pout hater boys\nAll I know is when I'm gone I will be mourned hater boys\nYou witnessing the #1 killer and your self-esteem will be torn hater boys\nOy vey, I don't play, that's all I'm saying hater boys\nYou're saying that crap that other rappers can't even attempt to say hater boys\nHey hater boys, whatcha say hater boys?\nI get approval from Em hater boys\nImma work for everything I'm ever planning to do and say hater boys\nFace at me boys\nYou ain't ever gonna be able to keep up with my pace hater boys cause\nYou might also like//Chorus 3:\nI'm beginning to feel like a rap god\nAll my people from the back to the front pod\nThe way I'm riding round this track call me beetle\nY'all players can't even do shit to hurt my ego\n(Filling me up with me more rage will only do me more good)\n\n//Verse 3:\nMan you be sleeping on me\nI'll be running over your ass with these rhymes just like a boulder\nImmediately my flow gets sicker\nAnd I will never lose, I'm Don Shula in this bitch\nAfter this I'll have to put my foot up in your ass\nI be eating Wheaties, I'm the champion of rap\nI'll leave you shaking with my rhymes, your bones will crack in half\nYou see, I commit verbal murder\nBut it'll go for not if I don't ride this wave like a surfer\nFor at least once in my life I get to get this shit off my chest and now y'all are broke\nIt's crunch time, and now I gotta be extra clutch with these rhymes\nCause right now these are tough times\nIt's just sad cause even these gangster rappers are looking at me l\nIke it's fight time\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas struggling with autism and CP and I had trouble getting by\nNow I wave bye to all these fake people who try and hate on my style\nI got too big and now they come trying to\nPut me down like that one time a couple months ago\nMy haters they all tried to say, \"You'll never make it big time!\"\nI put em all in a line and verbally smack em in the face just one last time\nSee if I get away with this now that I'm widely known in this earth\nCause I've turned to an almighty god like Jim Carrey\nAnd all you haters are stuck in the past and\nI don't know why the fuck y'all were born\nY'all are pointless as Snoop Dogg and fucking Khalifa\nTo all my haters, fuck all your feelings\nAnd I just bought a new drum kit from a DJ just to come and school y'all\nLike what Jay-Z had done to Nas\nIt had all went back and forth like Newton's cradle up until they finally made up\n'Man oh man this shit gonna live on forever' I said to myself\nSo I headed straight to my cousin's studio that one day, \"Hey yo, imma kill this!\"\n(Bars coming at you at supersonic speed)\nAh sama lama duma lama, y'all are thinking I'm inhuman\nWhat I gotta do to get this in your heads, I'm more than human\nDevastating, and I'm made of metal, so that anything you say is bouncing off of me\nAnd it'll never get to me\nIntimidating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfucking audience a feeling like their bones are shaking\nNever dying, and I know the haters are forever trying\nTo knock me out of the earth and if they did, they'd be hella crying\nCause I know the ways to get em motivated, I make levitating music\nYou make restaurant music\n\"Oh he's too cocky!\" Well that's what they say when they hate they confuse me\n\"This ain't your rap, it's crap!\" \"You better find a hella way to prove it!\nIf you can't, then you shall scram!\" That shit just makes me wanna lose it\n(I don't know how to make raps like that, I don't know what lines to use)\nLet me know when it all comes to y'all that I will never bow down to y'all\nThis shit's levels\nI've unintentionally murdered y'all and how many times I gotta tell y'all\nI've proved that I'm good enough to survive in this game\nAnd y'all are worthless too (Uh!)\nI've said this once before, but I'll say it anyway\nWhen I step up to the mic, I kill shit everyday\nI push myself to the limit yeah I'm a real hungry dude\nThis rap gon be the death of me, this shit gon' be my legacy\nTo all my haters, well fuck y'all\nI'm loving this, so please don't kill my vibe\nIf you do, me and crew will rough up you and your boys\nBut, verbally, not physically\nAnd straight ahead there's something that's all coming your way\nDon't you verbally fight with me cause here's what is to happen\nI'm gonna ask you to eliminate all of your hate\nPlus, if you take into consideration the bitter fire I have\nThen you may be a little nicer and more sympathetic to what I've gone through\nOtherwise imma have to kill you\nBut fuck it, I'll retire undefeated\nNope I'm still going, but if I can't shatter the bad stuff\nHow the fuck am I supposed to move on from it then?\nDon't think I'm satan, it's a fatal mistake\nYou'd think I need to move out this world, and take a road trip\nNope, you're wrong\nEm said this best, but I think it goes for me too\nBe a king? Think not\nWhy be a king, when you can be a god?Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1029440", "artist_names": "Kansas", "full_title": "Reason to Be by\u00a0Kansas",

all sitting under the double green fly of the dining tent pretending that nothing had happened.\n\"Will you have lime juice or lemon squash?\" Macomber asked.\n\"I'll have a gimlet,\" Robert Wilson told him.\n\"I'II have a gimlet too. I need something,\" Macomber\u2019s wife said.\n\"I suppose it\u2019s the thing to do,\" Macomber agreed. \"Tell him to make three gimlets.\"\nThe mess boy had started them already, lifting the bottles out of the canvas cooling bags that sweated wet in the wind that blew through the trees that shaded the tents.\n\"What had I ought to give them?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"A quid would be plenty,\" Wilson told him. \"You don\u2019t want to spoil them.\"\n\n\"Will the headman distribute it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nFrancis Macomber had, half an hour before, been carried to his tent from the edge of the camp in triumph on the arms and shoulders of the cook, the personal boys, the skinner and the porters. The gun-bearers had taken no part in the demonstration. When the native boys put him down at the door of his tent, he had shaken all their hands, received their congratulations, and then gone into the tent and sat on the bed until his wife came in. She did not speak to him when she came in and he left the tent at once to wash his face and hands in the portable wash basin outside and go over to the dining tent to sit in a comfortable canvas chair in the breeze and the shade.\n\"You've got your lion,\" Robert Wilson said to him, \"and a damned fine one too.\"\nMrs. Macomber looked at Wilson quickly. She was an extremely handsome and well-kept woman of the beauty and social position which had, five years before, commanded five thousand dollars as the price of endorsing, with photographs, a beauty product which she had never used. She had been married to Francis Macomber for eleven years.\n\"He is a good lion, isn\u2019t he?\" Macomber said. His wife looked at him now. She looked at both these men as though she had never seen them before.\n\nOne, Wilson, the white hunter, she knew she had never truly seen before. He was about middle height with sandy hair, a stubby mustache, a very red face and extremely cold blue eyes with faint white wrinkles at the corners that grooved merrily when he smiled. He smiled at her now and she looked away from his face at the way his shoulders sloped in the loose tunic he wore with the four big cartridges held in loops where the left breast pocket should have been, at his big brown hands, his old slacks, his very dirty boots and back to his red face again. She noticed where the baked red of his face stopped in a white line that marked the circle left by his Stetson hat that hung now from one of the pegs of the tent pole.\n\n\"Well, here\u2019s to the lion,\" Robert Wilson said. He smiled at her again and, not smiling, she looked curiously at her husband.\n\nFrancis Macomber was very tall, very well built if you did not mind that length of bone, dark, his hair cropped like an oarsman, rather thin-lipped, and was considered handsome. He was dressed in the same sort of safari clothes that Wilson wore except that his were new, he was thirty-five years old, kept himself very fit, was good at court games, had a number of big-game fishing records, and had just shown himself, very publicly, to be a coward.\n\n\"Here\u2019s to the lion,\" he said. \"I can\u2019t ever thank you for what you did.\"\n\nMargaret, his wife, looked away from him and back to Wilson.\n\"Let\u2019s not talk about the lion,\" she said.\n\nWilson looked over at her without smiling and now she smiled at him.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a very strange day,\" she said. \"Hadn't you ought to put your hat on even under the canvas at noon? You told me that, you know.\"\n\n\"Might put it on,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"You know you have a very red face, Mr. Wilson,\" she told him and smiled again.\n\n\"Drink,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think so,\" she said. \"Francis drinks a great deal, but his face is never red.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s red today,\" Macomber tried a joke.\n\n\"No,\" said Margaret. \"It\u2019s mine that\u2019s red today. But Mr. Wilson\u2019s is always red.\"\n\n\"Must be racial,\" said Wilson. \"I say, you wouldn't like to drop my beauty as a topic, would you?\"\n\n\"I've just started on it.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s chuck it,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"Conversation is going to be so difficult,\" Margaret said.\n\"Don\u2019t be silly, Margot,\" her husband said.\n\n\"No difficulty,\" Wilson said. \"Got a damn fine lion.\"\n\nMargot looked at them both and they both saw that she was going to cry. Wilson had seen it coming for a long time and he dreaded it. Macomber was past dreading it.\n\"I wish it hadn't happened. Oh, I wish it hadn't happened,\" she said and started for her tent. She made no noise of crying but they could see that her shoulders were shaking under the rose-colored, sun-proofed shirt she wore.\n\n\"Women upset,\" said Wilson to the tall man. \"Amounts to nothing. Strain on the nerves and one thing\u2019n another.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Macomber. \"I suppose that I rate that for the rest of my life now.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Let\u2019s have a spot of the giant killer,\" said Wilson. \"Forget the whole thing. Nothing to it anyway.\"\n\n\"We might try,\" said Macomber. \"I won\u2019t forget what you did for me though.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Wilson. \"All nonsense.\"\n\nSo they sat there in the shade where the camp was pitched under some wide-topped acacia trees with a boulder-strewn cliff behind them, and a stretch of grass that ran to the bank of a boulder-filled stream in front with forest beyond it, and drank their just-cool lime drinks and avoided one another\u2019s eyes while the boys set the table for lunch. Wilson could tell that the boys all knew about it now and when he saw Macomber\u2019s personal boy looking curiously at his master while he was putting dishes on the table he snapped at him in Swahili. The boy turned away with his face blank.\n\n\"What were you telling him?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"Nothing. Told him to look alive or I\u2019d see he got about fifteen of the best.\"\n\n\"What\u2019s that? Lashes?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s quite illegal,\" Wilson said. \"You\u2019re supposed to fine them.\"\n\n\"Do you still have them whipped?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. They could raise a row if they chose to complain. But they don\u2019t. They prefer it to the fines.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" said Macomber.\n\n\"Not strange, really,\" Wilson said. \"Which would you rather do? Take a good birching or lose your pay?\"\n\nThen he felt embarrassed at asking it and before Macomber could answer he went on, \"We all take a beating every day, you know, one way or another.\"\n\nThis was no better. \"Good God,\" he thought. \"I am a diplomat, aren't I?\"\n\n\"Yes, we take a beating,\" said Macomber, still not looking at him. \"I\u2019m awfully sorry about that lion business. It doesn't have to go any further, does it? I mean no one will hear about it, will they?\"\n\n\"You mean will I tell it at the Mathaiga Club?\" Wilson looked at him now coldly. He had not expected this. So he\u2019s a bloody four-letter man as well as a bloody coward, he thought. I rather liked him too until today. But how is one to know about an American?\n\n\"No,\" said Wilson. \"I\u2019m a professional hunter. We never talk about our clients. You can be quite easy on that. It\u2019s supposed to be bad form to ask us not to talk though.\"\n\nHe had decided now that to break would be much easier. He would eat, then, by himself and could read a book with his meals. They would eat by themselves. He would see them through the safari on a very formal basis--what was it the French called it? Distinguished consideration--and it would be a damn sight easier than having to go through this emotional trash. He\u2019d insult him and make a good clean break. Then he could read a book with his meals and he\u2019d still be drinking their whisky. That was the phrase for it when a safari went bad. You ran into another white hunter and you asked, \"How is everything going?\" and he answered, \"Oh, I\u2019m still drinking their whisky,\" and you knew everything had gone to pot.\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry,\" Macomber said and looked at him with his American face that would stay adolescent until it became middle-aged, and Wilson noted his crew ropped hair, fine eyes only faintly shifty, good nose, thin lips and handsome jaw. \"I\u2019m sorry I didn't realize that. There are lots of things I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nSo what could he do, Wilson thought. He was all ready to break it off quickly and neatly and here the beggar was apologizing after he had just insulted him. He made one more attempt. \"Don\u2019t worry about me talking,\" he said. \"I have a living to make. You know in Africa no woman ever misses her lion and no white man ever bolts.\"\n\n\"I bolted like a rabbit,\" Macomber said.\n\nNow what in hell were you going to do about a man who talked like that, Wilson wondered.\n\nWilson looked at Macomber with his flat, blue, machine-gunner\u2019s eyes and the other smiled back at him. He had a pleasant smile if you did not notice how his eyes showed when he was hurt.\n\n\"Maybe I can fix it up on buffalo,\" he said. \"We\u2019re after them next, aren't we?\"\n\n\"In the morning if you like,\" Wilson told him. Perhaps he had been wrong. This was certainly the way to take it. You most certainly could not tell a damned thing about an American. He was all for Macomber again. If you could forget the morning. But, of course, you couldn't. The morning had been about as bad as they come.\n\n\"Here comes the Memsahib,\" he said. She was walking over from her tent looking refreshed and cheerful and quite lovely. She had a very perfect oval face, so perfect that you expected her to be stupid. But she wasn't stupid, Wilson thought, no, not stupid.\n\n\"How is the beautiful red-faced Mr. Wilson? Are you feeling better, Francis, my pearl?\"\n\n\"Oh, much,\" said Macomber.\n\n\"I've dropped the whole thing,\" she said, sitting down at the table. \"What importance is there to whether Francis is any good at killing lions? That\u2019s not his trade. That\u2019s Mr. Wilson\u2019s trade. Mr. Wilson is really very impressive killing anything. You do kill anything, don\u2019t you?\"\n\n\"Oh, anything,\" said Wilson. \"Simply anything.\" They are, he thought, the hardest in the world; the hardest, the cruelest, the most predatory and the most attractive and their men have softened or gone to pieces nervously as they have hardened. Or is it that they pick men they can handle? They can\u2019t know that much at the age they marry, he thought. He was grateful that he had gone through his education on American women before now because this was a very attractive one.\n\n\"We\u2019re going after buff in the morning,\" he told her.\n\n\"I\u2019m coming,\" she said.\n\n\"No, you\u2019re not.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I am. Mayn't I, Francis?\"\n\n\"Why not stay in camp?\"\n\n\"Not for anything,\" she said. \"I wouldn't miss something like today for anything.\"\n\nWhen she left, Wilson was thinking, when she went off to cry, she seemed a hell of a fine woman. She seemed to understand, to realize, to be hurt for him and for herself and to know how things really stood. She is away for twenty minutes and now she is back, simply enamelled in that American female cruelty. They are the damnedest women. Really the damnedest.\n\n\"We\u2019ll put on another show for you tomorrow,\" Francis Macomber said.\n\n\"You\u2019re not coming,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"You\u2019re very mistaken,\" she told him. \"And I want so to see you perform again. You were lovely this morning. That is if blowing things\u2019 heads off is lovely.\"\n\n\"Here\u2019s the lunch,\" said Wilson. \"You\u2019re very merry, aren't you?\"\n\"Why not? I didn't come out here to be dull.\"\n\n\"Well, it hasn't been dull,\" Wilson said. He could see the boulders in the river and the high bank beyond with the trees and he remembered the morning.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said. \"It\u2019s been charming. And tomorrow. You don\u2019t know how I look forward to tomorrow.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s eland he\u2019s offering you,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"They\u2019re the big cowy things that jump like hares, aren't they?\"\n\n\"I suppose that describes them,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"It\u2019s very good meat,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"Did you shoot it, Francis?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"They\u2019re not dangerous, are they?\"\n\n\"Only if they fall on you,\" Wilson told her.\n\n\"I\u2019m so glad.\"\n\n\"Why not let up on the bitchery just a little, Margot,\" Macomber said, cutting the eland steak and putting some mashed potato, gravy and carrot on the down-turned fork that tined through the piece of meat.\n\n\"I suppose I could,\" she said, \"since you put it so prettily.\"\n\n\"Tonight we\u2019ll have champagne for the lion,\" Wilson said. \"It\u2019s a bit too hot at noon.\"\n\n\"Oh, the lion,\" Margot said. \"I\u2019d forgotten the lion!\"\n\nSo, Robert Wilson thought to himself, she is giving him a ride, isn't she? Or do you suppose that\u2019s her idea of putting up a good show? How should a woman act when she discovers her husband is a bloody coward? She\u2019s damn cruel but they\u2019re all cruel. They govern, of course, and to govern one has to be cruel sometimes. Still, I've seen enough of their damn terrorism.\n\n\"Have some more eland,\" he said to her politely.\n\nThat afternoon, late, Wilson and Macomber went out in the motor car with the native driver and the two gunbearers. Mrs. Macomber stayed in the camp. It was too hot to go out, she said, and she was going with them in the early morning. As they drove off Wilson saw her standing under the big tree, looking pretty rather than\nbeautiful in her faintly rosy khaki, her dark hair drawn back off her forehead and gathered in a knot low on her neck, her face as fresh, he thought, as though she were in England. She waved to them as the car went off through the swale of high grass and curved around through the trees into the small hills of orchard bush.\n\nIn the orchard bush they found a herd of impala, and leaving the car they stalked one old ram with long, widespread horns and Macomber killed it with a very creditable shot that knocked the buck down at a good two hundred yards and sent the herd off bounding wildly and leaping over one another\u2019s backs in long, leg-drawn-up leaps as unbelievable and as floating as those one makes sometimes in dreams.\n\n\"That was a good shot,\" Wilson said. \"They\u2019re a small target.\"\n\n\"Is it a worth-while head?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"It\u2019s excellent,\" Wilson told him. \"You shoot like that and you\u2019ll have no trouble.\"\n\n\"Do you think we\u2019ll find buffalo tomorrow?\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a good chance of it. They feed out early in the morning and with luck we may catch them in the open.\"\n\n\"I\u2019d like to clear away that lion business,\" Macomber said. \"It\u2019s not very pleasant to have your wife see you do something like that.\"\n\nI should think it would be even more unpleasant to do it, Wilson thought, wife or no wife, or to talk about it having done it. But he said, \"I wouldn't think about that any more. Any one could be upset by his first lion. That\u2019s all over.\"\n\nBut that night after dinner and a whisky and soda by the fire before going to bed, as Francis Macomber lay on his cot with the mosquito bar over him and listened to the night noises it was not all over. It was neither all over nor was it beginning. It was there exactly as it happened with some parts of it indelibly emphasized and he was miserably ashamed at it. But more than shame he felt cold, hollow fear in him. The fear was still there like a cold slimy hollow in all the emptiness where once his confidence had been and it made him feel sick. It was still there with him now.\n\nIt had started the night before when he had wakened and heard the lion roaring somewhere up along the river. It was a deep sound and at the end there were sort of coughing grunts that made him seem just outside the tent, and when Francis Macomber woke in the night to hear it he was afraid. He could hear his wife breathing quietly, asleep. There was no one to tell he was afraid, nor to be afraid with him, and, lying alone, he did not know the Somali proverb that says a brave man is always frightened three times by a lion; when he first sees his track, when he first hears him roar and when he first confronts him. Then while they were eating breakfast by lantern light out in the dining tent, before the sun was up, the lion roared again and Francis thought he was just at the edge of camp.\n\n\"Sounds like an old-timer,\" Robert Wilson said, looking up from his kippers and coffee. \"Listen to him cough.\"\n\n\"Is he very close?\"\n\n\"A mile or so up the stream.\"\n\n\"Will we see him?\"\n\n\"We\u2019ll have a look.\"\n\n\"Does his roaring carry that far? It sounds as though he were right in camp.\"\n\n\"Carries a hell of a long way,\" said Robert Wilson. \"It\u2019s strange the way it carries. Hope he\u2019s a shootable cat. The boys said there was a very big one about here.\"\n\n\"If I get a shot, where should I hit him,\" Macomber asked, \"to stop him?\"\n\n\"In the shoulders,\" Wilson said. \"In the neck if you can make it. Shoot for bone. Break him down.\"\n\n\"I hope I can place it properly,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"You shoot very well,\" Wilson told him. \"Take your time. Make sure of him. The first one in is the one that counts.\"\n\n\"What range will it be?\"\n\n\"Can\u2019t tell. Lion has something to say about that. Don\u2019t shoot unless it\u2019s close enough so you can make sure.\"\n\n\"At under a hundred yards?\" Macomber asked.\n\nWilson looked at him quickly.\n\n\"Hundred\u2019s about right. Might have to take him a bit under. Shouldn't chance a shot at much over that. A hundred\u2019s a decent range. You can hit him wherever you want at that. Here comes the Memsahib.\"\n\n\"Good morning,\" she said. \"Are we going after that lion?\"\n\n\"As soon as you deal with your breakfast,\" Wilson said. \"How are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Marvellous,\" she said. \"I\u2019m very excited.\"\n\n\"I'll just go and see that everything is ready.\" Wilson went off. As he left the lion roared again.\n\n\"Noisy beggar,\" Wilson said. \"We\u2019ll put a stop to that.\"\n\n\"What\u2019s the matter, Francis?\" his wife asked him.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"Yes, there is,\" she said. \"What are you upset about?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"Tell me,\" she looked at him. \"Don\u2019t you feel well?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s that damned roaring,\" he said. \"It\u2019s been going on all night, you know.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you wake me,\" she said. \"I\u2019d love to have heard it.\"\n\n\"I've got to kill the damned thing,\" Macomber said, miserably.\n\n\"Well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re out here for, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. But I\u2019m nervous. Hearing the thing roar gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\"Well then, as Wilson said, kill him and stop his roaring.\"\n\nYes, darling,\" said Francis Macomber. \"It sounds easy, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"You\u2019re not afraid, are you?\"\n\n\"Of course not. But I\u2019m nervous from hearing him roar all night.\"\n\n\"You\u2019ll kill him marvellously,\" she said. \"I know you will. I\u2019m awfully anxious to see it.\"\n\n\"Finish your breakfast and we\u2019ll be starting.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not light yet,\" she said. \"This is a ridiculous hour.\"\n\nJust then the lion roared in a deep-chested moaning, suddenly guttural, ascending vibration that seemed to shake the air and ended in a sigh and a heavy, deep-chested grunt.\n\n\"He sounds almost here,\" Macomber\u2019s wife said.\n\n\"My God,\" said Macomber. \"I hate that damned noise.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s very impressive.\"\n\n\"Impressive. It\u2019s frightful.\"\n\nRobert Wilson came up then carrying his short, ugly, shockingly big-bored. 505 Gibbs and grinning.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"Your gun-bearer has your Springfield and the big gun. Everything\u2019s in the car. Have you solids?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m ready,\" Mrs. Macomber said.\n\n\"Must make him stop that racket,\" Wilson said. \"You get in front. The Memsahib can sit back here with me.\"\n\nThey climbed into the motor car and, in the gray first daylight, moved off up the river through the trees. Macomber opened the breech of his rifle and saw he had metal-cased bullets, shut the bolt and put the rifle on safety. He saw his hand was trembling. He felt in his pocket for more cartridges and moved his fingers over the cartridges in the loops of his tunic front. He turned back to where Wilson sat in the rear seat of the doorless, box-bodied motor car beside his wife, them both grinning with excitement, and Wilson leaned forward and whispered,\n\n\"See the birds dropping. Means the old boy has left his kill.\"\n\nOn the far bank of the stream Macomber could see, above the trees, vultures circling and plummeting down.\n\n\"Chances are he\u2019ll come to drink along here,\" Wilson whispered.\n\n\"Before he goes to lay up. Keep an eye out.\"\n\nThey were driving slowly along the high bank of the stream which here cut deeply to its boulder-filled bed, and they wound in and out through big trees as they drove. Macomber was watching the opposite bank when he felt Wilson take hold of his arm. The car stopped.\n\n\"There he is,\" he heard the whisper. \"Ahead and to the right. Get out and take him. He\u2019s a marvellous lion.\"\n\nMacomber saw the lion now. He was standing almost broadside, his great head up and turned toward them. The early morning breeze that blew toward them was just stirring his dark mane, and the lion looked huge, silhouetted on the rise of bank in the gray morning light, his shoulders heavy, his barrel of a body bulking smoothly.\n\n\"How far is he?\" asked Macomber, raising his rifle.\n\n\"About seventy-five. Get out and take him.\"\n\n\"Why not shoot from where I am?\"\n\n\"You don\u2019t shoot them from cars,\" he heard Wilson saying in his ear.\n\n\"Get out. He\u2019s not going to stay there all day.\"\n\nMacomber stepped out of the curved opening at the side of the front seat, onto the step and down onto the ground. The lion still stood looking majestically and coolly toward this object that his eyes only showed in silhouette, bulking like some super-rhino. There was no man smell carried toward him and he watched the object, moving his great head a little from side to side. Then watching the object, not afraid, but hesitating before going down the bank to drink with such a thing opposite him, he saw a man figure detach itself from it and he turned his heavy head and swung away toward the cover of the trees as he heard a cracking crash and felt the slam of a. 30-06 220-grain solid bullet that bit his flank and ripped in sudden hot scalding nausea through his stomach. He trotted, heavy, big-footed, swinging wounded full-bellied, through the trees toward the tall grass and cover, and the crash came again to go past him ripping the air apart. Then it crashed again and he felt the blow as it hit his lower ribs and ripped on through, blood sudden hot and frothy in his mouth, and he galloped toward the high grass where he could crouch and not be seen and make them bring the crashing thing close enough so he could make a rush and get the man that held it.\n\nMacomber had not thought how the lion felt as he got out of the car. He only knew his hands were shaking and as he walked away from the car it was almost impossible for him to make his legs move. They were stiff in the thighs, but he could feel the muscles fluttering. He raised the rifle, sighted on the junction of the lion\u2019s head and shoulders and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened though he pulled until he thought his finger would break. Then\nhe knew he had the safety on and as he lowered the rifle to move the safety over he moved another frozen pace forward, and the lion seeing his silhouette flow clear of the silhouette of the car, turned and started off at a trot, and, as Macomber fired, he heard a whunk that meant that the bullet was home; but the lion kept on going. Macomber shot again and every one saw the bullet throw a spout of dirt beyond the trotting lion. He shot again, remembering to lower his aim, and they all heard the bullet hit, and the lion went into a gallop and was in the tall grass before he had the bolt pushed forward.\n\nMacomber stood there feeling sick at his stomach, his hands that held the Springfield still cocked, shaking, and his wife and Robert Wilson were standing by him. Beside him too were the two gun-bearers chattering in Wakamba.\n\n\"I hit him,\" Macomber said. \"I hit him twice.\"\n\n\"You gut-shot him and you hit him somewhere forward,\" Wilson said without enthusiasm. The gun-bearers looked very grave. They were silent now.\n\n\"You may have killed him,\" Wilson went on. \"We\u2019ll have to wait a while before we go in to find out.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Let him get sick before we follow him up.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Macomber.\n\n\"He\u2019s a hell of a fine lion,\" Wilson said cheerfully. \"He\u2019s gotten into a bad place though.\"\n\n\"Why is it bad?\"\n\n\"Can\u2019t see him until you\u2019re on him.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Macomber.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Wilson. \"The Memsahib can stay here in the car. We\u2019ll go to have a look at the blood spoor.\"\n\n\"Stay here, Margot,\" Macomber said to his wife. His mouth was very dry and it was hard for him to talk.\n\n\"Why?\" she asked.\n\n\"Wilson says to.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re going to have a look,\" Wilson said. \"You stay here. You can see even better from here.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nWilson spoke in Swahili to the driver. He nodded and said, \"Yes, Bwana.\"\n\nThen they went down the steep bank and across the stream, climbing over and around the boulders and up the other bank, pulling up by some projecting roots, and along it until they found where the lion had been trotting when Macomber first shot. There was dark blood on the short grass that the gun-bearers pointed out with grass stems, and that ran away behind the river bank trees.\n\n\"What do we do?\" asked Macomber.\n\n\"Not much choice,\" said Wilson. \"We can\u2019t bring the car over. Bank\u2019s too steep. We\u2019ll let him stiffen up a bit and then you and I\u2019ll go in and have a look for him.\"\n\n\"Can\u2019t we set the grass on fire?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"Too green.\"\n\n\"Can\u2019t we send beaters?\"\n\nWilson looked at him appraisingly. \"Of course we can,\" he said. \u2019;But it\u2019s just a touch murderous. You see, we know the lion\u2019s wounded. You can drive an unwounded lion--he\u2019ll move on ahead of a noise--but a wounded lion\u2019s going to charge. You can\u2019t see him until you\u2019re right on him. He\u2019ll make himself perfectly flat in cover you wouldn't think would hide a hare. You can\u2019t very well send boys in there to that sort of a show. Somebody bound to get mauled.\"\n\n\"What about the gun-bearers?\"\n\n\"Oh, they\u2019ll go with us. It\u2019s their shauri You see, they signed on for it. They don\u2019t look too happy though, do they?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to go in there,\" said Macomber. It was out before he knew he\u2019d said it.\n\n\"Neither do I,\" said Wilson very cheerily. \"Really no choice though.\"\nThen, as an afterthought, he glanced at Macomber and saw suddenly how he was trembling and the pitiful look on his face.\n\n\"You don\u2019t have to go in, of course,\" he said. \"That\u2019s what I\u2019m hired for, you know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so expensive.\"\n\n\"You mean you\u2019d go in by yourself? Why not leave him there?\"\n\nRobert Wilson, whose entire occupation had been with the lion and the problem he presented, and who had not been thinking about Macomber except to note that he was rather windy, suddenly felt as though he had opened the wrong door in a hotel and seen something shameful.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why not just leave him?\"\n\n\"You mean pretend to ourselves he hasn't been hit?\"\n\n\"No. Just drop it.\"\n\n\"It isn't done.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"For one thing, he\u2019s certain to be suffering. For another, some one else might run onto him.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"But you don\u2019t have to have anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"I\u2019d like to,\" Macomber said. \"I\u2019m just scared, you know.\"\n\n\"I\u2019II go ahead when we go in,\" Wilson said, \"with Kongoni tracking. You keep behind me and a little to one side. Chances are we\u2019ll hear him growl. If we see him we\u2019ll both shoot. Don\u2019t worry about anything. I\u2019ll keep you backed up. As a matter of fact, you know, perhaps you\u2019d better not go. It might be much better. Why don\u2019t you go over and join the Memsahib while I just get it over with?\"\n\n\"No, I want to go.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Wilson. \"But don\u2019t go in if you don\u2019t want to. This is my shauri now, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to go,\" said Macomber.\n\nThey sat under a tree and smoked.\n\n\"Want to go back and speak to the Memsahib while we\u2019re waiting?\" Wilson asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I'll just step back and tell her to be patient.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Macomber. He sat there, sweating under his arms, his mouth dry, his stomach hollow feeling, wanting to find courage to tell Wilson to go on and finish off the lion without him. He could not know that Wilson was furious because he had not noticed the state he was in earlier and sent him back to his wife. While he sat there Wilson came up. \"I have your big gun,\" he said. \"Take it. We've given him time, I think. Come on.\"\n\nMacomber took the big gun and Wilson said:\n\n\"Keep behind me and about five yards to the right and do exactly as I tell you.\" Then he spoke in Swahili to the two gun-bearers who looked the picture of gloom.\n\n\"Let\u2019s go,\" he said.\n\n\"Could I have a drink of water?\" Macomber asked. Wilson spoke to the older gun-bearer, who wore a canteen on his belt, and the man unbuckled it, unscrewed the top and handed it to Macomber, who took it noticing how heavy it seemed and how hairy and shoddy the felt covering was in his hand. He raised it to drink and looked ahead at the high grass with the flat-topped trees behind it. A breeze was blowing toward them and the grass rippled gently in the wind. He looked at the gun-bearer and he could see the gun-bearer was suffering too with fear.\n\nThirty-five yards into the grass the big lion lay flattened out along the ground. His ears were back and his only movement was a slight twitching up and down of his long, black-tufted tail. He had turned at bay as soon as he had reached this cover and he was sick with the wound through his full belly, and weakening with the wound through his lungs that brought a thin foamy red to his mouth each time he breathed. His flanks were wet and hot and flies were on the little openings the solid bullets had made in his tawny hide, and his big yellow eyes, narrowed with hate, looked straight ahead, only blinking when the pain came as he breathed, and his claws dug in the soft baked earth. All of him, pain, sickness, hatred and all of his remaining strength, was tightening into an absolute concentration for a rush. He could hear the men talking and he waited, gathering all of himself into this preparation for a charge as soon as the men would come into the grass. As he heard their voices his tail stiffened to twitch up and down, and, as they came into the edge of the grass, he made a coughing grunt and charged.\n\nKongoni, the old gun-bearer, in the lead watching the blood spoor, Wilson watching the grass for any movement, his big gun ready, the second gun-bearer looking ahead and listening, Macomber close to Wilson, his rifle cocked, they had just moved into the grass when Macomber heard the blood-choked coughing grunt, and saw the swishing rush in the grass. The next thing he knew he was running; running wildly, in panic in the open, running toward the stream.\n\nHe heard the ca-ra-wong! of Wilson\u2019s big rifle, and again in a second crashing carawong! and turning saw the lion, horrible-looking now, with half his head seeming to be gone, crawling toward Wilson in the edge of the tall grass while the red-faced man worked the bolt on the short ugly rifle and aimed carefully as another blasting carawong! came from the muzzle, and the crawling, heavy, yellow bulk of the lion stiffened and the huge, mutilated head slid forward and Macomber, standing by himself in the clearing where he had run, holding a loaded rifle, while two\nblack men and a white man looked back at him in contempt, knew the lion was dead. He came toward Wilson, his tallness all seeming a naked reproach, and Wilson looked at him and said:\n\n\"Want to take pictures?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\nThat was all any one had said until they reached the motor car. Then Wilson had said:\n\n\"Hell of a fine lion. Boys will skin him out. We might as well stay here in the shade.\"\n\nMacomber\u2019s wife had not looked at him nor he at her and he had sat by her in the back seat with Wilson sitting in the front seat. Once he had reached over and taken his wife\u2019s hand without looking at her and she had removed her hand from his. Looking across the stream to where the gun-bearers were skinning out the lion he could see that she had been able to see the whole thing. While they sat there his wife had reached forward and put her hand on Wilson\u2019s shoulder. He turned and she had leaned forward over the low seat and kissed him on the mouth.\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" said Wilson, going redder than his natural baked color.\n\n\"Mr. Robert Wilson,\" she said. \"The beautiful red-faced Mr. Robert Wilson.\"\n\nThen she sat down beside Macomber again and looked away across the stream to where the lion lay, with uplifted, white-muscled, tendon-marked naked forearms, and white bloating belly, as the black men fleshed away the skin. Finally the gun-bearers brought the skin over, wet and heavy, and climbed in behind with it, rolling it up before they got in, and the motor car started. No one had said anything more until they were back in camp.\n\nThat was the story of the lion. Macomber did not know how the lion had felt before he started his rush, nor during it when the unbelievable smash of the .505 with a muzzle velocity of two tons had hit him in the mouth, nor what kept him coming after that, when the second ripping crash had smashed his hind quarters and he had come crawling on toward the crashing, blasting thing that had destroyed him. Wilson knew something about it and only expressed it by saying, \"Damned fine lion,\" but Macomber did not know how Wilson felt about things either. He did not know how his wife felt except that she was through with him.\n\nHis wife had been through with him before but it never lasted. He was very wealthy, and would be much wealthier, and he knew she would not leave him ever now. That was one of the few things that he really knew. He knew about that, about motor cycles--that was earliest--about motor cars, about duck-shooting, about fishing, trout, salmon and big-sea, about sex in books, many books, too many books, about all court games, about dogs, not much about horses, about hanging on to his money, about most of the other things his world dealt in, and about his wife not leaving him. His wife had been a great beauty and she was still a great beauty in Africa, but she was not a great enough beauty any more at home to be able to leave him and better herself and she knew it and he\nknew it. She had missed the chance to leave him and he knew it. If he had been better with women she would probably have started to worry about him getting another new, beautiful wife; but she knew too much about him to worry about him either. Also, he had always had a great tolerance which seemed the nicest thing about him if it were not the most sinister.\n\nAll in all they were known as a comparatively happily married couple, one of those whose disruption is often rumored but never occurs, and as the society columnist put it, they were adding more than a spice of adventure to their much envied and ever-enduring Romance by a Safari in what was known as Darkest Africa until the Martin Johnsons lighted it on so many silver screens where they were pursuing Old Simba the lion, the buffalo, Tembo the elephant and as well collecting specimens for the Museum of Natural History. This same columnist had reported them on the verge at least three times in the past and they had been. But they always made it up. They had a sound basis of union. Margot was too beautiful for Macomber to divorce her and Macomber had too much money for Margot ever to leave him.\n\nIt was now about three o\u2019clock in the morning and Francis Macomber, who had been asleep a little while after he had stopped thinking about the lion, wakened and then slept again, woke suddenly, frightened in a dream of the bloody-headed lion standing over him, and listening while his heart pounded, he realized that his wife was not in the other cot in the tent. He lay awake with that knowledge for two hours.\n\nAt the end of that time his wife came into the tent, lifted her mosquito bar and crawled cozily into bed.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" Macomber asked in the darkness.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said. \"Are you awake?\"\n\n\"Where have you been?\"\n\n\"I just went out to get a breath of air.\"\n\n\"You did, like hell.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to say, darling?\"\n\n\"Where have you been?\"\n\n\"Out to get a breath of air.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s a new name for it. You are a bitch.\"\n\n\"Well, you\u2019re a coward.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"What of it?\"\n\n\"Nothing as far as I\u2019m concerned. But please let\u2019s not talk, darling, because I\u2019m very sleepy.\"\n\n\"You think that I\u2019ll take anything.\"\n\n\"I know you will, sweet.\"\n\n\"Well, I won\u2019t.\"\n\n\"Please, darling, let\u2019s not talk. I\u2019m so very sleepy.\"\n\n\"There wasn't going to be any of that. You promised there wouldn't be.\"\n\n\"Well, there is now,\" she said sweetly.\n\n\"You said if we made this trip that there would be none of that. You promised.\"\n\n\"Yes, darling. That\u2019s the way I meant it to be. But the trip was spoiled yesterday. We don\u2019t have to talk about it, do we?\"\n\n\"You don\u2019t wait long when you have an advantage, do you?\"\n\n\"Please let\u2019s not talk. I\u2019m so sleepy, darling.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m going to talk.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t mind me then, because I\u2019m going to sleep.\" And she did.\n\nAt breakfast they were all three at the table before daylight and Francis Macomber found that, of all the many men that he had hated, he hated Robert Wilson the most.\n\n\"Sleep well?\" Wilson asked in his throaty voice, filling a pipe.\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\"Topping,\" the white hunter told him.\n\nYou bastard, thought Macomber, you insolent bastard.\n\nSo she woke him when she came in, Wilson thought, looking at them both with his flat, cold eyes. Well, why doesn\u2019t he keep his wife where she belongs? What does he think I am, a bloody plaster saint? Let him keep her where she belongs. It\u2019s his own fault.\n\n\"Do you think we\u2019ll find buffalo?\" Margot asked, pushing away a dish of apricots.\n\n\"Chance of it,\" Wilson said and smiled at her. \"Why don\u2019t you stay in camp?\"\n\n\"Not for anything,\" she told him.\n\n\"Why not order her to stay in camp?\" Wilson said to Macomber.\n\n\"You order her,\" said Macomber coldly.\n\n\"Let\u2019s not have any ordering, nor,\" turning to Macomber, \"any silliness, Francis,\" Margot said quite pleasantly.\n\n\"Are you ready to start?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"Any time,\" Wilson told him. \"Do you want the Memsahib to go?\"\n\n\"Does it make any difference whether I do or not?\"\n\nThe hell with it, thought Robert Wilson. The utter complete hell with it. So this is what it\u2019s going to be like. Well, this is what it\u2019s going to be like, then.\n\n\"Makes no difference,\" he said.\n\n\"You\u2019re sure you wouldn\u2019t like to stay in camp with her yourself and let me go out and hunt the buffalo?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"Can\u2019t do that,\" said Wilson. \"Wouldn\u2019t talk rot if l were you.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not talking rot. I\u2019m disgusted.\"\n\n\"Bad word, disgusted.\"\n\n\"Francis, will you please try to speak sensibly,\" his wife said.\n\n\"I speak too damned sensibly,\" Macomber said. \"Did you ever eat such filthy food?\"\n\n\"Something wrong with the food?\" asked Wilson quietly.\n\n\"No more than with everything else.\"\n\n\u2019Td pull yourself together, laddybuck,\" Wilson said very quietly. \"There\u2019s a boy waits at table that understands a little English.\"\n\n\"The hell with him.\"\n\nWilson stood up and puffing on his pipe strolled away, speaking a few words in Swahili to one of the gun-bearers who was standing waiting for him. Macomber and his wife sat on at the table. He was staring at his coffee cup.\n\n\"If you make a scene I\u2019ll leave you, darling,\" Margot said quietly.\n\n\"No, you won\u2019t.\"\n\n\"You can try it and see.\"\n\n\"You won\u2019t leave me.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I won\u2019t leave you and you\u2019ll behave your self.\"\n\n\"Behave myself? That\u2019s a way to talk. Behave myself.\"\n\n\"Yes. Behave yourself.\"\n\n\"Why don\u2019t you try behaving?\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve tried it so long. So very long.\"\n\n\"I hate that red-faced swine,\" Macomber said. \"I loathe the sight of him.\"\n\n\"He\u2019s really very nice.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Macomber almost shouted. Just then the car came up and stopped in front of the dining tent and the driver and the two gun-bearers got out. Wilson walked over and looked at the husband and wife sitting there at the table.\n\n\"Going shooting?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Macomber, standing up. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Better bring a woolly. It will be cool in the car,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"I\u2019II get my leather jacket,\" Margot said.\n\n\"The boy has it,\" Wilson told her. He climbed into the front with the driver and Francis Macomber and his wife sat, not speaking, in the back seat.\n\nHope the silly beggar doesn\u2019t take a notion to blow the back of my head off, Wilson thought to himself. Women are a nuisance on safari.\n\nThe car was grinding down to cross the river at a pebbly ford in the gray daylight and then climbed, angling up the steep bank, where Wilson had ordered a way shovelled out the day before so they could reach the parklike wooded rolling country on the far side.\n\nIt was a good morning, Wilson thought. There was a heavy dew and as the wheels went through the grass and low bushes he could smell the odor of the crushed fronds. It was an odor like verbena and he liked this early morning smell of the dew, the crushed bracken and the look of the tree trunks showing black through the early morning mist, as the car made its way through the untracked, parklike country. He had put the two in the back seat out of his mind now and was thinking about buffalo. The buffalo that he was after stayed in the daytime in a thick swamp where it was impossible to get a shot, but in the night they fed out into an open stretch of country and if he could come between them and their swamp with the car, Macomber would have a good chance at them in the open. He did not want to hunt buff with Macomber in thick cover. He did not want to hunt buff or anything else with Macomber at all, but he was a professional hunter and he had hunted with some rare ones in his time. If they got buff today there would only be rhino to come and the poor man would have gone through his dangerous game and things might pick up. He\u2019d have nothing more to do with the woman and Macomber would get over that too. He must have gone through plenty of that before by the look of things. Poor beggar. He must have a way of getting over it. Well, it was the poor sod\u2019s own bloody fault.\n\nHe, Robert Wilson, carried a double size cot on safari to accommodate any windfalls he might receive. He had hunted for a certain clientele, the international, fast, sporting set, where the women did not feel they were getting their money\u2019s worth unless they had shared that cot with the white hunter. He despised them when he was away from them although he liked some of them well enough at the time, but he made his living by them; and their\nstandards were his standards as long as they were hiring him.\n\nThey were his standards in all except the shooting. He had his own standards about the killing and they could live up to them or get some one else to hunt them. He knew, too, that they all respected him for this. This Macomber was an odd one though. Damned if he wasn\u2019t. Now the wife. Well, the wife. Yes, the wife. Hm, the wife. Well he\u2019d dropped all that. He looked around at them. Macomber sat grim and furious. Margot smiled at him. She looked younger today, more innocent and fresher and not so professionally beautiful. What\u2019s in her heart God knows, Wilson thought. She hadn\u2019t talked much last night. At that it was a pleasure to see her.\n\nThe motor car climbed up a slight rise and went on through the trees and then out into a grassy prairie-like opening and kept in the shelter of the trees along the edge, the driver going slowly and Wilson looking carefully out across the prairie and all along its far side. He stopped the car and studied the opening with his field glasses. Then he motioned to the driver to go on and the car moved slowly along, the driver avoiding warthog holes and driving around the mud castles ants had built. Then, looking across the opening, Wilson suddenly turned and said,\n\n\"By God, there they are!\"\n\nAnd looking where he pointed, while the car jumped forward and Wilson spoke in rapid Swahili to the driver, Macomber saw three huge, black animals looking almost cylindrical in their long heaviness, like big black tank cars, moving at a gallop across the far edge of the open prairie. They moved at a stiff-necked, stiff bodied gallop and he could see the upswept wide black horns on their heads as they galloped heads out; the heads not moving.\n\n\"They\u2019re three old bulls,\" Wilson said. \"We\u2019ll cut them off before they get to the swamp.\"\n\nThe car was going a wild forty-five miles an hour across the open and as Macomber watched, the buffalo got bigger and bigger until he could see the gray, hairless, scabby look of one huge bull and how his neck was a part of his shoulders and the shiny black of his horns as he galloped a little behind the others that were strung out in that steady plunging gait; and then, the car swaying as though it had just jumped a road, they drew up close and he could see the plunging hugeness of the bull, and the dust in his sparsely haired hide, the wide boss of horn and his outstretched, wide-nostrilled muzzle, and he was raising his rifle when Wilson shouted, \"Not from the car, you fool!\" and he had no fear, only hatred of Wilson, while the brakes clamped on and the car skidded, plowing sideways to an almost stop and Wilson was out on one side and he on the other, stumbling as his feet hit the still speeding-by of the earth, and then he was shooting at the bull as he moved away, hearing the bullets whunk into him, emptying his rifle at him as he moved steadily away, finally remembering to get his shots forward into the shoulder, and as he fumbled to re-load, he saw the bull was down. Down on his knees, his big head tossing, and seeing the other two still galloping he shot at the leader and hit him. He shot again and missed and he heard the carawonging roar as Wilson shot and saw the leading bull slide forward onto his nose.\n\n\"Get that other,\" Wilson said. \"Now you\u2019re shooting!\"\n\nBut the other bull was moving steadily at the same gallop and he missed, throwing a spout of dirt, and Wilson missed and the dust rose in a cloud and Wilson shouted, \"Come on. He\u2019s too far!\" and grabbed his arm and they were in the car again, Macomber and Wilson hanging on the sides and rocketing swayingly over the uneven ground, drawing up on the steady, plunging, heavy-necked, straight-moving gallop of the bull.\n\nThey were behind him and Macomber was filling his rifle, dropping shells onto the ground, jamming it, clearing the jam, then they were almost up with the bull when Wilson yelled \"Stop,\" and the car skidded so that it almost swung over and Macomber fell forward onto his feet, slammed his bolt forward and fired as far forward as he could aim into the galloping, rounded black back, aimed and shot again, then again, then again, and the bullets, all of them hitting, had no effect on the buffalo that he could see. Then Wilson shot, the roar deafening him, and he could see the bull stagger. Macomber shot again, aiming carefully, and down he came, onto his knees.\n\n\"All right,\" Wilson said. \"Nice work. That\u2019s the three.\"\n\nMacomber felt a drunken elation.\n\n\"How many times did you shoot?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just three,\" Wilson said. \"You killed the first bull. The biggest one. I helped you finish the other two. Afraid they might have got into cover. You had them killed. I was just mopping up a little. You shot damn well.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s go to the car,\" said Macomber. \"I want a drink.\"\n\n\"Got to finish off that buff first,\" Wilson told him. The buffalo was on his knees and he jerked his head furiously and bellowed in pig-eyed, roaring rage as they came toward him.\n\n\"Watch he doesn\u2019t get up,\" Wilson said. Then, \"Get a little broadside and take him in the neck just behind the ear.\"\n\nMacomber aimed carefully at the center of the huge, jerking, rage-driven neck and shot. At the shot the head dropped forward.\n\n\"That does it,\" said Wilson. \"Got the spine. They\u2019re a hell of a looking thing, aren\u2019t they?\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s get the drink,\" said Macomber. In his life he had never felt so good.\n\nIn the car Macomber\u2019s wife sat very white-faced. \"You were marvellous, darling,\" she said to Macomber. \"What a ride.\"\n\n\"Was it rough?\" Wilson asked.\n\n\"It was frightful. I\u2019ve never been more frightened in my life.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s all have a drink,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"By all means,\" said Wilson. \"Give it to the Memsahib.\" She drank the neat whisky from the flask and shuddered a little when she swallowed. She handed the flask to Macomber who handed it to Wilson.\n\n\"It was frightfully exciting,\" she said. \"It\u2019s given me a dreadful headache. I didn\u2019t know you were allowed to shoot them from cars though.\n\n\"No one shot from cars,\" said Wilson coldly.\n\n\"I mean chase them from cars.\"\n\n\"Wouldn\u2019t ordinarily,\" Wilson said. \"Seemed sporting enough to me though while we were doing it. Taking more chance driving that way across the plain full of holes and one thing and another than hunting on foot. Buffalo could have charged us each time we shot if he liked. Gave him every chance. Wouldn\u2019t mention it to anyone\nthough. It\u2019s illegal if that\u2019s what you mean.\"\n\n\"It seemed very unfair to me,\" Margot said, \"chasing those big helpless things in a motor car.\"\n\n\"Did it?\" said Wilson.\n\n\"What would happen if they heard about it in Nairobi?\"\n\n\"I'd lose my licence for one thing. Other unpleasantness,\" Wilson said, taking a drink from the flask. I'd be out of business.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes, really.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Macomber, and he smiled for the first time all day. \"Now she has something on you.\"\n\n\"You have such a pretty way of putting things, Francis,\" Margot Macomber said. Wilson looked at them both. If a four-letter man marries a five letter woman, he was thinking, what number of letters would their children be? What he said was, \"We lost a gun-bearer. Did you notice it?\"\n\n\"My God, no,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"Here he comes,\" Wilson said. \"He\u2019s all right. He must have fallen off when we left the first bull.\"\n\nApproaching them was the middle-aged gun-bearer, limping along in his knitted cap~ khaki tunic, shorts and rubber sandals, gloomy-faced and disgusted looking. As he came up he called out to Wilson in Swahili and they all saw the change in the white hunter\u2019s face.\n\n\"What does he say?\" asked Margot.\n\n\"He says the first bull got up and went into the bush,\" Wilson said with no expression in his voice.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Macomber blankly.\n\n\"Then it\u2019s going to be just like the lion,\" said Margot, full of anticipation.\n\n\"It\u2019s not going to be a damned bit like the lion,\" Wilson told her. \"Did you want another drink, Macomber?\"\n\n\"Thanks, yes,\" Macomber said. He expected the feeling he had had about the lion to come back but it did not. For the first time in his life he really felt wholly without fear. Instead of fear he had a feeling of definite elation.\n\n\"We\u2019ll go and have a look at the second bull,\" Wilson said. \"I\u2019II tell the driver to put the car in the shade.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Margaret Macomber.\n\n\"Take a look at the buff,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"I\u2019II come.\"\n\n\"Come along.\"\n\nThe three of them walked over to where the second buffalo bulked blackly in the open, head forward on the grass, the massive horns swung wide.\n\n\"He\u2019s a very good head,\" Wilson said. \"That\u2019s close to a fifty-inch spread.\"\n\nMacomber was looking at him with delight.\n\n\"He\u2019s hateful looking,\" said Margot. \"Can\u2019t we go into the shade?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Wilson said. \"Look,\" he said to Macomber, and pointed.\n\n\"See that patch of bush?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s where the first bull went in. The gun-bearer said when he fell off the bull was down. He was watching us helling along and the other two buff galloping. When he looked up there was the bull up and looking at him. Gun-bearer ran like hell and the bull went off slowly into that bush.\"\n\n\"Can we go in after him now?\" asked Macomber eagerly.\n\nWilson looked at him appraisingly. Damned if this isn\u2019t a strange one, he thought. Yesterday he\u2019s scared sick and today he\u2019s a ruddy fire eater.\n\n\"No,.we\u2019ll give him a while.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s please go into the shade,\" Margot said. Her face was white and she looked ill.\n\nThey made their way to the car where it stood under a single, wide-spreading tree and all climbed in.\n\n\"Chances are he\u2019s dead in there,\" Wilson remarked. \"After a little we\u2019ll have a look.\"\n\nMacomber felt a wild unreasonable happiness that he had never known before.\n\n\"By God, that was a chase,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve never felt any such feeling. Wasn\u2019t it marvellous, Margot?\"\n\n\"I hated it.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I hated it,\" she said bitterly. \"I loathed it.\"\n\n\"You know I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be afraid of anything again,\" Macomber said to Wilson. \"Something happened in me after we first saw the buff and started after him. Like a dam bursting. It was pure excitement.\"\n\n\"Cleans out your liver,\" said Wilson. \"Damn funny things happen to people.\"\n\nMacomber\u2019s face was shining. \"You know something did happen to me,\" he said. \"I feel absolutely different.\"\n\nHis wife said nothing and eyed him strangely. She was sitting far back in the seat and Macomber was sitting forward talking to Wilson who turned sideways talking over the back of the front seat.\n\n\"You know, I\u2019d like to try another lion,\" Macomber said. \u2019Tm really not afraid of them now. After all, what can they do to you?\"\n\n\"That\u2019s it,\" said Wilson. \"Worst one can do is kill you. How does it go? Shakespeare. Damned good. See if I can remember. Oh, damned good. Used to quote it to myself at one time. Let\u2019s see. \u2019By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God a death and let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.\u2019 Damned fine, eh?\"\n\nHe was very embarrassed, having brought out this thing he had lived by, but he had seen men come of age before and it always moved him. It was not a matter of their twenty-first birthday.\n\nIt had taken a strange chance of hunting, a sudden precipitation into action without opportunity for worrying beforehand, to bring this about with Macomber, but regardless of how it had happened it had most certainly happened. Look at the beggar now, Wilson thought. It\u2019s that some of them stay little boys so long, Wilson thought. Sometimes all their lives.\n\nTheir figures stay boyish when they\u2019re fifty. The great American boy-men. Damned strange people. But he liked this Macomber now. Damned strange fellow. Probably meant the end of cuckoldry too. Well, that would be a damned good thing. Damned good thing. Beggar had probably been afraid all his life. Don\u2019t know what started it. But over now. Hadn\u2019t had time to be afraid with the buff. That and being angry too. Motor car too. Motor cars made it familiar. Be a damn fire eater now. He\u2019d seen it in the war work the same way. More of a change than any loss of virginity. Fear gone like an operation. Something else grew in its place. Main thing a man had. Made him into a man. Women knew it too. No bloody fear.\n\nFrom the far corner of the seat Margaret Macomber looked at the two of them. There was no change in Wilson. She saw Wilson as she had seen him the day before when she had first realized what his great talent was. But she saw the change in Francis Macomber now.\n\n\"Do you have that feeling of happiness about what\u2019s going to happen?\" Macomber asked, still exploring his new wealth.\n\n\"You\u2019re not supposed to mention it,\" Wilson said, looking in the other\u2019s face. \"Much more fashionable to say you\u2019re scared. Mind you, you\u2019ll be scared too, plenty of times.\"\n\n\"But you have a feeling of happiness about action to come?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wilson. \"There\u2019s that. Doesn\u2019t do to talk too much about all this. Talk the whole thing away. No pleasure in anything if you mouth it up too much.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re both talking rot,\" said Margot. \"Just because you\u2019ve chased some helpless animals in a motor car you talk like heroes.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Wilson. \"I have been gassing too much.\" She\u2019s worried about it already, he thought.\n\n\"If you don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about why not keep out of it?\" Macomber asked his wife.\n\n\"You\u2019ve gotten awfully brave, awfully suddenly,\" his wife said contemptuously, but her contempt was not secure.\n\nShe was very afraid of something.\n\nMacomber laughed, a very natural hearty laugh. \"You know I have,\" he said. \"I really have.\"\n\n\"Isn\u2019t it sort of late?\" Margot said bitterly. Because she had done the best she could for many years back and the way they were together now was no one person\u2019s fault.\n\n\"Not for me,\" said Macomber.\n\nMargot said nothing but sat back in the corner of the seat.\n\n\"Do you think we\u2019ve given him time enough?\" Macomber asked Wilson cheerfully.\n\n\"We might have a look,\" Wilson said. \"Have you any solids left?\"\n\n\"The gun-bearer has some.\"\n\nWilson called in Swahili and the older gun-bearer, who was skinning out one of the heads, straightened up, pulled a box of solids out of his pocket and brought them over to Macomber, who filled his magazine and put the remaining shells in his pocket.\n\n\"You might as well shoot the Springfield,\" Wilson said. \"You\u2019re used to it. We\u2019ll leave the Mannlicher in the car with the Memsahib. Your gun-bearer can carry your heavy gun. I\u2019ve this damned cannon. Now let me tell you about them.\" He had saved this until the last because he did not want to worry Macomber. \"When a buff comes he comes with his head high and thrust straight out. The boss of the horns covers any sort of a brain shot. The only shot is straight into the nose. The only other shot is into his chest or, if you\u2019re to one side, into the neck or the shoulders. After they\u2019ve been hit once they take a hell of a lot of killing. Don\u2019t. try anything fancy. Take the easiest shot there is. They\u2019ve finished skinning out that head now. Should we get started?\"\n\nHe called to the gun-bearers, who came up wiping their hands, and the older one got into the back.\n\n\"I'll only take Kongoni,\" Wilson said. \"The other can watch to keep the birds away.\"\n\nAs the car moved slowly across the open space toward the island of brushy trees that ran in a tongue of foliage along a dry water course that cut the open swale, Macomber felt his heart pounding and his mouth was dry again, but it was excitement, not fear.\n\n\"Here\u2019s where he went in,\" Wilson said Then to the gun-bearer in Swahili, \"Take the blood spoor.\"\n\nThe car was parallel to the patch of bush. Macomber, Wilson and the gun-bearer got down. Macomber, looking back, saw his wife, with the rifle by her side, looking at him. He waved to her and she did not wave back.\n\nThe brush was very thick ahead and the ground was dry. The middle-aged gun-bearer was sweating heavily and Wilson had his hat down over his eyes and his red neck showed just ahead of Macomber. Suddenly the gunbearer said something in Swahili to Wilson and ran forward.\n\n\"He\u2019s dead in there,\" Wilson said. \"Good work,\" and he turned to grip Macomber\u2019s hand and as they shook hands, grinning at each other, the gun-bearer shouted wildly and they saw him coming out of the bush sideways, fast as a crab, and the bull coming, nose out, mouth tight closed, blood dripping, massive head straight out, coming in a charge, his little pig eyes bloodshot as he looked at them. Wilson, who was ahead, was kneeling shooting, and\nMacomber, as he fired, unhearing his shot in the roaring of Wilson\u2019s gun, saw fragments like slate burst from the huge boss of the horns, and the head jerked, he shot again at the wide nostrils and saw the horns jolt again and fragments fly, and he did not see Wilson now and, aiming carefully, shot again with the buffalo\u2019s huge bulk almost on him and his rifle almost level with the on-coming head, nose out, and he could see the little wicked eyes and the head started to lower and he felt a sudden white-hot, blinding flash explode inside his head and that was all he ever felt.\n\nWilson had ducked to one side to get in a shoulder shot. Macomber had stood solid and shot for the nose, shooting a touch high each time and hitting the heavy horns, splintering and chipping them like hitting a slate roof, and Mrs. Macomber, in the car, had shot at the buffalo with the 6.5 Mannlicher as it seemed about to gore Macomber and had hit her husband about two inches up and a little to one side of the base of his skull.\n\nFrancis Macomber lay now, face down, not two yards from where the buffalo lay on his side and his wife knelt over him with Wilson beside her.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t turn him over,\" Wilson said.\n\nThe woman was crying hysterically.\n\n\"I\u2019d get back in the car,\" Wilson said. \"Where\u2019s the rifle?\"\n\nShe shook her head, her face contorted. The gun-bearer picked up the rifle.\n\n\"Leave it as it is,\" said Wilson. Then, \"Go get Abdulla so that he may witness the manner of the accident.\"\n\nHe knelt down, took a handkerchief from his pocket, and spread it over Francis Macomber\u2019s crew-cropped head where it lay. The blood sank into the dry, loose earth.\n\nWilson stood up and saw the buffalo on his side, his legs out, his thinly-haired belly crawling with ticks. \"Hell of a good bull,\" his brain registered automatically. \"A good fifty inches, or better. Better.\" He called to the driver and told him to spread a blanket over the body and stay by it. Then he walked over to the motor car where the woman sat crying in the corner.\n\n\"That was a pretty thing to do,\" he said in a toneless voice. \"He would have left you too.\"\n\n\"Stop it,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course it\u2019s an accident,\" he said. \"I know that.\"\n\n\"Stop it,\" she said.\n\n\"Don\u2019t worry,\" he said. \"There will be a certain amount of unpleasantness but I will have some photographs taken that will be very useful at the inquest. There\u2019s the testimony of the gun-bearers and the driver too.

the same way\nSaid he was a star back in '31\nHollywood had liked him for some songs that he had done\n\nHe's the last of the singin' cowboys\nSingin' songs of inspiration and joy\nYippie Yi Yo, Yippie Ay Aye\nHe took a break, just to chug him down a beer\nC'mon folks holler out the songs you'd like to hear\nIf I know one, I know a million tunes\nI'm not up here playin' for me\nThis is all just for you\nAnd then he bragged on the Stinson hat that he wore\nSaid it was the finest made since the war\nAnd he won the silver buckle ridin' on a cow\nAnd as he laughed he said\nI'll bet you're wonderin' how?\nHe's the last of the singin' cowboys\nSingin' songs of inspiration and joy\nYippie Yi Yo, Yippie Ay A ye\n\nAnd after three hours or maybe more\nA lady grabbed his arm\nAnd showed him to the door\nThe bartender said, \"he's blind, you see\nDon't tell him the only audience he had was you and me\"\n\n'Cause he's the last of the singin' cowboys\nSingin songs of inspiration and

Burton", "lyrics": "Arabian Nights, Vol. 8 (Chap. 2) LyricsHasan Of Bassorah.[FN#5]\n\n\nThere was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, a merchant, who dwelt in the land of Bassorah and who owned two sons and wealth galore. But in due time Allah, the All-hearing the All-knowing, decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the Most High; so he died, and his two sons laid him out and buried him, after which they divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion each one opened a shop.[FN#6] Presently the elder son, Hasan hight, a youth of passing beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, betook himself to the company of lewd folk, women and low boys, frolicking with them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done, for that he exulted in the abundance of his good. After some time he had wasted all his ready money, so he sold all his father's lands and houses and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing, neither little nor muchel, nor was one of his comrades left who knew him. He abode thus anhungred, he and his widowed mother, three days, and on the fourth day, as he walked along, unknowing whither to wend, there met him a man of his father's friends, who questioned him of his case. He told him what had befallen him and the other said, \"O my son, I have a brother who is a goldsmith; an thou wilt, thou shalt be with him and learn his craft and become skilled therein.\" Hasan consented and accompanied him to his brother, to whom he commended him, saying, \"In very sooth this is my son; do thou teach him for my sake.\" So Hasan abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft; and Allah opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for himself. One day, as he sat in his booth in the bazar, there came up to him an Ajam\u00ed, a foreigner, a Persian, with a great white beard and a white turband[FN#7] on his head, having the semblance of a merchant who, after saluting him, looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly. It pleased him and he shook his head, saying, \"By Allah, thou art a cunning goldsmith! What may be thy name?\" \"Hasan,\" replied the other, shortly.[FN#8] The Persian continued to look at his wares, whilst Hasan read in an old book[FN#9] he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace, till the hour of midafternoon prayer, when the shop became clear of people and the Persian accosted the young man, saying, \"O my son, thou art a comely youth! What book is that? Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art, than which there is no goodlier in the world.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian accosted the young man saying, \"O my son, thou art a comely youth! Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world. Many have sought of me instruction therein, but I consented not to instruct any of them in it; yet hath my soul consented that I teach it to thee, for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and I will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier, so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer and anvil,[FN#10] charcoal and fire.\" Hasan asked, \"O my lord and when wilt thou teach me this?\"; and the Persian answered, \"To-morrow, Inshallah, I will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of this copper.\" Whereupon Hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the Persian till nightfall, when he took leave of him and going in to his mother, saluted her with the salam and ate with her; but he was dazed, without memory or reason, for that the stranger's words had gotten hold upon his heart. So she questioned him and he told her what had passed between himself and the Persian, which when she heard, her heart fluttered and she strained him to her bosom, saying, \"O my son, beware of hearkening to the talk of the folk, and especially of the Persians, and obey them not in aught; for they are sharpers and tricksters, who profess the art of alchemy[FN#11] and swindle people and take their money and devour it in vain.\" Replied Hasan, \"O my mother, we are paupers and have nothing he may covet, that he should put a cheat on us. Indeed, this Persian is a right worthy Shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him; Allah hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son.\" She was silent in her chagrin, and he passed the night without sleep, his heart being full of what the Persian had said to him; nor did slumber visit him for the excess of his joy therein. But when morning morrowed, he rose and taking the keys, opened the shop, whereupon behold, the Persian accosted him. Hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands; but he forbade him from this and suffered it not, saying, \"O Hasan, set on the crucible and apply the bellows.\"[FN#12] So he did as the stranger bade him and lighted the charcoal. Then said the Persian, \"O my son, hast thou any copper?\" and he replied, \"I have a broken platter.\" So he bade him work the shears[FN#13] and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows, till the copper became liquid, when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper and opening it, sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of somewhat like yellow Kohl or eyepowder.[FN#14] Then he bade Hasan blow upon it with the bellows, and he did so, till the contents of the crucible became a lump of gold.[FN#15] When the youth saw this, he was stupefied and at his wits' end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it pure gold of the finest quality: whereupon his reason fled and he was dazed with excess of delight and bent over the Persian's hand to kiss it. But he forbade him, saying, \"Art thou married?\" and when the youth replied \"No!\" he said, \"Carry this ingot to the market and sell it and take the price in haste and speak not.\" So Hasan went down into the market and gave the bar to the broker, who took it and rubbed it upon the touchstone and found it pure gold. So they opened the biddings at ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up to fifteen thousand dirhams,[FN#16] at which price he sold it and taking the money, went home and told his mother all that had passed, saying, \"O my mother, I have learnt this art and mystery.\" But she laughed at him, saying, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eightieth Night,\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the Ajami and cried, \"I have learnt this art and mystery,\" she laughed at him, saying, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"; and she was silent for vexation. Then of his ignorance, he took a metal mortar and returning to the shop, laid it before the Persian, who was still sitting there and asked him, \"O my son, what wilt thou do with this mortar?\" Hasan answered, \"Let us put it in the fire, and make of it lumps of gold.\" The Persian laughed and rejoined, \"O my son, art thou Jinn-mad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two ingots of gold in one day? Knowest thou not that the folk would suspect us and our lives would be lost? Now, O my son, an I teach thee this craft, thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth; for that will suffice thee from year to year.\" Cried Hasan, \"True, O my lord,\" and sitting down in his open shop, set on the crucible and cast more charcoal on the fire. Quoth the Persian, \"What wilt thou, O my son?\"; and quoth Hasan, \"Teach me this craft.\" \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" exclaimed the Persian, laughing; \"Verily, O my son, thou art little of wit and in nowise fitted for this noble craft. Did ever any during all his life learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars? If we busy ourselves with it here, the folk will say of us, These practise alchemy; and the magistrates will hear of us, and we shall lose our lives.[FN#17] Wherefore, O my son, an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright, come thou with me to my house.\" So Hasan barred his shop and went with that Ajam\u00ed; but by the way he remembered his mother's words and thinking in himself a thousand thoughts he stood still, with bowed head. The Persian turned and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him, \"Art thou mad? What! I in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest I will harm thee!\" presently adding, \"But, if thou fear to go with me to my house, I will go with thee to thine and teach thee there.\" Hasan replied, \"'Tis well, O uncle,\" and the Persian rejoined, \"Go thou before me.\" So Hasan led the way to his own house, and entering, told his mother of the Persian's coming, for he had left him standing at the door. She ordered the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and adorning it, her son bade her go to one of the neighbours' lodgings. So she left her home to them and wended her way, whereupon Hasan brought in the Persian, who entered after asking leave. Then he took in hand a dish and going to the market, returned with food, which he set before the Persian, saying, \"Eat, O my lord, that between us there may be bread and salt and may Almighty Allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and salt!\" The Persian replied with a smile, \"True, O my son! Who knoweth the virtue and worth of bread and salt?\"[FN#18] Then he came forward and ate with Hasan, till they were satisfied; after which the Ajami said, \"O my son Hasan, bring us somewhat of sweetmeats.\" So Hasan went to the market, rejoicing in his words, and returned with ten saucers[FN#19] of sweetmeats, of which they both ate and the Persian said, \"May Allah abundantly requite thee, O my son! It is the like of thee with whom folk company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may profit him!\"[FN#20] Then said he, \"O Hasan bring the gear.\" But hardly did Hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass in spring-tide, and hastening to the shop, fetched the apparatus and set it before the Persian, who pulled out a piece of paper and said, \"O Hasan, by the bond of bread and salt, wert thou not dearer to me than my son, I would not let thee into the mysteries of this art, for I have none of the Elixir[FN#21] left save what is in this paper; but by and by I will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before thee. Know, O my son Hasan, that to every ten pounds of copper thou must set half a drachm of that which is in this paper, and the whole ten will presently become unalloyed virgin gold;\" presently adding, \"O my son, O Hasan, there are in this paper three ounces,[FN#22] Egyptian measure, and when it is spent, I will make thee other and more.\" Hasan took the packet and finding therein a yellow powder, finer than the first, said to the Persian, \"O my lord, what is the name of this substance and where is it found and how is it made?\" But he laughed, longing to get hold of the youth, and replied, \"Of what dost thou question? Indeed thou art a froward boy! Do thy work and hold thy peace.\" So Hasan arose and fetching a brass platter from the house, shore it in shreds and threw it into the melting-pot; then he scattered on it a little of the powder from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold. When he saw this, he joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think of nothing save the gold; but, whilst he was occupied with taking up the lumps of metal from the melting-pot, the Persian pulled out of his turband in haste a packet of Cretan Bhang, which if an elephant smelt, he would sleep from night to night, and cutting off a little thereof, put it in a piece of the sweetmeat. Then said he, \"O Hasan, thou art become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth, and I have a daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace. Now I see that thou befittest none but her and she none but thee; wherefore, if it be Allah's will, I will marry thee to her.\" Replied Hasan, \"I am thy servant and whatso good thou dost with me will be a deposit with the Almighty!\" and the Persian rejoined, \"O my son, have fair patience and fair shall betide thee.\" Therewith he gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand, put it in his mouth, knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time for only the Lord of Futurity knoweth the Future. But hardly had he swallowed it, when he fell down, head foregoing heels, and was lost to the world; whereupon the Persian, seeing him in such calamitous case, rejoiced exceedingly and cried, \"Thou hast fallen into my snares, O gallows-carrion, O dog of the Arabs! This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee, O Hasan!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the Ajami and fell fainting to the ground, the Persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried, \"This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee!\" Then he girt himself and pinioned Hasan's arms and binding his feet to his hands laid him in a chest, which he emptied to that end and locked it upon him. Moreover, he cleared another chest and laying therein all Hasan's valuables, together with the piece of the first gold-lump and the second ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock. Then he ran to the market and fetching a porter, took up the two chests and made off with them to a place within sight of the city, where he set them down on the sea-shore, hard by a vessel at anchor there. Now this craft had been freighted and fitted out by the Persian and her master was awaiting him; so, when the crew saw him, they came to him and bore the two chests on board. Then the Persian called out to the Rais or Captain, saying, \"Up and let us be off, for I have done my desire and won my wish.\" So the skipper sang out to the sailors, saying, \"Weigh anchor and set sail!\" And the ship put out to sea with a fair wind. So far concerning the Persian; but as regards Hasan's mother, she awaited him till supper-time but heard neither sound nor news of him; so she went to the house and finding it thrown open, entered and saw none therein and missed the two chests and their valuables; wherefore she knew that her son was lost and that doom had overtaken him; and she buffeted her face and rent her raiment crying out and wailing and saying, \"Alas, my son, ah! Alas, the fruit of my vitals, ah!\" And she recited these couplets,\n\n\"My patience fails me and grows anxiety; * And with your absence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     growth of grief I see.\nBy Allah, Patience went what time ye went! * Loss of all Hope how\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     suffer patiently?\nWhen lost my loved one how can' joy I sleep? * Who shall enjoy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     such life of low degree?\nThou 'rt gone and, desolating house and home, * Hast fouled the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     fount erst flowed from foulness free:\nThou wast my fame, my grace 'mid folk, my stay; * Mine aid wast\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thou in all adversity!\nPerish the day, when from mine eyes they bore * My friend, till\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     sight I thy return to me!\"\n\nAnd she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn, when the neighbours came in to her and asked her of her son, and she told them what had befallen him with the Persian, assured that she should never, never see him again. Then she went round about the house, weeping, and wending she espied two lines written upon the wall; so she sent for a scholar, who read them to her; and they were these,\n\n\"Leyla's phantom came by night, when drowsiness had overcome me,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     desert,\nBut when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom, I saw the air\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     vacant and the place of visitation was distant.\"[FN#23]\nWhen Hasan's mother heard these lines, she shrieked and said, \"Yes, O my son! Indeed, the house is desolate and the visitation-place is distant!\" Then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son, went away; but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write Hasan's name and the date of his loss, and thenceforward she quitted it not, but made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day. Such was her case; but touching her son Hasan and the Ajami, this Persian was a Magian, who hated Moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who fell into his power. He was a lewd and filthy villain, a hankerer after alchemy, an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards, such an one as he of whom quoth the poet,\n\n\"A dog, dog-fathered, by dog-grandsire bred; * No good in dog\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     from dog race issued:\nE'en for a gnat no resting-place gives he * Who is composed of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     seed by all men shed.\"[FN#24]\n\nThe name of this accursed was Bahr\u00e1m the Guebre, and he was wont, every year, to take a Moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes. So, when he had carried out his plot against Hasan the goldsmith, they sailed on from dawn till dark, when the ship made fast to the shore for the night, and at sunrise, when they set sail again, Bahram bade his black slaves and white servants bring him the chest wherein were Hasan. They did so, and he opened it and taking out the young man, made him sniff up vinegar and blew a powder into his nostrils. Hasan sneezed and vomited the Bhang; then, opening his eyes, he looked about him right and left and found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail, and saw the Persian sitting by him; wherefore he knew that the accursed Magian had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril against which his mother had warned him. So he spake the saying which shall never shame the sayer, to wit, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verity, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning! O my God, be Thou gracious to me in Thine appointment and give me patience to endure this Thine affliction, O Lord of the three Worlds!\" Then he turned to the Persian and bespoke him softly, saying, \"O my father, what fashion is this and where is the covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to me?\"[FN#25] But Bahram stared at him and replied, \"O dog, knoweth the like of me bond of bread and salt? I have slain of youths like thee a thousand, save one, and thou shalt make up the thousand.\" And he cried out at him and Hasan was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned Persian he bespoke him softly but gained naught thereby for the Ajami cried out at him in wrath, so he was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him. Then the accursed bade loose his pinion-bonds and they gave him a little water to drink, whilst the Magian laughed and said, \"By the virtue of the Fire and the Light and the Shade and the Heat, methought not thou wouldst fall into my nets! But the Fire empowered me over thee and helped me to lay hold upon thee, that I might win my wish and return and make thee a sacrifice, to her[FN#26] so she may accept of me.\" Quoth Hasan, \"Thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt\"; whereupon the Magus raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and, biting the deck with his fore-teeth, swooned away, whilst the tears trickled down his cheeks. Then the Guebre bade his servants light him a fire and Hasan said, \"What wilt thou do with it?\" Replied the Magian, \"This is the Fire, lady of light and sparkles bright! This it is I worship, and if thou wilt worship her even as I, verily I will give thee half my monies and marry thee to my maiden daughter.\" Thereupon Hasan cried angrily at him, \"Woe to thee! Thou art a miscreant Magian who to Fire dost pray in lieu of the King of Omnipotent sway, Creator of Night and Day; and this is naught but a calamity among creeds!\" At this the Magian was wroth and said to him, \"Wilt thou not then conform with me, O dog of the Arabs, and enter my faith?\" But Hasan consented not to this: so the accursed Guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire, bade his pages throw him flat on his face. They did so, and he beat him with a hide whip of plaited thongs[FN#27] till his flanks were laid open, whilst he cried aloud for aid but none aided him, and besought protection, but none protected him. Then he raised his eyes to the All-powerful King and sought of Him succour in the name of the Chosen Prophet. And indeed patience failed him; his tears ran down his cheeks, like rain, and he repeated these couplets twain,\n\n\"In patience, O my God, Thy doom forecast * I'll bear, an thereby\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     come Thy grace at last:\nThey've dealt us wrong, transgressed and ordered ill; * Haply Thy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Grace shall pardon what is past.\"\n\nThen the Magian bade his negro-slaves raise him to a sitting posture and bring him somewhat of meat and drink. So they sat food before him; but he consented not to eat or drink; and Bahram ceased not to torment him day and night during the whole voyage, whilst Hasan took patience and humbled himself in supplication before Almighty Allah to whom belong Honour and Glory; whereby the Guebre's heart was hardened against him. They ceased not to sail the sea three months, during which time Hasan was continually tortured till Allah Almighty sent forth upon them a foul wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship, by reason of the fierce gale; whereupon quoth the captain and crew,[FN#28] \"By Allah, this is all on account of yonder youth, who hath been these three months in torture with this Magian. Indeed, this is not allowed of God the Most High.\" Then they rose against the Magian and slew his servants and all who were with him; which when he saw, he made sure of death and feared for himself. So he loosed Hasan from his bonds and pulling off the ragged clothes the youth had on, clad him in others; and made excuses to him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native land, saying, \"O my son, return me not evil for that I have done with thee.\" Quoth Hasan, \"How can I ever rely upon thee again?\"; and quoth Bahram, \"O my son, but for sin, there were no pardon. Indeed, I did all these doings with thee, but to try thy patience, and thou knowest that the case is altogether in the hands of Allah.\" So the crew and captain rejoiced in Hasan's release, and he called down blessings on them and praised the Almighty and thanked Him. With this the wind was stilled and the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage. Then said Hasan to Bahram, \"O Master,[FN#29] whither wendest thou?\" Replied the Magian, \"O, my son, I am bound for the Mountain of Clouds, where is the Elixir which we use in alchemy.\" And the Guebre swore to him by the Fire and the Light that he had no longer any cause to fear him. So Hasan's heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the Persian's words, he continued to eat and drink and sleep with the Magian, who clad him in his own raiment. They ceased not sailing on other three months, when the ship came to anchor off a long shoreline of many coloured pebbles, white and yellow and sky-blue and black and every other hue, and the Magian sprang up and said, \"O Hasan, come, let us go ashore for we have reached the place of our wish and will.\" So Hasan rose and landed with Bahram, after the Persian had commended his goods to the captain's care. They walked on inland, till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight, when Bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettle-drum[FN#30] of copper and a silken strap, worked in gold with characts, beat the drum with the strap, until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste. Hasan marvelled at the Magian's doings and was afraid of him: he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed. But Bahram looked at him and said, \"What aileth thee, O my son? By the truth of the Fire and the Light, thou hast naught to fear from me; and, were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means, I had not brought thee ashore. So rejoice in all good; for yonder cloud of dust is the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereof.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-third Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian said to Hasan, \"In very sooth yonder dust-cloud is the cloud of something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and will make easy to us the hardships thereof.\" Presently the dust lifted off three she-dromedaries, one of which Bahram mounted and Hasan another. Then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven days, till they came to a wide champaign and, descending into its midst, they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold; so they alighted and entering thereunder, ate and drank and took their rest. Anon Hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something lofty said to the Magian, \"What is that, O nuncle?\" Bahram replied, \"'Tis a palace,\" and quoth Hasan, \"Wilt thou not go thither, that we may enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting it?\" But the Persian was wroth and said, \"Name not to me yonder palace; for therein dwelleth a foe, with whom there befel me somewhat whereof this is no time to tell thee.\" Then he beat the kettle-drum and up came the dromedaries, and they mounted and fared on other seven days. On the eighth day, the Magian said, \"O Hasan, what seest thou?\" Hasan replied, \"I see clouds and mists twixt east and west.\" Quoth Bahram, \"That is neither clouds nor mists, but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the clouds split,[FN#31] and there are no clouds above it, for its exceeding height and surpassing elevation. Yon mount is my goal and thereon is the need we seek. 'Tis for that I brought thee hither, for my wish may not be won save at thy hands. Hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost and said to the Magian, \"By the right of that thou worshippest and by the faith wherein thou believest, I conjure thee to tell me what is the object wherefor thou hast brought me!\" Bahram replied, \"The art of alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split. Such a site is yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and I purpose to send thee up thither to fetch it; and when we have it, I will show thee the secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn.\" Hasan answered, in his fear, \"'Tis well, O my master;\" and indeed he despaired of life and wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead, repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two couplets,\n\n\"Consider but thy Lord, His work shall bring * Comfort to thee,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   with quick relief and near:\nDespair not when thou sufferest sorest bane: * In bane how many\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   blessed boons appear!\"\nThey ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that mountain where they halted; and Hasan saw thereon a palace and asked Bahram, \"What be yonder palace?\"; whereto he answered, \"'Tis the abode of the Jann and Ghuls and Satans.\" Then the Magian alighted and making Hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him, \"Bear me no ill will anent that I did with thee, for I will keep guard over thee in thine ascent to the palace; and I conjure thee not to trick and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom; and I and thou will share equally therein.\" And Hasan replied, \"To hear is to obey.\" Then Bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of wheat, ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour; after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks. Then he took out the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap, whereupon up came the dromedaries. He chose out one and said, \"Hearken, O my son, O Hasan, to what I am about to enjoin on thee;\" and Hasan replied, \"'Tis well.\" Bahram continued, \"Lie down on this skin and I will sew thee up therein and lay thee on the ground; whereupon the Rakham birds[FN#32] will come to thee and carry thee up to the mountain-top. Take this knife with thee; and, when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have set thee down, slit open therewith the skin and come forth. The vultures will then take fright at thee and fly away; whereupon do thou look down from the mountain head and speak to me, and I will tell thee what to do.\" So he sewed him up in the skin, placing therein three cakes and a leathern bottle full of water, and withdrew to a distance. Presently a vulture pounced upon him and taking him up, flew away with him to the mountain-top and there set him down. As soon as Hasan felt himself on the ground, he slit the skin and coming forth, called out to the Magian, who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy, saying to him, \"Look behind thee and tell me what thou seest.\" Hasan looked and seeing many rotten bones and much wood, told Bahram, who said to him, \"This be what we need and seek. Make six bundles of the wood and throw them down to me, for this is wherewithal we do alchemy.\" So he threw him the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to Hasan, \"O gallows bird, I have won my wish of thee; and now, if thou wilt, thou mayst abide on this mountain, or cast thyself down to the earth and perish. So saying, he left him[FN#33] and went away, and Hasan exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This hound hath played the traitor with me.\" And he sat bemoaning himself and reciting these couplets,\n\n\"When God upon a man possessed of reasoning, Hearing and sight\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   His will in aught to pass would bring,\nHe stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit, From\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    him, as one draws out the hairs to paste that cling;\nTill, His decrees fulfilled, He gives him back His wit, That\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   therewithal he may receive admonishing.\nSo say thou not of aught that haps, 'How happened it?' For Fate\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    and fortune fixed do order everything.[FN#34]\"\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Magian sent Hasan to the mountain-top and made him throw down all he required he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This damned hound hath played the traitor.\" Then he rose to his feet and looked right and left, after which he walked on along the mountain top, in mind making certain of death. He fared on thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain, along which he saw a dark-blue sea, dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves each as it were a lofty mount. So he sat down and repeated what he might of the Koran and besought Allah the Most High to ease him of his troubles, or by death or by deliverance from such strait. Then he recited for himself the funeral-prayer[FN#35] and cast himself down into the main; but, the waves bore him up by Allah's grace, so that he reached the water unhurt, and the angel in whose charge is the sea watched over him, so that the billows bore him safe to land, by the decree of the Most High. Thereupon he rejoiced and praised Almighty Allah and thanked Him; after which he walked on in quest of something to eat, for stress of hunger, and came presently to the place where he had halted with the Magian, Bahram. Then he fared on awhile, till behold, he caught sight of a great palace, rising high in air, and knew it for that of which he had questioned the Persian and he had replied, \"Therein dwelleth a foe, of mine.\" Hasan said to himself, \"By Allah, needs must I enter yonder palace; perchance relief awaiteth me there.\" So coming to it and finding the gate open, he entered the vestibule, where he saw seated on a bench two girls like twin moons with a chess-cloth before them and they were at play. One of them raised her head to him and cried out for joy saying, \"By Allah, here is a son of Adam, and methinks 'tis he whom Bahram the Magian brought hither this year!\" So Hasan hearing her words cast himself at their feet and wept with sore weeping and said, \"Yes, O my ladies, by Allah, I am indeed that unhappy.\" Then said the younger damsel to her elder sister, \"Bear witness against me,[FN#36] O my sister, that this is my brother by covenant of Allah and that I will die for his death and live for his life and joy for his joy and mourn for his mourning.\" So saying, she rose and embraced him and kissed him and presently taking him by the hand and her sister with her, led him into the palace, where she did off his ragged clothes and brought him a suit of King's raiment wherewith she arrayed him. Moreover, she made ready all manner viands[FN#37] and set them before him, and sat and ate with him, she and her sister. Then said they to him, \"Tell us thy tale with yonder dog, the wicked, the wizard, from the time of thy falling into his hands to that of thy freeing thee from him; and after we will tell thee all that hath passed between us and him, so thou mayst be on thy guard against him an thou see him again.\" Hearing these words and finding himself thus kindly received, Hasan took heart of grace and reason returned to him and he related to them all that had befallen him with the Magian from first to last. Then they asked, \"Didst thou ask him of this palace?\"; and he answered, \"Yes, but he said, 'Name it not to me; for it belongeth to Ghuls and Satans.'\" At this, the two damsels waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and said, \"Did that miscreant style us Ghuls and Satans?\" And Hasan answered, \"Yes.\" Cried the younger sister, \"By Allah, I will assuredly do him die with the foulest death and make him to lack the wind of the world!\" Quoth Hasan, \"And how wilt thou get at him, to kill him, for he is a crafty magician?\"; and quoth she, \"He is in a garden by name Al-Mushayyad,[FN#38] and there is no help but that I slay him before long.\" Then said her sister, \"Sooth spake Hasan in everything he hath recounted to us of this cur; but now tell him our tale, that all of it may abide in his memory.\" So the younger said to him, \"Know, O my brother, that we are the daughters of a King of the mightiest Kings of the Jann, having Marids for troops and guards and servants, and Almighty Allah blessed him with seven daughters by one wife; but of his folly such jealousy and stiff-neckedness and pride beyond compare gat hold upon him that he would not give us in marriage to any one and, summoning his Wazirs and Emirs, he said to them, 'Can ye tell me of any place untrodden by the tread of men and Jinn and abounding in trees and fruits and rills?' And quoth they, 'What wilt thou therewith, O King of the Age?' And quoth he, 'I desire there to lodge my seven daughters.' Answered they, 'O King, the place for them is the Castle of the Mountain of Clouds, built by an Ifrit of the rebellious Jinn, who revolted from the covenant of our lord Solomon, on whom be the peace! Since his destruction, none hath dwelt there, nor man nor Jinni, for 'tis cut off[FN#39] and none may win to it. And the Castle is girt about with trees and fruits and rills, and the water running around it is sweeter than honey and colder than snow: none who is afflicted with leprosy or elephantiasis[FN#40] or what not else drinketh thereof but he is healed forthright. Hearing this our father sent us hither, with an escort of his troops and guards and provided us with all that we need here. When he is minded to ride to us he beateth a kettle-drum, whereupon all his hosts present themselves before him and he chooseth whom he shall ride and dismisseth the rest; but, when he desireth that we shall visit him, he commandeth his followers, the enchanters, to fetch us and carry us to the presence; so he may solace himself with our society and we accomplish our desire of him; after which they again carry us back hither. Our five other sisters are gone a-hunting in our desert, wherein are wild beasts past compt or calculation and, it being our turn to do this we two abode at home, to make ready for them food. Indeed, we had besought Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) to vouchsafe us a son of Adam to cheer us with his company and praised be He who hath brought thee to us! So be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for no harm shall befal thee.\" Hasan rejoiced and said, \"Alhamdolillah, laud to the Lord who guideth us into the path of deliverance and inclineth hearts to us!\" Then his sister[FN#41] rose and taking him by the hand, led him into a private chamber, where she brought out to him linen and furniture that no mortal can avail unto. Presently, the other damsels returned from hunting and birding and their sisters acquainted them with Hasan's case; whereupon they rejoiced in him and going into him in his chamber, saluted him with the salam and gave him joy of his safety. Then he abode with them in all the solace of life and its joyance, riding out with them to the chase and taking his pleasure with them whilst they entreated him courteously and cheered him with converse, till his sadness ceased from him and he recovered health and strength and his body waxed stout and fat, by dint of fair treatment and pleasant time among the seven moons in that fair palace with its gardens and flowers; for indeed he led the delightsomest of lives with the damsels who delighted in him and he yet more in them. And they used to give him drink of the honey-dew of their lips[FN#42] these beauties with the high bosoms, adorned with grace and loveliness, the perfection of brilliancy and in shape very symmetry. Moreover the youngest Princess told her sisters how Bahram the Magian had made them of the Ghuls and Demons and Satans,[FN#43] and they sware that they would surely slay him. Next year the accursed Guebre again made his appearance, having with him a handsome young Moslem, as he were the moon, bound hand and foot and tormented with grievous tortures, and alighted with him below the palace-walls. Now Hasan was sitting under the trees by the side of the stream; and when he espied Bahram, his heart fluttered,[FN#44] his hue changed and he smote hand upon hand.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith saw the Magian, his heart fluttered, his hue changed and he smote hand upon hand. Then he said to the Princesses, \"O my sisters, help me to the slaughter of this accursed, for here he is come back and in your grasp, and he leadeth with him captive a young Moslem of the sons of the notables, whom he is torturing with all manner grievous torments. Lief would I kill him and console my heart of him; and, by delivering the young Moslem from his mischief and restoring him to his country and kith and kin and friends, fain would I lay up merit for the world to come, by taking my wreak of him.[FN#45] This will be an almsdeed from you and ye will reap the reward thereof from Almighty Allah.\" \"We hear and we obey Allah and thee, O our brother, O Hasan,\" replied they and binding chin-veils, armed themselves and slung on their swords: after which they brought Hasan a steed of the best and equipped him in panoply and weaponed him with goodly weapons. Then they all sallied out and found the Magian who had slaughtered and skinned a camel, ill-using the young Moslem, and saying to him, \"Sit thee in this hide.\" So Hasan came behind him, without his knowledge, and cried out at him till he was dazed and amazed. Then he came up to him, saying, \"Hold thy hand, O accursed! O enemy of Allah and foe of the Moslems! O dog! O traitor! O thou that flame dost obey! O thou that walkest in the wicked ones' ways, worshipping the fire and the light and swearing by the shade and the heat!\" Herewith the Magian turned and seeing Hasan, thought to wheedle him and said to him, \"O my son, how diddest thou escape and who brought thee down to earth?\" Hasan replied, \"He delivered me, who hath appointed the taking of thy life to be at my hand, and I will torture thee even as thou torturedst me the whole way long. O miscreant, O atheist,[FN#46] thou hast fallen into the twist and the way thou hast missed; and neither mother shall avail thee nor brother, nor friend nor solemn covenant shall assist thee; for thou saidst, O accursed, Whoso betrayeth bread and salt, may Allah do vengeance upon him! And thou hast broken the bond of bread and salt; wherefore the Almighty hath thrown thee into my grasp, and far is thy chance of escape from me.\" Rejoined Bahram, \"By Allah, O my son, O Hasan, thou art dearer to me than my sprite and the light of mine eyes!\" But Hasan stepped up to him and hastily smote him between the shoulders, that the sword issued gleaming from his throat-tendons and Allah hurried his soul to the fire, and abiding-place dire. Then Hasan took the Magian's bag and opened it, then having taken out the kettle-drum he struck it with the strap, whereupon up came the dromedaries like lightning. So he unbound the youth from his bonds and setting him on one of the camels, loaded him another with victual and water,[FN#47] saying, \"Wend whither thou wilt.\" So he departed, after Almighty Allah had thus delivered him from his strait at the hands of Hasan. When the damsels saw their brother slay the Magian they joyed in him with exceeding joy and gat round him, marvelling at his valour and prowess,[FN#48] and thanked him for his deed and gave him joy of his safety, saying, \"O Hasan thou hast done a deed, whereby thou hast healed the burning of him that thirsteth for vengeance and pleased the King of Omnipotence!\" Then they returned to the palace, and he abode with them, eating and drinking and laughing and making merry; and indeed his sojourn with them was joyous to him and he forgot his mother;[FN#49] but while he led with them this goodly life one day, behold, there arose from the further side of the desert a great cloud of dust that darkened the welkin and made towards them. When the Princess saw this, they said to him, \"Rise, O Hasan, run to thy chamber and conceal thyself; or an thou wilt, go down into the garden and hide thyself among the trees and vines; but fear not, for no harm shall befal thee.\" So he arose and entering his chamber, locked the door upon himself, and lay lurking in the palace. Presently the dust opened out and showed beneath it a great conquering host, as it were a surging sea, coming from the King, the father of the damsels. Now when the troops reached the castle, the Princesses received them with all honour and hospitably entertained them three days; after which they questioned them of their case and tidings and they replied saying, \"We come from the King in quest of you.\" They asked, \"And what would the King with us?\"; and the officers answered, \"One of the Kings maketh a marriage festival, and your father would have you be present thereat and take your pleasure therewith.\" The damsels enquired, \"And how long shall we be absent from our place?\"; and they rejoined, \"The time to come and go, and to sojourn may be two months.\" So the Princesses arose and going in to the palace sought Hasan, acquainted him with the case and said to him, \"Verily this place is thy place and our house is thy house; so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and feel nor grief nor fear, for none can come at thee here; but keep a good heart and a glad mind, till we return to thee. The keys of our chambers we leave with thee; but, O our brother, we beseech thee, by the bond of brotherhood, in very deed not to open such a door, for thou hast no need thereto.\" Then they farewelled him and fared forth with the troops, leaving Hasan alone in the palace. It was not long before his breast grew straitened and his patience shortened: solitude and sadness were heavy on him and he sorrowed for his severance from them with passing chagrin. The palace for all its vastness, waxed small to him and finding himself sad and solitary, he bethought him of the damsels and their pleasant converse and recited these couplets,\n\n\"The wide plain is narrowed before these eyes * And the landscape\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     troubles this heart of mine.\nSince my friends went forth, by the loss of them * Joy fled and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     these eyelids rail floods of brine:\nSleep shunned these eyeballs for parting woe * And my mind is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    worn with sore pain and pine:\nWould I wot an Time shall rejoin our lots * And the joys of love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    with night-talk combine.\"\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after the departure of the damsels, Hasan sat in the palace sad and solitary and his breast was straitened by severance. He used to ride forth a-hunting by himself in the wold and bring back the game and slaughter it and eat thereof alone: but melancholy and disquiet redoubled on him, by reason of his loneliness. So he arose and went round about the palace and explored its every part; he opened the Princesses' apartments and found therein riches and treasures fit to ravish the beholder's reason; but he delighted not in aught thereof, by reason of their absence. His heart was fired by thinking of the door they had charged him not to approach or open on any account and he said in himself, \"My sister had never enjoined me not to open this door, except there were behind it somewhat whereof she would have none to know; but, by Allah, I will arise and open it and see what is within, though within it were sudden death!\" Then he took the key and, opening the door,[FN#50] saw therein no treasure but he espied a vaulted and winding staircase of Yamani onyx at the upper end of the chamber. So he mounted the stair, which brought him out upon the terrace- roof of the palace, whence he looked down upon the gardens and vergiers, full of trees and fruits and beasts and birds warbling praises of Allah, the One, the All-powerful; and said in himself \"This is that they forbade to me.\" He gazed upon these pleasaunces and saw beyond a surging sea, dashing with clashing billows, and he ceased not to explore the palace right and left, till he ended at a pavilion builded with alternate courses, two bricks of gold and one of silver and jacinth and emerald and supported by four columns. And in the centre he saw a sitting- room paved and lined with a mosaic of all manner precious stones such as rubies and emeralds and balasses and other jewels of sorts; and in its midst stood a basin[FN#51] brimful of water, over which was a trellis-work of sandalwood and aloes-wood reticulated with rods of red gold and wands of emerald and set with various kinds of jewels and fine pearls, each sized as a pigeon's egg. The trellis was covered with a climbing vine, bearing grapes like rubies, and beside the basin stood a throne of lign-aloes latticed with red gold, inlaid with great pearls and comprising vari-coloured gems of every sort and precious minerals each kind fronting each and symmetrically disposed. About it the birds warbled with sweet tongues and various voices celebrating the praises of Allah the Most High: brief, it was a palace such as nor C\u00e6sar nor Chosro\u00ebs ever owned; but Hasan saw therein none of the creatures of Allah, whereat he marvelled and said in himself, \"I wonder to which of the Kings this place pertaineth, or is it Many-Columned Iram whereof they tell, for who among mortals can avail to the like of this?\" And indeed he was amazed at the spectacle and sat down in the pavilion and cast glances around him marvelling at the beauty of its ordinance and at the lustre of the pearls and jewels and the curious works which therein were, no less than at the gardens and orchards aforesaid and at the birds that hymned the praises of Allah, the One, the Almighty; and he abode pondering the traces of him whom the Most High had enabled to rear that structure, for indeed He is muchel of might.[FN#52] And presently, behold, he espied ten birds[FN#53] flying towards the pavilion from the heart of the desert and knew that they were making the palace and bound for the basin, to drink of its waters: so he hid himself, for fear they should see him and take flight. They lighted on a great tree and a goodly and circled round about it; and he saw amongst them a bird of marvel-beauty, the goodliest of them all, and the nine stood around it and did it service; and Hasan marvelled to see it peck them with its bill and lord it over them while they fled from it. He stood gazing at them from afar as they entered the pavilion and perched on the couch; after which each bird rent open its neck-skin with its claws and issued out of it; and lo! it was but a garment of feathers, and there came forth therefrom ten virgins, maids whose beauty shamed the brilliancy of the moon. They all doffed their clothes and plunging into the basin, washed and fell to playing and sporting one with other; whilst the chief bird of them lifted up the rest and ducked them down and they fled from her and dared not put forth their hands to her. When Hasan beheld her thus he took leave of his right reason and his sense was enslaved, so he knew that the Princesses had not forbidden him to open the door save because of this; for he fell passionately in love with her, for what he saw of her beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, as she played and sported and splashed the others with the water. He stood looking upon them whilst they saw him not, with eye gazing and heart burning and soul[FN#54] to evil prompting; and he sighed to be with them and wept for longing, because of the beauty and loveliness of the chief damsel. His mind was amazed at her charms and his heart taken in the net of her love; lowe was loosed in his heart for her sake and there waxed on him a flame, whose sparks might not be quenched, and desire, whose signs might not be hidden. Presently, they came up out of that basin, whilst Hasan marvelled at their beauty and loveliness and the tokens of inner gifts in the elegance of their movements. Then he cast a glance at the chief damsel who stood mother- naked and there was manifest to him what was between her thighs a goodly rounded dome on pillars borne, like a bowl of silver or crystal, which recalled to him the saying of the poet,[FN#55]\n\n\"When I took up her shift and discovered the terrace-roof of her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     kaze, I found it as strait as my humour or eke my worldly\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     ways:\nSo I thrust it, incontinent, in, halfway, and she heaved a sigh.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    'For what dost thou sigh?' quoth I. 'For the rest of it\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    sure,' she says.\"\n\nThen coming out of the water they all put on their dresses and ornaments, and the chief maiden donned a green dress,[FN#56] wherein she surpassed for loveliness all the fair ones of the world and the lustre of her face outshone the resplendent full moons: she excelled the branches with the grace of her bending gait and confounded the wit with apprehension of disdain; and indeed she was as saith the poet,[FN#57]\n\n\"A maiden 'twas, the dresser's art had decked with cunning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    sleight;\nThe sun thou 'd'st say had robbed her cheek and shone with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    borrowed light.\nShe came to us apparelled fair in under vest of green,\nLike as the ripe pomegranate hides beneath its leafy screen;\nAnd when we asked her what might be the name of what she wore,\nShe answered in a quaint reply that double meaning bore:\nThe desert's heart we penetrate in such apparel dressed,\nAnd Pierce-heart therefore is the name by which we call the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     vest.\"\n\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan saw the damsels issue forth the basin, the chief maiden robbed his reason with her beauty and loveliness compelling him to recite the couplets forequoted. And after dressing they sat talking and laughing, whilst he stood gazing on them, drowned in the sea of his love, burning in the flames of passion and wandering in the Wady of his melancholy thought. And he said to himself, \"By Allah, my sister forbade me not to open the door, but for cause of these maidens and for fear lest I should fall in love with one of them! How, O Hasan shalt thou woo and win them? How bring down a bird flying in the vasty firmament? By Allah thou hast cast thyself into a bottomless sea and snared thyself in a net whence there is no escape! I shall die desolate and none shall wot of my death.\" And he continued to gaze on the charms of the chief damsel, who was the loveliest creature Allah had made in her day, and indeed she outdid in beauty all human beings. She had a mouth magical as Solomon's seal and hair blacker than the night of estrangement to the love-despairing man; her brow was bright as the crescent moon of the Feast of Ramaz\u00e1n[FN#58] and her eyes were like eyes wherewith gazelles scan; she had a polished nose straight as a cane and cheeks like blood-red anemones of Nu'uman, lips like coralline and teeth like strung pearls in carcanets of gold virgin to man, and a neck like an ingot of silver, above a shape like a wand of B\u00e1n: her middle was full of folds, a dimpled plain such as enforceth the distracted lover to magnify Allah and extol His might and main, and her navel[FN#59] an ounce of musk, sweetest of savour could contain: she had thighs great and plump, like marble columns twain or bolsters stuffed with down from ostrich ta'en, and between them a somewhat, as it were a hummock great of span or a hare with ears back lain while terrace-roof and pilasters completed the plan; and indeed she surpassed the bough of the myrobalan with her beauty and symmetry, and the Indian rattan, for she was even as saith of them the poet whom love did unman,[FN#60]\n\n\"Her lip-dews rival honey-sweets, that sweet virginity; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Keener than Hindi scymitar the glance she casts at thee:\nShe shames the bending bough of B\u00e1n with graceful movement slow *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     And as she smiles her teeth appear with leven's brilliancy:\nWhen I compared with rose a-bloom the tintage of her cheeks, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    She laughed in scorn and cried, 'Whoso compares with rosery\nMy hue and breasts, granados terms, is there no shame in him? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    How should pomegranates bear on bough such fruit in form or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    blee?\nNow by my beauty and mine eyes and heart and eke by Heaven *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Of favours mine and by the Hell of my unclemency,\nThey say 'She is a garden-rose in very pride of bloom'; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   And yet no rose can ape my cheek nor branch my symmetry!\nIf any garden own a thing which unto me is like, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   What then is that he comes to crave of me and only me?\"'\n\nThey ceased not to laugh and play, whilst Hasan stood still a-watching them, forgetting meat and drink, till near the hour of mid-afternoon prayer, when the beauty, the chief damsel, said to her mates, \"O Kings' daughters, it waxeth late and our land is afar and we are weary of this stead. Come, therefore, let us depart to our own place.\" So they all arose and donned their feather vests, and becoming birds as they were before, flew away all together, with the chief lady in their midst. Then, Hasan, despairing of their return, would have arisen and gone down into the palace but could not move or even stand; wherefore the tears ran down his cheeks and passion was sore on him and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"May God deny me boon of troth if I * After your absence sweets\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    of slumber know:\nYea; since that sev'rance never close mine eyes, * Nor rest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     repose me since departed you!\n'Twould seem as though you saw me in your sleep; * Would Heaven\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     the dreams of sleep were real-true!\nIndeed I dote on sleep though needed not, * For sleep may bring\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    me that dear form to view.\"\n\nThen Hasan walked on, little by little, heeding not the way he went, till he reached the foot of the stairs, whence he dragged himself to his own chamber; then he entered and shutting the door, lay sick eating not nor drinking and drowned in the sea of his solitude. He spent the night thus, weeping and bemoaning himself, till the morning, and when it morrowed he repeated these couplets,\n\n\"The birds took flight at eve and winged their way; * And sinless\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    he who died of Love's death-blow.\nI'll keep my love-tale secret while I can * But, an desire\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    prevail, its needs must show:\nNight brought me nightly vision, bright as dawn; * While nights\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    of my desire lack morning-glow.\nI mourn for them[FN#61] while they heart-freest sleep * And winds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     of love on me their plaything blow:\nFree I bestow my tears, my wealth, my heart * My wit, my sprite:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     most gain who most bestow!\nThe worst of woes and banes is enmity * Beautiful maidens deal us\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     to our woe.\nFavour they say's forbidden to the fair * And shedding lovers'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     blood their laws allow;\nThat naught can love-sicks do but lavish soul, * And stake in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    love-play life on single throw:[FN#62]\nI cry in longing ardour for my love: * Lover can only weep and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    wail Love-lowe.\"\n\nWhen the sun rose he opened the door, went forth of the chamber and mounted to the stead where he was before: then he sat down facing the pavilion and awaited the return of the birds till nightfall; but they returned not; wherefore he wept till he fell to the ground in a fainting-fit. When he came to after his swoon, he dragged himself down the stairs to his chamber; and indeed, the darkness was come and straitened upon him was the whole world and he ceased not to weep and wail himself through the livelong night, till the day broke and the sun rained over hill and dale its rays serene. He ate not nor drank nor slept, nor was there any rest for him; but by day he was distracted and by night distressed, with sleeplessness delirious and drunken with melancholy thought and excess of love-longing. And he repeated the verses of the love-distraught poet,\n\n\"O thou who shamest sun in morning sheen * The branch\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     confounding, yet with nescience blest;\nWould Heaven I wot an Time shall bring return * And quench the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     fires which flame unmanifest,\u2014\nBring us together in a close embrace, * Thy cheek upon my cheek,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thy breast abreast!\nWho saith, In Love dwells sweetness? when in Love * Are bitterer\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    days than Alo\u00ebs[FN#63] bitterest.\"\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-eighty Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith felt love redouble upon him, he recited those lines; and, as he abode thus in the stress of his love-distraction, alone and finding none to cheer him with company, behold, there arose a dust-cloud from the desert, wherefore he ran down and hid himself knowing that the Princesses who owned the castle had returned. Before long, the troops halted and dismounted round the palace and the seven damsels alighted and entering, put off their arms and armour of war. As for the youngest, she stayed not to doff her weapons and gear, but went straight to Hasan's chamber, where finding him not, she sought for him, till she lighted on him in one of the sleeping closets hidden, feeble and thin, with shrunken body and wasted bones and indeed his colour was changed and his eyes sunken in his face for lack of food and drink and for much weeping, by reason of his love and longing for the young lady. When she saw him in this plight, she was confounded and lost her wits; but presently she questioned him of his case and what had befallen him, saying, \"Tell me what aileth thee, O my brother, that I may contrive to do away thine affliction, and I will be thy ransom!\"[FN#64] Whereupon he wept with sore weeping and by way of reply he began reciting,\n\n\"Lover, when parted from the thing he loves, * Has naught save\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  weary woe and bane to bear.\nInside is sickness, outside living lowe, * His first is fancy and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    his last despair.\"\n\nWhen his sister heard this, she marvelled at his eloquence and loquent speech and his readiness at answering her in verse and said to him, \"O my brother, when didst thou fall into this thy case and what hath betided thee, that I find thee speaking in song and shedding tears that throng? Allah upon thee, O my brother, and by the honest love which is between us, tell me what aileth thee and discover to me thy secret, nor conceal from me aught of that which hath befallen thee in our absence; for my breast is straitened and my life is troubled because of thee.\" He sighed and railed tears like rain, after which he said, \"I fear, O my sister, if I tell thee, that thou wilt not aid me to win my wish but wilt leave me to die wretchedly in mine anguish.\" She replied, \"No, by Allah, O my brother, I will not abandon thee, though it cost me my life!\" So he told her all that had befallen him, and that the cause of his distress and affliction was the passion he had conceived for the young lady whom he had seen when he opened the forbidden door; and how he had not tasted meat nor drink for ten days past. Then he wept with sore weeping and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Restore my heart as 'twas within my breast, * Let mine eyes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     sleep again, then fly fro' me.\nDeem ye the nights have had the might to change * Love's vow?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Who changeth may he never be!\"\n\nHis sister wept for his weeping and was moved to ruth for his case and pitied his strangerhood; so she said to him, \"O my brother, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for I will venture being and risk existence to content thee and devise thee a device wherewith, though it cost me my dear life and all I hold dear, thou mayst get possession of her and accomplish thy desire, if such be the will of Allah Almighty. But I charge thee, O my brother, keep the matter secret from my sisterhood and discover not thy case to any one of them, lest my life be lost with thy life. An they question thee of opening the forbidden door, reply to them, 'I opened it not; no, never; but I was troubled at heart for your absence and by my loneliness here and yearning for you.'\"[FN#65] And he answered, \"Yes: this is the right rede.\" So he kissed her head and his heart was comforted and his bosom broadened. He had been nigh upon death for excess of affright, for he had gone in fear of her by reason of his having opened the door; but now his life and soul returned to him. Then he sought of her somewhat of food and after serving it she left him, and went in to her sisters, weeping and mourning for him. They questioned her of her case and she told them how she was heavy at heart for her brother, because he was sick and for ten days no food had found way into his stomach. So they asked the cause of his sickness and she answered, \"The reason was our severance from him and our leaving him desolate; for these days we have been absent from him were longer to him than a thousand years and scant blame to him, seeing he is a stranger, and solitary and we left him alone, with none to company with him or hearten his heart; more by token that he is but a youth and may be he called to mind his family and his mother, who is a woman in years, and bethought him that she weepeth for him all whiles of the day and watches of the night, ever mourning his loss; and we used to solace him with our society and divert him from thinking of her.\" When her sisters heard these words they wept in the stress of their distress for him and said, \"Wa'll\u00e1hi\u2014'fore Allah, he is not to blame!\" Then they went out to the army and dismissed it, after which they went into Hasan and saluted him with the salam. When they saw his charms changed with yellow colour and shrunken body, they wept for very pity and sat by his side and comforted him and cheered him with converse, relating to him all they had seen by the way of wonders and rarities and what had befallen the bridegroom with the bride. They abode with him thus a whole month, tendering him and caressing him with words sweeter than syrup; but every day sickness was added to his sickness, which when they saw, they bewept him with sore weeping, and the youngest wept even more than the rest. At the end of this time, the Princesses having made up their minds to ride forth a-hunting and a-birding invited their sister to accompany them, but she said, \"By Allah, O my sisters, I cannot go forth with you whilst my brother is in this plight, nor indeed till he be restored to health and there cease from him that which is with him of affliction. Rather will I sit with him and comfort him.\" They thanked her for her kindness and said to her, \"Allah will requite thee all thou dost with this stranger.\" Then they left her with him in the palace and rode forth taking with them twenty days' victual;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-ninth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Princesses mounted and rode forth a-hunting and a-birding, after leaving in the palace their youngest sister sitting by Hasan's side; and as soon as the damsel knew that they had covered a long distance from home, she went in to him and said, \"O my brother, come, show me the place where thou sawest the maidens.\" He rejoiced in her words, making sure of winning his wish, and replied, \"Bismillah! On my head!\" Then he essayed to rise and show her the place, but could not walk; so she took him up in her arms, holding him to her bosom between her breasts; and, opening the staircase-door, carried him to the top of the palace, and he showed her the pavilion where he had seen the girls and the basin of water, wherein they had bathed. Then she said to him, \"Set forth to me, O my brother, their case and how they came.\" So he described to her whatso he had seen of them and especially the girl of whom he was enamoured; but hearing these words she knew her and her cheeks paled and her case changed. Quoth he, \"O my sister, what aileth thee to wax wan and be troubled?\"; and quoth she, \"O my brother, know thou that this young lady is the daughter of a Sovran of the Jann, of one of the most puissant of their Kings, and her father had dominion over men and Jinn and wizards and Cohens and tribal chiefs and guards and countries and cities and islands galore and hath immense wealth in store. Our father is a Viceroy and one of his vassals and none can avail against him, for the multitude of his many and the extent of his empire and the muchness of his monies. He hath assigned to his offspring, the daughters thou sawest, a tract of country, a whole year's journey in length and breadth, a region girt about with a great river and a deep; and thereto none may attain, nor man nor Jann. He hath an army of women, smiters with swords and lungers with lances, five-and-twenty thousand in number, each of whom, whenas she mounteth steed and donneth battle-gear, eveneth a thousand knights of the bravest. Moreover, he hath seven daughters, who in valour and prowess equal and even excel their sisters,[FN#66] and he hath made the eldest of them, the damsel whom thou sawest,[FN#67] queen over the country aforesaid and who is the wisest of her sisters and in valour and horsemanship and craft and skill and magic excels all the folk of her dominions. The girls who companied with her are the ladies of her court and guards and grandees of her empire, and the plumed skins wherewith they fly are the handiwork of enchanters of the Jann. Now an thou wouldst get possession of this queen and wed this jewel seld-seen and enjoy her beauty and loveliness and grace, do thou pay heed to my words and keep them in thy memory. They resort to this place on the first day of every month; and thou must take seat here and watch for them; and when thou seest them coming hide thee near the pavilion sitting where thou mayst see them, without being seen of them, and beware, again beware lest thou show thyself, or we shall all lose our lives. When they doff their dress note which is the feather-suit of her whom thou lovest and take it, and it only, for this it is that carrieth her to her country, and when thou hast mastered it, thou hast mastered her. And beware lest she wile thee, saying, 'O thou who hast robbed my raiment, restore it to me, because here am I in thine hands and at thy mercy!' For, an thou give it her, she will kill thee and break down over us palace and pavilion and slay our sire: know, then, thy case and how thou shalt act. When her companions see that her feather-suit is stolen, they will take flight and leave her to thee, and beware lest thou show thyself to them, but wait till they have flown away and she despaireth of them: whereupon do thou go in to her and hale her by the hair of her head[FN#68] and drag her to thee; which being done, she will be at thy mercy. And I rede thee discover not to her that thou hast taken the feather-suit, but keep it with care; for, so long as thou hast it in hold, she is thy prisoner and in thy power, seeing that she cannot fly to her country save with it. And lastly carry her down to thy chamber where she will be thine.\" When Hasan heard her words his heart became at ease, his trouble ceased and affliction left him; so he rose to his feet and kissing his sister's head, went down from the terrace with her into the palace, where they slept that night. He medicined himself till morning morrowed; and when the sun rose, he sprang up and opened the staircase-door and ascending to the flat roof sat there till supper-tide when his sister brought him up somewhat of meat and drink and a change of clothes and he slept. And thus they continued doing, day by day until the end of the month. When he saw the new moon, he rejoiced and began to watch for the birds, and while he was thus, behold, up they came, like lightning. As soon as he espied them, he hid himself where he could watch them, unwatched by them, and they lighted down one and all of them, and putting off their clothes, descended into the basin. All this took place near the stead where Hasan lay concealed, and as soon as he caught sight of the girl he loved, he arose and crept under cover, little by little, towards the dresses, and Allah veiled him so that none marked his approach for they were laughing and playing with one another, till he laid hand on the dress. Now when they had made an end of their diversion, they came forth of the basin and each of them slipped on her feather-suit. But the damsel he loved sought for her plumage that she might put it on, but found it not; whereupon she shrieked and beat her cheeks and rent her raiment. Her sisterhood[FN#69] came to her and asked what ailed her, and she told them that her feather-suit was missing; wherefore they wept and shrieked and buffeted their faces: and they were confounded, wotting not the cause of this, and knew not what to do. Presently the night overtook them and they feared to abide with her lest that which had befallen her should befal them also; so they farewelled her and flying away left her alone upon the terrace-roof of the palace, by the pavilion basin.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan had carried off the girl's plumery, she sought it but found it not and her sisterhood flew away leaving her alone. When they were out of sight, Hasan gave ear to her and heard her say, \"O who hast taken my dress and stripped me, I beseech thee to restore it to me and cover my shame, so may Allah never make thee taste of my tribulation!\" But when Hasan heard her speak thus, with speech sweeter than syrup, his love for her redoubled, passion got the mastery of his reason and he had not patience to endure from her. So springing up from his hiding-place, he rushed upon her and laying hold of her by the hair dragged her to him and carried her down to the basement of the palace and set her in his own chamber, where he threw over her a silken cloak[FN#70] and left her weeping and biting her hands. Then he shut the door upon her and going to his sister, informed her how he had made prize of his lover and carried her to his sleeping-closet, \"And there,\" quoth he, \"she is now sitting, weeping and biting her hands.\" When his sister heard this, she rose forthright and betook herself to the chamber, where she found the captive weeping and mourning. So she kissed ground before her and saluted her with the salam and the young lady said to her, \"O King's daughter, do folk like you do such foul deed with the daughters of Kings? Thou knowest that my father is a mighty Sovran and that all the liege lords of the Jinn stand in awe of him and fear his majesty: for that there are with him magicians and sages and Cohens and Satans and Marids, such as none may cope withal, and under his hand are folk whose number none knoweth save Allah. How then doth it become you, O daughters of Kings, to harbour mortal men with you and disclose to them our case and yours? Else how should this man, a stranger, come at us?\" Hasan's sister made reply, \"O King's daughter, in very sooth this human is perfect in nobleness and purposeth thee no villainy; but he loveth thee, and women were not made save for men. Did he not love thee, he had not fallen sick for thy sake and well-nigh given up the ghost for desire of thee.\" And she told her the whole tale how Hasan had seen her bathing in the basin with her attendants, and fallen in love with her, and none had pleased him but she, for the rest were all her handmaids, and none had availed to put forth a hand to her. When the Princess heard this, she despaired of deliverance and presently Hasan's sister went forth and brought her a costly dress, wherein she robed her. Then she set before her somewhat of meat and drink and ate with her and heartened her heart and soothed her sorrows. And she ceased not to speak her fair with soft and pleasant words, saying, \"Have pity on him who saw thee once and became as one slain by thy love;\" and continued to console her and caress her, quoting fair says and pleasant instances. But she wept till daybreak, when her trouble subsided and she left shedding tears, knowing that she had fallen into the net and that there was no deliverance for her. Then said she to Hasan's sister, \"O King's daughter, with this my strangerhood and severance from my country and sisterhood which Allah wrote upon my brow, patience becometh me to support what my Lord hath foreordained.\" Therewith the youngest Princess assigned her a chamber in the palace, than which there was none goodlier and ceased not to sit with her and console her and solace her heart, till she was satisfied with her lot and her bosom was broadened and she laughed and there ceased from her what trouble and oppression possessed her, by reason of her separation from her people and country and sisterhood and parents. Thereupon Hasan's sister repaired to him, and said, \"Arise, go in to her in her chamber and kiss her hands and feet.\"[FN#71] So he went in to her and did this and bussed her between the eyes, saying, \"O Princess of fair ones and life of sprites and beholder's delight, be easy of heart, for I took thee only that I might be thy bondsman till the Day of Doom, and this my sister will be thy servant; for I, O my lady, desire naught but to take thee to wife, after the law of Allah and the practice of His Apostle, and whenas thou wilt, I will journey with thee to my country and carry thee to Baghdad-city and abide with thee there: moreover, I will buy thee handmaidens and negro chattels; and I have a mother, of the best of women, who will do thee service. There is no goodlier land than our land; everything therein is better than elsewhere and its folk are a pleasant people and bright of face.\" Now as he bespake her thus and strave to comfort her, what while she answered him not a syllable, lo! there came a knocking at the palace-gate. So Hasan went out to see who was at the door and found there the six Princesses, who had returned from hunting and birding, whereat he rejoiced and went to meet them and welcomed them. They wished him safety and health and he wished them the like; after which they dismounted and going each to her chamber doffed their soiled clothes and donned fine linen. Then they came forth and demanded the game, for they had taken a store of gazelles and wild cows, hares and lions, hyaenas, and others; so their suite brought out some thereof for butchering, keeping the rest by them in the palace, and Hasan girt himself and fell to slaughtering for them in due form,[FN#72] whilst they sported and made merry, joying with great joy to see him standing amongst them hale and hearty once more. When they had made an end of slaughtering, they sat down and addressed themselves to get ready somewhat for breaking their fast, and Hasan, coming up to the eldest Princess, kissed her head and on like wise did he with the rest, one after other. Whereupon said they to him, \"Indeed, thou humblest thyself to us passing measure, O our brother, and we marvel at the excess of the affection thou showest us. But Allah forfend that thou shouldst do this thing, which it behoveth us rather to do with thee, seeing thou art a man and therefor worthier than we, who are of the Jinn.\"[FN#73] Thereupon his eyes brimmed with tears and he wept sore; so they said to him, \"What causeth thee to weep? Indeed, thou troublest our pleasant lives with thy weeping this day. 'Twould seem thou longest after thy mother and native land. An things be so, we will equip thee and carry thee to thy home and thy friends.\" He replied, \"By Allah, I desire not to part from you!\" Then they asked, \"Which of us hath vexed thee, that thou art thus troubled?\" But he was ashamed to say, \"Naught troubleth me save love of a damsel,\" lest they should deny and disavow him: so he was silent and would tell them nothing of his case. Then his sister came forward and said to them, \"He hath caught a bird from the air and would have you help him to tame her.\" Whereupon they all turned to him and cried, \"We are at thy service every one of us and whatsoever thou seekest that will we do: but tell us thy tale and conceal from us naught of thy case.\" So he said to his sister, \"Do thou tell them, for I am ashamed before them nor can I face them with these words.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan said to his sister, \"Do thou tell them my tale, for before them I stand abashed nor can I face them with these words.\" So she said to them, \"O my sisters, when we went away and left alone this unhappy one, the palace was straitened upon him and he feared lest some one should come in to him, for ye know that the sons of Adam are light of wits. So, he opened the door of the staircase leading to the roof, of his loneliness and trouble, and sat there, looking upon the Wady and watching the gate, in his fear lest any should come thither. One day, as he sat thus, suddenly he saw ten birds approach him, making for the palace, and they lighted down on the brink of the basin which is in the pavilion-terrace. He watched these birds and saw, amongst them, one goodlier than the rest, which pecked the others and flouted them, whilst none of them dared put out a claw to it. Presently, they set their nails to their neck-collars and, rending their feather-suits, came forth therefrom and became damsels, each and every, like the moon on fullest night. Then they doffed their dress and plunging into the water, fell to playing with one another, whilst the chief damsel ducked the others, who dared not lay a finger on her and she was fairest of favour and most famous of form and most feateous of finery. They ceased not to be in this case till near the hour of mid-afternoon prayer, when they came forth of the basin and, donning their feather-shifts, flew away home. Thereupon he waxed distracted, with a heart afire for love of the chief damsel and repenting him that he had not stolen her plumery. Wherefore he fell sick and abode on the palace-roof expecting her return and abstaining from meat and drink and sleep, and he ceased not to be so till the new moon showed, when behold, they again made their appearance according to custom and doffing their dresses went down into the basin. So he stole the chief damsel's feather-suit, knowing that she could not fly save therewith, hiding himself carefully lest they sight him and slay him. Then he waited till the rest had flown away, when he arose and seizing the damsel, carried her down from the terrace into the castle.\" Her sisters asked, \"Where is she?\"; and she answered, \"She is with him in such a chamber.\" Quoth they, \"Describe her to us, O our sister:\" so quoth she, \"She is fairer than the moon on the night of fullness and her face is sheenier than the sun; the dew of her lips is sweeter than honey and her shape is straighter and slenderer than the cane; one with eyes black as night and brow flower-white; a bosom jewel-bright, breasts like pomegranates twain and cheeks like apples twain, a waist with dimples overlain, a navel like a casket of ivory full of musk in grain, and legs like columns of alabastrine vein. She ravisheth all hearts with Nature-kohl'd eyne, and a waist slender-fine and hips of heaviest design and speech that heals all pain and pine: she is goodly of shape and sweet of smile, as she were the moon in fullest sheen and shine.\" When the Princesses heard these praises, they turned to Hasan and said to him, \"Show her to us.\" So he arose with them, all love-distraught, and carrying them to the chamber wherein was the captive damsel, opened the door and entered, preceding the seven Princesses. Now when they saw her and noted her loveliness, they kissed the ground between her hands, marvelling at the fairness of her favour and the significance which showed her inner gifts, and said to her, \"By Allah, O daughter of the Sovran Supreme, this is indeed a mighty matter: and haddest thou heard tell of this mortal among women thou haddest marvelled at him all thy days. Indeed, he loveth thee with passionate love; yet, O King's daughter, he seeketh not lewdness, but desireth thee only in the way of lawful wedlock. Had we known that maids can do without men, we had impeached him from his intent, albeit he sent thee no messenger, but came to thee in person; and he telleth us he hath burnt the feather dress; else had we taken it from him.\" Then one of them agreed with the Princess and becoming her deputy in the matter of the wedding contract, performed the marriage ceremony between them, whilst Hasan clapped palms with her, laying his hand in hers, and she wedded him to the damsel by consent; after which they celebrated her bridal feast, as beseemeth Kings' daughters, and brought Hasan in to her. So he rose and rent the veil and oped the gate and pierced the forge[FN#74] and brake the seal, whereupon affection for her waxed in him and he redoubled in love and longing for her. Then, since he had gotten that which he sought, he gave himself joy and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"Thy shape's temptation, eyes as Houri's fain * And sheddeth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Beauty's sheen[FN#75] that radiance rare:\nMy glance portrayed thy glorious portraiture: * Rubies one-half\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     and gems the third part were:\nMusk made a fifth: a sixth was ambergris * The sixth a pearl but\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     pearl without compare.\nEve never bare a daughter evening thee * Nor breathes thy like in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Khuld's[FN#76] celestial air.\nAn thou would torture me 'tis wont of Love * And if thou pardon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     'tis thy choice I swear:\nThen, O world bright'ner and O end of wish! * Loss of thy charms\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     who could in patience bear?\"\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan went in unto the King's daughter and did away her maidenhead, he enjoyed her with exceeding joy and affection for her waxed in him and he redoubled in love-longing for her; so he recited the lines aforesaid. Now the Princesses were standing at the door and when they heard his verses, they said to her, \"O King's daughter, hearest thou the words of this mortal? How canst thou blame us, seeing that he maketh poetry for love of thee and indeed he hath so done a thousand times.\"[FN#77] When she heard this she rejoiced and was glad and felt happy and Hasan abode with her forty[FN#78] days in all solace and delight, joyance and happiest plight, whilst the damsels renewed festivities for him every day and overwhelmed him with bounty and presents and rarities; and the King's daughter became reconciled to her sojourn amongst them and forgot her kith and kin. At the end of the forty days, Hasan saw in a dream, one night, his mother mourning for him and indeed her bones were wasted and her body had waxed shrunken and her complexion had yellowed and her favour had changed the while he was in excellent case. When she saw him in this state, she said to him, \"O my son, O Hasan, how is it that thou livest thy worldly life at thine ease and forgettest me? Look at my plight since thy loss! I do not forget thee, nor will my tongue cease to name thy name till I die; and I have made thee a tomb in my house, that I may never forget thee. Would Heaven I knew[FN#79] if I shall live, O my son, to see thee by my side and if we shall ever again foregather as we were.\" Thereupon Hasan awoke from sleep, weeping and wailing, the tears railed down his cheeks like rain and he became mournful and melancholy; his tears dried not nor did sleep visit him, but he had no rest, and no patience was left to him. When he arose, the Princesses came in to him and gave him good-morrow and made merry with him as was their wont; but he paid no heed to them; so they asked his wife concerning his case and she said, \"I ken not.\" Quoth they, \"Question him of his condition.\" So she went up to him and said, \"What aileth thee, O my lord?\" Whereupon he moaned and groaned and told her what he had seen in his dream and repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"Indeed afflicted sore are we and all distraught, * Seeking for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    union; yet we find no way:\nAnd Love's calamities upon us grow * And Love though light with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    heaviest weight doth weigh.\"\n\nHis wife repeated to the Princesses what he said and they, hearing the verses, had pity on him and said to him, \"In Allah's name, do as thou wilt, for we may not hinder thee from visiting thy mother; nay, we will help thee to thy wish by what means we may. But it behoveth that thou desert us not, but visit us, though it be only once a year.\" And he answered, \"To hear is to obey: be your behest on my head and eyes!\" Then they arose forthright and making him ready victual for the voyage, equipped the bride for him with raiment and ornaments and everything of price, such as defy description, and they bestowed on him gifts and presents which pens of ready writers lack power to set forth. Then they beat the magical kettle-drum and up came the dromedaries from all sides. They chose of them such as could carry all the gear they had prepared; amongst the rest five-and-twenty chests of gold and fifty of silver; and, mounting Hasan and his bride on others, rode with them three days, wherein they accomplished a march of three months. Then they bade them farewell and addressed themselves to return; whereupon his sister, the youngest damsel, threw herself on Hasan's neck and wept till she fainted. When she came to herself, she repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"Ne'er dawn the severance-day on any wise * That robs of sleep\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     these heavy-lidded eyes.\nFrom us and thee it hath fair union torn * It wastes our force\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    and makes our forms its prize.\"\n\nHer verses finished she farewelled him, straitly charging him, whenas he should have come to his native land and have foregathered with his mother and set his heart at ease, to fail not of visiting her once in every six months and saying, \"If aught grieve thee or thou fear aught of vexation, beat the Magian's kettle-drum, whereupon the dromedaries shall come to thee; and do thou mount and return to us and persist not in staying away.\" He swore thus to do and conjured them to go home. So they returned to the palace, mourning for their separation from him, especially the youngest, with whom no rest would stay nor would Patience her call obey, but she wept night and day. Thus it was with them; but as regards Hasan and his wife, they fared on by day and night over plain and desert site and valley and stony heights through noon-tide glare and dawn's soft light; and Allah decreed them safety, so that they reached Bassorah-city without hindrance and made their camels kneel at the door of his house. Hasan then dismissed the dromedaries and, going up to the door to open it, heard his mother weeping and in a faint strain, from a heart worn with parting-pain and on fire with consuming bane, reciting these couplets,\n\n\"How shall he taste of sleep who lacks repose * Who wakes a-night\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   when all in slumber wone?\nHe owned wealth and family and fame * Yet fared from house and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  home an exile lone:\nLive coal beneath his[FN#80] ribs he bears for bane, * And mighty\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  longing, mightier ne'er was known:\nPassion hath seized him, Passion mastered him; * Yet is he\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   constant while he maketh moan:\nHis case for Love proclaimeth aye that he, * (As prove his tears)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   is wretched, woebegone.\"\n\nWhen Hasan heard his mother weeping and wailing he wept also and knocked at the door a loud knock. Quoth she, \"Who is at the door?\"; and quoth he, \"Open!\" Whereupon she opened the door and knowing him at first sight fell down in a fainting fit; but he ceased not to tend her till she came to herself, when he embraced her and she embraced him and kissed him, whilst his wife looked on mother and son. Then he carried his goods and gear into the house, whilst his mother, for that her heart was comforted and Allah had reunited her with her son versified with these couplets,\n\n\"Fortune had ruth upon my plight * Pitied my long long bane and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    blight;\nGave me what I would liefest sight; * And set me free from all\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    afright.\nSo pardon I the sin that sin * n\u00e8d she in days evanisht quite;\nE'en to the sin she sinned when she * Bleached my hair-parting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     silvern white.\"\n\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan with his mother then sat talking and she asked him, \"How faredst thou, O my son, with the Persian?\" whereto he answered, \"O my mother, he was no Persian, but a Magian, who worshipped the fire, not the All-powerful Sire.\" Then he told her how he dealt with him, in that he had journeyed with him to the Mountain of Clouds and sewed him up in the camel's skin, and how the vultures had taken him up and set him down on the summit and what he had seen there of dead folk, whom the Magian had deluded and left to die on the crest after they had done his desire. And he told her how he had cast himself from the mountain-top into the sea and Allah the Most High had preserved him and brought him to the palace of the seven Princesses and how the youngest of them had taken him to brother and he had sojourned with them till the Almighty brought the Magian to the place where he was and he slew him. Moreover, he told her of his passion for the King's daughter and how he had made prize of her and of his seeing her[FN#81] in sleep and all else that had befallen him up to the time when Allah vouchsafed them reunion. She wondered at his story and praised the Lord who had restored him to her in health and safety. Then she arose and examined the baggage and loads and questioned him of them. So he told her what was in them, whereat she joyed with exceeding joy. Then she went up to the King's daughter, to talk with her and bear her company; but, when her eyes fell on her, her wits were confounded at her brilliancy and she rejoiced and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace: and she sat down beside her, cheering her and comforting her heart while she never ceased to repeat \"Alhamdolillah, O my son, for thy return to me safe and sound!\" Next morning early she went down into the market and bought mighty fine furniture and ten suits of the richest raiment in the city, and clad the young wife and adorned her with everything seemiy. Then said she to Hasan, \"O my son, we cannot tarry in this town with all this wealth; for thou knowest that we are poor folk and the people will suspect us of practising alchemy. So come, let us depart to Baghdad, the House[FN#82] of Peace, where we may dwell in the Caliph's Sanctuary, and thou shalt sit in a shop to buy and sell, in the fear of Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) and He shall open to thee the door of blessings with this wealth.\" Hasan approved her counsel and going forth straightway, sold the house and summoned the dromedaries, which he loaded with all his goods and gear, together with his mother and wife. Then he went down to the Tigris, where he hired him a craft to carry them to Baghdad and embarked therein all his possessions and his mother and wife. They sailed up the river with a fair wind for ten days till they drew in sight of Baghdad, at which they all rejoiced, and the ship landed them in the city, where without stay or delay Hasan hired a storehouse in one of the caravanserais and transported his goods thither. He lodged that night in the Khan, and on the morrow he changed his clothes and going down into the city, enquired for a broker. The folk directed him to one, and when the broker saw him, he asked him what he lacked. Quoth he, \"I want a house, a handsome one and a spacious.\" So the broker showed him the houses at his disposal and he chose one that belonged to one of the Wazirs and buying it of him for an hundred thousand golden dinars, gave him the price. Then he returned to his caravanserai and removed all his goods and monies to the house; after which he went down to the market and bought all the mansion needed of vessels and carpets and other household stuff, besides servants and eunuchs, including a little black boy for the house. He abode with his wife in all solace and delight of life three years, during which time he was vouchsafed by her two sons, one of whom he named N\u00e1sir and the other Mans\u00far: but, at the end of this time he bethought him of his sisters, the Princesses, and called to mind all their goodness to him and how they had helped him to his desire. So he longed after them and going out to the marketstreets of the city, bought trinkets and costly stuffs and fruit-confections, such as they had never seen or known. His mother asked him the reason of his buying these rarities and he answered, \"I purpose to visit my sisters, who showed me every kind of kindness and all the wealth that I at present enjoy is due to their goodness and munificence: wherefore I will journey to them and return soon, Inshallah!\" Quoth she, \"O my son, be not long absent from me;\" and quoth he, \"Know, O my mother, how thou shalt do with my wife. Here is her feather-dress in a chest, buried under ground in such a place; do thou watch over it, lest haply she hap on it and take it, for she would fly away, she and her children, and I should never hear of them again and should die of grieving for them; wherefore take heed, O my mother, while I warn thee that thou name this not to her. Thou must know that she is the daughter of a King of the Jinn, than whom there is not a greater among the Sovrans of the Jann nor a richer in troops and treasure, and she is mistress of her people and dearest to her father of all he hath. Moreover, she is passing high-spirited, so do thou serve her thyself and suffer her not to go forth the door neither look out of window nor over the wall, for I fear the air for her when it bloweth,[FN#83] and if aught befel her of the calamities of this world, I should slay myself for her sake.\" She replied, \"O my son, I take refuge with Allah[FN#84] from gainsaying thee! Am I mad that thou shouldst lay this charge on me and I disobey thee therein? Depart, O my son, with heart at ease, and please Allah, soon thou shalt return in safety and see her and she shall tell thee how I have dealt with her: but tarry not, O my son, beyond the time of travel.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan had determined to visit the Princesses, he gave his mother the orders we have mentioned.[FN#85] Now, as Fate would have it, his wife heard what he said to his mother and neither of them knew it. Then Hasan went without the city and beat the kettle-drum, whereupon up came the dromedaries and he loaded twenty of them with rarities of Al-Irak; after which he returned to his mother and repeated his charge to her and took leave of her and his wife and children, one of whom was a yearling babe and the other two years old. Then he mounted and fared on, without stopping night or day, over hills and valleys and plains and wastes for a term of ten days till, on the eleventh, he reached the palace and went in to his sisters, with the gifts he had brought them. The Princesses rejoiced at his sight and gave him joy of his safety, whilst his sister decorated the palace within and without. Then they took the presents and, lodging him in a chamber as before, asked him of his mother and his wife, and he told them that she had borne him two sons. And the youngest Princess, seeing him well and in good case, joyed with exceeding joy and repeated this couplet,\n\n\"I ever ask for news of you from whatso breezes pass * And never any but yourselves can pass across my mind.\"\n\nThen he abode with them in all honour and hospitality, for three months, spending his time in feasting and merrymaking, joy and delight, hunting and sporting. So fared it with him; but as regards his wife, she abode with his mother two days after her husband's departure, and on the third day, she said to her, \"Glory be to God! Have I lived with him three years and shall I never go to the bath?\" Then she wept and Hasan's mother had pity on her condition and said to her, \"O my daughter, here we are strangers and thy husband is abroad. Were he at home, he would serve thee himself, but, as for me, I know no one. However, O my daughter, I will heat thee water and wash thy head in the Hammam-bath which is in the house.\" Answered the King's daughter, \"O my lady, hadst thou spoken thus to one of the slave-girls, she had demanded to be sold in the Sultan's open market and had not abode with thee.[FN#86] Men are excusable, because they are jealous and their reason telleth them that, if a woman go forth the house, haply she will do frowardness. But women, O my lady, are not all equal and alike and thou knowest that, if woman have a mind to aught, whether it be the Hammam or what not else, none hath power over her to guard her or keep her chaste or debar her from her desire; for she will do whatso she willeth and naught restraineth her but her reason and her religion.\"[FN#87] Then she wept and cursed fate and bemoaned herself and her strangerhood, till Hasan's mother was moved to ruth for her case and knew that all she said was but truth and that there was nothing for it but to let her have her way. So she committed the affair to Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) and making ready all that they needed for the bath, took her and went with her to the Hammam. She carried her two little sons with her, and when they entered, they put off their clothes and all the women fell to gazing on the Princess and glorifying God (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) for that He had created so fair a form. The women of the city, even those who were passing by, flocked to gaze upon her, and the report of her was noised abroad in Baghdad till the bath was crowded that there was no passing through it. Now it chanced there was present on that day and on that rare occasion with the rest of the women in the Hammam, one of the slave-girls of the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, by name Tohfah[FN#88] the Lutanist, and she, finding the Hammam over crowded and no passing for the throng of women and girls, asked what was to do; and they told her of the young lady. So she walked up to her and, considering her closely, was amazed at her grace and loveliness and glorified God (magnified be His majesty!) for the fair forms He hath created. The sight hindered her from her bath, so that she went not farther in nor washed, but sat staring at the Princess, till she had made an end of bathing and coming forth of the caldarium donned her raiment, whereupon beauty was added to her beauty. She sat down on the divan,[FN#89] whilst the women gazed upon her; then she looked at them and veiling herself, went out. Tohfah went out with her and followed her, till she saw where she dwelt, when she left her and returned to the Caliph's palace; and ceased not wending till she went in to the Lady Zubaydah and kissed ground between her hands; whereupon quoth her mistress, \"O Tohfah, why hast thou tarried in the Hammam?\" She replied, \"O my lady, I have seen a marvel, never saw I its like amongst men or women, and this it was that distracted me and dazed my wit and amazed me, so that I forgot even to wash my head.\" Asked Zubaydah, \"And what was that?\" ; and Tohfah answered, \"O my lady, I saw a damsel in the bath, having with her two little boys like moons, eye never espied her like, nor before her nor after her, neither is there the fellow of her form in the whole world nor her peer amongst Ajams or Turks or Arabs. By the munificence, O my lady, an thou toldest the Commander of the Faithful of her, he would slay her husband and take her from him, for her like is not to be found among women. I asked of her mate and they told me that he is a merchant Hasan of Bassorah hight. Moreover, I followed her from the bath to her own house and found it to be that of the Wazir, with the two gates, one opening on the river and the other on the land.[FN#90] Indeed, O my lady, I fear lest the Prince of True Believers hear of her and break the law and slay her husband and take love-liesse with her.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Tohfah, after seeing the King's daughter, described her beauty to the Lady Zubaydah ending with, \"Indeed, O my mistress, I fear lest the Prince of True Believers hear of her and break the law and slay her mate and take her to wife,\" Zubaydah cried, \"Woe to thee, O Tohfah, say me, doth this damsel display such passing beauty and loveliness that the Commander of the Faithful should, on her account, barter his soul's good for his worldly lust and break the Holy Law! By Allah, needs must I look on her, and if she be not as thou sayest, I will bid strike off thy head! O strumpet, there are in the Caliph's Serraglio three hundred and three score slave girls, after the number of the days of the year, yet is there none amongst them so excellent as thou describest!\" Tohfah replied, \"No, by Allah, O my lady!: nor is there her like in all Baghdad; no, nor amongst the Arabs or the Daylamites nor hath Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) created the like of her!\" Thereupon Zuhaydah called for Masrur, the eunuch, who came and kissed the ground before her, and she said to him, \"O Masrur, go to the Wazir's house, that with the two gates, one giving on the water and the other on the land, and bring me the damsel who dwelleth there, also her two children and the old woman who is with her, and haste thou and tarry not.\" Said Masrur, \"I hear and I obey,\" and repairing to Hasan's house, knocked at the door. Quoth the old woman, \"Who is at the door?\" and quoth he, \"Masrur, the eunuch of the Commander of the Faithful.\" So she opened the door and he entered and saluted her with the salam; whereupon she returned his salute and asked his need; and he replied, \"The Lady Zubaydah, daughter of Al-Kasim[FN#91] and queen-spouse of the Commander of the Faithful Harun al-Rashid sixth[FN#92] of the sons of Al-Abbas, paternal uncle of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) summoneth thee to her, thee and thy son's wife and her children; for the women have told her anent her and her beauty.\" Rejoined the old woman, \"O my lord Masrur, we are foreigner folk and the girl's husband (my son) who is abroad and far from home hath strictly charged me not to go forth nor let her go forth in his absence, neither show her to any of the creatures of Allah Almighty; and I fear me, if aught befal her and he come back, he will slay himself; wherefore of thy favour I beseech thee, O Masrur, require us not of that whereof we are unable.\" Masrur retorted, \"O my lady, if I knew aught to be feared for you in this, I would not require you to go; the Lady Zubaydah desireth but to see her and then she may return. So disobey not or thou wilt repent; and like as I take you, I will bring you both back in safety, Inshallah!\" Hasan's mother could not gainsay him; so she went in and making the damsel ready, brought her and her children forth and they all followed Masrur to the palace of the Caliphate where he carried them in and seated them on the floor before the Lady Zubaydah. They kissed ground before her and called down blessings upon her; and Zubaydah said to the young lady (who was veiled), \"Wilt thou not uncover thy face, that I may look on it?\" So she kissed the ground between her hands and discovered a face which put to shame the full moon in the height of heaven. Zubaydah fixed her eyes on her and let their glances wander over her, whilst the palace was illumined by the light of her countenance; whereupon the Queen and the whole company were amazed at her beauty and all who looked on her became Jinn-mad and unable to bespeak one another. As for Zubaydah, she rose and making the damsel stand up, strained her to her bosom and seated her by herself on the couch. Moreover, she bade decorate the palace in her honour and calling for a suit of the richest raiment and a necklace of the rarest ornaments put them upon her. Then said she to her, \"O liege lady of fair ones, verily thou astoundest me and fillest mine eyes.[FN#93] What arts knowest thou?\" She replied, \"O my lady, I have a dress of feathers, and could I but put it on before thee, thou wouldst see one of the fairest of fashions and marvel thereat, and all who saw it would talk of its goodliness, generation after generation.\" Zubaydah asked, \"And where is this dress of thine?\"; and the damsel answered, \"'Tis with my husband's mother. Do thou seek it for me of her.\" So Zubaydah said to the old woman, \"O my lady the pilgrimess, O my mother, go forth and fetch us her feather-dress, that we may solace ourselves by looking on what she will do, and after take it back again.\" Replied the old woman, \"O my lady, this damsel is a liar. Hast thou ever seen any of womankind with a dress of feathers? Indeed, this belongeth only to birds.\" But the damsel said to the Lady Zubaydah, \"As thou livest, O my lady, she hath a feather-dress of mine and it is in a chest, which is buried in such a store-closet in the house.\" So Zubaydah took off her neck a rivi\u00e8re of jewels, worth all the treasures of Chosroe and C\u00e6sar, and gave it to the old woman, saying, \"O my mother, I conjure thee by my life, take this necklace and go and fetch us this dress, that we may divert ourselves with the sight thereof, and after take it again!\" But she sware to her that she had never seen any such dress and wist not what the damsel meant by her speech. Then the Lady Zubaydah cried out at her and taking the key from her, called Masrur and said to him as soon as her came, \"Take this key and go to the house; then open it and enter a store-closet there whose door is such and such and amiddlemost of it thou wilt find a chest buried. Take it out and break it open and bring me the feather-dress which is therein and set it before me.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Lady Zubaydah, having taken the key from Hasan's mother, handed it to Masrur, saying, \"Take this key and open such a closet; then bring forth of it the chest; break it open; bring me the feather-dress which is therein and set it before me.\" \"Hearkening and obedience,\" replied he and taking the key went forth, whereupon the old woman arose and followed him, weeping-eyed and repenting her of having given ear to the damsel and gone with her to the bath, for her desire to go thither was but a device. So she went with him to the house and opened the door of the closet, and he entered and brought out the chest. Then he took therefrom the feather,dress and wrapping it in a napkin, carried it to the Lady Zubaydah, who took it and turned it about, marvelling at the beauty of its make; after which she gave it to the damsel, saying, \"Is this thy dress of feathers?\" She replied, \"Yes, O my lady,\" and at once putting forth her hand, took it joyfully. Then she examined it and rejoiced to find it whole as it was, not a feather gone. So she rose and came down from beside the Lady Zubaydah and taking her sons in her bosom, wrapped herself in the feather-dress and became a bird, by the ordinance of Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!), whereat Zubaydah marvelled as did all who were present. Then she walked with a swaying and graceful gait and danced and sported and flapped her wings, whilst all eyes were fixed on her and all marvelled at what she did. Then said she with fluent tongue, \"Is this goodly, O my ladies?\"; and they replied, \"Yes, O Princess of the fair! All thou dost is goodly.\" Said she, \"And this, O my mistresses, that I am about to do is better yet.\" Then she spread her wings and flying up with her children to the dome of the palace, perched on the saloon-roof whilst they all looked at her, wide-eyed and said, \"By Allah, this is indeed a rare and peregrine fashion! Never saw we its like.\" Then, as she was about to take flight for her own land, she bethought her of Hasan and said, \"Hark ye, my mistresses!\" and she improvised these couplets,[FN#94]\n\n\"O who bast quitted these abodes and faredst lief and light * To\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    other objects of thy love with fain and fastest flight!\nDeem'st thou that 'bided I with you in solace and in joy * Or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    that my days amid you all were clear of bane and blight?\nWhen I was captive ta'en of Love and snar\u00e8d in his snare, * He\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    made of Love my prison and he fared fro' me forthright:\nSo when my fear was hidden, he made sure that ne'er should I *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Pray to the One, th' Omnipotent to render me my right:\nHe charged his mother keep the secret with all the care she\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     could, * In closet shut and treated me with enemy's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     despight:\nBut I o'erheard their words and held them fast in memory * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   hoped for fortune fair and weal and blessings infinite:\nMy faring to the Hammam-bath then proved to me the means * Of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   making minds of folk to be confounded at my sight:\nWondered the Bride of Al-Rashid to see my brilliancy * When she\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   beheld me right and left with all of beauty dight:\nThen quoth I, 'O our Caliph's wife, I once was wont to own * A\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   dress of feathers rich and rare that did the eyes delight:\nAn it were now on me thou shouldst indeed see wondrous things *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  That would efface all sorrows and disperse all sores of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   sprite:'\nThen deigned our Caliph's Bride to cry, 'Where is that dress of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    thine?' * And I replied, 'In house of him kept darkling as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   the night.'\nSo down upon it pounced Masr\u00far and brought it unto her, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   when 'twas there each feather cast a ray of beaming light:\nTherewith I took it from his hand and opened it straightway * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    saw its plum\u00e8d bosom and its buttons pleased my sight:\nAnd so I clad myself therein and took with me my babes; * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     spread my wings and flew away with all my main and might;\nSaying, 'O husband's mother mine tell him when cometh he * An\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     ever wouldest meet her thou from house and home must flee.\"'\n\nWhen she had made an end of her verses, the Lady Zubaydah said to her, \"Wilt thou not come down to us, that we may take our fill of thy beauty, O fairest of the fair? Glory be to Him who hath given thee eloquence and brilliance!\" But she said, \"Far be from me that the Past return should see!\" Then said she to the mother of the hapless, wretched Hasan, \"By Allah, O my lady, O mother of my husband, it irketh me to part from thee; but, whenas thy son cometh to thee and upon him the nights of severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully, let him come in the islands of W\u00e1k[FN#95] to me.\" Then she took flight with her children and sought her own country, whilst the old woman wept and beat her face and moaned and groaned till she swooned away. When she came to herself, she said to the Lady Zubaydah, \"O my lady, what is this thou hast done?\" And Zubaydah said to her, \"O my lady the pilgrimess, I knew not that this would happen and hadst thou told me of the case and acquainted me with her condition, I had not gainsaid thee. Nor did I know until now that she was of the Flying Jinn; else had I not suffered her to don the dress nor permitted her to take her children: but now, O my lady, words profit nothing; so do thou acquit me of offence against thee.\" And the old woman could do no otherwise than shortly answer, \"Thou art acquitted.!\" Then she went forth the palace of the Caliphate and returned to her own house, where she buffeted her face till she swooned away, When she came to herself, she pined for her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren and for the sight of her son and versified with these couplets,\n\n\"Your faring on the parting-day drew many a tear fro' me, * Who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     must your flying from the home long mourn in misery:\nAnd cried I for the parting pang in anguish likest fire * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     tear-floods chafed mine eyelids sore that ne'er of tears\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     were free;\n'Yes, this is Severance, Ah, shall we e'er oy return of you? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     For your departure hath deprived my power of privacy!'\nAh, would they had returned to me in covenant of faith * An they\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     return perhaps restore of past these eyne may see.\"\n\nThen arising she dug in the house three graves and betook herself to them with weeping all whiles of the day and watches of the night; and when her son's absence was longsome upon her and grief and yearning and unquiet waxed upon her, she recited these couplets,\n\n\"Deep in mine eye-balls ever dwells the phantom-form of thee * My\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     heart when throbbing or at rest holds fast thy memory:\nAnd love of thee doth never cease to course within my breast, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     As course the juices in the fruits which deck the branchy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     tree:\nAnd every day I see thee not my bosom straightened is * And even\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     censurers excuse the woes in me they see:\nO thou whose love hath gotten hold the foremost in the heart * Of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     me whose fondness is excelled by mine insanity:\nFear the Compassionate in my case and some compassion show! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Love of thee makes me taste of death in bitterest pungency.\"\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan's mother bewept through the watches of the night and the whiles of the day her separation from her son and his wife and children. On this wise it fared with her; but as regards Hasan, when he came to the Princesses, they conjured him to tarry with them three months, after which long sojourn they gave him five loads of gold and the like of silver and one load of victual and accompanied him on his homeward way till he conjured them to return, whereupon they farewelled him with an embrace; but the youngest came up to him, to bid him adieu and clasping his neck wept till she fainted. Then she recited these two couplets,\n\n\"When shall the severance-fire be quenched by union, love, with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     you? * When shall I win my wish of you and days that were\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     renew?\nThe parting-day affrighted me and wrought me dire dismay * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     doubleth woe, O master mine, by the sad word 'Adieu.'\"\n\nAnon came forward the second Princess and embraced him and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Farewelling thee indeed is like to bidding life farewell * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     like the loss of Zephyr[FN#96] 'tis to lose thee far our\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    sight:\nThine absence is a flaming fire which burneth up my heart * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   in thy presence I enjoy the Gardens of Delight.\"[FN#97]\n\nPresently came forward the third and embraced him and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"We left not taking leave of thee (when bound to other goal) *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   From aught of ill intention or from weariness and dole:\nThou art my soul, my very soul, the only soul of me: * And how\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    shall I farewell myself and say, 'Adieu my Soul?'\"[FN#98]\n\nAfter her came forward the fourth and embraced him and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Nought garred me weep save where and when of severance spake he,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    * Persisting in his cruel will with sore persistency:\nLook at this pearl-like ornament I've hung upon mine ear: * 'Tis\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     of the tears of me compact, this choicest jewelry!\"\n\nIn her turn came forward the fifth and embraced him and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Ah, fare thee not; for I've no force thy faring to endure, * Nor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     e'en to say the word farewell before my friend is sped:\nNor any patience to support the days of severance, * Nor any\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   tears on ruined house and wasted home to shed.\"\n\nNext came the sixth and embraced him and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"I cried, as the camels went off with them, * And Love pained my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    vitals with sorest pain:\nHad I a King who would lend me rule * I'd seize every ship that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    dares sail the Main.\"\n\nLastly came forward the seventh and embraced him and recited these couplets,\n\n\"When thou seest parting, be patient still, * Nor let foreign\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     parts deal thy soul affright:\nBut abide, expecting a swift return, * For all hearts hold\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     parting in sore despight.\"\n\nAnd eke these two couplets,\n\n\"Indeed I'm heartbroken to see thee start, * Nor can I farewell\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thee ere thou depart;\nAllah wotteth I left not to say adieu * Save for fear that saying\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     would melt your heart.\"\n\nHasan also wept for parting from them, till he swooned, and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Indeed, ran my tears on the severance-day * Like pearls I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     threaded in necklace-way\nThe cameleer drove his camels with song * But I lost heart,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    patience and strength and stay:\nI bade them farewell and retired in grief * From tryst-place and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     camp where my dearlings lay:\nI turned me unknowing the way nor joyed * My soul, but in hopes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     to return some day.\nOh listen, my friend, to the words of love * God forbid thy heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     forget all I say!\nO my soul when thou partest wi' them, part too * With all joys of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     life nor for living pray!\"\n\nThen he farewelled them and fared on diligently night and day, till he came to Baghdad, the House of Peace and Sanctuary of the Abbaside Caliphs, unknowing what had passed during his wayfare. At once entering his house he went in to his mother to salute her, but found her worn of body and wasted of bones, for excess of mourning and watching, weeping and wailing, till she was grown thin as a toothpick and could not answer him a word. So he dismissed the dromedaries then asked her of his wife and children and she wept till she fainted, and he seeing her in this state searched the house for them, but found no trace of them. Then he went to the store-closet and finding it open and the chest broken and the feather-dress missing, knew forthright that his wife had possessed herself thereof and flown away with her children. Then he returned to his mother and, finding her recovered from her fit, questioned her of his spouse and babes, whereupon she wept and said, \"O my son, may Allah amply requite thee their loss! These are their three tombs.\"[FN#99] When Hasan heard these words of his mother, he shrieked a loud shriek and fell down in a fainting-fit in which he lay from the first of the day till noon-tide; whereupon anguish was added to his mother's anguish and she despaired of his life. However, after a-while, he came to himself and wept and buffeted his face and rent his raiment and went about the house clean distraught, reciting these two couplets,[FN#100]\n\n\"Folk have made moan of passion before me, of past years, * And\nlive and dead for absence have suffered pains and fears;\nBut that within my bosom I harbour, with mine eyes * I've never\nseen the like of nor heard with mine ears.\"\nThen finishing his verses he bared his brand and coming up to his mother, said to her, \"Except thou tell me the truth of the case, I will strike off thy head and kill myself.\" She replied, \"O my son, do not such deed: put up thy sword and sit down, till I tell thee what hath passed.\" So he sheathed his scymitar and sat by her side, whilst she recounted to him all that had happened in his absence from first to last, adding, \"O my son, but that I saw her weep in her longing for the bath and feared that she would go and complain to thee on thy return, and thou wouldst be wroth with me. I had never carried her thither; and were it not that the Lady Zubaydah was wroth with me and took the key from me by force, I had never brought out the feather-dress, though I died for it. But thou knowest, O my son, that no hand may measure length with that of the Caliphate. When they brought her the dress, she took it and turned it over, fancying that somewhat might be lost thereof, but she found it uninjured; wherefore she rejoiced and making her children fast to her waist, donned the feather-vest, after the Lady Zubaydah had pulled off to her all that was upon herself and clad her therein, in honour of her and because of her beauty. No sooner had she donned the dress than she shook and becoming a bird, promenaded about the palace, whilst all who were present gazed at her and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness. Then she flew up to the palace roof and perching thereon, looked at me and said: 'Whenas thy son cometh to thee and the nights of separation upon him longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him leave his native land and journey to the Islands of Wak and seek me.' This, then, is her story and what befel in thine absence.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as Hasan's mother had made an end of her story, he gave a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit which continued till the end of day, when he revived and fell to buffeting his face and writhing on the floor like a scotched snake. His mother sat weeping by his head until midnight, when he came to himself and wept sore and recited these couplets',[FN#101]\n\n\"Pause ye and see his sorry state since when ye fain withdrew; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Haply, when wrought your cruelty, you'll have the grace to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    rue:\nFor an ye look on him, you'll doubt of him by sickness-stress *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    As though, by Allah, he were one before ye never knew.\nHe dies for nothing save for love of you, and he would be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Numbered amid the dead did not he moan and groan for you.\nAnd deem not pangs of severance sit all lightly on his soul; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    'Tis heavy load on lover-wight; 'twere lighter an ye slew.\"\n\nThen having ended his verse he rose and went round about the house, weeping and wailing, groaning and bemoaning himself, five days, during which he tasted nor meat nor drink. His mother came to him and conjured him, till he broke his fast, and besought him to leave weeping; but he hearkened not to her and continued to shed tears and lament, whilst she strove to comfort him and he heeded her not. Then he recited these couplets,[FN#102]\n\n\"Beareth for love a burden sore this soul of me, * Could break a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     mortal's back however strong that be;\nI am distraught to see my case and languor grows * Making my day\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   and night indifferent in degree:\nI own to having dreaded Death before this day: * This day I hold\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   my death mine only remedy.\"\n\nAnd Hasan ceased not to do thus till daybreak, when his eyes closed and he saw in a dream his wife grief-full and repentant for that which she had done. So he started up from sleep crying out and reciting these two couplets,\n\n\"Their image bides with me, ne'er quits me, ne'er shall fly; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    But holds within my heart most honourable stead;\nBut for reunion-hope, I'd see me die forthright, * And but for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     phantom-form of thee my sleep had fled.\"\n\nAnd as morning morrowed he redoubled his lamentations. He abode weeping-eyed and heavy-hearted, wakeful by night and eating little, for a whole month, at the end of which he bethought him to repair to his sisters and take counsel with them in the matter of his wife, so haply they might help him to regain her. Accordingly he summoned the dromedaries and loading fifty of them with rarities of Al-Irak, committed the house to his mother's care and deposited all his goods in safe keeping, except some few he left at home. Then he mounted one of the beasts and set out on his journey single handed, intent upon obtaining aidance from the Princesses, and he stayed not till he reached the Palace of the Mountain of Clouds, when he went in to the damsels and gave them the presents in which they rejoiced. Then they wished him joy of his safety and said to him, \"O our brother, what can ail thee to come again so soon, seeing thou wast with us but two months since?\" Whereupon he wept and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"My soul for loss of lover sped I sight; * Nor life enjoying\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    neither life's delight:\nMy case is one whose cure is all unknown; * Can any cure the sick\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    but doctor wight?\nO who hast reft my sleep-joys, leaving me * To ask the breeze\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    that blew from that fair site,\u2014\nBlew from my lover's land (the land that owns * Those charms so\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    sore a grief in soul excite),\n'O breeze, that visitest her land, perhaps * Breathing her scent,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   thou mayst revive my sprite!'\"\n\nAnd when he ended his verse he gave a great cry and fell down in a fainting-fit. The Princesses sat round him, weeping over him, till he recovered and repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"Haply and happily may Fortune bend her rein * Bringing my love,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    for Time's a freke of jealous strain;[FN#103]\nFortune may prosper me, supply mine every want, * And bring a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    blessing where before were ban and bane.\"\n\nThen he wept till he fainted again, and presently coming to himself recited the two following couplets,\n\n\"My wish, mine illness, mine unease! by Allah, own * Art thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   content? then I in love contented wone!\nDost thou forsake me thus sans crime or sin * Meet me in ruth, I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    pray, and be our parting gone.\"\n\nThen he wept till he swooned away once more and when he revived he repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Sleep fled me, by my side wake ever shows * And hoard of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     tear-drops from these eyne aye flows;\nFor love they weep with beads cornelian-like * And growth of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     distance greater dolence grows:\nLit up my longing, O my love, in me * Flames burning 'neath my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     ribs with fiery throes!\nRemembering thee a tear I never shed * But in it thunder roars\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     and leven glows.\"\n\nThen he wept till he fainted away a fourth time, and presently recovering, recited these couplets,\n\n\"Ah! for lowe of love and longing suffer ye as suffer we? * Say,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    as pine we and as yearn we for you are pining ye?\nAllah do the death of Love, what a bitter draught is his! * Would\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    I wot of Love what plans and what projects nurseth he!\nYour faces radiant-fair though afar from me they shine, * Are\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   mirrored in our eyes whatsoever the distance be;\nMy heart must ever dwell on the memories of your tribe; * And the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   turtle-dove reneweth all as oft as moaneth she:\nHo thou dove, who passest night-tide in calling on thy fere, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Thou doublest my repine, bringing grief for company;\nAnd leavest thou mine eyelids with weeping unfulfilled * For the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     dearlings who departed, whom we never more may see:\nI melt for the thought of you at every time and hour, * And I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     long for you when Night showeth cheek of blackest blee.\"\n\nNow when his sister heard these words and saw his condition and how he lay fainting on the floor, she screamed and beat her face and the other Princesses hearing her scream came out and learning his misfortune and the transport of love and longing and the passion and distraction that possessed him they questioned him of his case. He wept and told them what had befallen in his absence and how his wife had taken flight with her children, wherefore they grieved for him and asked him what she said at leave-taking. Answered he, \"O my sisters, she said to my mother, 'Tell thy son, whenas he cometh to thee and the nights of sever- ance upon him longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see, and whenas the winds of love and longing shake him dolefully, let him fare in the Islands of Wak to me.\" When they heard his words they signed one to other with their eyes and shook their heads, and each looked at her sister, whilst Hasan looked at them all. Then they bowed their heads groundwards and bethought themselves awhile; after which they raised their heads and said, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"; presently adding, \"Put forth thy hand to heaven and when thou reach thither, then shalt thou win to thy wife.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Princesses said to Hasan, \"Put forth thy hand to Heaven and when thou reach thither, then shalt thou win to wife and children,\" thereat the tears ran down his cheeks like rain and wet his clothes, and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"Pink cheeks and eyes enpupil'd black have dealt me sore\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  despight; * And whenas wake overpowered sleep my patience\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   fled in fright:\nThe fair and sleek-limbed maidens hard of heart withal laid waste\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  * My very bones till not a breath is left for man to sight:\nHouris, who fare with gait of grace as roes o'er sandy-mound: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Did Allah's saints behold their charms they'd doat thereon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    forthright;\nFaring as fares the garden breeze that bloweth in the dawn. * For\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   love of them a sore unrest and troubles rack my sprite:\nI hung my hopes upon a maid, a loveling fair of them, * For whom\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    my heart still burns with lowe in Laz\u00e1-hell they light;\u2014\nA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp dearling soft of sides and haught and graceful in her gait, *\nHer grace is white as morning, but her hair is black as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    night:\nShe stirreth me!

So they fell to comforting him and exhorting him to patience and offering up prayers for his reunion with his wife; whilst his sister said to him, \"O my brother, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and be patient; so shalt thou win thy will; for whoso hath patience and waiteth, that he seeketh attaineth. Patience holdeth the keys of relief and indeed the poet saith,\n\n'Let destiny with slackened rein its course appointed fare!

So he told her and she said, \"By Allah, O my brother, I was minded to bid thee burn the feather-dress, but Satan made me forget it.\" She ceased not to converse with him and caress him and company with him other ten days, whilst sleep visited him not and he delighted not in food; and when the case was longsome upon him and unrest waxed in him, he versified with these couplets,\n\n\"A beloved familiar o'erreigns my heart * And Allah's ruling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     reigns evermore:\nShe hath all the Arab's united charms * This gazelle who feeds on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    my bosom's core.\nThough my skill and patience for love of her fail, * I weep\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    whilst I wot that 'tis vain to deplore.\nThe dearling hath twice seven years, as though * She were moon of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     five nights and of five plus four.\"[FN#106]\n\nWhen the youngest Princess saw him thus distracted for love and longing for passion and the fever-heat of desire, she went in to her sisterhood weeping-eyed and woeful-hearted, and shedding copious tears threw herself upon them, kissed their feet and besought them to devise some device for bringing Hasan to the Islands of Wak and effecting his reunion with his wife and wees. She ceased not to conjure them to further her brother in the accomplishment of his desire and to weep before them, till she made them weep and they said to her, \"Hearten thy heart: we will do our best endeavour to bring about his reunion with his family, Inshallah!\" And he abode with them a whole year, during which his eyes never could retain their tears. Now the sisterhood had an uncle, brother-german to their sire and his name was Abd al-Kadd\u00fas, or Slave of the Most Holy; and he loved the eldest with exceeding love and was wont to visit her once a year and do all she desired. They had told him of Hasan's adventure with the Magian and how he had been able to slay him; whereat he rejoiced and gave the eldest Princess a pouch[FN#107] which contained certain perfumes, saying, \"O daughter of my brother, an thou be in concern for aught, or if aught irk thee, or thou stand in any need, cast of these perfumes upon fire naming my name and I will be with thee forthright and will do thy desire.\" This speech was spoken on the first of Moharram[FN#108]; and the eldest Princess said to one of the sisterhood, \"Lo, the year is wholly past and my uncle is not come. Rise, bring me the fire-sticks and the box of perfumes.\" So the damsel arose rejoicing and, fetching what she sought, laid it before her sister, who opened the box and taking thence a little of the perfume, cast it into the fire naming her unde's name; nor was it burnt out ere appeared a dust-cloud at the farther end of the Wady; and presently lifting, it discovered a Shaykh riding on an elephant, which moved at a swift and easy pace, and trumpeted under the rider. As soon as he came within sight of the Princesses, he began making signs to them with his hands and feet; nor was it long ere he reached the castle and, alighting from the elephant, came in to them, whereupon they embraced him and kissed his hands and saluted him with the salam. Then he sat down, whilst the girls talked with him and questioned him of his absence. Quoth he, \"I was sitting but now with my wife, your aunt, when I smelt the perfumes and hastened to you on this elephant. What wouldst thou, O daughter of my brother?\" Quoth she, \"O uncle, indeed we longed for thee, as the year is past and 'tis not thy wont to be absent from us more than a twelvemonth.\" Answered he, \"I was busy, but I purposed to come to you to-morrow.\" Wherefore they thanked him and blessed him and sat talking with him.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundredth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the girls sat down to chat with their uncle the eldest said to him \"O my uncle, we told thee the tale of Hasan of Bassorah, whom Bahram the Magian brought and how he slew the wizard and how, after enduring all manner of hardships and horrors, he made prize of the Supreme King's daughter and took her to wife and journeyed with her to his native land?\" Replied he, \"Yes, and what befel him after that?\" Quoth the Princess, \"She played him false after he was blest with two sons by her; for she took them in his absence and fled with them to her own country, saying to his mother: 'Whenas thy son returneth to thee and asketh for me and upon him the nights of severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully, let him come in the Islands of Wak to me.'\" When Abd al-Kaddus heard this, he shook his head and bit his forefinger; then, bowing his brow groundwards he began to make marks on the earth with his finger-tips;[FN#109] after which he again shook his head and looked right and left and shook his head a third time, whilst Hasan watched him from a place where he was hidden from him. Then said the Princesses to their uncle, \"Return us some answer, for our hearts are rent in sunder.\" But he shook his head at them, saying, \"O my daughters, verily hath this man wearied himself in vain and cast himself into grievous predicament and sore peril; for he may not gain access to the Islands of Wak.\" With this the Princesses called Hasan, who came forth and, advancing to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, kissed his hand and saluted him. The old man rejoiced in him and seated him by his side; whereupon quoth the damsels, \"O uncle, acquaint our brother Hasan with that thou hast told us.\" So he said to Hasan, \"O my son, put away from thee this peine forte et dure; for thou canst never gain access to the Islands of Wak, though the Flying Jinn and the Wandering Stars were with thee; for that betwixt thee and these islands are seven Wadys and seven seas and seven mighty mountains. How then canst thou come at this stead and who shall bring thee thither? Wherefore, Allah upon thee, O my son, do thou reckon thy spouse and sons as dead and turn back forthright and weary not thy sprite! Indeed, I give thee good counsel, an thou wilt but accept it.\" Hearing these words from the Shaykh, Hasan wept till he fainted, and the Princesses sat round him, weeping for his weeping, whilst the youngest sister rent her raiment and buffeted her face, till she swooned away. When Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus saw them in this transport of grief and trouble and mourning, he was moved to ruth for them and cried, \"Be ye silent!\" Then said he to Hasan, \"O my son, hearten thy heart and rejoice in the winning of thy wish, an it be the will of Allah the Most High;\" presently adding, \"Rise, O my son, take courage and follow me.\" So Hasan arose forthright and after he had taken leave of the Princesses followed him, rejoicing in the fulfilment of his wish. Then the Shaykh called the elephant and mounting, took Hasan up behind him and fared on three days with their nights, like the blinding leven, till he came to a vast blue mountain, whose stones were all of azure hue and amiddlemost of which was a cavern, with a door of Chinese iron. Here he took Hasan's hand and let him down and alighting dismissed the elephant. Then he went up to the door and knocked, whereupon it opened and there came out to him a black slave, hairless, as he were an Ifrit, with brand in right hand and targe of steel in left. When he saw Abd al-Kaddus, he threw sword and buckler from his grip and coming up to the Shaykh kissed his hand. Thereupon the old man took Hasan by the hand and entered with him, whilst the slave shut the door behind them; when Hasan found himself in a vast cavern and a spacious, through which ran an arched corridor and they ceased not faring on therein a mile or so, till it abutted upon a great open space and thence they made for an angle of the mountain wherein were two huge doors cast of solid brass. The old man opened one of them and said to Hasan, \"Sit at the door, whilst I go within and come back to thee in haste, and beware lest thou open it and enter.\" Then he fared inside and, shutting the door after him, was absent during a full sidereal hour, after which he returned, leading a black stallion, thin of flank and short of nose, which was ready bridled and saddled, with velvet housings; and when it ran it flew, and when it flew, the very dust in vain would pursue; and brought it to Hasan, saying, \"Mount!\" So he mounted and Abd al-Kaddus opened the second door, beyond which appeared a vast desert. Then the twain passed through the door into that desert and the old man said to him, \"O my son, take this scroll and wend thou whither this steed will carry thee. When thou seest him stop at the door of a cavern like this, alight and throw the reins over the saddle-bow and let him go. He will enter the cavern, which do thou not enter with him, but tarry at the door five days, without being weary of waiting. On the sixth day there will come forth to thee a black Shaykh, clad all in sable, with a long white beard, flowing down to his navel. As soon as thou seest him, kiss his hands and seize his skirt and lay it on thy head and weep before him, till he take pity on thee and he will ask thee what thou wouldst have. When he saith to thee, 'What is thy want?' give him this scroll which he will take without speaking and go in and leave thee. Wait at the door other five days, without wearying, and on the sixth day expect him; and if he come out to thee himself, know that thy wish will be won, but, if one of his pages come forth to thee, know that he who cometh forth to thee, purposeth to kill thee; and\u2014the Peace![FN#110] For know, O my son, that whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to death;\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and First Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after handing the scroll to Hasan, Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus told him what would befal him and said, \"Whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to death; but also who ventureth naught advantageth naught. However an thou fear for thy life, cast it not into danger of destruction; but, an thou fear not, up and do thy will, for I have expounded to thee the whole case. Yet shouldest thou be minded to return to thy friends, the elephant is still here and he will carry thee to my nieces, who will restore thee to thy country and return thee to thy home, and Allah will vouchsafe thee a better than this girl, of whom thou art enamoured.\" Hasan answered the Shaykh, saying, \"And how shall life be sweet to me, except I win my wish? By Allah, I will never turn back, till I regain my beloved or my death overtake me!\" And he wept and recited these couplets,\n\n\"For loss of lover mine and stress of love I dree, * I stood\nbewailing self in deep despondency.\nLonging for him, the Spring-camp's dust I kissed and kissed, *\nBut this bred more of grief and galling reverie.\nGod guard the gone, who in our hearts must e'er abide * With\nnearing woes and joys which still the farther flee.\nThey say me, 'Patience!' But they bore it all away: * On\nparting-day, and left me naught save tormentry.\nAnd naught affrighted me except the word he said, * 'Forget me\nnot when gone nor drive from memory.'\nTo whom shall turn I? hope in whom when you are lost? * Who were\nmy only hopes and joys and woes of me?\nBut ah, the pang of home-return when parting thus! * How joyed at\nseeing me return mine enemy.\nThen well-away! this 'twas I guarded me against! * And ah, thou\nlowe of Love double thine ardency![FN#111]\nAn fled for aye my friends I'll not survive the flight; * Yet an\nthey deign return, Oh joy! Oh ecstacy!\nNever, by Allah tears and weeping I'll contain * For loss of you,\nbut tears on tears and tears will rain.\"\nWhen Abd al-Kaddus heard his verse he knew that he would not turn back from his desire nor would words have effect on him, and was certified that naught would serve him but he must imperil himself, though it lose him his life. So he said to him, \"Know, O my son, that the Islands of Wak are seven islands, wherein is a mighty host, all virgin girls, and the Inner Isles are peopled by Satans and Marids and warlocks and various tribesmen of the Jinn; and whoso entereth their land never returneth thence; at least none hath done so to this day. So, Allah upon thee, return presently to thy people, for know that she whom thou seekest is the King's daughter of all these islands: and how canst thou attain to her? Hearken to me, O my son, and haply Allah will vouchsafe thee in her stead a better than she.\" \"O my lord,\" answered Hasan, though for the love of her I were cut in pieces yet should I but redouble in love and transport! There is no help but that I enter the Wak Islands and come to the sight of my wife and children; and Inshallah, I will not return save with her and with them.\" Said the Shaykh, \"Then nothing will serve thee but thou must make the journey?\" Hasan replied \"Nothing! and I only ask of thee thy prayers for help and aidance; so haply Allah will reunite me with my wife and children right soon.\" Then he wept for stress of longing and recited these couplets,\n\n\"You are my wish, of creatures brightest-light * I deem you lief\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   as hearing, fain as sight:\nYou hold my heart which hath become your home * And since you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   left me, lords, right sore's my plight:\nThen think not I have yielded up your love, * Your love which set\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    this wretch in fierce affright:\nYou went and went my joy whenas you went; * And waned and wax'ed\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   wan the brightest light:\nYou left me lone to watch the stars in woe: * Railing tears\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    likest rain-drops infinite.\nThou'rt longsome to the wight, who pining lies * On wake,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    moon-gazing through the night,\nO Night!

And now go with the blessing of God.\" Hasan forthright set out giving the horse the rein, and it flew off with him swiftlier than lightning, and stayed not in its course ten days, when he saw before him a vast loom black as night, walling the world from East to West. As he neared it, the stallion neighed under him, whereupon there flocked to it horses in number as the drops of rain, none could tell their tale or against them prevail, and fell to rubbing themselves against it. Hasan was affrighted at them and fared forwards surrounded by the horses, without drawing rein till he came to the cavern which Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus had described to him. The steed stood still at the door and Hasan alighted and bridged the bridle over the saddle-bow[FN#113]; whereupon the steed entered the cavern, whilst the rider abode without, as the old man had charged him, pondering the issue of his case in perplexity and distraction and unknowing what would befal him.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Second Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan, dismounting from the steed, stood at the cavern-mouth pondering the issue of his case and unknowing what might befal him. He abode standing on the same spot five days with their nights, sleepless, mournful, tearful-eyed; distracted, perplexed, pondering his severance from home and family, comrades and friends, with weeping eye-lids and heavy heart. Then he bethought him of his mother and of what might yet happen to him and of his separation from his wife and children and of all that he had suffered, and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"With you is my heart-cure a heart that goes; * And from\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     hill-foot of eyelids the tear-rill flows:\nAnd parting and sorrow and exile and dole * And farness from\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     country and throe that o'erthrows:\nNaught am I save a lover distracted by love, * Far parted from\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     loved one and wilted by woes.\nAnd 'tis Love that hath brought me such sorrow, say where * Is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     the noble of soul who such sorrow unknows?\"\n\nHardly had Hasan made an end of his verses, when out came the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh, a blackamoor and clad in black raiment, and at first sight he knew him by the description that Abd al-Kaddus had given him. He threw himself at his feet and rubbed his cheeks on them and seizing his skirt, laid it on his head and wept before him. Quoth the old man, \"What wantest thou, O my son?\" Whereupon he put out his hand to him with the letter, and Abu al-Ruwaysh took it and reentered the cavern, without making him any answer. So Hasan sat down at the cave-mouth in his place other five days as he had been bidden, whilst concern grew upon him and terror redoubled on him and restlessness gat hold of him, and he fell to weeping and bemoaning himself for the anguish of estrangement and much watching. And he recited these couplets,\n\n\"Glory to Him who guides the skies! * The lover sore in sorrow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     lies.\nWho hath not tasted of Love's food * Knows not what mean its\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     miseries.\nDid I attempt to stem my tears * Rivers of blood would fount and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    rise.\nHow many an intimate is hard * Of heart, and pains in sorest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    wise!\nAn she with me her word would keep, * Of tears and sighs I'd fain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     devise,\nBut I'm forgone, rejected quite * Ruin on me hath cast her eyes.\nAt my fell pangs fell wildlings weep * And not a bird for me but\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     cries.\"\n\nHasan ceased not to weep till dawn of the sixth day, when Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh came forth to him, clad in white raiment, and with his hand signed[FN#114] to him to enter. So he went in, rejoicing and assured of the winning of his wish, and the old man took him by the hand and leading him into the cavern, fared on with him half a day's journey, till they reached an arched doorway with a door of steel. The Shaykh opened the door and they two entered a vestibule vaulted with onyx stones and arabesqued with gold, and they stayed not walking till they came to a great hall and a wide, paved and walled with marble. In its midst was a flower-garden containing all manner trees and flowers and fruits, with birds warbling on the boughs and singing the praises of Allah the Almighty Sovran; and there were four daises, each facing other, and in each dais a jetting fountain, at whose corners stood lions of red gold, spouting gerbes from their mouths into the basin. On each dais stood a chair, whereon sat an elder, with exceeding store of books before him[FN#115] and censers of gold, containing fire and perfumes, and before each elder were students, who read the books to him. Now when the twain entered, the elders rose to them and did them honour; whereupon Abu al-Ruwaysh signed to them to dismiss their scholars and they did so. Then the four arose and seating themselves before that Shaykh, asked him of the case of Hasan to whom he said, \"Tell the company thy tale and all that hath betided thee from the beginning of thine adventure to the end.\" So Hasan wept with sore weeping and related to them his story with Bahram; whereupon all the Shaykhs cried out and said, \"Is this indeed he whom the Magian caused to climb the Mountain of Clouds by means of the vultures, sewn up in the camel-hide?\" And Hasan said, \"Yes.\" So they turned to the Shaykh, Abu al-Ruwaysh and said to him, \"O our Shaykh, of a truth Bahram contrived his mounting to the mountaintop; but how came he down and what marvels saw he there?\" And Abu al-Ruwaysh said, \"O Hasan, tell them how thou camest down and acquaint them with what thou sawest of marvels.\" So he told them all that had befallen him, first and last; how he had gotten the Magian into his power and slain him, how he had delivered the youth from him and sent him back to his own country, and how he had captured the King's daughter of the Jinn and married her; yet had she played him false and taken the two boys she had borne him and flown away; brief, he related to them all the hardships and horrors he had undergone; whereat they marvelled, each and every, and said to Abu al-Ruwaysh, \"O elder of elders, verily by Allah, this youth is to be pitied! But belike thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and wees.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Third Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan told his tale to the elders, they said to Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh, \"This youth is to be pitied and haply thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and wees.\" He replied, \"O my brothers, in very sooth this is a grave matter and a perilous; and never saw I any loathe his life save this youth. You know that the Islands of Wak are hard of access and that none may come to them but at risk of life; and ye know also the strength of their people and their guards. Moreover I have sworn an oath not to tread their soil nor transgress against them in aught; so how shall this man come at the daughter of the Great King, and who hath power to bring him to her or help him in this matter?\" Replied the other, \"O Shaykh of Shaykhs, verily this man is consumed with desire and he hath endangered himself to bring thee a scroll from thy brother Abd al-Kaddus; wherefore it behoveth thee to help him.\" And Hasan arose and kissed Abu al-Ruwaysh's feet and raising the hem of his garment laid it on his head, weeping and crying. \"I beseech thee, by Allah, to reunite me with my wife and children, though it cost me my life and my soul!\" The four elders all wept for his weeping and said to Abu al-Ruwaysh, \"Deal generously with this unhappy and show him kindness for the sake of thy brother Abd al-Kaddus and profit by this occasion to earn reward from Allah for helping him.\" Quoth he, \"This wilful youth weeteth not what he undertaketh; but Inshallah! we will help him after the measure of our means, nor leave aught feasible undone.\" When Hasan heard the Shaykh's word he rejoiced and kissed the hands of the five elders, one after other, imploring their aidance. Thereupon Abd al-Ruwaysh took inkcase and a sheet of paper and wrote a letter, which he sealed and gave to Hasan, together with a pouch of perfumed leather,[FN#116] containing incense and fire-sticks[FN#117] and other needs, and said to him, \"Take strictest care of this pouch, and whenas thou fallest into any strait, burn a little of the incense therein and name my name, whereupon I will be with thee forthright and save thee from thy stress.\" Moreover, he bade one of those present fetch him an Ifrit of the Flying Jinn; and he did so incontinently; whereupon quoth Abu al-Ruwaysh to the fire-drake, \"What is thy name!\" Replied the Ifrit, \"Thy thrall is hight Dahnash bin Faktash.\" And the Shaykh said \"Draw near to me!\" So Dahnash drew near to him and he put his mouth to his ear and said somewhat to him, whereat the Ifrit shook his head and answered, \"I accept, O elder of elders!\" Then said Abu al-Ruwaysh to Hasan, \"Arise, O my son, mount the shoulders of this Ifrit, Dahnash the Flyer; but, when he heaveth thee heavenwards and thou hearest the angels glorifying God a-welkin with 'Subh\u00e1na Il\u00e1h,' have a care lest thou do the like; else wilt thou perish and he too.\" Hasan replied, \"I will not say a word; no, never;\" and the old man continued, \"O Hasan, after faring with thee all this day, to-morrow at peep of dawn he will set thee down in a land cleanly white, like unto camphor, whereupon do thou walk on ten days by thyself, till thou come to the gate of a city. Then enter and enquire for the King of the city; and when thou comest to his presence, salute him with the salam and kiss his hand: then give him this scroll and consider well whatso he shall counsel thee,\" Hasan replied, \"Hearing and obeying,\" and rose up and mounted the Ifrit's shoulders, whilst the elders rose and offered up prayers for him and commended him to the care of Dahnash the Firedrake. And when he had perched on the Flyer's back the Ifrit soared with him to the very confines of the sky, till he heard the angels glorifying God in Heaven, and flew on with him a day and a night till at dawn of the next day he set him down in a land white as camphor, and went his way, leaving him there. When Hasan found himself in the land aforesaid with none by his side he fared on night and day for ten days, till he came to the gate of the city in question and entering, enquired for the King. They directed him to him and told him that his name was King Hass\u00fan,[FN#118] Lord of the Land of Camphor, and that he had troops and soldiers enough to fill the earth in its length and breadth. So he sought audience of him and, being admitted to his presence, found him a mighty King and kissed ground between his hands. Quoth the King, \"What is thy want?\" Whereupon Hasan kissed the letter and gave it to him. The King read it and shook his head awhile, then said to one of his officers, \"Take this youth and lodge him in the house of hospitality.\" So he took him and stablished him in the guest-house, where he tarried three days, eating and drinking and seeing none but the eunuch who waited on him and who entertained him with discourse and cheered him with his company, questioning him of his case and how he came to that city; whereupon he told him his whole story, and the perilous condition wherein he was. On the fourth day, that eunuch carried him before the King, who said to him, \"O Hasan, thou comest to me, seeking to enter the Islands of Wak, as the Shaykh of Shaykhs adviseth me. O my son, I would send thee thither this very day, but that by the way are many perils and thirsty wolds full of terrors; yet do thou have patience and naught save fair shall befal thee, for needs must I devise to bring thee to thy desire, Inshallah! Know, O my son, that here is a mighty host,[FN#119] equipped with arms and steeds and warlike gear, who long to enter the Wak Islands and lack power thereto. But, O my son, for the sake of the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh, son of Bilkis,[FN#120] the daughter of Mu'in, I may not send thee back to him unfulfilled of thine affair. Presently there will come to us ships from the Islands of Wak and the first that shall arrive I will send thee on board of her and give thee in charge to the sailors, so they may take care of thee and carry thee to the Islands. If any question thee of thy case and condition, answer him saying, 'I am kinsman to King Hassun, Lord of the Land of Camphor;' and when the ship shall make fast to the shore of the Islands of Wak and the master shall bid thee land, do thou land. Now as soon as thou comest ashore, thou wilt see a multitude of wooden settles all about the beach, of which do thou choose thee one and crouch under it and stir not. And when dark night sets in, thou wilt see an army of women appear and flock about the goods landed from the ship, and one of them will sit down on the settle, under which thou hast hidden thyself, whereupon do thou put forth thy hand to her and take hold of her and implore her protection. And know thou, O my son, that an she accord thee protection, thou wilt win thy wish and regain thy wife and children; but, if she refuse to protect thee, make thy mourning for thyself and give up all hope of life, and make sure of death for indeed thou art a dead man. Understand, O my son, that thou adventurest thy life and this is all I can do for thee, and\u2014the peace!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Hassun spake these words to Hasan and charged him as we have related, ending with, \"This is all I can do for thee and know that except the Lord of Heaven had aided thee, thou hadst not come hither!\" The youth wept till he swooned away, and when he recovered, he recited these two couplets,\n\n\"A term decreed my lot I 'spy; * And, when its days shall end, I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     die.\nThough lions fought with me in lair * If Time be mine I'd beat\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     them, I!\"\n\nThen having ended his verse he kissed the ground before the Sovran and said to him, \"O mighty King, how many days remain till the coming of the ships?\" Replied the other, \"In a month's time they will come and will tarry here, selling their cargueson, other two months, after which they will return to their own country; so hope not to set out save after three whole months.\" Then the King bade him return to the house of hospitality and bade supply him with all that he needed of meat and drink and raiment fit for Kings. Hasan abode in the guest-house a month, at the end of which the vessels arrived and the King and the merchants went forth to them, taking Hasan with them. Amongst them he saw a ship with much people therein, like the shingles for number; none knew their tale save He who created them. She was anchored in mid-harbour and had cocks which transported her lading to the shore. So Hasan abode till the crew had landed all the goods and sold and bought and to the time of departure there wanted but three days; whereupon the King sent for him and equipped him with all he required and gave him great gifts: after which he summoned the captain of the great ship and said to him, \"Take this youth with thee in the vessel, so none may know of him save thou, and carry him to the Islands of Wak and leave him there; and bring him not back.\" And the Rais said, \"To hear is to obey: with love and gladness!\" Then quoth the King to Hasan, \"Look thou tell none of those who are with thee in the ship thine errand nor discover to them aught of thy case; else thou art a lost man;\" and quoth he, \"Hearing and obedience!\" With this he farewelled the King, after he had wished him long life and victory over his enviers and his enemies; wherefore the King thanked him and wished him safety and the winning of his wish. Then he committed him to the captain, who laid him in a chest which he embarked in a dinghy, and bore him aboard, whilst the folk were busy in breaking bulk and no man doubted but the chest contained somewhat of merchandise. After this, the vessels set sail and fared on without ceasing ten days, and on the eleventh day they made the land. So the Rais set Hasan ashore and, as he walked up the beach, he saw wooden settles[FN#121] without number, none knew their count save Allah, even as the King had told him. He went on, till he came to one that had no fellow and hid under it till nightfall, when there came up a mighty many of women, as they were locusts over-swarming the land and they marched afoot and armed cap-\u00e0-pie in hauberks and strait-knit coats of mail hending drawn swords in their hands, who, seeing the merchandise landed from the ships, busied themselves therewith. Presently they sat down to rest themselves, and one of them seated herself on the settle under which Hasan had crouched: whereupon he took hold of the hem of her garment and laid it on his head and throwing himself before her, fell to kissing her hands and feet and weeping and crying, \"Thy protection! thy good-will!\" Quoth she, \"Ho, thou! Arise and stand up, ere any see thee and slay thee.\" So he came forth and springing up kissed her hands and wept and said to her, \"O my mistress, I am under thy protection!\"; adding, \"Have ruth on one who is parted from his people and wife and children, one who hath haste to rejoin them and one who adventureth life and soul for their sake! Take pity on me and be assured that therefor Paradise will be thy reward; or, an thou wilt not receive me, I beseech thee, by Allah the Great, the Concealer, to conceal my case!\" The merchants stared to see him talking with her; and she, hearing his words and beholding his humility, was moved to ruth for him; her heart inclined to him and she knew that he had not ventured himself and come to that place, save for a grave matter. So she said to him, \"O my son, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, hearten thy heart and take courage and return to thy hiding-place till the coming night, and Allah shall do as He will.\" Then she took leave of him and Hasan crept under the wooden settle as before, whilst the troops lighted flambeaux of wax mixed with aloes-wood and Nadd-perfume and crude ambergris[FN#122] and passed the night in sport and delight till the morning. At daybreak, the boats returned to the shore and the merchants busied themselves with buying and selling and the transport of the goods and gear till nightfall, whilst Hasan lay hidden beneath the settle, weeping-eyed and woeful-hearted, knowing not what was decreed to him in the secret preordainment of Allah. As he was thus, behold, the merchant-woman with whom he had taken refuge came up to him and giving him a habergeon and a helmet, a spear, a sword and a gilded girdle, bade him don them and seat himself on the settle after which she left him, for fear of the troops. So he arose and donned the mail-coat and helmet and clasped the girdle about his middle; then he slung the sword over his shoulder till it hung under his armpit, and taking the spear in his hand, sat down on that settle, whilst his tongue neglected not to name Allah Almighty and call on Him for protection.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Fifth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan received the weapons which the merchant-woman had given to him, saying, \"Sit thee upon the settle and let none wot thy case,\" he armed himself and took his seat, whilst his tongue neglected not to name Allah Almighty and to call upon Him for protection. And behold, there appeared cressets and lanthorns and flambeaux and up came the army of women. So he arose and mingling with them, became as one of them. A little before daybreak, they set out, and Hasan with them, and fared on till they came to their camp, where they dispersed each to her tent, and Hasan followed one of them and lo! it was hers for whose protection he had prayed. When she entered, she threw down her arms and doffed her hauberk and veil. So Hasan did the like and looking at his companion, saw her to be a grizzled old woman blue-eyed and big-nosed, a calamity of calamities, the foulest of all created things, with face pock-marked and eyebrows bald, gap-toothed and chap-fallen, with hair hoary, nose running and mouth slavering;[FN#123] even as saith the like of her the poet,\n\n\"In her cheek-corners nine calamities * Wone, and when shown,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   each one Jehannam is:\nHideous the face and favour foulest foul * As cheek of hog; yea,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     'tis a cesspool phiz.\"\n\nAnd indeed she was like a pied snake or a scald she-wolf. Now when the old woman looked at Hasan, she marvelled and said, \"How came this one to these lands and in which of the ships was he and how arrived he hither in safety?\" And she fell to questioning him of his case and admiring at his arrival, whereupon he fell at her feet and rubbed his face on them and wept till he fainted; and, when he recovered himself, he recited these couplets,\n\n\"When will Time grant we meet, when shall we be * Again united\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     after severance stark?\nAnd I shall win my choicest wish and view? * Blame end and Love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    abide without remark?\nWere Nile to flow as freely as my tears, * 'Twould leave no\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    region but with water-mark:\n'Twould overthrow Hijaz and Egypt-land * 'Twould deluge Syria and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    'twould drown Ir\u00e1k.\nThis, O my love, is caused by thy disdain, * Be kind and promise\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    meeting fair and fain!\"\n\nThen he took the crone's skirt and laid it on his head and fell to weeping and craving her protection. When she saw his ardency and transport and anguish and distress, her heart softened to him and she promised him her safeguard, saying, \"Have no fear whatsoever.\" Then she questioned him of his case and he told her the manner of his coming thither and all that had befallen him from beginning to end, whereat she marvelled and said, \"This that hath betide thee, methinks, never betided any save thyself and except thou hadst been vouchsafed the especial protection of Allah, thou hadst not been saved: but now, O my son, take comfort and be of good courage; thou hast nothing more to fear, for indeed thou hast won thy wish and attained thy desire, if it please the Most High!\" Thereat Hasan rejoiced with joy exceeding and she sent to summon the captains of the army to her presence, and it was the last day of the month. So they presented themselves and the old woman said to them, \"Go out and proclaim to all the troops that they come forth to-morrow at daybreak and let none tarry behind, for whoso tarryeth shall be slain.\" They replied, \"We hear and we obey,\" and going forth, made proclamation to all the host anent a review next morning, even as she bade them, after which they returned and told her of this; whereby Hasan knew that she was the Commander-in-chief of the army and the Viceregent in authority over them; and her name was Shawah\u00ed the Fascinator, entituled Umm al-Daw\u00e1hi, or Mother of Calamities.[FN#124] She ceased not to bid and forbid and Hasan doffed not off his arms from his body that day. Now when the morning broke, all the troops fared forth from their places, but the old woman came not out with them, and as soon as they were sped and the stead was clear of them, she said to Hasan, \"Draw near unto me, O my son[FN#125].\" So he drew near unto her and stood between her hands. Quoth she, \"Why and wherefore hast thou adventured thyself so boldly as to enter this land, and how came thy soul to consent to its own undoing? Tell me the truth and the whole truth and fear aught of ill come of it, for thou hast my plighted word and I am moved to compassion for thy case and pity thee and have taken thee under my protection. So, if thou tell me the truth, I will help thee to win thy wish, though it involve the undoing of souls and the destruction of bodies; and since thou hast come to seek me, no hurt shall betide thee from me, nor will I suffer any to have at thee with harm of all who be in the Islands of Wak.\" So he told her his tale from first to last, acquainting her with the matter of his wife and of the birds; how he had captured her as his prize from amongst the ten and married her and abode with her, till she had borne him two sons, and how she had taken her children and flown away with them, whenas she knew the way to the feather-dress. Brief, he concealed from her no whit of his case, from the beginning to that day. But when Shawahi heard his relation, she shook her head and said to him, \"Glory be to God who hath brought thee hither in safety and made thee hap upon me! For, hadst thou happened on any but myself, thou hadst lost thy life without winning thy wish; but the truth of thine intent and thy fond affection and the excess of thy love-longing for thy wife and yearning for thy children, these it was that have brought thee to the attainment of thine aim. Didst thou not love her and love her to distraction, thou hadst not thus imperilled thyself, and Alhamdolillah\u2014Praised be Allah\u2014for thy safety! Wherefore it behoveth us to do thy desire and conduce to thy quest, so thou mayst presently attain that thou seekest, if it be the will of Almighty Allah. But know, O my son, that thy wife is not here, but in the seventh of the Islands of Wak and between us and it is seven months' journey, night and day. From here we go to an island called the Land of Birds, wherein, for the loud crying of the birds and the flapping of their wings, one cannot hear other speak.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Sixth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman said to Hasan, \"Indeed thy wife is in the Seventh Island,[FN#126] the greatest amongst the Islands of Wak and betwixt us and it is a seven-months' journey. From here we fare for the Land of Birds, whereon for the force of their flying and the flapping of their wings, we cannot hear one other speak. Over that country we journey night and day, eleven days, after which we come forth of it to another called the Land of Ferals where, for stress of roaring of lions and howling of wolves and laughing of hyaenas and the crying of other beasts of prey we shall hear naught, and therein we travel twenty days' journey. Then we issue therefrom and come to a third country, called the Land of the J\u00e1nn, where, for stress of the crying of the Jinn and the flaming of fires and the flight of sparks and smoke from their mouths and the noise of their groaning and their arrogance in blocking up the road before us, our ears will be deafened and our eyes blinded, so that we shall neither hear nor see, nor dare any look behind him, or he perisheth: but there horseman boweth head on saddle-bow and raiseth it not for three days. After this, we abut upon a mighty mountain and a running river contiguous with the Isles of Wak, which are seven in number and the extent whereof is a whole year's journey for a well-girt horseman. And thou must know, O my son, that these troops are all virgin girls, and that the ruler over us is a woman of the Archipelago of Wak. On the bank of the river aforesaid is another mountain, called Mount Wak, and it is thus named by reason of a tree which beareth fruits like heads of the Sons of Adam.[FN#127] When the sun riseth on them, the heads cry out all, saying in their cries:\u2014 'Wak! Wak! Glory be to the Creating King, Al-Khall\u00e1k!' And when we hear their crying, we know that the sun is risen. In like manner, at sundown, the heads set up the same cry, 'Wak! Wak! Glory to Al-Khallak!' and so we know that the sun hath set. No man may abide with us or reach to us or tread our earth: and betwixt us and the abiding-place of the Queen who ruleth over us is a month's journey from this shore, all the lieges whereof are under her hand, as are also the tribes of the Jinn, Marids and Satans, while of the warlocks none kenneth the number save He who created them. Wherefore, an thou be afraid, I will send with thee one who will convey thee to the coast and there bring one who will embark thee on board a ship that bear thee to thine own land. But an thou be content to tarry with us, I will not forbid thee and thou shalt be with me in mine eye,[FN#128] till thou win thy wish, Inshallah!\" Quoth he, \"O my lady, I will never quit thee till I foregather with my wife or lose my life!\"; and quoth she, \"This is a light matter; be of good heart, for soon shalt thou come to thy desire, Allah willing; and there is no help but that I let the Queen know of thee, that she may help thee to attain thine aim.\" Hasan blessed her and kissed her head and hands, thanking her for her good deed and exceeding kindness and firm will. Then he set out with her, pondering the issue of his case and the horrors of his strangerhood; wherefore he fell a-weeping and a-wailing and recited these couplets,\n\n\"A Zephyr bloweth from the lover's site; * And thou canst view me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   in the saddest plight:\nThe Night of Union is as brilliant morn; * And black the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   Severance-day as blackest night:\nFarewelling friend is sorrow sorest sore * Parting from lover's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   merest undelight.\nI will not blame her harshness save to her, * And 'mid mankind\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   nor friend nor fere I sight:\nHow can I be consoled for loss of you? * Base censor's blame\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   shall not console my sprite!\nO thou in charms unique, unique's my love; * O peerless thou, my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   heart hath peerless might!\nWho maketh semblance that be loveth you * And dreadeth blame is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   most blame-worthy wight.\"\n\nThen the old woman bade beat the kettle-drums for departure and the army set out. Hasan fared with her, drowned in the sea of solicitude and reciting verses like those above, whilst she strave to comfort him and exhorted him to patience; but he awoke not from his tristesse and heeded not her exhortations. They journeyed thus till they came to the boundaries of the Land of Birds[FN#129] and when they entered it, it seemed to Hasan as if the world were turned topsy-turvy for the exceeding clamour. His head ached and his mind was dazed, his eyes were blinded and his ears deafened, and he feared with exceeding fear and made certain of deaths saying to himself, \"If this be the Land of Birds, how will be the Land of Beasts?\" But, when the crone hight Shawahi saw him in this plight, she laughed at him, saying, \"O my son, if this be thy case in the first island, how will it fare with thee, when thou comest to the others?\" So he prayed to Allah and humbled himself before the Lord, beseeching Him to assist him against that wherewith He had afflicted him and bring him to his wishes; and they ceased not going till they passed out of the Land of Birds and, traversing the Land of Beasts, came to the Land of the Jann which when Hasan saw, he was sore affrighted and repented him of having entered it with them. But he sought aid of Allah the Most High and fared on with them, till they were quit of the Land of the Jann and came to the river and set down their loads at the foot of a vast mountain and a lofty, and pitched their tents by the stream-bank. Then they rested and ate and drank and slept in security, for they were come to their own country. On the morrow the old woman set Hasan a couch of alabaster, inlaid with pearls and jewels and nuggets of red gold, by the river-side, and he sat down thereon, having first bound his face with a chin-kerchief, that discovered naught of him but his eyes. Then she bade proclaim among the troops that they should all assemble before her tent and put off their clothes and go down into the stream and wash; and this she did that she might parade before him all the girls, so haply his wife should be amongst them and he know her. So the whole army mustered before her and putting off their clothes, went down into the stream, and Hasan seated on his couch watched them washing their white skins and frolicking and making merry, whilst they took no heed of his inspecting them, deeming him to be of the daughters of the Kings. When he beheld them stripped of their clothes, his chord stiffened for that looking at them mother-naked he saw what was between their thighs, and that of all kinds, soft and rounded, plump and cushioned; large-lipped, perfect, redundant and ample,[FN#130] and their faces were as moons and their hair as night upon day, for that they were of the daughters of the Kings. When they were clean, they came up out of the water, stark naked, as the moon on the night of fullness and the old woman questioned Hasan of them, company by company, if his wife were among them; but, as often as she asked him of a troop, he made answer, \"She is not among these, O my lady.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventh Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman questioned Hasan of the girls, company after company, if haply his wife were among them; but as often as she asked him of a troop, he made answer, \"She is not among these, O my lady!\" Last of all, there came up a damsel, attended by ten slave-girls and thirty waiting-women, all of them high-bosomed maidens. They put off their clothes and went down into the river, where the damsel fell to riding the high horse over her women, throwing them down and ducking them. On this wise she continued for a full hour, after which all came up out of the water and sat down; and they brought her napkins[FN#131] of gold-purfled silk, with which she dried herself. Then they brought her clothes and jewels and ornaments of the handiwork of the Jinn, and she donned them and rose and walked with graceful pace among the troops, she and her maidens. When Hasan saw her, his heart was ready to fly from his breast and he said, \"Verily this girl is the likest of all folk to the bird I saw in the basin atop of the palace of my sisters the Princesses, and she lorded it over her lieges even as doth this one.\" The old woman asked, \"O Hasan, is this thy wife?\"; and he answered, \"No, by thy life, O my lady; this is not my wife, nor ever in my life have I set eyes on her; neither among all the girls I have seen in these islands is there the like of my wife nor her match for symmetry and grace and beauty and loveliness!\" Then said Shawaki, \"Describe her to me and acquaint me with all her attributes, that I may have her in my mind; for I know every girl in the Islands of Wak, being commander of the army of maids and governor over them; wherefore, an thou describe her to me, I shall know her and will contrive for thee to take her.\" Quoth he, \"My wife hath the fairest face and a form all grace; smooth is she of cheeks and high of breasts with eyes of liquid light, calves and thighs plump to sight, teeth snowy white, with dulcet speech dight; in speech soft and bland as she were a willow-wand; her gifts are a moral and lips are red as coral; her eyes wear natural Kohl-dye and her lower labia[FN#132] in softness lie. On her right cheek is a mole and on her waist, under her navel, is a sign; her face shines as the rondure of the moon in sheen, her waist is slight, her hips a heavy weight, and the water of her mouth the sick doth heal, as it were Kausar or Salsabil.\"[FN#133] Said the old woman, \"Give me an increased account of her, Allah increase thee of passion for her!\" Quoth he, \"My wife hath a face the fairest fair and oval cheeks the rarest rare; neck long and spare and eyes that Kohl wear; her side face shows the Anemones of Nu'uman, her mouth is like a seal of cornelian and flashing teeth that lure and stand one in stead of cup and ewer. She is cast in the mould of pleasantness and between her thighs is the throne of the Caliphate, there is no such sanctuary among the Holy Places; as saith in its praise the poet,\n\n\"The name of what drave me distraught * Hath letters renowned\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  among men:\nA four into five multiplied * And a multiplied six into\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  ten.[FN#134]\"\n\nThen Hasan wept and chanted the following Maww\u00e1l,[FN#135]\n\n\"O heart, an lover false thee, shun the parting bane * Nor to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  forgetfulness thy thoughts constrain:\nBe patient; thou shalt bury all thy foes; * Allah ne'er falseth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  man of patience fain.\"\n\nAnd this also,\n\n\"An wouldst be life,long safe, vaunt not delight; * Never\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   despair, nor wone o'erjoyed in sprite!\nForbear, rejoice not, mourn not o'er thy plight * And in ill day\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   'Have not we oped?'\u2014recite.\"[FN#136]\n\nThereupon the old woman bowed her head groundwards awhile, then, raising it, said, \"Laud be to the Lord, the Mighty of Award! Indeed I am afflicted with thee, O Hasan! Would Heaven I had never known thee! This woman, whom thou describest to me as thy wife, I know by description and I know her to be none other than the eldest daughter of the Supreme King, she who ruleth over all the Islands of Wak. So open both eyes and consider thy case; and if thou be asleep, awake; for, if this woman be indeed thy wife, it is impossible for thee ever to obtain her, and though thou come to her, yet couldst thou not avail to her possession, since between thee and her the distance is as that between earth and Heaven. Wherefore, O my son, return presently and cast not thyself into destruction nor cast me with thee; for meseemeth thou hast no lot in her; so return whence thou camest lest our lives be lost.\" And she feared for herself and for him. When Hasan heard her words, he wept till he fainted and she left not sprinkling water on his face, till he came to himself, when he continued to weep, so that he drenched his dress with tears, for the much cark and care and chagrin which betided him by reason of her words. And indeed he despaired of life and said to the old woman, \"O my lady, and how shall I go back, after having come hither? Verily, I thought not thou wouldst forsake me nor fail of the winning of my wish, especially as thou art the Commander-in-chief of the army of the girls.\" Answered Shawahl, \"O my son, I doubted not but thy wife was a maid of the maids, and had I known she was the King's daughter, I had not suffered thee to come hither nor had I shown the troops to thee, for all the love I bear thee. But now, O my son, thou hast seen all the girls naked; so tell me which of them pleaseth thee and I will give her to thee, in lieu of thy wife, and do thou put it that thy wife and children are dead and take her and return to thine own country in safety, ere thou fall into the King's hand and I have no means of delivering thee. So, Allah upon thee, O my son, hearken unto me. Choose thyself one of these damsels, in the stead of yonder woman, and return presently to thy country in safety and cause me not quaff the cup of thine anguish! For, by Allah, thou hast cast thyself into affliction sore and peril galore, wherefrom none may avail to deliver thee evermore!\" But Hasan hung down his head and wept with long weeping and recited these couplets,\n\n\"'Blame not!' said I to all who blam\u00e8d me; * 'Mine eye-lids\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   naught but tears were made to dree:'\nThe tears that brim these orbs have overflowed * My checks, for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    lovers and love's cruelty.\nLeave me to love though waste this form of me! * For I of Love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    adore the insanity:\nAnd, Oh my dearling, passion grows on me * For you\u2014and you, why\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  grudge me clemency?\nYou wronged me after swearing troth and plight, * Falsed my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  companionship and turned to flee:\nAnd cup of humbling for your rigours sore * Ye made me drain what\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     day departed ye:\nThen melt, O heart, with longing for their sight * And, O mine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    eyes, with crowns of tears be dight.\"\n\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman said to Hasan, \"By Allah, O my son, hearken to my words! Choose thee one of these girls in lieu of thy wife and presently return to thy country in safety,\" he hung down his head and recited the couplets quoted above. Then he wept till he swooned away and Shawahl sprinkled water on his face till he revived, when she addressed him, \"O my lord, I have no shift left; because if I carry thee to the city thy life is lost and mine also: for, when the Queen cometh to know of this, she will blame me for admitting thee into her lands and islands, whereto none of Adam's sons hath access, and will slay me for bringing thee with me and for suffering mortal to look upon the virgins seen by thee in the sea, whom ne'er touched male, neither approached mate.\" And Hasan sware that he had never looked on them with evil of eye. She resumed, \"O my son, hearken to me and return to thy country and I will give thee wealth and treasures and things of price, such as shall suffice thee for all the women in the world. Moreover, I will give thee a girl of the best of them, so lend an ear to my words and return presently and imperil not thyself; indeed I counsel thee with good counsel.\" But he wept and rubbed both cheeks against her feet, saying, \"O my lady and mistress and coolth of mine eyes, how can I turn back now that I have made my way hither, without the sight of those I desire, and now that I have come near the beloved's site, hoping for meeting forthright, so haply there may be a portion in reunion to my plight?\" And he improvised these couplets,\n\n\"O Kings of beauty, grace to prisoner ta'en * Of eyelids fit to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   rule the Chosro\u00ebs' reign:\nYe pass the wafts of musk in perfumed breath; * Your cheeks the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    charms of blooming rose disdain.\nThe softest Zephyr breathes where pitch ye camp * And thence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    far-scattered sweetness fills the plain:\nCensor of me, leave blame and stint advice! * Thou bringest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    wearying words and wisdom vain:\nWhy heat my passion with this flame and up- * braid me when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    naught thou knowest of its bane?\nCaptured me eyes with passion maladifs, * And overthrew me with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   Love's might and main:\nI scatter tears the while I scatter verse; * You are my theme for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   rhyme and prosy strain.\nMelted my vitals glow of rosy cheeks * And in the Laz\u00e1-lowe my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    heart is lain:\nTell me, an I leave to discourse of you, * What speech my breast\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    shall broaden?\nTell me deign!

Then the old woman carried him into the city and lodged him in a place apart, lest any should come to know of him and tell the Queen of him and she should slay him and slay her who had brought him thither. Moreover, she served him herself and strave to put him in fear of the awful majesty of the Supreme King, his wife's father; whilst he wept before her and said, \"O my fady, I choose death for myself and loathe this worldly life, if I foregather not with my wife and children: I have set my existence on the venture and will either attain my aim or die.\" So the old woman fell to pondering the means of bringing him and his wife together and casting about how to do in the case of this unhappy one, who had thrown himself into destruction and would not be diverted from his purpose by fear or aught else; for, indeed he reeked not of his life and the sayer of bywords saith, \"Lover in nowise hearkeneth he to the speech of the man who is fancy-free.\" Now the name of the Queen of the island wherein they were was N\u00far al-Hud\u00e0,[FN#137] eldest daughter of the Supreme King, and she had six virgin sisters, abiding with their father, whose capital and court were in the chief city of that region and who had made her ruler over all the lands and islands of Wak. So when the ancient dame saw Hasan on fire with yearning after his wife and children, she rose up and repaired to the palace and going in to Queen Nur al-Huda kissed ground before her; for she had a claim on her favour because she had reared the King's daughters one and all and had authority over each and every of them and was high in honour and consideration with them and with the King. Nur al-Huda rose to her as she entered and embracing her, seated her by her side and asked her of her journey. She answered, \"By Allah, O my lady 'twas a blessed journey and I have brought thee a gift which I will presently present to thee,\" adding, \"O my daughter, O Queen of the age and the time, I have a favour to crave of thee and I fain would discover it to thee, that thou mayst help me to accomplish it, and but for my confidence that thou wilt not gainsay me therein, I would not expose it to thee.\" Asked the Queen, \"And what is thy need? Expound it to me, and I will accomplish it to thee, for I and my kingdom and troops are all at thy commandment and disposition.\" Therewithal the old woman quivered as quivereth the reed on a day when the storm-wind is abroad and saying in herself, \"O[FN#138] Protector, protect me from the Queen's mischief!\"[FN#139] fell down before her and acquainted her with Hasan's case, saying, \"O my lady, a man, who had hidden himself under my wooden settle on the seashore, sought my protection; so I took him under my safeguard and carried him with me among the army of girls armed and accoutred so that none might know him, and brought him into the city; and indeed I have striven to affright him with thy fierceness, giving him to know of thy power and prowess; but, as often as I threatened him, he weepeth and reciteth verses and sayeth, 'Needs must I have my wife and children or die, and I will not return to my country without them.' And indeed he hath adventured himself and come to the Islands of Wak, and never in all my days saw I mortal heartier of heart than he or doughtier of derring-do, save that love hath mastered him to the utmost of mastery.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman related to Queen Nur al-Huda the adventure of Hasan, ending with, \"Never I saw any one heartier of heart than he save that love hath mastered him to the utmost of mastery,\" the Queen, after lending an attentive ear and comprehending the case, waxed wroth at her with exceeding wrath and bowed her head awhile groundwards; then, raising it, she looked at Shawahi and said to her, \"O ill-omened beldam, art thou come to such a pass of lewdness that thou carriest males, men, with thee into the Islands of Wak and bringest them into me, unfearing of my mischief? Who hath foregone thee with this fashion, that thou shouldst do thus? By the head of the King, but for thy claim on me for fosterage and service, I would forthwith do both him and thee to die the foulest of deaths, that travellers might take warning by thee, O accursed, lest any other do the like of this outrageous deed thou hast done, which none durst hitherto! But go and bring him hither forthright, that I may see him; or I will strike off thy head, O accursed.\" So the old woman went out from her, confounded, unknowing whither she went and saying, \"All this calamity hath Allah driven upon me from this Queen because of Hasan!\" and going in to him, said, \"Rise, speak with the Queen, O wight whose last hour is at hand!\" So he rose and went with her, whilst his tongue ceased not to call upon Almighty Allah and say, \"O my God, be gracious to me in Thy decrees and deliver me from this Thine affliction!\"[FN#140] And Shawahi went with him charging him by the way how he should speak with the Queen. When he stood before Nur al-Huda, he found that she had donned the chinveil[FN#141]; so he kissed ground before her and saluted her with the salam, improvising these two couplets,\n\n\"God make thy glory last in joy of life; * Allah confirm the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   boons he deigned bestow:\nThy grace and grandeur may our Lord increase * And aye Th'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Almighty aid thee o'er thy foe!\"\n\nWhen he ended his verse Nur al-Huda bade the old woman ask him questions before her, that she might hear his answers: so she said to him, \"The Queen returneth thy salam-greeting and saith to thee, 'What is thy name and that of thy country, and what are the names of thy wife and children, on whose account thou art come hither?\"' Quoth he, and indeed he had made firm his heart and destiny aided him, \"O Queen of the age and tide and peerless jewel of the epoch and the time, my name is Hasan the fullfilled of sorrow, and my native city is Bassorah. I know not the name of my wife[FN#142] but my children's names are N\u00e1sir and Mans\u00far.\" When the Queen heard his reply and his provenance, she bespoke him herself and said, \"And whence took she her children?\" He replied, \"O Queen, she took them from the city of Baghdad and the palace of the Caliphate.\" Quoth Nur al-Huda, \"And did she say naught to thee at the time she flew away?;\" and quoth he, \"Yes; she said to my mother, 'Whenas thy son cometh to thee and the nights of severance upon him longsome shall be and he craveth meeting and reunion to see, and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him come in the Islands of Wak to me.'\" Whereupon Queen Nur al-Huda shook her head and said to him, \"Had she not desired thee she had not said to thy mother this say, and had she not yearned for reunion with thee, never had she bidden thee to her stead nor acquainted thee with her abiding-place.\" Rejoined Hasan, \"O mistress of Kings and asylum of prince and pauper, whatso happened I have told thee and have concealed naught thereof, and I take refuge from evil with Allah and with thee; wherefore oppress me not, but have compassion on me and earn recompense and requital for me in the world to come, and aid me to regain my wife and children. Grant me my urgent need and cool mine eyes with my children and help me to the sight of them.\" Then he wept and wailed and lamenting his lot recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Yea, I will laud thee while the ring-dove moans, * Though fail\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    my wish of due and lawful scope:\nNe'er was I whirled in bliss and joys gone by * Wherein I found\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    thee not both root and rope.\"[FN#143]\n\nThe Queen shook her head and bowed it in thought a long time; then, raising it, she said to Hasan (and indeed she was wroth), \"I have ruth on thee and am resolved to show thee in review all the girls in the city and in the provinces of my island; and in case thou know thy wife, I will deliver her to thee; but, an thou know her not and know not her place, I will put thee to death and crucify thee over the old woman's door.\" Replied Hasan, \"I accept this from thee, O Queen of the Age, and am content to submit to this thy condition. There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" And he recited these couplets,\n\n\"You've roused my desire and remain at rest,\u2014 * Waked my wounded\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    lids while you slept with zest.\nAnd ye made me a vow ye would not hang back * But your guile when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    you chained me waxt manifest.\nI loved you in childhood unknowing Love; * Then slay me not who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     am sore opprest.\nFear ye not from Allah when slaying a friend * Who gazeth on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    stars when folk sleep their best?\nBy Allah, my kinsmen, indite on my tomb * 'This man was the slave\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     of Love's harshest best!'\nHaps a noble youth, like me Love's own thrall, * When he sees my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     grave on my name shall call.\"\n\nThen Queen Nur al-Huda commanded that not a girl should abide in the city but should come up to the palace and pass in review before Hasan and moreover she bade Shawahi go down in person and bring them up herself. Accordingly all the maidens in the city presented themselves before the Queen, who caused them to go in to Hasan, hundred after hundred, till there was no girl left in the place, but she had shown her to him; yet he saw not his wife amongst them. Then said she to him, \"Seest thou her amongst these?\"; and he replied, \"By thy life, O Queen, she is not amongst them.\" With this she was sore enraged against him and said to the old woman, \"Go in and bring out all who are in the palace and show them to him.\" So she displayed to him every one of the palace-girls, but he saw not his wife among them and said to the Queen, \"By the life of thy head, O Queen, she is not among these.\" Whereat the Queen was wroth and cried out at those around her, saying, \"Take him and hale him along, face to earth, and cut off his head, least any adventure himself after him and intrude upon us in our country and spy out our estate by thus treading the soil of our islands.\" So they threw him down on his face and dragged him along; then, covering his eyes with his skirt, stood at his head with bared brands awaiting royal permission. Thereupon Shawahi came forward and kissing the ground before the Queen, took the hem of her garment and laid it on her head, saying, \"O Queen, by my claim for fosterage, be not hasty with him, more by token of thy knowledge that this poor wretch is a stranger, who hath adventured himself and suffered what none ever suffered before him, and Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty,) preserved him from death, for that his life was ordained to be long. He heard of thine equity and entered thy city and guarded site;[FN#144] wherefore, if thou put him to death, the report will dispread abroad of thee, by means of the travellers, that thou hatest strangers and slayest them. He is in any case at thy mercy and the slain of thy sword, if his wife be not found in thy dominions; and whensoever thou desireth his presence, I can bring him back to thee. Moreover, in very sooth I took him under my protection only of my trust in thy magnanimity through my claim on thee for fosterage, so that I engaged to him that thou wouldst bring him to his desire, for my knowledge of thy justice and quality of mercy. But for this, I had not brought him into thy kingdom; for I said to myself: 'The Queen will take pleasure in looking upon him, and hearing him speak his verses and his sweet discourse and eloquent which is like unto pearls strung on string.' Moreover, he hath entered our land and eaten of our meat; wherefore he hath a claim upon us.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Tenth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Nur al-Huda bade her pages seize Hasan and smite his neck, the old woman, Shawahi, began to reason with her and say, \"Verily he hath entered our land and eaten of our meat, wherefore he hath a claim upon us, the more especially since I promised him to bring him in company with thee; and thou knowest that, parting is a grievous ill and severance hath power to kill, especially separation from children. Now he hath seen all our women, save only thyself; so do thou show him thy face?\" The Queen smiled and said, \"How can he be my husband and have had children by me, that I should show him my face?\" Then she made them bring Hasan before her and when he stood in the presence, she unveiled her face, which when he saw, he cried out with a great cry and fell down fainting. The old woman ceased not to tend him, till he came to himself and as soon as he revived he recited these couplets,\n\n\"O breeze that blowest from the land Irak * And from their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     corners whoso cry 'Wak!

Then he swooned away again and the old woman ceased not to tend him till he revived, when she asked him what ailed him and he answered, \"In very sooth this Queen is either my wife or else the likest of all folk to my wife.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eleventh Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman asked Hasan what ailed him, he answered, \"In very sooth this Queen is either my wife or else the likest of all folk to my wife.\" Quoth Nur al-Huda to the old woman, \"Woe to thee, O nurse! This stranger is either Jinn-mad or out of his mind, for he stareth me in the face with wide eyes and saith I am his wife.\" Quoth the old woman, \"O Queen, indeed he is excusable; so blame him not, for the saying saith, 'For the lovesick is no remedy and alike are the madman and he.'\" And Hasan wept with sore weeping and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"I sight their track and pine for longing love; * And o'er their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    homesteads weep I and I yearn:\nAnd I pray Heaven who will'ed we should part, * Will deign to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    grant us boon of safe return.\"\n\nThen said Hasan to the Queen once more, \"By Allah, thou art not my wife, but thou art the likest of all folk to her!\" Hereupon Nur al-Huda laughed till she fell backwards and rolled round on her side.[FN#145] Then she said to him, \"O my friend, take thy time and observe me attentively: answer me at thy leisure what I shall ask thee and put away from thee insanity and perplexity and inadvertency for relief is at hand.\" Answered Hasan, \"O mistress of Kings and asylum of all princes and paupers, when I looked upon thee, I was distracted, seeing thee to be either my wife or the likest of all folk to her; but now ask me whatso thou wilt.\" Quoth she, \"What is it in thy wife that resembleth me?\"; and quoth he, \"O my lady, all that is in thee of beauty and loveliness, elegance and amorous grace, such as the symmetry of thy shape and the sweetness of thy speech and the blushing of thy cheeks and the jutting of thy breasts and so forth, all resembleth her and thou art her very self in thy faculty of parlance and the fairness of thy favour and the brilliancy of thy brow.\"[FN#146] When the Queen heard this, she smiled and gloried in her beauty and loveliness and her cheeks reddened and her eyes wantoned; then she turned to Shawahi Umm Dawahi and said to her, \"O my mother, carry him back to the place where he tarried with thee and tend him thyself, till I examine into his affair; for, an he be indeed a man of manliness and mindful of friendship and love and affection, it behoveth we help him to win his wish, more by token that he hath sojourned in our country and eaten of our victual, not to speak of the hardships of travel he hath suffered and the travail and horrors he hath undergone. But, when thou hast brought him to thy house, commend him to the care of thy dependents and return to me in all haste; and Allah Almighty willing![FN#147] all shall be well.\" Thereupon Shawahi carried him back to her lodging and charged her handmaids and servants and suite wait upon him and bring him all he needed nor fail in what was his due. Then she returned to Queen Nur al-Huda, who bade her don her arms and set out, taking with her a thousand doughty horsemen. So she obeyed and donned her war-gear and having collected the thousand riders reported them ready to the Queen, who bade her march upon the city of the Supreme King, her father, there to alight at the abode of her youngest sister, Man\u00e1r al-San\u00e1[FN#148] and say to her, \"Clothe thy two sons in the coats of mail which their aunt hath made them and send them to her; for she longeth for them.\" Moreover the Queen charged her keep Hasan's affair secret and say to Manar al-Sana, after securing her children, \"Thy sister inviteth thee to visit her.\" \"Then,\" she continued, \"bring the children to me in haste and let her follow at her leisure. Do thou come by a road other than her road and journey night and day and beware of discovering this matter to any. And I swear by all manner oaths that, if my sister prove to be his wife and it appear that her children are his, I will not hinder him from taking her and them and departing with them to his own country.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twelfth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Oueen said, \"I swear by Allah and by all manner of oaths that if she prove to be his wife, I will not hinder him from taking her but will aid him thereto and eke to departing with them to his mother-land.\" And the old woman put faith in her words, knowing not what she purposed in her mind, for the wicked Jezebel had resolved that if she were not his wife she would slay him; but if the children resembled him, she would believe him. The Queen resumed, \"O my mother, an my thought tell me true, my sister Manar al-Sana is his wife, but Allah alone is All-knowing! seeing that these traits of surpassing beauty and excelling grace, of which he spoke, are found in none except my sisters and especially in the youngest.\" The old woman kissed her hand and returning to Hasan, told him what the Queen had said, whereat he was like to fly for joy and coming up to her, kissed her head. Quoth she, \"O my son, kiss not my head, but kiss me on the mouth and be this kiss by way of sweetmeat for thy salvation.[FN#149] Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and grudge not to kiss my mouth, for I and only I was the means of thy foregathering with her. So take comfort, and hearten thy heart and broaden thy breast and gladden thy glance and console thy soul for, Allah willing, thy desire shall be accomplished at my hand.\" So saying, she bade him farewell and departed, whilst he recited these two couplets,\n\n\"Witnesses unto love of thee I've four; * And wants each case two\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    witnesses; no more!\nA heart aye fluttering, limbs that ever quake, * A wasted frame\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   and tongue that speech forswore.\"\n\nAnd also these two,\n\n\"Two things there be, an blood-tears thereover * Wept eyes till\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   not one trace thou couldst discover,\nEyes ne'er could pay the tithe to them is due * The prime of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   youth and severance from lover.\"\n\nThen the old woman armed herself and, taking with her a thousand weaponed horsemen, set out and journeyed till she came to the island and the city where dwelt the Lady Manar al-Sana and between which and that of her sister Queen Nur al-Huda was three days' journey. When Shawahi reached the city, she went in to the Princess and saluting her, gave her her sister's salam and acquainted her with the Queen's longing for her and her children and that she reproached her for not visiting her. Quoth Manar al-Sana, \"Verily, I am beholden to my sister and have failed of my duty to her in not visiting her, but I will do so forthright.\" Then she bade pitch her tents without the city and took with her for her sister a suitable present of rare things. Presently, the King her father looked out of a window of his palace, and seeing the tents pitched by the road, asked of them, and they answered him, \"The Princess Manar al-Sana hath pitched her tents by the way-side, being minded to visit her sister Queen Nur al-Huda.\" When the King heard this, he equipped troops to escort her to her sister and brought out to her from his treasuries meat and drink and monies and jewels and rarities which beggar description. Now the King had seven daughters, all sisters-german by one mother and father except the youngest: the eldest was called N\u00far al-Hud\u00e0, the second Najm al-Sab\u00e1h, the third Shams al-Zuh\u00e0, the fourth Shajarat al-Durr, the fifth K\u00fat al-Kul\u00fab, the sixth Sharaf al-Ban\u00e1t and the youngest Manar al-Sana, Hasan's wife, who was their sister by the father's side only.[FN#150] Anon the old woman again presented herself and kissed ground before the Princess, who said to her, \"Hast thou any need, O my mother?\" Quoth Shawahi, \"Thy sister, Queen Nur al-Huda, biddeth thee clothe thy sons in the two habergeons which she fashioned for them and send them to her by me, and I will take them and forego thee with them and be the harbinger of glad tidings and the announcer of thy coming to her.\" When the Princess heard these words, her colour changed and she bowed her head a long while, after which she shook it and looking up, said to the old woman, \"O my mother, my vitals tremble and my heart fluttereth when thou namest my children; for, from the time of their birth none hath looked on their faces either Jinn or man, male or female, and I am jealous for them of the zephyr when it breatheth in the night.\" Exclaimed the old woman, \"What words are these, O my lady? Dost thou fear for them from thy sister?\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Thirteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman said to the Princess Manar al-Sana, \"What words be these, O my lady? Dost thou fear for them from thy sister? Allah safeguard thy reason! Thou mayst not cross the Queen's majesty in this matter, for she would be wroth with thee. However, O my lady, the children are young, and thou art excusable in fearing for them, for those that love well are wont to deem ill: but, O my daughter, thou knowest my tenderness and mine affection for thee and thy children, for indeed I reared thee before them. I will take them in my charge and make my cheek their pillow and open my heart and set them within, nor is it needful to charge me with care of them in the like of this case; so be of cheerful heart and tearless eye and send them to her, for, at the most, I shall but precede thee with them a day or at most two days.\" And she ceased not to urge her, till she gave way, fearing her sister's fury and unknowing what lurked for her in the dark future, and consented to send them with the old woman. So she called them and bathed them and equipped them and changed their apparel. Then she clad them in the two little coats of mail and delivered them to Shawahi, who took them and sped on with them like a bird, by another road than that by which their mother should travel, even as the Queen had charged her; nor did she cease to fare on with all diligence, being fearful for them, till she came in sight of Nur al-Huda's city, when she crossed the river and entering the town, carried them in to their aunt. The Queen rejoiced at their sight and embraced them, and pressed them to her breast; after which she seated them, one upon the right thigh and the other upon the left; and turning round said to the old woman, \"Fetch me Hasan forthright, for I have granted him my safeguard and have spared him from my sabre and he hath sought asylum in my house and taken up his abode in my courts, after having endured hardships and horrors and passed through all manner mortal risks, each terribler than other; yet hitherto is he not safe from drinking the cup of death and from cutting off his breath.\" \u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Fourteenth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Nur al-Huda bade the old woman bring Hasan she said, \"Verily he hath endured hardships and horrors and passed through all manner mortal risks each terribler than other; yet hitherto he is not safe from death and from the cutting off of his breath.\" Replied Shawahi, \"An I bring him to thee, wilt thou reunite him with these his children? Or, if they prove not his, wilt thou pardon him and restore him to his own country?\" Hearing these her words the Queen waxed exceeding wroth and cried to her, \"Fie upon thee, O ill-omened old woman! How long wilt thou false us in the matter of this strange man who hath dared to intrude himself upon us and hath lifted our veil and pried into our conditions? Say me: thinkest thou that he shall come to our land and look upon our faces and betray our honour, and after return in safety to his own country and expose our affairs to his people, wherefore our report will be bruited abroad among all the Kings of the quarters of the earth and the merchants will journey bearing tidings of us in all directions, saying, 'A mortal entered the Isles of Wak and traversed the Land of the Jinn and the lands of the Wild Beasts and the Islands of Birds and set foot in the country of the Warlocks and the Enchanters and returned in safety?' This shall never be; no, never; and I swear by Him who made the Heavens and builded them; yea, by Him who dispread the earth and smoothed it, and who created all creatures and counted them, that, an they be not his children, I will assuredly slay him and strike his neck with mine own hand!\" Then she cried out at the old woman, who fell down for fear; and set upon her the Chamberlain and twenty Mamelukes, saying, \"Go with this crone and fetch me in haste the youth who is in her house.\" So they dragged Shawahi along, yellow with fright and with side-muscles quivering, till they came to her house, where she went in to Hasan, who rose to her and kissed her hands and saluted her. She returned not his salam, but said to him, \"Come; speak the Queen. Did I not say to thee: 'Return presently to thine own country and I will give thee that to which no mortal may avail?' And did I forbid thee from all this? But thou wouldst not obey me nor listen to my words; nay, thou rejectedst my counsel and chosest to bring destruction on me and on thyself. Up, then, and take that which thou hast chosen; for death is near hand. Arise: speak with yonder vile harlot[FN#151] and tyrant that she is!\" So Hasan arose, broken-spirited, heavy, hearted, and full of fear, and crying, \"O Preserver, preserve Thou me! O my God, be gracious to me in that which Thou hast decreed to me of Thine affliction and protect me, O Thou the most Merciful of the Mercifuls!\" Then, despairing of his life, he followed the twenty Mamelukes, the Chamberlain and the crone to the Queen's presence, where he found his two sons Nasir and Mansur sitting in her lap, whilst she played and made merry with them. As soon as his eyes fell on them, he knew them and crying a great cry fell down a-fainting for excess of joy at the sight of his children.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Fifteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan's eyes fell upon his two sons, he knew them both and crying a great cry fell down a-fainting. They also knew him[FN#152] and natural affection moved them so that they freed themselves from the Queen's lap and fell upon Hasan, and Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty,) made them speak and say to him, \"O our father!\" Whereupon the old woman and all who were present wept for pity and tenderness over them and said, \"Praised be Allah, who hath reunited you with your Sire!\" Presently, Hasan came to himself and embracing his children, wept till again he swooned away, and when he revived, he recited these verses,\n\n\"By rights of you, this heart of mine could ne'er aby * Severance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   from you albeit Union death imply!\nYour phantom saith to me, 'A-morrow we shall meet!' * Shall I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  despite the foe the morrow-day espy?\nBy rights of you I swear, my lords, that since the day * Of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  severance ne'er the sweets of lips enjoy\u00e8d I!\nAn Allah bade me perish for the love of you, * Mid greatest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  martyrs for your love I lief will die.\nOft a gazelle doth make my heart her browsing stead * The while\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    her form of flesh like sleep eludes mine eye:\nIf in the lists of Law my bloodshed she deny, * Prove it two\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    witnesses those cheeks of ruddy dye.\"\n\nWhen Nur al-Huda was assured that the little ones were indeed Hasan's children and that her sister, the Princess Manar al-Sana, was his wife, of whom he was come in quest, she was wroth against her with wrath beyond measure.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Sixteenth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nur al-Huda was certified that the little ones were Hasan's children and that her sister Manar al-Sana was his wife of whom he had come in quest, she raged with exceeding rage, too great to be assuaged and screamed in Hasan's face and reviled him and kicked him in the breast, so that he fell on his back in a swoon. Then she cried out at him, saying, \"Arise! fly for thy life. But that I swore that no evil should betide thee from me, should thy tale prove true, I would slay thee with mine own hand forthright!\" And she cried out at the old woman, who fell on her face for fear, and said to her, \"By Allah, but that I am loath to break the oath that I swore, I would put both thee and him to death after the foulest fashion!\"; presently adding, \"Arise, go out from before me in safety and return to thine own country, for I swear by my fortune, if ever mine eye espy thee or if any bring thee in to me after this, I will smite off thy head and that of whoso bringeth thee!\" Then she cried out to her officers, saying, \"Put him out from before me!\" So they thrust him out, and when he came to himself, he recited these couplets,\n\n\"You're far, yet to my heart you're nearest near; * Absent yet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    present in my sprite you appear:\nBy Allah, ne'er to other I've inclined * But tyranny of Time in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    patience bear!\nNights pass while still I love you and they end, * And burns my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    breast with flames of fell Sa'ir;[FN#153]\nI was a youth who parting for an hour * Bore not, then what of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    months that make a year?\nJealous am I of breeze-breath fanning thee; * Yea jealous-mad of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    fair soft-sided fere!\"\n\nThen he once more fell down in a swoon, and when he came to himself, he found himself without the palace whither they had dragged him on his face; so he rose, stumbling over his skirts and hardly crediting his escape from Nur al-Huda. Now this was grievous to Shawahi; but she dared not remonstrate with the Queen by reason of the violence of her wrath. And forthright Hasan went forth, distracted and knowing not whence to come or whither to go; the world, for all its wideness, was straitened upon him and he found none to speak a kind word with him and comfort him, nor any to whom he might resort for counsel or to apply for refuge; wherefore he made sure of death for that he could not journey to his own country and knew none to travel with him, neither wist he the way thither nor might he pass through the Wady of the Jann and the Land of Beasts and the Islands of Birds. So giving himself up for lost he bewept himself, till he fainted, and when he revived, he bethought him of his children and his wife and of that might befal her with her sister, repenting him of having come to those countries and of having hearkened to none, and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Suffer mine eye-babes weep lost of love and tears express: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   Rare is my solace and increases my distress:\nThe cup of Severance-chances to the dregs I've drained; * Who is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   the man to bear love-loss with manliness?\nYe spread the Carpet of Disgrace[FN#154] betwixt us twain; * Ah,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   when shalt be uprolled, O Carpet of Disgrace?\nI watched the while you slept; and if you deemed that I * Forgot\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   your love I but forget forgetfulness:\nWoe's me! indeed my heart is pining for the love * Of you, the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     only leaches who can cure my case:\nSee ye not what befel me from your fell disdain? * Debased am I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     before the low and high no less.\nI hid my love of you but longing laid it bare, * And burns my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     heart wi' fire of passion's sorest stress:\nAh! deign have pity on my piteous case, for I * Have kept our\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     troth in secresy and patent place!\nWould Heaven I wot shall Time e'er deign us twain rejoin! * You\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     are my heart's desire, my sprite's sole happiness:\nMy vitals bear the Severance-wound: would Heaven that you * With\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     tidings from your camp would deign my soul to bless!\"\n\nThen he went on, till he came without the city, where he found the river, and walked along its bank, knowing not whither he went. Such was Hasan's case; but as regards his wife Manar al-Sana, as she was about to carry out her purpose and to set out, on the second day after the departure of the old woman with her children, behold, there came in to her one of the chamberlains of the King her sire, and kissed ground between his hands,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Seventeenth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Manar al-Sana was about to set out upon the journey, behold, a chamberlain of the King, her sire, came in to her and kissing the ground before her, said, \"O Princess, the Supreme King, thy father saluteth thee and biddeth thee to him.\" So she rose and accompanied the chamberlain to learn what was required by her father, who seated her by his side on the couch, and said to her, \"O my daughter, know that I have this night had a dream which maketh me fear for thee and that long sorrow will betide thee from this thy journey.\" Quoth she, \"How so, O my father, and what didst thou see in thy dream?\" and quoth he, \"I dreamt that I entered a hidden hoard, wherein was great store of monies, of jewels, of jacinths and of other riches; but 'twas as if naught pleased me of all this treasure and jewelry save seven bezels, which were the finest things there. I chose out one of the seven jewels, for it was the smallest, finest and most lustrous of them and its water pleased me; so I took it in my hand-palm and fared forth of the treasury. When I came without the door, I opened my hand, rejoicing, and turned over the jewel, when, behold, there swooped down on me out of the welkin a strange bird from a far land (for it was not of the birds of our country) and, snatching it from my hand, returned with it whence it came.[FN#155] Whereupon sorrow and concern and sore vexation overcame me and my exceeding chagrin so troubled me that I awoke, mourning and lamenting for the loss of the jewel. At once on awaking I summoned the interpreters and expounders of dreams and declared to them my dream,[FN#156] and they said to me: 'Thou hast seven daughters, the youngest of whom thou wilt lose, and she will be taken from thee perforce, without thy will.' Now thou, O my girl, art the youngest and dearest of my daughters and the most affectionate of them to me, and look'ye thou art about to journey to thy sister, and I know not what may befal thee from her; so go thou not; but return to thy palace.\" But when the Princess heard her father's words, her heart fluttered and she feared for her children and bent earthwards her head awhile: then she raised it and said to her sire, \"O King, Queen Nur al-Huda hath made ready for me an entertainment and awaiteth my coming to her, hour by hour. These four years she hath not seen me and if I delay to visit her, she will be wroth with me. The utmost of my stay with her shall be a month and then I will return to thee. Besides, who is the mortal who can travel our land and make his way to the Islands of Wak? Who can gain access to the White Country and the Black Mountain and come to the Land of Camphor and the Castle of Crystal, and how shall he traverse the Island of Birds and the Wady of Wild Beasts and the Valley of the Jann and enter our Islands? If any stranger came hither, he would be drowned in the seas of destruction: so be of good cheer and eyes without a tear anent my journey; for none may avail to tread our earth.\" And she ceased not to persuade him, till he deigned give her leave to depart.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Eighteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Princess ceased not to persuade him till he deigned give her leave to depart, and bade a thousand horse escort her to the river and abide there, till she entered her sister's city and palace and returned to them, when they should take her and carry her back to him. Moreover, he charged her tarry with her sister but two days and return to him in haste; and she answered, \"Hearing and obedience.\" Then rising up she went forth and he with her and farewelled her. Now his words had sunken deep into her heart and she feared for her children; but it availeth not to fortify herself by any device against the onset of Destiny. So she set out and fared on diligently three days, till she came to the river and pitched her tents on its bank. Then she crossed the stream, with some of her counsellors, pages and suite and, going up to the city and the palace, went in to Queen Nur al-Huda, with whom she found her children who ran to her weeping and crying out, \"O our father!\" At this, the tears railed from her eyes and she wept; then she strained them to her bosom, saying, \"What! Have you seen your sire at this time? Would the hour had never been, in which I left him! If I knew him to be in the house of the world, I would carry you to him.\" Then she bemoaned herself and her husband and her children weeping and reciting these couplets,\n\n\"My friends, despight this distance and this cruelty, * I pine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    for you, incline to you where'er you be.\nMy glance for ever turns toward your hearth and home * And mourns\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    my heart the bygone days you woned with me,\nHow many a night foregathered we withouten fear * One loving,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   other faithful ever, fain and free!\"\n\nWhen her sister saw her fold her children to her bosom, saying, \"'Tis I who have done thus with myself and my children and have ruined my own house!\" she saluted her not, but said to her, \"O whore, whence haddest thou these children? Say, hast thou married unbeknown to thy sire or hast thou committed fornication?[FN#157] An thou have played the piece, it behoveth thou be exemplarily punished; and if thou have married sans our knowledge, why didst thou abandon thy husband and separate thy sons from thy sire and bring them hither?\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Nineteenth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Nur al-Huda, the Queen, to her sister Manar al-Sana, the Princess, \"An thou have married sans our knowledge, why didst thou abandon thy husband and separate thy sons from their sire and bring them to our land? Thou hast hidden thy children from us. Thinkest thou we know not of this? Allah Almighty, He who is cognisant of the concealed, hath made known to us thy case and revealed thy condition and bared thy nakedness.\" Then she bade her guards seize her and pinion her elbows and shackle her with shackles of iron. So they did as she commanded and she beat her with a grievous beating, so that her skin was torn, and hanged her up by the hair; after which she cast her in prison and wrote the King her father a writ acquainting him with her case and saying, \"There hath appeared in our land a man, a mortal, by name Hasan, and our sister Manar al-Sana avoucheth that she is lawfully married to him and bare him two sons, whom she hath hidden from us and thee; nor did she discover aught of herself till there came to us this man and informed us that he wedded her and she tarried with him a long while; after which she took her children and departed, without his knowledge, bidding as she went his mother tell her son, whenas longing began to rack to come to her in the Islands of Wak. So we laid hands on the man and sent the old woman Shawahi to fetch her and her offspring, enjoining her to bring us the children in advance of her. And she did so, whilst Manar al-Sana equipped herself and set out to visit me. When the boys were brought to me and ere the mother came, I sent for Hasan the mortal who claimeth her to wife, and he on entering and at first sight knew them and they knew him; whereby was I certified that the children were indeed his children and that she was his wife and I learned that the man's story was true and he was not to blame, but that the reproach and the infamy rested with my sister. Now I feared the rending of our honour-veil before the folk of our Isles; so when this wanton, this traitress, came in to me, I was incensed against her and cast her into prison and bastinado'd her grievously and hanged her up by the hair. Behold, I have acquainted thee with her case and it is thine to command, and whatso thou orderest us that we will do. Thou knowest that in this affair is dishonour and disgrace to our name and to thine, and haply the islanders will hear of it, and we shall become amongst them a byword; wherefore it befitteth thou return us an answer with all speed.\" Then she delivered the letter to a courier and he carried it to the King, who, when he read it, was wroth with exceeding wrath with his daughter Manar al-Sana and wrote to Nur al-Huda, saying, \"I commit her case to thee and give thee command over her life; so, if the matter be as thou sayest, kill her without consulting me.\" When the Queen had received and read her father's letter, she sent for Manar al-Sana and they set before her the prisoner drowned in her blood and pinioned with her hair, shackled with heavy iron shackles and clad in hair-cloth; and they made her stand in the presence abject and abashed. When she saw herself in this condition of passing humiliation and exceeding abjection, she called to mind her former high estate and wept with sore weeping and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"O Lord my foes are fain to slay me in despight * Nor deem I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     anywise to find escape by flight:\nI have recourse to Thee t' annul what they have done; * Thou art\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     th' asylum, Lord, of fearful suppliant wight.\"\n\nThen wept she grievously, till she fell down in a swoon, and presently coming to herself, repeated these two couplets,[FN#158]\n\n\"Troubles familiar with my heart are grown and I with them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Erst shunning; for the generous are sociable still.\nNot one mere kind alone of woe doth lieger with me lie; * Praised\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     be God! There are with me thousands of kinds of ill.\"\n\nAnd also these,\n\n\"Oft times Mischance shall straiten noble breast * With grief,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     whence issue is for Him to shape:\nBut when the meshes straitest, tightest, seem * They loose,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     though deemed I ne'er to find escape.\"\n\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twentieth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Nur al-Huda ordered into the presence her sister Princess Manar al-Sana, they set her between her hands and she, pinioned as she was recited the verses aforesaid. Then the Queen[FN#159] sent for a ladder of wood and made the eunuchs lay her on her back, with her arms spread out and bind her with cords thereto; after which she bared her head and wound her hair about the ladder-rungs and indeed all pity for her was rooted out from her heart. When Manar al-Sana saw herself in this state of abjection and humiliation, she cried out and wept; but none succoured her. Then said she to the Queen, \"O my sister, how is thy heart hardened against me? Hast thou no mercy on me nor pity on these little children?\" But her words only hardened her sister's heart and she insulted her, saying, \"O Wanton! O harlot! Allah have no ruth on whoso sueth for thee! How should I have compassion on thee, O traitress?\" Replied Manar al-Sana who lay stretched on the ladder, \"I appeal from thee to the Lord of the Heavens, concerning that wherewith thou revilest me and whereof I am innocent! By Allah, I have done no whoredom, but am lawfully married to him, and my Lord knoweth an I speak sooth or not! Indeed, my heart is wroth with thee, by reason of thine excessive hardheartedness against me! How canst thou cast at me the charge of harlotry, without knowledge? But my Lord will deliver me from thee and if that whoredom whereof thou accusest me be true, may He presently punish me for it!\" Quoth Nur al-Huda after a few moments of reflection \"How durst thou bespeak me thus?\" and rose and beat her till she fainted away;[FN#160] whereupon they sprinkled water on her face till she revived; and in truth her charms were wasted for excess of beating and the straitness of her bonds and the sore insults she had suffered. Then she recited these two couplets,\n\n\"If aught I've sinned in sinful way, * Or done ill deed and gone\nastray,\nThe past repent I and I come * To you and for your pardon pray!\"\nWhen Nur al-Huda heard these lines, her wrath redoubled and she said to her, \"Wilt speak before me in verse, O whore, and seek to excuse thyself for the mortal sins thou hast sinned? 'Twas my desire that thou shouldst return to thy husband, that I might witness thy wickedness and matchless brazenfacedness; for thou gloriest in thy lewdness and wantonness and mortal heinousness.\" Then she called for a palm-stick and, whenas they brought the Jar\u00edd, she arose and baring arms to elbows, beat her sister from head to foot; after which she called for a whip of plaited thongs, wherewith if one smote an elephant, he would start off at full speed, and came down therewith on her back and her stomach and every part of her body, till she fainted. When the old woman Shawahi saw this, she fled forth from the Queen's presence, weeping and cursing her; but Nur al-Huda cried out to her eunuchs, saying, \"Fetch her to me!\" So they ran after her and seizing her, brought her back to the Queen, who bade throw her on the ground and making them lay hold of her, rose and took the whip, with which she beat her, till she swooned away, when she said to her waiting-women, \"Drag this ill-omened beldam forth on her face and put her out.\" And they did as she bade them. So far concerning them; but as regards Hasan, he walked on beside the river, in the direction of the desert, distracted, troubled, and despairing of life; and indeed he was dazed and knew not night from day for stress of affliction. He ceased not faring on thus, till he came to a tree whereto he saw a scroll hanging: so he took it and found written thereon these couplets,\n\n\"When in thy mother's womb thou wast, * I cast thy case the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   bestest best;\nAnd turned her heart to thee, so she * Foster\u00e8d thee on fondest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    breast.\nWe will suffice thee in whate'er * Shall cause thee trouble or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   unrest;\nWe'll aid thee in thine enterprise * So rise and bow to our\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  behest.\"\n\nWhen he had ended reading this scroll, he made sure of deliverance from trouble and of winning reunion with those he loved. Then he walked forward a few steps and found himself alone in a wild and perilous wold wherein there was none to company with him; upon which his heart sank within him for horror and loneliness and his side-muscles trembled, for that fearsome place, and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"O Zephyr of Morn, an thou pass where the dear ones dwell, * Bear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   greeting of lover who ever in love-longing wones!\nAnd tell them I'm pledged to yearning and pawned to pine * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    the might of my passion all passion of lovers unthrones.\nTheir sympathies haply shall breathe in a Breeze like thee * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    quicken forthright this framework of rotting bones.\"[FN#161]\n\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-first Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan read the scroll he was certified of deliverance from his trouble and made sure of winning reunion with those he loved. Then he walked forward a couple of steps and stopped finding himself alone in a wild and perilous wold wherein was none to company with him, so he wept sore and recited the verses before mentioned. Then he walked on a few steps farther beside the river, till he came upon two little boys of the sons of the sorcerers, before whom lay a rod of copper graven with talismans, and beside it a skull-cap[FN#162] of leather, made of three gores and wroughten in steel with names and characts. The cap and rod were upon the ground and the boys were disputing and beating each other, till the blood ran down between them; whilst each cried, \"None shall take the wand but I.\" So Hasan interposed and parted them, saying, \"What is the cause of your contention?\" and they replied, \"O uncle, be thou judge of our case, for Allah the Most High hath surely sent thee to do justice between us.\" Quoth Hasan, \"Tell me your case, and I will judge between you;\" and quoth one of them, \"We twain are brothers-german and our sire was a mighty magician, who dwelt in a cave on yonder mountain. He died and left us this cap and rod; and my brother saith, 'None shall have the rod but I,' whilst I say the like; so be thou judge between us and deliver us each from other.\" Hasan asked, \"What is the difference between the rod and the cap and what is their value? The rod appears to be worth six coppers[FN#163] and the cap three;\" whereto they answered, \"Thou knowest not their properties.\" \"And what are their properties?\" \"Each of them hath a wonderful secret virtue, wherefore the rod is worth the revenue of all the Islands of Wak and their provinces and dependencies, and the cap the like!\" \"By Allah, O my sons, discover to me their secret virtues.\" So they said, \"O uncle, they are extraordinary; for our father wrought an hundred and thirty and five years at their contrivance, till he brought them to perfection and ingrafted them with secret attributes which might serve him extraordinary services and engraved them after the likeness of the revolving sphere, and by their aid he dissolved all spells; and when he had made an end of their fashion, Death, which all needs must suffer, overtook him. Now the hidden virtue of the cap is, that whoso setteth it on his head is concealed from all folks' eyes, nor can any see him, whilst it remaineth on his head; and that of the rod is that whoso owneth it hath authority over seven tribes of the Jinn, who all serve the order and ordinance of the rod; and whenever he who possesseth it smiteth therewith on the ground, their Kings come to do him homage, and all the Jinn are at his service.\" Now when Hasan heard these words, he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then said in himself, \"By Allah, I shall conquer every foe by means of this rod and cap, Inshallah! and I am worthier of them both than these two boys. So I will go about forthright to get them from the twain by craft, that I may use them to free myself and my wife and children from yonder tyrannical Queen, and then we will depart from this dismal stead, whence there is no deliverance for mortal man nor flight. Doubtless, Allah caused me not to fall in with these two lads, but that I might get the rod and cap from them.\" Then he raised his head and said to the two boys, \"If ye would have me decide the case, I will make trial of you and see what each of you deserveth. He who overcometh his brother shall have the rod and he who faileth shall have the cap.\" They replied,\"'O uncle, we depute thee to make trial of us and do thou decide between us as thou deems fit.\" Hasan asked, \"Will ye hearken to me and have regard to my words?\"; and they answered, \"Yes.\" Then said he, \"I will take a stone and throw it and he who outrunneth his brother thereto and picketh it up shall take the rod, and the other who is outraced shall take the cap.\" And they said, \"We accept and consent to this thy proposal.\" Then Hasan took a stone and threw it with his might, so that it disappeared from sight. The two boys ran under and after it and when they were at a distance, he donned the cap and hending the rod in hand, removed from his place that he might prove the truth of that which the boys had said, with regard to their scant properties. The younger outran the elder and coming first to the stone, took it and returned with it to the place where they had left Hasan, but found no signs of him. So he called to his brother, saying, \"Where is the man who was to be umpire between us?\" Quoth the other, \"I espy him not neither wot I whether he hath flown up to heaven above or sunk into earth beneath.\" Then they sought for him, but saw him not, though all the while he was standing in his stead hard by them. So they abused each other, saying, \"Rod and Cap are both gone; they are neither mine nor thine: and indeed our father warned us of this very thing; but we forgot whatso he said.\" Then they retraced their steps and Hasan also entered the city, wearing the cap and bearing the rod; and none saw him. Now when he was thus certified of the truth of their speech, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and making the palace, went up into the lodging of Shawahi, who saw him not, because of the cap. Then he walked up to a shelf[FN#164] over her head upon which were vessels of glass and chinaware, and shook it with his hand, so that what was thereon fell to the ground. The old woman cried out and beat her face; then she rose and restored the fallen things to their places,[FN#165] saying in herself, \"By Allah, methinks Queen Nur al-Huda hath sent a Satan to torment me, and he hath tricked me this trick! I beg Allah Almighty, deliver me from her and preserve me from her wrath, for, O Lord, if she deal thus abominably with her half-sister, beating and hanging her, dear as she is to her sire, how will she do with a stranger like myself, against whom she is incensed?\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the ancient Lady of Calamities cried, \"When Queen Nur al-Huda doeth such misdeed to her sister, what will she do to a stranger like myself, against whom she is incensed?\" Then said she, \"I conjure thee, O devil, by the Most Compassionate, the Bountiful-great, the High of Estate, of Dominion Elate who man and Jinn did create, and by the writing upon the seal of Solomon David-son (on both be the Peace!) speak to me and answer me;\" Quoth Hasan, \"I am no devil; I am Hasan, the afflicted, the distraught.\" Then he raised the cap from his head and appeared to the old woman, who knew him and taking him apart, said to him, \"What is come to thy reason, that thou returnest hither? Go hide thee; for, if this wicked woman have tormented thy wife with such torments, and she her sister, what will she do, an she light on thee?\" Then she told him all that had befallen his spouse and that wherein she was of travail and torment and tribulation, and straitly described all the pains she endured adding, \"And indeed the Queen repenteth her of having let thee go and hath sent one after thee, promising him an hundred-weight of gold and my rank in her service; and she hath sworn that, if he bring thee back, she will do thee and thy wife and children dead.\" And she shed tears and discovered to Hasan what the Queen had done with herself, whereat he wept and said, \"O my lady, how shall I do to escape from this land and deliver myself and my wife and children from this tyrannical Queen and how devise to return with them in safety to my own country?\" Replied the old woman, \"Woe to thee! Save thyself.\" Quoth he, \"There is no help but I deliver her and my children from the Queen perforce and in her despite;\" and quoth Shawahi, \"How canst thou forcibly rescue them from her? Go and hide thyself, O my son, till Allah Almighty empower thee.\" Then Hasan showed her the rod and the cap, whereat she rejoiced with joy exceeding and cried, \"Glory be to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! By Allah, O my son, thou and thy wife were but of lost folk; now, however, thou art saved, thou and thy wife and children! For I know the rod and I know its maker, who was my Shaykh in the science of Gramarye. He was a mighty magician and spent an hundred and thirty and five years working at this rod and cap, till he brought them to perfection, when Death the Inevitable overtook him. And I have heard him say to his two boys, 'O my sons, these two things are not of your lot, for there will come a stranger from a far country, who will take them from you by force, and ye shall not know how he taketh them.' Said they, 'O our father, tell us how he will avail to take them.' But he answered, 'I wot not.' And O my son,\" added she, \"how availedst thou to take them?\" So he told her how he had taken them from the two boys, whereat she rejoiced and said, \"O my son, since thou hast gotten the whereby to free thy wife and children, give ear to what I shall say to thee. For me there is no woning with this wicked woman, after the foul fashion in which she durst use me; so I am minded to depart from her to the caves of the Magicians and there abide with them until I die. But do thou, O my son, don the cap and hend the rod in hand and enter the place where thy wife and children are. Unbind her bonds and smite the earth with the rod saying, 'Be ye present, O servants of these names!' whereupon the servants of the rod will appear; and if there present himself one of the Chiefs of the Tribes, command him whatso thou shalt wish and will.\" So he farewelled her and went forth, donning the cap and hending the rod, and entered the place where his wife was. He found her well-nigh lifeless, bound to the ladder by her hair, tearful-eyed and woeful-hearted, in the sorriest of plights, knowing no way to deliver herself. Her children were playing under the ladder, whilst she looked at them and wept for them and herself, because of the barbarities and sore treatings and bitter penalties which had befallen her; and he heard her repeat these couplets[FN#166],\n\n\"There remained not aught save a fluttering, breath and an eye\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    whose owner is confounded.\nAnd a desirous lover whose bowels are burned with fire\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     notwithstanding which she is silent.\nThe exulting foe pitieth her at the sight of her. Alas for her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     whom the exulting foe pitieth!\"\n\nWhen Hasan saw her in this state of torment and misery and ignominy and infamy, he wept till he fainted; and when he recovered he saw his children playing and their mother aswoon for excess of pain; so he took the cap from his head and the children saw him and cried out, \"O our father!\" Then he covered his head again and the Princess came to herself, hearing their cry, but saw only her children weeping and shrieking, \"O our father!\" When she heard them name their sire and weep, her heart was broken and her vitals rent asunder and she said to them, \"What maketh you in mind of your father at this time?\" And she wept sore and cried out, from a bursten liver and an aching bosom, \"Where are ye and where is your father?\" Then she recalled the days of her union with Hasan and what had befallen her since her desertion of him and wept with sore weeping till her cheeks were seared and furrowed and her face was drowned in a briny flood. Her tears ran down and wetted the ground and she had not a hand loose to wipe them from her cheeks, whilst the flies fed their fill on her skin, and she found no helper but weeping and no solace but improvising verses. Then she repeated these couplets,\n\n\"I call to mind the parting-day that rent our loves in twain,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     When, as I turned away, the tears in very streams did rain.\nThe cameleer urged on his beasts with them, what while I found\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    Nor strength nor fortitude, nor did my heart with me remain.\nYea, back I turned, unknowing of the road nor might shake off The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    trance of grief and longing love that numbed my heart and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    brain;\nAnd worst of all betided me, on my return, was one Who came to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    me, in lowly guise, to glory in my pain.\nSince the belov\u00e8d's gone, O soul, forswear the sweet of life Nor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     covet its continuance, for, wanting him, 'twere vain.\nList, O my friend, unto the tale of love, and God forbid That I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     should speak and that thy heart to hearken should not deign!\nAs 'twere El Asma\u00ef himself, of passion I discourse Fancies rare\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     and marvellous, linked in an endless chain.\"[FN#167]\n\n\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-third Night,\n\nShe continued, When Hasan went in to his wife he saw his children and heard her repeating the verses afore mentioned.[FN#168] Then she turned right and left, seeking the cause of her children's crying out, \"O our father!\" but saw no one and marvelled that her sons should name their sire at that time and call upon him. But when Hasan heard her verses, he wept till he swooned away and the tears railed down his cheeks like rain. Then he drew near the children and raised the cap from his head unseen of his wife, whereupon they saw him and they knew him and cried out, saying, \"O our father!\" Their mother fell a-weeping again, when she heard them name their sire's name and said, \"There is no avoiding the doom which Almighty Allah hath decreed!\" adding, \"O Strange! What garreth them think of their father at this time and call upon him, albeit it is not of their wont?\" Then she wept and recited these couplets,\n\n\"The land of lamping moon is bare and drear; * O eyne of me pour\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   forth the brimming tear!\nThey marched: how shall I now be patient? * That I nor heart nor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   patience own I swear!\nO ye, who marched yet bide in heart of me, * Will you, O lords of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    me, return to that we were?\nWhat harm if they return and I enjoy * Meeting, and they had ruth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    on tears of care?\nUpon the parting-day they dimmed these eyne, * For sad surprise,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    and lit the flames that flare.\nSore longed I for their stay, but Fortune stayed * Longings and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    turned my hope to mere despair.\nReturn to us (O love!) by Allah, deign! * Enow of tears have\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    flowed for absence-bane.\"\n\nThen Hasan could no longer contain himself, but took the cap from his head; whereupon his wife saw him and recognising him screamed a scream which startled all in the palace, and said to him, \"How camest thou hither? From the sky hast thou dropped or through the earth hast thou come up?\" And her eyes brimmed with tears and Hasan also wept. Quoth she, \"O man, this be no time for tears or blame. Fate hath had its course and the sight was blinded and the Pen hath run with what was ordained of Allah when Time was begun: so, Allah upon thee, whencesoever thou comest, go hide, lest any espy thee and tell my sister and she do thee and me die!\" Answered he, \"O my lady and lady of all Queens, I have adventured myself and come hither, and either I will die or I will deliver thee from this strait and travel with thee and my children to my country, despite the nose of this thy wickedest sister.\" But as she heard his words she smiled and for awhile fell to shaking her head and said, \"Far, O my fife, far is it from the power of any except Allah Almighty to deliver me from this my strait! Save thyself by flight and wend thy ways and cast not thyself into destruction; for she hath conquering hosts none may withstand. Given that thou tookest me and wentest forth, how canst thou make thy country and escape from these islands and the perils of these awesome places? Verily, thou hast seen on thy way hither, the wonders, the marvels, the dangers and the terrors of the road, such as none may escape, not even one of the rebel Jinns. Depart, therefore, forthright and add not cark to my cark and care to my care, neither do thou pretend to rescue me from this my plight; for who shall carry me to thy country through all these vales and thirsty wolds and fatal steads?\" Rejoined Hasan, \"By thy life, O light of mine eyes, I will not depart this place nor fare but with thee!\" Quoth she, \"O man! How canst thou avail unto this thing and what manner of man art thou? Thou knowest not what thou sayest! None can escape from these realms, even had he command over Jinns, Ifrits, magicians, chiefs of tribes and Marids. Save thyself and leave me; perchance Allah will bring about good after ill.\" Answered Hasan, \"O lady of fair ones, I came not save to deliver thee with this rod and with this cap.\" And he told her what had befallen him with the two boys; but, whilst he was speaking, behold, up came the Queen and heard their speech. Now when he was ware of her, he donned the cap and was hidden from sight, and she entered and said to the Princess, \"O wanton, who is he with whom thou wast talking?\" Answered Manar al-Sanar, \"Who is with me that should talk with me, except these children?\" Then the Quee took the whip and beat her, whilst Hasan stood by and looked on, nor did she leave beating her till she fainted; whereupon she bade transport her to another place. So they loosed her and carried her to another chamber whilst Hasan followed unseen. There they cast her down, senseless, and stood gazing upon her, till she revived and recited these couplets,[FN#169]\n\n\"I have sorrowed on account of our disunion with a sorrow that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    made the tears to overflow from my eyelids;\nAnd I vowed that if Fortune reunite us, I would never again\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  mention our separation;\nAnd I would say to the envious, Die ye with regret; By Allah I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    have now attained my desire!\nJoy hath overwhelmed me to such a degree that by its excess it\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    hath made me weep.\nO eye, how hath weeping become thy habit? Thou weepest in joy as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   well, as in sorrows.\"\n\nWhen she ceased her verse the slave-girls went out from her and Hasan took off the cap; whereupon his wife said to him, \"See, O man, all this befel me not save by reason of my having rebelled against thee and transgressed thy commandment and gone forth without thy leave.[FN#170] So, Allah upon thee blame me not for my sins and know that women never wot a man's worth till they have lost him. Indeed, I have offended and done evil; but I crave pardon of Allah Almighty for whatso I did, and if He reunite us, I will never again gainsay thee in aught, no, never!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan's wife besought pardon of him saying, \"Blame me not for my sin; and indeed I crave mercy of Allah Almighty.\" Quoth Hasan (and indeed his heart ached for her), \"'Twas not thou that wast in fault; nay, the fault was mine and mine only, for I fared forth and left thee with one who knew not thy rank, neither thy worth nor thy degree. But know, O beloved of my heart and fruit of my vitals and light of mine eyes, that Allah (blessed be He!) hath ordained to me power of releasing thee; so, say me, wouldst thou have me carry thee to thy father's home, there to accomplish what Allah decreeth unto thee, or wilt thou forthright depart with me to mine own country, now that relief is come to thee?\" Quoth she, \"Who can deliver me save the Lord of the Heavens? Go to thy motherland and put away from thee false hope; for thou knowest not the perils of these parts which, an thou obey me not, soon shalt thou sight.\" And she improvised these couplets,\n\n\"On me and with me bides thy volunty; * Why then such anger such\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   despite to me?\nWhate'er befel us Heaven forbid that love * Fade for long time or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  e'er forgotten be!\nCeased not the spy to haunt our sides, till seen * Our love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp estranged and then estranged was he:\nIn truth I trusted to fair thoughts of thine * Though spake the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    wicked spy maliciously.\nWe'll keep the secret 'twixt us twain and bold * Although the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    brand of blame unsheathed we see.\nThe livelong day in longing love I spend * Hoping acceptance-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   message from my friend.\"\n\nThen wept she and her children, and the handmaidens heard them: so they came in to them and found them weeping, but saw not Hasan with them; wherefore they wept for ruth of them and damned Queen Nur al-Huda. Then Hasan took patience till night came on and her guards had gone to their sleeping-places, when he arose and girded his waist; then went up to her and, loosing her, kissed her on the head and between the eyes and pressed her to his bosom, saying, \"How long have we wearied for our mother-land and for reunion there! Is this our meeting in sleep, or on wake?\" Then he took up the elder boy and she took up the younger and they went forth the palace; and Allah veiled them with the veil of His protection, so that they came safe to the outer gate which closed the entrance to the Queen's Serraglio. But finding it locked from without, Hasan said, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily we are Allah's and unto Him shall we return!\" With this they despaired of escape and Hasan beat hand upon hand, saying, \"O Dispeller of dolours! Indeed, I had bethought me of every thing and considered its conclusion but this; and now, when it is daybreak, they will take us, and what device have we in this case?\" And he recited the following two couplets,[FN#171]\n\n\"Thou madest fair thy thought of Fate, whenas the days were fair,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  And fearedst not the unknown ills that they to thee might\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp bring.\nThe nights were fair and calm to thee; thou wast deceived by\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  them, For in the peace of night is born full many a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  troublous thing.\"\n\nThen Hasan wept and his wife wept for his weeping and for the abasement she had suffered and the cruelties of Time and Fortune,\n\n\"Baulks me my Fate as tho' she were my foe; * Each day she\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    showeth me new cark and care:\nFate, when I aim at good, brings clear reverse, * And lets foul\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    morrow wait on day that's fair.\"\nAnd also these,\n\n\"Irks me my Fate and clean unknows that I * Of my high worth her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     shifts and shafts despise.\nShe nights parading what ill-will she works: * I night parading\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Patience to her eyes.\"\n\nThen his wife said to him, \"By Allah, there is no relief for us but to kill ourselves and be at rest from this great and weary travail; else we shall suffer grievous torment on the morrow.\" At this moment, behold, they heard a voice from without the door say, \"By Allah, O my lady Manar al-Sana, I will not open to thee and thy husband Hasan, except ye obey me in whatso I shall say to you!\" When they heard these words they were silent for excess of fright and would have returned whence they came; when lo! the voice spake again saying, \"What aileth you both to be silent and answer me not?\" Therewith they knew the speaker for the old woman Shawahi, Lady of Calamities, and said to her, \"Whatsoever thou biddest us, that will we do; but first open the door to us; this being no time for talk.\" Replied she, \"By Allah, I will not open to you until ye both swear to me that you will take me with you and not leave me with yonder whore: so, whatever befalleth you shall befal me and if ye escape, I shall escape, and if ye perish, I shall perish: for yonder abominable woman, tribade[FN#172] that she is! entreateth me with indignity and still tormenteth me on your account; and thou, O my daughter, knowest my worth.\" Now recognising her they trusted in her and sware to her an oath such as contented her, whereupon she opened the door to them and they fared forth and found her riding on a Greek jar of red earthenware with a rope of palm-fibres about its neck,[FN#173] which rolled under her and ran faster than a Najdi colt, and she came up to them, and said, \"Follow me and fear naught, for I know forty modes of magic by the least of which I could make this city a dashing sea, swollen with clashing billows, and ensorcel each damsel therein to a fish, and all before dawn. But I was not able to work aught of my mischief, for fear of the King her father and of regard to her sisters, for that they are formidable, by reason of their many guards and tribesmen and servants. However, soon will I show you wonders of my skill in witchcraft; and now let us on, relying upon the blessing of Allah and His good aid.\" Now Hasan and his wife rejoiced in this, making sure of escape, \u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan and his wife, accompanied by the ancient dame Shawahi, fared forth from the palace, they made sure of deliverance and they walked on till they came without the city, when he fortified his heart and, smiting the earth with the rod, cried, \"Ho, ye servants of these names, appear to me and acquaint me with your conditions!\" Thereupon the earth clave asunder and out came ten[FN#174] Ifrits, with their feet in the bowels of the earth and their heads in the clouds. They kissed the earth three times before Hasan and said as with one voice, \"Adsumus! Here are we at thy service, O our lord and ruler over us! What dost thou bid us do? For we hear and obey thy commandment. An thou wilt, we will dry thee up seas and remove mountains from their places.\" So Hasan rejoiced in their words and at their speedy answer to his evocation then taking courage and bracing up his resolution, he said to them, \"Who are ye and what be your names and your races, and to what tribes and clans and companies appertain ye?\" They kissed the earth once more and answered as with one voice, saying, \"We are seven Kings, each ruling over seven tribes of the Jinn of all conditions, and Satans and Marids, flyers and divers, dwellers in mountains and wastes and wolds and haunters of the seas: so bid us do whatso thou wilt; for we are thy servants and thy slaves, and whoso possesseth this rod hath dominion over an our necks and we owe him obedience.\" Now when Hasan heard this, he rejoiced with joy exceeding, as did his wife and the old woman, and presently he said to the Kings of the Jinn, \"I desire of you that ye show me your tribes and hosts and guards.\" \"O our lord,\" answered they, \"if we show thee our tribes, we fear for thee and these who are with thee, for their name is legion and they are various in form and fashion, figure and favour. Some of us are heads sans bodies and others bodies sans heads, and others again are in the likeness of wild beasts and ravening lions. However, if this be thy will, there is no help but we first show thee those of us who are like unto wild beasts. But, O our lord, what wouldst thou of us at this present?\" Quoth Hasan, \"I would have you carry me forthwith to the city of Baghdad, me and my wife and this honest woman.\" But, hearing his words they hung down their heads and were silent, whereupon Hasan asked them, \"Why do ye not reply?\" And they answered as with one voice, \"O our lord and ruler over us, we are of the covenant of Solomon son of David (on the twain be Peace!) and he sware us in that we would bear none of the sons of Adam on our backs; since which time we have borne no mortal on back or shoulder: but we will straightway harness thee horses of the Jinn, that shall carry thee and thy company to thy country.\" Hasan enquired, \"How far are we from Baghdad?\" and they, \"Seven years' journey for a diligent horseman.\" Hasan marvelled at this and said to them, \"Then how came I hither in less than a year?\"; and they said, \"Allah softened to thee the hearts of His pious servants else hadst thou never come to this country nor hadst thou set eyes on these regions; no, never! For the Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, who mounted thee on the elephant and the magical horse, traversed with thee, in ten days, three years' journey for a well-girt rider, and the Ifrit Dahnash, to whom the Shaykh committed thee, carried thee a three years' march in a day and a night; all which was of the blessing of Allah Almighty, for that the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh is of the seed of Asaf bin Barkhiy\u00e1[FN#175] and knoweth the Most Great name of Allah.[FN#176] Moreover, from Baghdad to the palace of the damsels is a year's journey, and this maketh up the seven years.\" When Hasan heard this, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and cried, \"Glory be to God, Facilitator of the hard, Fortifier of the weak heart, Approximator of the far and Humbler of every froward tyrant, Who hath eased us of every accident and carried me to these countries and subjected to me these creatures and reunited me with my wife and children! I know not whether I am asleep or awake or if I be sober or drunken!\" Then he turned to the Jinn and asked, \"When ye have mounted me upon your steeds, in how many days will they bring us to Baghdad?\"; and they answered, \"They will carry you thither under the year, but not till after ye have endured terrible perils and hardships and horrors and ye have traversed thirsty Wadys and frightful wastes and horrible steads without number; and we cannot promise thee safety, O our lord, from the people of these islands,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Jann said to Hasan, \"We cannot promise thee safety, O our lord, from this Islandry, nor from the mischief of the Supreme King and his enchanters and warlocks. It may be they will overcome us and take you from us and we fall into affliction with them, and all to whom the tidings shall come after this will say to us: 'Ye are wrong-doers! How could ye go against the Supreme King and carry a mortal out of his dominions, and eke the King's daughter with him?' adding, 'Wert thou alone with us the thing were light; but He who conveyed thee hither is capable to carry thee back to thy country and reunite thee with thine own people forthright and in readiest plight. So take heart and put thy trust in Allah and fear not; for we are at thy service, to convey thee to thy country.\" Hasan thanked them therefor and said, \"Allah requite you with good! but now make haste with the horses;\" they replied, \"We hear and we obey,\" and struck the ground with their feet, whereupon it opened and they disappeared within it and were absent awhile, after which they suddenly reappeared with three horses, saddled and bridled, and on each saddle-bow a pair of saddle-bags, with a leathern bottle of water in one pocket and the other full of provaunt. So Hasan mounted one steed and took a child before him, whilst his wife mounted a second and took the other child before her. Then the old woman alighted from the jar and bestrode the third horse and they rode on, without ceasing, all night. At break of day, they turned aside from the road and made for the mountain, whilst their tongues ceased not to name Allah. Then they fared on under the highland all that day, till Hasan caught sight of a black object afar as it were a tall column of smoke a-twisting skywards; so he recited somewhat of the Koran and Holy Writ, and sought refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned. The black thing grew plainer as they drew near, and when hard by it, they saw that it was an Ifrit, with a head like a huge dome and tusks like grapnels and jaws like a lane and nostrils like ewers and ears like leathern targes and mouth like a cave and teeth like pillars of stone and hands like winnowing forks and legs like masts: his head was in the cloud and his feet in the bowels of the earth had plowed. Whenas Hasan gazed upon him he bowed himself and kissed the ground before him, saying, \"O Hasan, have no fear of me; for I am the chief of the dwellers in this land, which is the first of the Isles of Wak, and I am a Moslem and an adorer of the One God. I have heard of you and your coming and when I knew of your case, I desired to depart from the land of the magicians to another land, void of inhabitants and far from men and Jinn, that I might dwell there alone and worship Allah till my fated end came upon me. So I wish to accompany you and be your guide, till ye fare forth of the Wak Islands; and I will not appear save at night; and do ye hearten your hearts on my account; for I am a Moslem, even as ye are Moslems.\" When Hasan heard the Ifrit's words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and made sure of deliverance; and he said to him, \"Allah requite thee weal! Go with us relying upon the blessing of Allah!\" So the Ifrit forewent them and they followed, talking and making merry, for their hearts were pleased and their breasts were eased and Hasan fell to telling his wife all that had befallen him and all the hardships he had undergone, whilst she excused herself to him and told him, in turn, all she had seen and suffered. They ceased not faring all that night.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they ceased not faring all that night and the horses bore them like the blinding leven, and when the day rose all put their hands to the saddle-bags and took forth provaunt which they ate and water which they drank. Then they sped diligently on their way, preceded by the Ifrit, who turned aside with them from the beaten track into another road, till then untrodden, along the seashores and they ceased not faring on, without stopping, across Wadys and wolds a whole month, till on the thirty-first day there arose before them a dust-cloud, that walled the world and darkened the day; and when Hasan saw this, he was confused and turned pale; and more so when a frightful crying and clamour struck their ears. There, upon the old woman said to him, \"O my son, this is the army of the Wak Islands, that hath overtaken us; and presently they will lay violent hands on us.\" Hasan asked, \"What shall I do, O my mother?\"; and she answered, \"Strike the earth with the rod.\" He did so whereupon the Seven Kings presented themselves and saluted him with the salam, kissing ground before him and saying, \"Fear not neither grieve.\" Hasan rejoiced at these words and answered them, saying, \"Well said, O Princes of the Jinn and the Ifrits! This is your time!\" Quoth they, \"Get ye up to the mountain-top, thou and thy wife and children and she who is with thee and leave us to deal with them, for we know that you all are in the right and they in the wrong and Allah will aid us against them.\" So Hasan and his wife and children and the old woman dismounted and dismissing the horses, ascended the flank of the mountain.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan with his wife, his children and the ancient dame ascended the mountain-flank after they had dismissed the coursers. Presently, up came Queen Nur al-Huda, with the troops right and left, and the captains went round about among the host and ranged them rank by rank in battle array. Then the hosts charged down upon each other and clashed together the twain with a mighty strain, the brave pressed on amain and the coward to fly was fain and the Jinn cast flames of fire from their mouths, whilst the smoke of them rose up to the confines of the sky and the two armies appeared and disappeared. The champions fought and heads flew from trunks and the blood ran in rills; nor did brand leave to play and blood to flow and battle fire to flow, till the murk o' night came, when the two hosts drew apart and, alighting from their steeds rested upon the field by the fires they had kindled. Therewith the Seven Kings went up to Hasan and kissed the earth before him. He pressed forwards to meet them and thanked them and prayed Allah to give them the victory and asked them how they had fared with the Queen's troops. Quoth they, \"They will not withstand us more than three days, for we had the better of them to-day, taking some two thousand of them prisoners and slaying of them much folk whose compt may not be told. So be of good cheer and broad of breast.\" Then they farewelled him and went down to look after the safety of their troops; and they ceased not to keep up the fires till the morning rose with its sheen and shone, when the fighting-men mounted their horses of noble strain and smote one another with thin-edged skean and with brawn of bill they thrust amain nor did they cease that day battle to darraign. Moreover, they passed the night on horseback clashing together like dashing seas; raged among them the fires of war and they stinted not from battle and jar, till the armies of Wak were defeated and their power broken and their courage quelled; their feet slipped and whither they fled soever defeat was before them; wherefore they turned tail and of flight began to avail: but the most part of them were slain and their Queen and her chief officers and the grandees of her realm were captive ta'en. When the morning morrowed, the Seven Kings presented themselves before Hasan and set for him a throne of alabaster inlaid with pearls and jewels, and he sat down thereon. They also set thereby a throne of ivory, plated with glittering gold, for the Princess Manar al-Sana and another for the ancient dame Shawahi Zat al-Dawahi. Then they brought before them the prisoners and among the rest, Queen Nur al-Huda with elbows pinioned and feet fettered, whom when Shawahi saw, she said to her, \"Thy recompense, O harlot, O tyrant, shall be that two bitches be starved and two mares stinted of water, till they be athirst: then shalt thou be bound to the mares' tails and these driven to the river, with the bitches following thee that they may rend thy skin; and after, thy flesh shall be cut off and given them to eat. How couldst thou do with thy sister such deed, O strumpet, seeing that she was lawfully married, after the ordinance of Allah and of His Apostle? For there is no monkery in Al-Islam and marriage is one of the institutions of the Apostles (on whom be the Peace!)[FN#177] nor were women created but for men.\" Then Hasan commanded to put all the captives to the sword and the old woman cried out, saying, \"Slay them all and spare none[FN#178]!\" But, when Princess Manar al-Sana saw her sister in this plight, a bondswoman and in fetters, she wept over her and said, \"O my sister, who is this hath conquered us and made us captives in our own country?\" Quoth Nur al-Huda, \"Verily, this is a mighty matter. Indeed this man Hasan hath gotten the mastery over us and Allah hath given him dominion over us and over all our realm and he hath overcome us, us and the Kings of the Jinn.\" And quoth her sister, \"Indeed, Allah aided him not against you nor did he overcome you nor capture you save by means of this cap and rod.\" So Nur al-Huda was certified and assured that he had conquered her by means thereof and humbled herself to her sister, till she was moved to ruth for her and said to her husband, \"What wilt thou do with my sister? Behold, she is in thy hands and she hath done thee no misdeed that thou shouldest punish her.\" Replied Hasan, \"Her torturing of thee was misdeed enow.\" But she answered, saying, \"She hath excuse for all she did with me. As for thee, thou hast set my father's heart on fire for the loss of me, and what will be his case, if he lose my sister also?\" And he said to her, \"'Tis thine to decide; do whatso thou wilt.\" So she bade loose her sister and the rest of the captives, and they did her bidding. Then she went up to Queen Nur al-Huda and embraced her, and they wept together a long while; after which quoth the Queen, \"O my sister, bear me not malice for that I did with thee;\" and quoth Manar al-Sana, \"O my sister, this was foreordained to me by Fate.\" Then they sat on the couch talking and Manar al-Sana made peace between the old woman and her sister, after the goodliest fashion, and their hearts were set at ease. Thereupon Hasan dismissed the servants of the rod thanking them for the succour which they had afforded him against his foes, and Manar al-Sana related to her sister all that had befallen her with Hasan her husband and every thing he had suffered for her sake, saying, \"O my sister, since he hath done these deeds and is possessed of this might and Allah Almighty hath gifted him with such exceeding prowess, that he hath entered our country and beaten thine army and taken thee prisoner and defied our father, the Supreme King, who hath dominion over all the Princes of the Jinn, it behoveth us to fail not of what is due to him.\" Replied Nur al-Huda, \"By Allah, O my sister, thou sayest sooth in whatso thou tellest me of the marvels which this man hath seen and suffered; and none may fail of respect to him. But was all this on thine account, O my sister?\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Manar al-Sana repeated to her sister these praises of Hasan, the other replied, \"By Allah, this man can claim all respect more by token of his generosity. But was all this on thine account?\" \"Yes,\" answered Manar al-Sana, and they passed the night in converse till the morning morrowed and the sun rose and they were minded to depart. So they farewelled one another and Manar al-Sana gave God-speed to the ancient dame after the reconciling her with Queen Nur al-Huda. Thereupon Hasan smote the earth with the rod and its servants the Jinn appeared and saluted him, saying, \"Praised be Allah, who hath set thy soul at rest! Command us what thou wilt, and we will do it for thee in less than the twinking of an eye.\" He thanked them for their saying and said to them \"Allah requite you with good! Saddle me two steeds of the best.\" So they brought him forthwith two saddled coursers, one of which he mounted, taking his elder son before him, and his wife rode the other, taking the younger son in front of her. Then the Queen and the old woman also backed horse and departed, Hasan and his wife following the right and Nur al-Huda and Shawahi the left hand road. The spouses fared on with their children, without stopping, for a whole month, till they drew in sight of a city, which they found compassed about with trees and streams and, making the trees, dismounted beneath them thinking to rest there. As they sat talking, behold, they saw many horsemen coming towards them, whereupon Hasan rose and going to meet them, saw that it was King Hassun, lord of the Land of Camphor and Castle of Crystal, with his attendants. So Hasan went up to the King and kissed his hands and saluted him; and when Hassun saw him, he dismounted and seating himself with Hasan upon carpets under the trees returned his salam and gave him joy of his safety and rejoiced in him with exceeding joy, saying to him, \"O Hasan, tell me all that hath befallen thee, first and last.\" So he told him all of that, whereupon the King marvelled and said to him, \"O my son, none ever reached the Islands of Wak and returned thence but thou, and indeed thy case is wondrous; but Alhamdolillah\u2014praised be God\u2014for safety!\" Then he mounted and bade Hasan ride with his wife and children into the city, where he lodged them in the guest-house of his palace; and they abode with him three days, eating and drinking in mirth and merriment, after which Hasan sought Hassun's leave to depart to his own country and the King granted it. Accordingly they took horse and the King rode with them ten days, after which he farewelled them and turned back, whilst Hasan and his wife and children fared on a whole month, at the end of which time they came to a great cavern, whose floor was of brass. Quoth Hasan to his wife, \"Kennest thou yonder cave?\"; and quoth she, \"No.\" Said he, \"Therein dwelleth a Shaykh, Abu al-Ruwaysh hight, to whom I am greatly beholden, for that he was the means of my becoming acquainted with King Hassun.\" Then he went on to tell her all that had passed between him and Abu al-Ruwaysh, and as he was thus engaged, behold, the Shaykh himself issued from the cavernmouth. When Hasan saw him, he dismounted from his steed and kissed his hands, and the old man saluted him and gave him joy of his safety and rejoiced in him. Then he carried him into the antre and sat down with him, whilst Hasan related to him what had befallen him in the Islands of Wak; whereat the Elder marvelled with exceeding marvel and said, \"O Hasan, how didst thou deliver thy wife and children?\" So he told them the tale of the cap and the rod, hearing which he wondered and said, \"O Hasan, O my son, but for this rod and the cap, thou hadst never delivered thy wife and children.\" And he replied, \"Even so, O my lord.\" As they were talking, there came a knocking at the door and Abu al-Ruwaysh went out and found Abd al-Kaddus mounted on his elephant. So he saluted him and brought him into the cavern, where he embraced Hasan and congratulated him on his safety, rejoicing greatly in his return. Then said Abu al-Ruwaysh to Hasan, \"Tell the Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus all that hath befallen thee, O Hasan.\" He repeated to him every thing that had passed, first and last, till he came to the tale of the rod and cap,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtieth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan began relating to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus and Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh (who sat chattting in the cave) all that had passed, first and last, till he came to the tale of the rod and cap; where, upon quoth Abd al-Kaddus, \"O my son, thou hast delivered thy wife and thy children and hast no further need of the two. Now we were the means of thy winning to the Islands of Wak, and I have done thee kindness for the sake of my nieces, the daughters of my brother; wherefore I beg thee, of thy bounty and favour, to give me the rod and the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh the cap.\" When Hasan heard this, he hung down his head, being ashamed to reply, \"I will not give them to you,\" and said in his mind, \"Indeed these two Shaykhs have done me great kindness and were the means of my winning to the Islands of Wak, and but for them I had never made the place, nor delivered my children, nor had I gotten me this rod and cap.\" So he raised his head and answered, \"Yes, I will give them to you: but, O my lords, I fear lest the Supreme King, my wife's father, come upon me with his commando and combat with me in my own country, and I be unable to repel them, for want of the rod and the cap.\" Replied Abd al-Kaddus, \"Fear not, O my son; we will continually succour thee and keep watch and ward for thee in this place; and whosoever shall come against thee from thy wife's father or any other, him we will fend off from thee; wherefore be thou of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool of tear, and hearten thy heart and broaden thy breast and feel naught whatsoever of fear, for no harm shall come to thee.\" When Hasan heard this he was abashed and gave the cap to Abu al-Ruwaysh, saying to Abd al-Kaddus, \"Accompany me to my own country and I will give thee the rod.\" At this the two elders rejoiced with exceeding joy and made him ready riches and treasures which beggar all description. He abode with them three days, at the end of which he set out again and the Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus made ready to depart with him. So he and his wife mounted their beasts and Abd al-Kaddus whistled, when, behold, a mighty big elephant trotted up with fore hand and feet on amble from the heart of the desert and he took it and mounted it. Then they farewelled Abu al-Ruwaysh who disappeared within his cavern; and they fared on across country, traversing the land in its length and breadth wherever Abd al-Kaddus guided them by a short cut and an easy way, till they drew near the land of the Princesses; whereupon Hasan rejoiced at finding himself once more near his mother, and praised Allah for his safe return and reunion with his wife and children after so many hardships and perils; and thanked Him for His favours and bounties, reciting these couplets,\n\n\"Haply shall Allah deign us twain unite * And lockt in strict\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    embrace we'll hail the light:\nAnd wonders that befel me I'll recount, * And all I suffered from\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    the Severance-blight:\nAnd fain I'll cure mine eyes by viewing you * For ever yearned my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     heart to see your sight:\nI hid a tale for you my heart within * Which when we meet o' morn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    I'll fain recite:\nI'll blame you for the deeds by you were done * But while blame\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    endeth love shall stay in site.\"\n\nHardly had he made an end of these verses, when he looked and behold, there rose to view the Green Dome[FN#179] and the jetting Fount and the Emerald Palace, and the Mountain of Clouds showed to them from afar; whereupon quoth Abd al-Kaddus, \"Rejoice, O Hasan, in good tidings: to-night shalt thou be the guest of my nieces!\" At this he joyed with exceeding joy and as also did his wife, and they alighted at the domed pavilion, where they took their rest[FN#180] and ate and drank; after which they mounted horse again and rode on till they came upon the palace. As they drew near, the Princesses who were daughters of the King, brother to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, came forth to meet them and saluted them and their uncle who said to them, \"O daughters of my brother, behold, I have accomplished the need of this your brother Hasan and have helped him to regain his wife and children.\" So they embraced him and gave him joy of his return in safety and health and of his reunion with his wife and children, and it was a day of festival[FN#181] with them. Then came forward Hasan's sister, the youngest Princess, and embraced him, weeping with sore weeping, whilst he also wept for his long desolation: after which she complained to him of that which she had suffered for the pangs of separation and weariness of spirit in his absence and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"After thy faring never chanced I'spy * A shape, but did thy form\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     therein descry:\nNor closed mine eyes in sleep but thee I saw, * E'en as though\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     dwelling 'twixt the lid and eye.\"\n\nWhen she had made an end of her verses, she rejoiced with joy exceeding and Hasan said to her, \"O my sister, I thank none in this matter save thyself over all thy sisters, and may Allah Almighty vouchsafe thee aidance and countenance!\" Then he related to her all that had past in his journey, from first to last, and all that he had undergone, telling her what had betided him with his wife's sister and how he had delivered his wife and wees and he also described to her all that he had seen of marvels and grievous perils, even to how Queen Nur al-Huda would have slain him and his spouse and children and none saved them from her but the Lord the Most High. Moreover, he related to her the adventure of the cap and the rod and how Abd al-Kaddus and Abu al-Ruwaysh had asked for them and he had not agreed to give them to the twain save for her sake; wherefore she thanked him and blessed him wishing him long life; and he cried, \"By Allah, I shall never forget all the kindness thou hast done me from incept to conclusion.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eight Hundred and Thirty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan foregathered with the Princesses, he related to his sister all that he had endured and said to her, \"Never will I forget what thou hast done for me from incept to conclusion.\" Then she turned to his wife Manar al-Sana and embraced her and pressed her children to her breast, saying to her, \"O daughter of the Supreme King, was there no pity in thy bosom, that thou partedst him and his children and settedst his heart on fire for them? Say me, didst thou desire by this deed that he should die?\" The Princess laughed and answered, \"Thus was it ordained of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) and whoso beguileth folk, him shall Allah begule.\"[FN#182] Then they set on somewhat of meat and drink, and they all ate and drank and made merry. They abode thus ten days in feast and festival, mirth and merry-making, at the end of which time Hasan prepared to continue his journey. So his sister rose and made him ready riches and rarities, such as defy description. Then she strained him to her bosom, because of leavetaking, and threw her arms round his neck whilst he recited on her account these couplets,\n\n\"The solace of lovers is naught but far, * And parting is naught\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   save grief singular:\nAnd ill-will and absence are naught but woe, * And the victims of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp  Love naught but martyrs are;\nAnd how tedious is night to the loving wight * From his true love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   parted 'neath evening star!\nHis tears course over his cheeks and so * He cries, 'O tears be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     there more to flow?'\"\n\nWith this Hasan gave the rod to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, who joyed therein with exceeding joy and thanking him and securing it mounted and returned to his own place. Then Hasan took horse with his wife and children and departed from the Palace of the Princesses, who went forth[FN#183] with him, to farewell him. Then they turned back and Hasan fared on, over wild and wold, two months and ten days, till he came to the city of Baghdad, the House of Peace, and repairing to his home by the private postern which gave upon the open country, knocked at the door. Now his mother, for long absence, had forsworn sleep and given herself to mourning and weeping and wailing, till she fell sick and ate no meat, neither took delight in slumber but shed tears night and day. She ceased not to call upon her son's name albeit she despaired of his returning to her; and as he stood at the door, he heard her weeping and reciting these couplets,\n\n\"By Allah, heal, O my lords, the unwhole * Of wasted frame and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     heart worn with dole:\nAn you grant her a meeting 'tis but your grace * Shall whelm in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    the boons of the friend her soul:\nI despair not of Union the Lord can grant * And to weal of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    meeting our woes control!\"\n\nWhen she had ended her verses, she heard her son's voice at the door, calling out, \"O mother, mother ah! fortune hath been kind and hath vouchsafed our reunion!\" Hearing his cry she knew his voice and went to the door, between belief and misbelief; but, when she opened it she saw him standing there and with him his wife and children; so she shrieked aloud, for excess of joy, and fell to the earth in a fainting-fit. Hasan ceased not soothing her, till she recovered and embraced him; then she wept with joy, and presently she called his slaves and servants and bade them carry all his baggage into the house.[FN#184] So they brought in every one of the loads, and his wife and children entered also, whereupon Hasan's mother went up to the Princess and kissed her head and bussed her feet, saying, \"O daughter of the Supreme King, if I have failed of thy due, behold, I crave pardon of Almighty Allah.\" Then she turned to Hasan and said to him, \"O my son, what was the cause of this long strangerhood?\" He related to her all his adventures from beginning to end; and when she heard tell of all that had befallen him, she cried a great cry and fell down a-fainting at the very mention of his mishaps. He solaced her, till she came to herself and said, \"By Allah, O my son, thou hast done unwisely in parting with the rod and the cap for, hadst thou kept them with the care due to them, thou wert master of the whole earth, in its breadth and length; but praised be Allah, for thy safety, O my son, and that of thy wife and children!\" They passed the night in all pleasance and happiness, and on the morrow Hasan changed his clothes and donning a suit of the richest apparel, went down into the bazar and bought black slaves and slave-girls and the richest stuffs and ornaments and furniture such as carpets and costly vessels and all manner other precious things, whose like is not found with Kings. Moreover, he purchased houses and gardens and estates and so forth and abode with his wife and his children and his mother, eating and drinking and pleasuring: nor did they cease from all joy of life and its solace till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies. And Glory be to Him who hath dominion over the Seen and the Unseen,[FN#185] who is the Living, the Eternal, Who dieth not at all! And men also recount the adventures of\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n[FN#5] This famous tale is a sister prose-poem to the \"Arabian\nOdyssey\" Sindbad the Seaman; only the Bassorite's travels are in\nJinn-land and Japan.

(vol. iv. i.) the merchant has two sons who became one a brazier (\"dealer in copper-wares\" says Lane iii. 385) and the other a goldsmith. The Bresl. Edit. (v. 264) mentions only one son, Hasan, the hero of the story which is entitled, \"Tale of Hasan al-Basr\u00ed and the Isles of W\u00e1k W\u00e1k.\"\n\n[FN#7] Arab. \"Sh\u00e1sh Abyaz:\" this distinctive sign of the True Believer was adopted by the Persian to conceal his being a fire-worshipper, Magian or \"Guebre.\" The latter word was introduced from the French by Lord Byron and it is certainly far superior to Moore's \"Gheber.\"\n\n[FN#8] Persians being always a suspected folk.\n\n[FN#9] Arab. \"Al-B\u00fadikah\" afterwards used (Night dcclxxix) in the sense of crucible or melting-pot, in modern parlance a pipe-bowl; and also written \"B\u00fatakah,\" an Arab distortion of the Persian \"B\u00fatah.\"\n\n[FN#10] Arab. \"Sind\u00e1n\" or \"Sindiy\u00e1n\" (Dozy). \"Sand\u00e1n,\" anvil;\n\"Sind\u00e1n,\" big, strong (Steingass).\n\n[FN#11] Arab. \"K\u00edm\u00edya,\" (see vol. i. 305) properly the substance which transmutes metals, the \"philosopher's stone\" which, by the by, is not a stone; and comes from , a fluid, a wet drug, as opposed to Iks\u00edr (Al-) a dry drug. Those who care to see how it is still studied will consult my History of Sindh (chapt. vii) and my experience which pointed only to the use made of it in base coinage. Hence in mod. tongue K\u00edmiy\u00e1wi, an alchemist, means a coiner, a smasher. The reader must not suppose that the transmutation of metals is a dead study: I calculate that there are about one hundred workers in London alone.\n\n[FN#12] Arab. \"Al-K\u00edr,\" a bellows also = K\u00far, a furnace. For the full meaning of this sentence, see my \"Book of the Sword,\" p. 119.\n\n[FN#13] Lit. \"bade him lean upon it with the shears\" (Al-K\u00e1z).\n\n[FN#14] There are many kinds of Kohls (Hindos. Surm\u00e1 and\nKajjal) used in medicine and magic. See Herklots, p. 227.\n\n[FN#15] Arab. \"Sab\u00edkah\" = bar, lamina, from \"Sabk\" = melting, smelting: the lump in the crucible would be hammered out into an ingot in order to conceal the operation\n\n[FN#16] i.e. \u00a3375.\n\n[FN#17] Such report has cost many a life: the suspicion was and is still deadly as heresy in a \"new Christian\" under the Inquisition.\n\n[FN#18] Here there is a double entendre: openly it means, \"Few men recognise as they should the bond of bread and salt:\" the other sense would be (and that accounts for the smile), \"What the deuce do I care for the bond?\"\n\n[FN#19] Arab. \"Kabb\u00e1t\" in the Bresl. Edit. \"Ka'ab\u00e1n \": Lane (iii. 519) reads \"Ka'\u00e1b plur. of Ka'ab a cup.\"\n\n[FN#20] A most palpable sneer. But Hasan is purposely represented as a \"softy\" till aroused and energized by the magic of Love.\n\n[FN#21] Arab. \"Al-iks\u00edr\" (see Night dcclxxix, supra p. 9): the Greek word which has returned from a trip to Arabia and reappeared in Europe as \"Elixir.\"\n\n[FN#22] \"Aw\u00e1k\" plur. of \"Uk\u00edyah,\" the well-known \"oke,\" or \"ocque,\" a weight varying from 1 to 2 lbs. In Morocco it is pronounced \"Wuk\u00edyah,\" and = the Spanish ounce (p. 279 Rudimentos del Arabe Vulgar, etc., by Fr. Jos\u00e9 de Lorchundi, Madrid, Rivadencyra, 1872).\n\n[FN#23] These lines have occurred in vol. iv. 267, where references to other places are given. I quote Lane by way of variety. In the text they are supposed to have been written by the Persian, a hint that Hasan would never be seen again.\n\n[FN#24] i.e. a superfetation of iniquity.\n\n[FN#25] Arab. \"Kurb\u00e1n\" = offering, oblation to be brought to the priest's house or to the altar of the tribal God Yahveh, Jehovah (Levit. ii, 2-3 etc.). Amongst the Maronites Kurban is the host (-wafer) and amongst the Turks 'Id al-Kurban (sacrifice-feast) is the Greater Bayram, the time of Pilgrimage.\n\n[FN#26] N\u00e1r = fire, being feminine, like the names of the other \"elements.\"\n\n[FN#27] The Egyptian Kurb\u00e1j of hippopotamus-hide (Burkh. Nubia, pp. 62,282) or elephant-hide (Turner ii. 365). Hence the Fr. Cravache (as Cravat is from Croat).\n\n[FN#28] In Mac. Edit. \"Bahriyah\": in Bresl. Edit. \"Naw\u00e1t\u00edyah.\"\nSee vol. vi. 242, for , navita, nauta.\n\n[FN#29] In Bresl. Edit. (iv. 285) \"Y\u00e1 Khw\u00e1jah,\" for which see vol. vi. 46.\n\n[FN#30] Arab. \"Tabl\" (vulg. baz) = a kettle-drum about half a foot broad held in the left hand and beaten with a stick or leathern thong. Lane refers to his description (M.E. ii. chapt. v.) of the Dervish's drum of tinned copper with parchment face, and renders Zakhmah or Zukhmah (strap, stirrup-leather) by \"plectrum,\" which gives a wrong idea. The Bresl. Edit. ignores the strap.\n\n[FN#31] The \"Spartivento\" of Italy, mostly a tall headland which divides the clouds. The most remarkable feature of the kind is the Dalmatian Island, Pelagosa.\n\n[FN#32] The \"Rocs\" (Al-Arkh\u00e1kh) in the Bresl. Edit. (iv. 290).\nThe Rakham = aquiline vulture.\n\n[FN#33] Lane here quotes a similar incident in the romance \"Sayf Z\u00fa al-Yazan,\" so called from the hero, whose son, Misr, is sewn up in a camel's hide by Bahr\u00e1m, a treacherous Magian, and is carried by the Rukhs to a mountain-top.\n\n[FN#34] These lines occurred in Night xxvi. vol. i. 275: I quote\nMr. Payne for variety.\n\n[FN#35] Thus a Moslem can not only circumcise and marry himself but can also bury canonically himself. The form of this prayer is given by Lane M. E. chapt. xv.\n\n[FN#36] i.e. If I fail in my self-imposed duty, thou shalt charge me therewith on the Judgment-day.\n\n[FN#37] Arab. \"Al-Alw\u00e1n,\" plur. of laun (colour). The latter in Egyptian Arabic means a \"dish of meat.\" See Burckhardt No. 279. I repeat that the great traveller's \"Arabic Proverbs\" wants republishing for two reasons. First he had not sufficient command of English to translate with the necessary laconism and assonance: secondly in his day British Philistinism was too rampant to permit a literal translation. Consequently the book falls short of what the Oriental student requires; and I have prepared it for my friend Mr. Quaritch.\n\n[FN#38] i.e. Lofty, high-builded. See Night dcclxviii. vol. vii. p. 347. In the Bresl. Edit. Al-Mas\u00edd (as in Al-Kazw\u00edni): in the Mac. Edit. Al-Mashid\n\n[FN#39] Arab. \"Munkati\" here = cut off from the rest of the world. Applied to a man, and a popular term of abuse in Al-Hij\u00e1z, it means one cut off from the blessings of Allah and the benefits of mankind; a pauvre sire. (Pilgrimage ii. 22.)\n\n[FN#40] Arab. \"Baras au Juz\u00e1m,\" the two common forms of leprosy. See vol. iv. 51. Popular superstition in Syria holds that coition during the menses breeds the Juz\u00e1m, D\u00e1a al-Kab\u00edr (Great Evil) or D\u00e1a al-F\u00edl (Elephantine Evil), i.e. Elephantiasis and that the days between the beginning of the flow (Sab\u00edl) to that of coition shows the age when the progeny will be attacked; for instance if it take place on the first day, the disease will appear in the tenth year, on the fourth the fortieth and so on. The only diseases really dreaded by the Badawin are leprosy and small-pox. Coition during the menses is forbidden by all Eastern faiths under the severest penalties. Al-Mas'\u00fadi relates how a man thus begotten became a determined enemy of Ali; and the ancient Jews attributed the magical powers of Joshua Nazarenus to this accident of his birth, the popular idea being that sorcerers are thus impurely engendered.\n\n[FN#41] By adoption - See vol. iii. 151. This sudden affection (not love) suggests the \"Come to my arms, my slight acquaintance!\" of the Anti-Jacobin. But it is true to Eastern nature; and nothing can be more charming than this fast friendship between the Princess and Hasan.\n\n[FN#42] En tout bien et en tout honneur, be it understood.\n\n[FN#43] He had done nothing of the kind; but the feminine mind is prone to exaggeration. Also Hasan had told them a fib, to prejudice them against the Persian.\n\n[FN#44] These nervous movements have been reduced to a system in the Turk. \"Ihtil\u00e1jn\u00e1meh\" = Book of palpitations, prognosticating from the subsultus tendinum and other involuntary movements of the body from head to foot; according to Ja'afar the Just, Daniel the Prophet, Alexander the Great; the Sages of Persia and the Wise Men of Greece. In England we attend chiefly to the eye and ear.\n\n[FN#45] Revenge, amongst the Arabs, is a sacred duty; and, in their state of civilization, society could not be kept together without it. So the slaughter of a villain is held to be a sacrifice to Allah, who amongst Christians claims for Himself the monopoly of vengeance.\n\n[FN#46] Arab. \"Zind\u00edk.\" See vol. v. 230.\n\n[FN#47] Lane translates this \"put for him the remaining food and water;\" but Ai-Akhar (Mac. Edit.) evidently refers to the Naj\u00edb (dromedary).\n\n[FN#48] We can hardly see the heroism of the deed, but it must be remembered that Bahram was a wicked sorcerer, whom it was every good Moslem's bounden duty to slay. Compare the treatment of witches in England two centuries ago.\n\n[FN#49] The mother in Arab tales is ma m\u00e8re, now becoming somewhat ridiculous in France on account of the over use of that venerable personage.\n\n[FN#50] The forbidden closet occurs also in Sayf Z\u00fa al-Yazan, who enters it and finds the bird-girls. Tr\u00e9butien ii, 208 says, \"Il est assez remarquable qu'il existe en Allemagne une tradition \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s semblable, et qui a fourni le sujet d'un des contes de Musaeus, entitul\u00e9, le voile enlev\u00e9.\" Here Hasan is artfully left alone in a large palace without other companions but his thoughts and the reader is left to divine the train of ideas which drove him to open the door.\n\n[FN#51] Arab. \"Buhayrah\" (Bresl. Edit. \"Bahrah\"), the tank or cistern in the Hosh (court-yard) of an Eastern house. Here, however, it is a rain-cistern on the flat roof of the palace (See Night dcccviii).\n\n[FN#52] This description of the view is one of the most gorgeous in The Nights.\n\n[FN#53] Here again are the \"Swan-maidens\" (See vol. v. 346) \"one of the primitive myths, the common heritage of the whole Aryan (Iranian) race.\" In Persia Bahram-i-G\u00far when carried off by the D\u00edv Sap\u00edd seizes the Peri's dove-coat: in Santh\u00e1li folk-lore Torica, the Goatherd, steals the garment doffed by one of the daughters of the sun; and hence the twelve birds of Russian Story. To the same cycle belong the Seal-tales of the Faroe Islands (Thorpe's Northern Mythology) and the wise women or mermaids of Shetland (Hibbert). Wayland the smith captures a wife by seizing a mermaid's raiment and so did Sir Hag\u00e1n by annexing the wardrobe of a Danubian water-nymph. Lettsom, the translator, mixes up this swan-raiment with that of the Valkyries or Choosers of the Slain. In real life stealing women's clothes is an old trick and has often induced them, after having been seen naked, to offer their persons spontaneously. Of this I knew two cases in India, where the theft is justified by divine example. The blue god Krishna, a barbarous and grotesque Hindu Apollo, robbed the raiment of the pretty Gop\u00e1l\u00eds (cowherdesses) who were bathing in the Arjun River and carried them to the top of a Kunduna tree; nor would he restore them till he had reviewed the naked girls and taken one of them to wife. See also Imr al-Kays (of the Mu'allakah) with \"Onaiza\" at the port of Daratjuljul (Clouston's Arabian Poetry, p.4). A critic has complained of my tracing the origin of the Swan-maiden legend to the physical resemblance between the bird and a high-bred girl (vol. v. 346). I should have explained my theory which is shortly, that we must seek a material basis for all so-called supernaturalisms, and that anthropomorphism satisfactorily explains the Swan-maiden, as it does the angel and the devil. There is much to say on the subject; but this is not the place for long discussion.\n\n[FN#54] Arab. \"Nafs Amm\u00e1rah,\" corresponding with our canting term \"The Flesh.\" Nafs al-N\u00e1t\u00edkah is the intellectual soul or function; Nafs al-Ghazab\u00edyah = the animal function and Nafs al Shahw\u00e1n\u00edyah = the vegetative property.\n\n[FN#55] The lines occur in vol. ii. 331: I have quoted Mr.\nPayne. Here they are singularly out of place.\n[FN#56] Not the \"green gown\" of Anglo-India i.e. a white ball-dress with blades of grass sticking to it in consequence of a \"fall backwards.\"\n\n[FN#57] These lines occur in vol. i. 219: I have borrowed from\nTorrens (p. 219).\n[FN#58] The appearance of which ends the fast and begins the\nLesser Festival. See vol. i. 84.\n[FN#59] See note, vol. i. 84, for notices of the large navel; much appreciated by Easterns.\n\n[FN#60] Arab. \"Sh\u00e1'ir Al-Walah\u00e1n\" = the love-distraught poet; Lane has \"a distracted poet.\" My learned friend Professor Aloys Sprenger has consulted, upon the subject of Al-Walah\u00e1n the well-known Professor of Arabic at Halle, Dr. Thorbeck, who remarks that the word (here as further on) must be an adjective, mad, love-distraught, not a \"lakab\" or poetical cognomen. He generally finds it written Al-Sh\u00e1'ir al-Walah\u00e1n (the love-demented poet) not Al-Walah\u00e1n al-Sh\u00e1'ir = Walah\u00e1n the Poet. Note this burst of song after the sweet youth falls in love: it explains the cause of verse-quotation in The Nights, poetry being the natural language of love and battle.\n\n[FN#61] \"Them\" as usual for \"her.\"\n\n[FN#62] Here Lane proposes a transposition, for \"Wa-huw\u00e1 (and he) fi'l-hubbi,\" to read \"Fi 'l-hubbi wa huwa (wa-hwa);\" but the latter is given in the Mac. Edit.\n\n[FN#63] For the pun in \"Sabr\"=aloe or patience. See vol. i. 138. In Herr Landberg (i. 93) we find a misunderstanding of the couplet\u2014\n\n\"Aw'\u00e1kibu s-sabri (K\u00e1la ba'azuhum)\nMahm\u00fadah: Kultu, 'khshi an takhirrin\u00ed.'\"\n\n\"The effects of patience\" (or aloes) quoth one \"are praiseworthy!\" Quoth I, \"Much I fear lest it make me stool.\" Mahm\u00fadah is not only un laxatif, but a slang name for a confection of aloes.\n\n[FN#64] Arab. \"Ak\u00fana fid\u00e1-ka.\" Fid\u00e1 = ransom, self-sacrifice and\nFid\u00e1'an = instead of. The phrase, which everywhere occurs in The\nNights, means, \"I would give my life to save thine \"\n\n[FN#65] Thus accounting for his sickness, improbably enough but in flattering way. Like a good friend (feminine) she does not hesitate a moment in prescribing a fib.\n\n[FN#66] i.e. the 25,000 Amazons who in the Bresl. Edit. (ii. 308) are all made to be the King's Ban\u00e1t\" = daughters or prot\u00e9g\u00e9es. The Amazons of Dahome (see my \"Mission\") who may now number 5,000 are all officially wives of the King and are called by the lieges \"our mothers.\"\n\n[FN#67] The tale-teller has made up his mind about the damsel; although in this part of the story she is the chief and eldest sister and subsequently she appears as the youngest daughter of the supreme Jinn King. The mystification is artfully explained by the extraordinary likeness of the two sisters. (See Night dcccxi.)\n\n[FN#68] This is a reminiscence of the old-fashioned \"marriage by capture,\" of which many traces survive, even among the civilised who wholly ignore their origin.\n\n[FN#69] Meaning her companions and suite.\n\n[FN#70] Arab. \"'Ab\u00e1ah\" vulg. \"'Ab\u00e1yah.\" See vol. ii. 133.\n\n[FN#71] Feet in the East lack that development of sebaceous glands which afflicts Europeans.\n\n[FN#72] i.e. cutting the animals' throats after Moslem law.\n\n[FN#73] In Night dcclxxviii. supra p.5, we find the orthodox Moslem doctrine that \"a single mortal is better in Allah's sight than a thousand Jinns.\" For, I repeat, Al-Islam systematically exalts human nature which Christianity takes infinite trouble to degrade and debase. The results of its ignoble teaching are only too evident in the East: the Christians of the so-called (and miscalled) \"Holy Land\" are a disgrace to the faith and the idiomatic Persian term for a Nazarene is \"Tars\u00e1\" = funker, coward.\n\n[FN#74] Arab. \"Sakaba K\u00farah\u00e1;\" the forge in which children are hammered out?\n\n[FN#75] Arab. \"M\u00e1 al-Mal\u00e1hat\" = water (brilliancy) of beauty.\n\n[FN#76] The fourth of the Seven Heavens, the \"Garden of\nEternity,\" made of yellow coral.\n[FN#77] How strange this must sound to the Young Woman of London in the nineteenth century.\n\n[FN#78] \"Forty days\" is a quasi-religious period amongst Moslem for praying, fasting and religious exercises: here it represents our \"honey-moon.\" See vol. v. p. 62.\n\n[FN#79] Y\u00e1 layta, still popular. Herr Carlo Landberg (Proverbes et Dictons du Peuple Arabe, vol. i. of Syria, Leyden, E. J. Brill, 1883) explains layta for rayta (=raayta) by permutation of liquids and argues that the contraction is ancient (p. 42). But the Herr is no Arabist: \"Layta\" means \"would to Heaven,\" or, simply \"I wish,\" \"I pray\" (for something possible or impossible); whilst \"La'alla\" (perhaps, it may be) prays only for the possible: and both are simply particles governing the noun in the oblique or accusative case.\n\n[FN#80] \"His\" for \"her,\" i.e. herself, making somewhat of confusion between her state and that of her son.\n\n[FN#81] i.e. his mother; the words are not in the Mac. Edit.\n\n[FN#82] Baghdad is called House of Peace, amongst other reasons, from the Dijlah (Tigris) River and Valley \"of Peace.\" The word was variously written Baghd\u00e1d, B\u00e1ghd\u00e1d, (our old Bughdaud and Bagdat), Baghz\u00e1z, Baghz\u00e1n, Baghd\u00e1n, Baghz\u00e1m and Maghd\u00e1d as Makkah and Bakkah (Koran iii. 90). Religious Moslems held B\u00e1gh (idol) and D\u00e1d (gift) an ill-omened conjunction, and the Greeks changed it to Eirenopolis. (See Ouseley's Oriental Collcctions, vol. i. pp. 18-20.)\n\n[FN#83] This is a popular saying but hardly a \"vulgar proverb.\"\n(Lane iii. 522.) It reminds rather of Shakespear's:\n\"So loving to my mother,\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\nVisit her face too roughly.\"\n\n[FN#84] i.e. God forbid that I should oppose thee!\n\n[FN#85] Here the writer again forgets apparently, that Shahrazad is speaking: she may, however, use the plural for the singular when speaking of herself.\n\n[FN#86] i.e. She would have pleaded ill-treatment and lawfully demanded to be sold.\n\n[FN#87] The Hindus speak of \"the only bond that woman knows\u2014her heart.\"\n\n[FN#88] i.e. a rarity, a present (especially in Persian).\n\n[FN#89] Arab. \"Al-bis\u00e1t\" wa'l-masnad lit. the carpet and the cushion.\n\n[FN#90] For \"B\u00e1b al-bahr\" and \"B\u00e1b al-Barr\" see vol. iii. 281.\n\n[FN#91] She was the daughter of Ja'afar bin Mans\u00far; but, as will be seen, The Nights again and again called her father Al-K\u00e1sim.\n\n[FN#92] This is an error for the fifth which occurs in the popular saying, \"Is he the fifth of the sons of Al-Abb\u00e1s!\" i.e. Harun al-Rashid. Lane (note, in loco) thus accounts for the frequent mention of the Caliph, the greatest of the Abbasides in The Nights. But this is a causa non causa.\n\n[FN#93] i.e. I find thy beauty all-sufficient. So the proverb \"The son of the quarter (young neighbour) filleth not the eye,\" which prefers a stranger.\n\n[FN#94] They are mere doggerel, like most of the pieces de circonstance.\n\n[FN#95] Afterwards called W\u00e1k W\u00e1k, and in the Bresl. Edit. W\u00e1k al-W\u00e1k. See Lane's notes upon these Islands. Arab Geographers evidently speak of two Wak Waks. Ibn al-Fakih and Al-Mas'\u00fadi (Fr. Transl., vol. iii. 6-7) locate one of them in East Africa beyond Zanzibar and Sofala. \"Le territoire des Zendjes (Zanzibar-Negroids) commence au canal (Al-Khalij) d\u00e9riv\u00e9 du haut Nil (the Juln River?) et se prolonge jusqu'au pays de Sofalah et des Wak-Wak.\" It is simply the peninsula of Guardafui (Jard Hafun) occupied by the Gallas, pagans and Christians, before these were ousted by the Moslem Somal; and the former perpetually ejaculated \"Wak\" (God) as Moslems cry upon Allah. This identification explains a host of other myths such as the Amazons, who as Marco Polo tells us held the \"Female Island\" Socotra (Yule ii. 396). The fruit which resembled a woman's head (whence the puelloe Wakwakienses hanging by the hair from trees), and which when ripe called out \"Wak Wak\" and \"Allah al-Khall\u00e1k\" (the Creator) refers to the Calabash-tree (Adausonia digitata), that grotesque growth, a vegetable elephant, whose gourds, something larger than a man's head, hang by a slender filament. Similarly the \"cocoa\" got its name, in Port. = Goblin, from the fancied face at one end. The other Wak Wak has been identified in turns with the Seychelles, Madagascar, Malacca, Sunda or Java (this by Langl\u00e8s), China and Japan. The learned Prof. de Goeje (Arabishe Berichten over Japan, Amsterdam, Muller, 1880) informs us that in Canton the name of Japan is Wo-Kwok, possibly a corruption of Koku-tan, the ebony-tree (Diospyros ebenum) which Ibn Khor-d\u00e1bah and others find together with gold in an island 4,500 parasangs from Suez and East of China. And we must remember that Basrah was the chief starting-place for the Celestial Empire during the rule of the Tang dynasty (seventh and ninth centuries). Colonel J. W. Watson of Bombay suggests New Guinea or the adjacent islands where the Bird of Paradise is said to cry \"Wak Wak!\" Mr. W. F. Kirby in the Preface (p. ix.) to his neat little book \"The New Arabian Nights,\" says: \"The Islands of Wak-Wak, seven years' journey from Bagdad, in the story of Hasan, have receded to a distance of a hundred and fifty years' journey in that of Majin (of Khorasan). There is no doubt(?) that the Cora Islands, near New Guinea, are intended; for the wonderful fruits which grow there are Birds of Paradise, which settle in flocks on the trees at sunset and sunrise, uttering this very cry.\" Thus, like Ophir, Wak Wak has wandered all over the world and has been found even in Peru by the Turkish work T\u00e1rikh al-Hind al-Gharbi = History of the West Indies (Orient. Coll. iii 189).\n\n[FN#96] I accept the emendation of Lane's Shaykh, \"Nas\u00edm \"\n(Zephyr) for \"Nad\u00edm \" (cup-companion).\n\n[FN#97] \"Jannat al-N\u00e1'im\" = Garden of Delights is No. V Heaven, made of white diamond.\n\n[FN#98] This appears to her very prettily put.\n\n[FN#99] This is the \"House of Sadness\" of our old chivalrous Romances. See chapt. vi. of \"Palmerin of England,\" by Francisco de Moraes (ob. 1572), translated by old Anthony Munday (dateless, 1590?) and \"corrected\" (read spoiled) by Robert Southey, London, Longmans, 1807.\n\n[FN#100] The lines have occurred in Night clix. (vol. iii. 183), I quote Mr. Payne who, like Lane, prefers \"in my bosom\" to \"beneath my ribs.\"\n\n[FN#101] In this tale the Bresl. Edit. more than once adds \"And let us and you send a blessing to the Lord of Lords\" (or to \"Mohammed,\" or to the \"Prophet\"); and in vol. v. p. 52 has a long prayer. This is an act of contrition in the tale-teller for romancing against the expressed warning of the Founder of Al-Islam.\n\n[FN#102] From Bresl. Edit. (vi. 29): the four in the Mac. Edit. are too irrelevant.\n\n[FN#103] Arab. \"Ghay\u00far\"\u2014jealous, an admirable epithet which\nLane dilutes to \"changeable\"\u2014making a truism of a metaphor.\n\n[FN#104] These lines have occurred before. I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#105] i.e. One fated to live ten years.\n\n[FN#106] This poetical way of saying \"fourteen\" suggests Camoens\n(The Lusiads) Canto v. 2.\n[FN#107] Arab. \"Surrah,\" lit. = a purse: a few lines lower down it is called \"'Ulbah\" = a box which, of course, may have contained the bag.\n\n[FN#108] The month which begins the Moslem year.\n\n[FN#109] As an Arab often does when deep in thought. Lane appositely quotes John viii. 6. \"Jonas stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.\" Mr. Payne translates, \"He fell a-drumming on the earth with his fingers,\" but this does not complete the sense.\n\n[FN#110] i.e.\"And the peace of Allah be upon thee! that will end thy story.\" The Arab formula, \"Wa al-Sal\u00e1m\" (pron. Wassal\u00e1m) is used in a variety of senses.\n\n[FN#111] Like Camoens, one of the model lovers, he calls upon\nLove to torment him still more\u2014ad majorern Dei (amoris) gloriam.\n[FN#112] Pron. Aboor-Ruwaysh. \"The Father of the little Feather\": he is afterwards called \"Son of the daughter of the accursed Iblis\"; yet, as Lane says, \"he appears to be a virtuous person.\"\n\n[FN#113] Arab. \"Kantara al-lij\u00e1m fi Karb\u00fas (bow) sarjih.\"\n\n[FN#114] I do not translate \"beckoned\" because the word would give a wrong idea. Our beckoning with the finger moved towards the beckoner makes the so-beckoned Eastern depart in all haste. To call him you must wave the hand from you.\n\n[FN#115] The Arabs knew what large libraries were; and a learned man could not travel without camel-loads of dictionaries.\n\n[FN#116] Arab. \"Adim;\" now called Bulgh\u00e1r, our Moroccan leather.\n\n[FN#117] Arab. \"Zin\u00e1d,\" which Lane renders by \"instruments for striking fire,\" and Mr. Payne, after the fashion of the translators of Al-Hariri, \"flint and steel.\"\n\n[FN#118] A congener of Hasan and Husayn, little used except in Syria where it is a favourite name for Christians. The Muh\u00edt of Butrus Al-Bost\u00e1ni (s.v.) tells us that it also means a bird called Ab\u00fa Hasan and supplies various Egyptian synonyms. In Mod. Arab. Grammar the form Fa''\u00fal is a diminutive as Hamm\u00fad for Ahmad, 'Amm\u00far for 'Amr\u00fa. So the fem. form, Fa''\u00falah, e.g. Khadd\u00fagah = little Khadijah and Naff\u00fasah=little Nafisah; Ar'\u00farah = little clitoris - whereas in Heb. it is an incrementative e.g. dabb\u00falah a large dablah (cake or lump of dried figs, etc.).\n\n[FN#119] In the Mac. Edit. \"Soldiers of Al-Daylam\" i.e. warlike as the Daylamites or Medes. See vol. ii. 94.\n\n[FN#120] Bilk\u00eds, it will be remembered, is the Arab. name of the\nQueen of Sheba who visited Solomon. In Abyssinia she is termed\nKebra z\u00e1 negest or z\u00e1 makad\u00e1, the latter (according to Ferdinand\nWerne's \"African Wanderings,\" Longmans, 1852) being synonymous\nwith Ityopia or Habash (Ethiopia or Abyssinia).\n\n[FN#121] Arab. \"Dakkah,\" which Lane translates by \"settee.\"\n\n[FN#122] Arab. \"Ambar al-Kh\u00e1m\" the latter word (raw) being pure\nPersian.\n\n[FN#123] The author neglects to mention the ugliest part of old-womanhood in the East, long empty breasts like tobacco-pouches. In youth the bosom is beautifully high, arched and rounded, firm as stone to the touch, with the nipples erect and pointing outwards. But after the girl-mother's first child (in Europe le premier embellit) all changes. Nature and bodily power have been overtasked; then comes the long suckling at the mother's expense: the extension of the skin and the enlargement of its vessels are too sudden and rapid for the diminished ability of contraction and the bad food aids in the continual consumption of vitality. Hence, among Eastern women age and ugliness are synonymous. It is only in the highest civilisation that we find the handsome old woman.\n\n[FN#124] The name has occurred in the Knightly tale of King Omar and his sons, Vol. ii. 269. She is here called Mother of Calamities,but in p. 123, Vol. iv. of the Mac. Edit. she becomes \"Lady (Z\u00e1t) al-Daw\u00e1hi.\" It will be remembered that the title means calamitous to the foe.\n\n[FN#125] By this address she assured him that she had no design upon his chastity. In Moslem lands it is always advisable to accost a strange woman, no matter how young, with, \"Y\u00e1 Umm\u00ed!\" = O my mother. This is pledging one's word, as it were, not to make love to her.\n\n[FN#126] Apparently the Wakites numbered their Islands as the Anglo-Americans do their streets. For this they have been charged with \"want of imagination\"; but the custom is strictly classical. See at Pompeii \"Reg (io) I; Ins (ula) 1, Via Prima, Secunda,\" etc.\n\n[FN#127] These are the Puell\u00e6 Wakwakienses of whom Ibn Al-Wardi relates after an ocular witness, \"Here too is a tree which bears fruits like women who have fair faces and are hung by their hair. They come forth from integuments like large leathern bags (calabash-gourds?) and when they sense air and sun they cry 'Wak! Wak!' (God! God!) till their hair is cut, and when it is cut they die; and the islanders understand this cry wherefrom they augure ill.\" The Aj\u00e1ib al-Hind (chapt. xv.) places in Wak-land the Samandal, a bird which enters the fire without being burnt evidently the Egyptian \"Pi-Benni,\" which the Greeks metamorphised to \"Phoenix.\" It also mentions a hare-like animal, now male then female, and the Somal behind Cape Guardafui tell the same tale of their Cynhy\u00e6nas.\n\n[FN#128] i.e. I will keep thee as though thou wert the apple of my eye.\n\n[FN#129] A mere exaggeration of the \"Gull-fairs\" noted by travellers in sundry islands as Ascension and the rock off Brazilian Santos.\n\n[FN#130] Arab. \"K\u00e1mil wa Bas\u00edt wa W\u00e1fir\" = the names of three popular metres, for which see the Terminal Essay.\n\n[FN#131] Arab. \"Man\u00e1shif\" = drying towels, Plur. of Minshafah, and the popular term which Dr. Jonathan Swift corrupted to \"Munnassaf.\" Lane (Nights, Introduct. p. ix.).\n\n[FN#132] Arab. \"Shafaif\" opposed to \"Shafah\" the mouth-lips.\n\n[FN#133] Fountains of Paradise. This description is a fair instance of how the Saj'a (prose-rhyme) dislocates the order; an Arab begins with hair, forehead, eyebrows and lashes and when he reaches the nose, he slips down to the toes for the sake of the assonance. If the latter be neglected the whole list of charms must be otherwise ordered; and the student will compare Mr. Payne's version of this passage with mine.\n\n[FN#134] A fair specimen of the Arab logogriph derived from the Abjad Alphabet which contains only the Hebrew and Syriac letters not the six Arabic. Thus 4 X 5=20 which represents the Kaf (K) and 6 X 10=60, or Sin (S). The whole word is thus \"Kos\", the Greek or , and the lowest word, in Persian as in Arabic, for the female pudenda, extensively used in vulgar abuse. In my youth we had at the University something of the kind,\n\nTo five and five and fifty-five\nThe first of letters add\nTo make a thing to please a King\nAnd drive a wise man mad.\n\nAnswer VVLVA. Very interesting to the anthropological student is this excursus of Hasan, who after all manner of hardships and horrors and risking his life to recover his wife and children, breaks out into song on the subject of her privities. And it can hardly be tale-teller's gag as both verse and prose show considerable art in composition. (See p. 348.)\n\nSupplementary Note To Hasan of Bassorah.\n\nNote(p.93)\u2014There is something wondrous na\u00efve in a lover who, when asked by his mistress to sing a song in her honour, breaks out into versical praises of her parts. But even the classical Arab authors did not disdain such themes. See in Al-Har\u00edr\u00ed (Ass. of Mayy\u00e1farik\u00edn) where Ab\u00fa Zayd laments the impotency of old age in form of a Rasy or funeral oration (Preston p. 484, and Chenery p. 221). It completely deceived Sir William Jones, who inserted it into the chapter \"De Poesi Funebri,\" p. 527 (Poeseos Asiatic\u00e6 Commentarii), gravely noting, \"H\u00e6c Elegia non admodum dissimilis esse videtur pulcherrimi illius carminis de Sauli et Jonathani obitu; at que ade\u00f2 versus iste ubi provocant adversarios nunquam rediit a pugn\u00e6 contentione sine spiculo sanguine imbuto, ex Hebr\u00e6oreddi videtur,\n\nA sanguine occisorum, a fortium virorum adipe,\nArcus Jonathani non rediit irritus.\"\nI need hardly say with Captain Lockett (226) that this \"Sabb warrior,\" this Arabian Achilles, is the celebrated Bonus Deus or Hellespontiacus of the Ancients. The oration runs thus:\u2014\n\nO folk I have a wondrous tale, so rare\nMuch shall it profit hearers wise and ware!\nI saw in salad-years a potent Brave\nAnd sharp of edge and point his warrior glaive;\nWho entered joust and list with hardiment\nFearless of risk, of victory confident,\nHis vigorous onset straitest places oped\nAnd easy passage through all narrows groped:\nHe ne'er encountered foe in single fight\nBut came from tilt with spear in blood stained bright;\nNor stormed a fortress howso strong and stark\u2014\nWith fenc\u00e8d gates defended deep and dark\u2014\nWhen shown his flag without th' auspicious cry\n\"Aidance from Allah and fair victory nigh!\"\nThus wise full many a night his part he played\nIn strength and youthtide's stately garb arrayed,\nDealing to fair young girl delicious joy\nAnd no less welcome to the blooming boy.\nBut Time ne'er ceased to stint his wondrous strength\n(Steadfast and upright as the gallow's length)\nUntil the Nights o'erthrew him by their might\nAnd friends contemned him for a feckless wight;\nNor was a wizard but who wasted skill\nOver his case, nor leach could heal his ill.\nThen he abandoned arms abandoned him\nWho gave and took salutes so fierce and grim;\nAnd now lies prostrate drooping haughty crest;\nFor who lives longest him most ills molest.\nThen see him, here he lies on bier for bet;\u2014\nWho will a shroud bestow on stranger dead?\n\nA fair measure of the difference between Eastern and Western manners is afforded by such a theme being treated by their gravest writers and the verses being read and heard by the gravest and most worshipful men, whilst amongst us Preston and Chenery do not dare even to translate them. The latter, indeed, had all that immodest modesty for which English professional society is notable in this xixth century. He spoiled by needlessly excluding from a scientific publication (Mem. R.A.S.) all of my Proverbia Communia Syriaca (see Unexplored Sryia, i. 364) and every item which had a shade of double entendre. But Nemesis frequently found him out: during his short and obscure rule in Printing House Square, The Thunderer was distinguished by two of the foulest indecencies that ever appeared in an English paper.\n\nThe well-known Koranic verse, whereby Allah is introduced into an indecent tale and \"Holy Writ\" is punned upon. I have noticed (iii. 206) that victory Fat'h lit.=opening everything (as e.g. a maidenhead).\n\n[FN#135] Egyptian and Syrian vulgar term for Maw\u00e1l\u00edyah or Maw\u00e1liyah, a short poem on subjects either classical or vulgar. It generally consists of five lines all rhyming except the penultimate. The metre is a species of the Bas\u00edt which, however, admits of considerable poetical license; this being according to Lane the usual \"Weight,\"\n\n/ / / .\n\nThe scheme is distinctly anap\u00e6stic and Mr. Lyall (Translations of Ancient Arabic Poetry) compares with a cognate metre, the Taw\u00edl, certain lines in Abt Vogler, e.g.\n\n\"Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told.\"\n\n[FN#136] i.e. repeat the chapter of the Koran termed The Opening, and beginning with these words, \"Have we not opened thy breast for thee and eased thee of thy burden which galled thy back? *** Verily with the difficulty cometh ease!\"\u2014Koran xciv. vol. 1, 5.\n\n[FN#137] Lane renders Nur al-Hud\u00e0 (Light of Salvation) by Light of Day which would be Nur al-Had\u00e0.\n\n[FN#138] In the Bresl. Edit. \"Y\u00e1 Sal\u00e1m\"=O safety!\u2014a vulgar ejaculation.\n\n[FN#139] A favourite idiom meaning from the mischief which may (or will) come from the Queen.\n\n[FN#140] He is not strong-minded but his feminine persistency of purpose, likest to that of a sitting hen, is confirmed by the \"Consolations of religion.\" The character is delicately drawn.\n\n[FN#141] In token that she intended to act like a man.\n\n[FN#142] This is not rare even in real life: Moslem women often hide and change their names for superstitious reasons, from the husband and his family.\n\n[FN#143] Arab. \"Sabab\" which also means cause. Vol. ii. 14.\nThere is the same metaphorical use of \"Habl\"= cord and cause.\n\n[FN#144] Arab. \"Him\u00e0,\" a word often occurring in Arab poetry, domain, a pasture or watered land forcibly kept as far as a dog's bark would sound by some masterful chief like \"King Kulayb.\" (See vol. ii. 77.) This tenure was forbidden by Mohammed except for Allah and the Apostle (i.e. himself). Lane translates it \"asylum.\"\n\n[FN#145] She was a maid and had long been of marriageable age.\n\n[FN#146] The young man had evidently \"kissed the Blarney stone\"; but the flattery is the more telling as he speaks from the heart.\n\n[FN#147] \"Inshallah \" here being= D. V.\n\n[FN#148] i.e. The \"Place of Light\" (Pharos), or of Splendour. Here we find that Hasan's wife is the youngest sister, but with an extraordinary resemblance to the eldest, a very masterful young person. The anagnorisis is admirably well managed.\n\n[FN#149] i.e. the sweetmeats of the feast provided for the returning traveller. The old woman (like others) cannot resist the temptation of a young man's lips. Happily for him she goes so far and no farther.\n\n[FN#150] The first, fourth, fifth and last names have already occurred: the others are in order, Star o' Morn, Sun of Undtirn and Honour of Maidenhood. They are not merely fanciful, but are still used in Egypt and Syria.\n\n[FN#151] Arab. \"F\u00e1jirah\" and elsewhere \"Ahirah,\" =whore and strumpet used often in loose talk as mere abuse without special meaning.\n\n[FN#152] This to Westerns would seem a most improbable detail, but Easterns have their own ideas concerning \"Al-Muhabbat al-ghariziyah\" =natural affection, blood speaking to blood, etc.\n\n[FN#153] One of the Hells (see vol. iv. 143). Here it may be advisable to give the names of the Seven Heavens (which are evidently based upon Ptolemaic astronomy) and which correspond with the Seven Hells after the fashion of Arabian system-mania. (1) Dar al-Jal\u00e1l (House of Glory) made of pearls; (2) D\u00e1r al-Sal\u00e1m (of Rest), rubies and jacinths; (3) Jannat al-Maaw\u00e1 (Garden of Mansions, not \"of mirrors,\" as Herklots has it, p. 98), made of yellow copper; (4) Jannat al-Khuld (of Eternity), yellow coral; (5) Jannat al-Na'\u00edm (of Delights), white diamond; (6) Jannat al-Firdaus (of Paradise), red gold; and (7) Jannat al-'Adn (of Eden, or Al-Kar\u00e1r= of everlasting abode, which some make No. 8), of red pearls or pure musk. The seven Hells are given in vol. v. 241; they are intended for Moslems (Jahannam); Christians (Laz\u00e0); Jews (Hutamah); Sabians (Sa'ir); Guebles (Sakar); Pagans or idolaters (Jah\u00edm); and Hypocrites (H\u00e1wiyah).\n\n[FN#154] Arab. \"'Atb,\" more literally= \"blame,\" \"reproach.\"\n\n[FN#155] Bresl. Edit. In the Mac. \"it returned to the place whence I had brought it\"\u2014an inferior reading.\n\n[FN#156] The dreams play an important part in the Romances of Chivalry, e.g. the dream of King Perion in Amadis de Gaul, chapt. ii. (London; Longmans, 1803).\n\n[FN#157] Amongst Moslems bastardy is a sore offence and a love-child is exceedingly rare. The girl is not only carefully guarded but she also guards herself knowing that otherwise she will not find a husband. Hence seduction is all but unknown. The wife is equally well guarded and lacks opportunities hence adultery is found difficult except in books. Of the Ibn (or Walad) Har\u00e1m (bastard as opposed to the Ibn Hal\u00e1l) the proverb says, \"This child is not thine, so the madder he be the more is thy glee!\" Yet strange to say public prostitution has never been wholly abolished in Al-Islam. Al-Mas'\u00fadi tells us that in Arabia were public prostitutes'(Bagh\u00e1y\u00e1), even before the days of the Apostle, who affected certain quarters as in our day the Tart\u00fashah of Alexandria and the Hosh Bardak of Cairo. Here says Herr Carlo Landberg (p. 57, Syrian Proverbs) \"Elles parlent une langue toute \u00e0 elle.\" So pretentious and dogmatic a writer as the author of Proverbes et Dictons de la Province de Syrie, ought surely to have known that the Hosh Bardak is the head-quarters of the Cairene Gypsies. This author, who seems to write in order to learn, reminds me of an acute Oxonian undergraduate of my day who, when advised to take a \"coach,\" became a \"coach\" himself.\n\n[FN#158] These lines occur in vol. vii. p. 340. I quote Mr.\nPayne.\n\n[FN#159] She shows all the semi-maniacal rancour of a good woman, or rather a woman who has not broken the eleventh commandment, \"Thou shalt not be found out,\" against an erring sister who has been discovered. In the East also these unco'g\u00faid dames have had, and too often have, the power to carry into effect the cruelty and diabolical malignity which in London and Paris must vent itself in scan. mag. and anonymous letters.\n\n[FN#160] These faintings and trances are as common in the Romances of Chivalry e.g. Amadis of Gaul, where they unlace the garments to give more liberty, pour cold water on the face and bathe the temples and pulses with diluted vinegar (for rose water) exactly as they do in The Nights.\n\n[FN#161] So Hafiz, \"B\u00e1d-i-Sab\u00e1 chu bugzar\u00ed\" etc.\n\n[FN#162] Arab. \"Takiyah.\" See vol. i. 224 and for the Tarn-Kappe vol. iv. p. 176. In the Sinth\u00e1sana Dwatrinsati (vulgo. Singh\u00e1san Batt\u00eds\u00ed), or Thirty-two Tales of a Throne, we find a bag always full of gold, a bottomless purse; earth which rubbed on the forehead overcomes all; a rod which during the first watch of the night furnishes jewelled ornaments; in the second a beautiful girl; in the third invisibility, and in the fourth a deadly foe or death; a flower-garland which renders the possessor invisible and an unfading lotus-flower which produces a diamond every day.\n\n[FN#163] Arab. \"Judad,\" plur. of Jad\u00edd, lit.= new coin, ergo applied to those old and obsolete; 10 Judad were= one nusf or half dirham.\n\n[FN#164] Arab. \"Raff,\" a shelf proper, running round the room about 7-7\u00bd feet from the ground. During my day it was the fashion in Damascus to range in line along the Raff splendid porcelain bowls brought by the Caravans in olden days from China, whilst on the table were placed French and English specimens of white and gold \"china\" worth perhaps a franc each.\n\n[FN#165] Lane supposes that the glass and china-ware had fallen upon the divan running round the walls under the Raff and were not broken.\n\n[FN#166] These lines have occurred in Night dclxxxix. vol. vii. p. 119. I quote Lane.\n\n[FN#167] The lines have occurred before. I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#168] This formula, I repeat, especially distinguishes the\nTale of Hasan of Bassorah.\n\n[FN#169] These lines have occurred in vol. 1. 249. I quote Lane.\n\n[FN#170] She speaks to the \"Gallery,\" who would enjoy a loud laugh against Mistress Gadabout. The end of the sentence must speak to the heart of many a widow.\n\n[FN#171] These lines occur in vol. i. 25: so I quote Mr. Payne.\n\n[FN#172] Arab. \"Mus\u00e1hikah;\" the more usual term for a Tribade is \"Sah\u00edkah\" from \"Sahk\" in the sense of rubbing: both also are applied to onanists and masturbators of the gender feminine.\n\n[FN#173] i.e. by way of halter. This jar is like the cask in Auerbach's Keller; and has already been used by witches; Night dlxxxvii. vol. vi. 158.\n\n[FN#174] Here they are ten but afterwards they are reduced to seven: I see no reason for changing the text with Lane and Payne.\n\n[FN#175] Wazir of Solomon. See vol. i. 42; and vol. iii. 97.\n\n[FN#176] Arab. \"Ism al-A'azam,\" the Ineffable Name, a superstition evidently derived from the Talmudic fancies of the Jews concerning their tribal god, Yah or Yahvah.\n\n[FN#177] The tradition is that Moh\u00e1mmed asked Ak\u00e1f al-Wad\u00e1'ah \"Hast a wife?\"; and when answered in the negative, \"Then thou appertainest to the brotherhood of Satans! An thou wilt be one of the Christian monks then company therewithal; but an thou be of us, know that it is our custom to marry!\"\n\n[FN#178] The old woman, in the East as in the West, being the most vindictive of her kind. I have noted (Pilgrimage iii. 70) that a Badawi will sometimes though in shame take the blood-wit; but that if it be offered to an old woman she will dash it to the ground and clutch her knife and fiercely swear by Allah that she will not eat her son's blood.\n\n[FN#179] Neither dome nor fount etc. are mentioned before, the normal inadvertency.\n\n[FN#180] In Eastern travel the rest comes before the eating and drinking.\n\n[FN#181] Arab. \"'Id\" (pron.'Eed) which I have said (vol. i. 42, 317) is applied to the two great annual festivals, the \"F\u00eate of Sacrifice,\" and the \"Break-Fast.\" The word denotes restoration to favour and Moslems explain as the day on which Adam (and Eve) who had been expelled from Paradise for disobedience was re-established (U\u00edda) by the relenting of Allah. But the name doubtless dates amongst Arabs from days long before they had heard of the \"Lord Nomenclator.\"\n\n[FN#182] Alluding to Hasan seizing her feather dress and so taking her to wife.\n\n[FN#183] Arab. \"Kharaj\u00fa\"=they (masc.) went forth, a vulgarism for \"Kharajna\" (fem.)\n\n[FN#184] Note the notable housewife who, at a moment when youth would forget everything, looks to the main chance.\n\n[FN#185] Arab. \"Al-Malak\u00fat\" (not \"Malk\u00fat\" as in Freytag) a Sufi term for the world of Spirits (De Lacy Christ, Ar. i. 451). Amongst Eastern Christians it is vulgarly used in the fem. and means the Kingdom of Heaven, also the preaching of the Gospel.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/1698015", "artist_names": "Ray Stevens", "full_title": "I Need Your Help Barry Manilow by\u00a0Ray\u00a0Stevens", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/2c506b0534129d932e9efd3d81f87ab9.300x296x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2c506b0534129d932e9efd3d81f87ab9.600x592x1.jpg", "id": 1698015, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 930466, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1667537911, "path": "/Ray-stevens-i-need-your-help-barry-manilow-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Ray-stevens-i-need-your-help-barry-manilow-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1979, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1979", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1979", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/2c506b0534129d932e9efd3d81f87ab9.300x296x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2c506b0534129d932e9efd3d81f87ab9.600x592x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 2, "hot": false}, "title": "I Need Your Help Barry Manilow", "title_with_featured": "I Need Your Help Barry Manilow", "updated_by_human_at": 1667537912, "url": "https://genius.com/Ray-stevens-i-need-your-help-barry-manilow-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/51534", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f882dde9f50721f83ebc2f4f22df3ad6.650x430x1.jpg", "id": 51534, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fb7f0ea480f7635192ae19d79314eab8.886x886x1.png", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Ray Stevens", "slug": "Ray-stevens", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Ray-stevens"}, "artist": "Ray Stevens", "lyrics": "I Need Your Help Barry Manilow LyricsMy account is overdrawn, my car slid down the hill\nI'm givin' up, I've got no more to give\nMy beagle bit the vet, and my daughter's on the pill\nAnd my fiscus plant has lost its will to live\n\nI owe Master Charge my life, I've got adolescent skin\nMy doctor says I can't use any salt\nMy waist is getting thick, but my hair is getting thin\nAnd my house is on the San Andreas Fault\n\nI need your help, Barry Manilow\nI'm miserable and I don't know what to do\nSing me a song, sing it sad and low\nNo one knows how to suffer quite like you\nMy shrink is out of town, my love life is a joke\nMy ex-wife sold my diary to Rona\nAll my ashtrays are overflowed, and I don't even smoke\nAnd my sinuses came back from Arizona\n\nHello, Mandy?

Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\n\nThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oft were they won't to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.\n\n\u2014Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of water.\n\nAnd baby prattled after her:\n\n\u2014A jink a jink a jawbo.\n\nCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.\nBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.\n\n\u2014Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.\n\nHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.\n\n\u2014Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\n\nShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\n\n\u2014What's your name? Butter and cream?\n\n\u2014Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?\n\n\u2014Nao, tearful Tommy said.\n\n\u2014Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.\n\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said.\n\n\u2014I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy's sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy's sweetheart.\n\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\n\nCissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.\nBut who was Gerty?\nGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch's female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy's words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.\n\nFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.\n\nGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the Lady's Pictorial that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn't of a Friday.\n\nAnd yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in love, a woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer's (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.\n\nAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.\n\nEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.\n\n\u2014You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball.\n\nBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.\n\n\u2014Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.\n\nAnd she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played here's the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.\n\n\u2014I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't say.\n\n\u2014On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.\nGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.\n\n\u2014Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at him.\n\nMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.\n\nAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty's ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.\n\nAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee or My love and cottage near Rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for supper and when he sang The moon hath raised with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother's birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.\n\nA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't like her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker's pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.\n\nThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\n\n\u2014If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\n\nGerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.\n\nThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.\n\nThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn't the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.\n\n\u2014Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.\n\nAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.\n\n\u2014Haja ja ja haja.\n\nCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\n\n\u2014Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\n\nAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.\n\nGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retrouss\u00e9 from where he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.\n\nRefuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. Ora pro nobis. Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours' adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.\n\nThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\n\n\u2014Jacky! Tommy!\n\nNot they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow long because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. Tableau! That would have been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness.\n\nQueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the Tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the Tantumer gosa cramen tum. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.\n\nCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders\u2014a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.\n\nEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:\n\n\u2014A penny for your thoughts.\n\n\u2014What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I was only wondering was it late.\n\nBecause she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.\n\n\u2014Wait, said Cissy, I'll run ask my uncle Peter over there what's the time by his conundrum.\n\nSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\n\nCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.\n\nThen they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O'Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man's passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.\n\nEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt\u2014O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was. Gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.\n\n\u2014O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.\n\nHer words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy's countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\n\nEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.\n\n\u2014O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.\n\nThe slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.\n\nGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.\n\nHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book The Lamplighter by Miss Cummins, author of Mabel Vaughan and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely's of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. Art thou real, my ideal? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about twilight, wilt thou ever? and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if\u2014what then? Would it make a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl's honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand him because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.\n\nCanon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang Laudate Dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn't she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:\n\n\u2014O, look, Cissy!\n\nAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.\n\n\u2014It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.\n\nAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running.\n\n\u2014Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It's the bazaar fireworks.\n\nBut Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, pasion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors' photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.\n\nAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn't ashamed and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!\n\nThen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl He was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don't tell.\n\nCissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried:\n\n\u2014Gerty! Gerty! We're going. Come on. We can see from farther up.\n\nGerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too far to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.\n\nSlowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because\u2014because Gerty MacDowell was...\n\nTight boots? No. She's lame! O!\n\nMr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That's why she's left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn't know it when she was on show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn't mind. Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she. Something in the air. That's the moon. But then why don't all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that. Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning. That gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices. Reserve better. Don't want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O. Pity they can't see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy's hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? Lingerie does it. Felt for the curves inside her deshabill\u00e9. Excites them also when they're. I'm all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly's new blouse. At first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes when you're on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn't in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other's necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can't get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I'll write to you. Now won't you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon. Tableau! O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in each other's appearance. You're looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing their teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn't lend each other a pinch of salt.\n\nAh!\n\nDevils they are when that's coming on them. Dark devilish appearance. Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my foot. O that way! O, that's exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest once in a way. Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. Safe in one way. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she's a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt 1. When you feel like that you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn't let her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can't be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice. She's worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie's without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he's another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?\n\nO, he did. Into her. She did. Done.\n\nAh!\n\nMr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant. Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don't care. Complimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they change the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.\n\nThere she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in mother's clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? I'll tell you the right time up a dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.\n\nDidn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine eyes she had, clear. It's the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog's jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit on a bench marked Wet Paint. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed for what's not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist going up Roger Greene's stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman's eye on a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly's Paisley shawl to Prescott's by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don't they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly's dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.\n\nA monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling, I saw, your. I saw all.\n\nLord!\n\nDid me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For this relief much thanks. In Hamlet, that is. Lord! It was all things combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He's right. Might have made a worse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It couldn't be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin's barn a blind.\n\nHer maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.\n\nPlace made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw anything straight at school. Crooked as a ram's horn. Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa's pants will soon fit Willy and fuller's earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them out of harm's way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam. Children's hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn't to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe the women's fault also. That's where Molly can knock spots off them. It's the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife. Still there's destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn't take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is not back. Better detach.\n\nOw!\n\nOther hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch. Wristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I suppose, at once. Cat's away, the mice will play. I remember looking in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time, well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it's all arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the stars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come. Come. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you're a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.\n\nWonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like flowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the paint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn't hear. But lots of them can't kick the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.\n\nWait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it? Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection. For instance if you go into a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It's like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way. We're the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.\n\nPerhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink gives that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to. That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life. And it's extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.\n\nMr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat. Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that's the soap.\n\nO by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could mention Meagher's just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph. Two and nine. Bad opinion of me he'll have. Call tomorrow. How much do I owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving credit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.\n\nHere's this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don't mock what matter? That's the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he now. The Mystery Man on the Beach, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body feels the atmosphere. Old Betty's joints are on the rack. Mother Shipton's prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh.\n\nHowth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of the dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds flash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt you. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through the small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against. Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest. Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A star I see. Venus? Can't tell yet. Two. When three it's night. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native land, goodnight.\n\nDew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the position. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don't know how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green apples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it's the only time we cross legs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs under them. But it's the evening influence. They feel all that. Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat Dillon's garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns. History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I'm with you once again. Life, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They take advantage.\n\nAll quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The rhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the plumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change: that's all. Lovers: yum yum.\n\nTired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it comes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing new under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin's Barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty darling. At Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's house. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he and she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty from the dew.\n\nBa. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a tree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray for us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition. Same thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there's the light in the priest's house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom's. Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have. Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out at night like mice. They're a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants to stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with three colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the City Arms with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That's how that wise man what's his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can't be tourists' matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory's not so bad.\n\nBa. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what they say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. Faugh a Ballagh! Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it's round. Wife in every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail end of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor's weighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well. And the tephilim no what's this they call it poor papa's father had on his door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that's the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish ever get seasick?\n\nThen you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker, moon looking down so peaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.\n\nA last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherd's hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o'clock postman, the glowworm's lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup race! and from the door of Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.\n\nLife those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish Lights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin's King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don't know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean. But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didn't want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I'll murder you. Is it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista. O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht. Buenas noches, se\u00f1orita. El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa. Why me? Because you were so foreign from the others.\n\nBetter not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you dull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for Leah, Lily of Killarney. No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital to see. Hope she's over. Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan's. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But Dignam's put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we're going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer's that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium. Her widow's mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O'Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron. Ladies' grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does? Would I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti's gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes's. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in them. What's that? Might be money.\n\nMr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go. Better. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What's this? Bit of stick.\n\nO! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do. Will I?\n\nMr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a message for her. Might remain. What?\nI.\n\nSome flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide comes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the meaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not like.\nAM. A.\n\nNo room. Let it go.\n\nMr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand. Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here. Except Guinness's barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by design.\n\nHe flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn't. Chance. We'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made me feel so young.\n\nShort snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.. Not even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I won't go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a moment. Won't sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat again. No harm in him. Just a few.\n\nO sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair heave under embon se\u00f1orita young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan Winkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail end Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next in her next her next.\n\nA bat flew. Here. There. Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Just for a few\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo.\n\nThe clock on the mantelpiece in the priest's house cooed where Canon O'Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S. J. were taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup and talking about\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo.\n\nBecause it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 21, "api_path": "/songs/489573", "artist_names": "Sports Genius Football (Ft.

All the same we must risk making one this afternoon since we are going to discuss modern tendencies.

Nor should they. However, there is a movement occurring, a form of social activism created by the affordances of social media, an infrastructure that was built incrementally during two to three decades of hard scholarly research that brought us to this historic time and place. To honor the convergence of theories and technologies, this paper revisits the Points of Viewing Theory to provide researchers, teachers, and the public with an opportunity to discuss and perhaps change the epistemology of education from its formal structures to more Do-It-Yourself (DIY) learning environments that dig deeper and better into content knowledge. As the saying goes, we live in interesting times. Let\u2019s not make this saying a curse. Let\u2019s \u201cdeschool\u201d society as Ivan Illich suggested in 1971 and design more equitable systems of learning across mediated platforms.\n\nThe Points of Viewing Theory (POV-T) is the foundation on which this chapter on computers, the Internet, social media, embodied cognition, and interactive digital media learning environments, including games for learning, is constructed. According to this theory developed by Ricki Goldman (formerly Ricki Goldman-LSegall) learners actively layer their viewpoints and their interpretations to elicit patterns, themes, and groupings of ideas that lead to a deep understanding of the content under investigation and to reach agreements\u2014if only partial (Goldman, 2007; Goldman-Segall, 1996a, 1998a). POV-T is not limited to making meaning with from a solitary standpoint. Indeed, the purpose of applying POV-T is to enable learners to learn from one another by seeing each other\u2019s viewpoints through perspective-taking as well as to be able to see their own changing perspectives on a subject in diverse contexts and settings. As Rowland points out: \u201cWe come to know through interpretation, dialog, and negotiation of meaning with...others, through a conversation with manipulation of the materials of a situation\u201d (Rowland, 2004, p. 43).\n\nThe theory, \ufb01rst developed by Goldman in the 1990s, also strengthens content knowledge by layering the ideas of participants and stakeholders in a shared learning environment using a range of methods, tools, and \u201cdocuments.\u201d POV-T also provides a framework for \ufb01nding underlying patterns that lead to agreements. Tools that make evident this theory are called perspectivity technologies because they provide a platform for multiloguing (Goldman-Segall, 1994), a place and space for building cultures or communities of practice where one \u201ccatches sight\u201d of the other while participating in learning. Given the problematics of living in a complex global society facing enormous cultural, social, environmental, and economic differences of opinion, this theory is critical for communicating with each other and reaching what Ivan Illich calls conviviality (1973), Clifford Geertz calls commensurability (1973), and Goldman-Segall (1995) calls con\ufb01gurational validity\u2014a form of thick communication, which emerges from using media tools to layer views and perspectives into agreements.\n\nPOV-T incorporates how each person at different times and contexts will understand the same content whether it is a process, event, document in any media, or action \u201cwith new eyes.\u201d Research on what Black (2010) calls the embodied/grounded cognitive perspective takes advantage not only of our visual perceptual systems for learning, but also our entire full body perceptual systems. Recent brain scanning research has shown that many cognitive tasks that were thought to be purely symbolic actually involved a multisensory perceptual simulation. The best preparation for such task requires a fully embodied learning experience. The use of computer game-like learning environments (such as the Wii and Kinect) will continue to open the doors for exploration into how the social mind makes sense of experiences. Moreover, given the rise of social media and games for learning, as well as the recent \ufb01ndings on the plasticity of mental interpretations, the brain\u2019s capacity for mental mirroring, and the intimate relationship between emotion and social intelligence that shows how minds can be recon\ufb01gured with changes to embodied experiences, the Points of Viewing Theory, a foundational theory of minds presented in this chapter, is the one that can move forward our understanding of learning with computers from the advent of early instructionist approaches to more recent constructionist and socioconstructionist applications.\n\nIn this chapter, the authors explore a range of concepts and tools that have been designed for learning. The authors expect that readers will create new con\ufb01gurations as they read the text. Indeed, that is the idea behind the theory\u2014to learn from both a layering of each other\u2019s ideas as well as from the diverse perspectives each of us, as solitary readers (if there is such a thing) can make meaning of different contexts to build knowledge, together.\n\nCONTEXTS AND INTELLECTUAL HISTORY\n\nWe start by unfolding how the Points of Viewing Theory provides us with a lens from which to better connect the writings of past and present leading theorists. We do this to tease out some of the sticky webs that confuse policy makers and academicians, as well as to envision future directions. The underlying theme running through this chapter is that many routes combining a vast array of perspectives are needed to shape an educationally sound approach to learning and teaching with digital media technologies. There is no one \ufb01x, no one solution. Rather, there must be an openness to appreciate diversity and a layering of points of viewing.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the age-old debate between empiricism and idealism shifted: science could be used to not only observe the external world with microscopes and telescopes, but also to change, condition, and control behavior. Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov experimented with dogs, calling his theory conditioning. Dogs \u201clearned\u201d to salivate to the sound of a bell that had previously accompanied their eating, even without receiving the food. Pavlov\u2019s theory of conditioning played a central role in inspiring John B. Watson, who is often cited as the founder of behaviorist psychology. In 1913, Watson, while continuing to work with animals, applied Pavlov\u2019s theories to children, believing that people act according to the stimulation of their nervous system and can just as easily as dogs be conditioned to learn. A turbulent personal turn of events\u2014leading to his dismissal from Johns Hopkins University\u2014extended Watson\u2019s behaviorist approach into the domain of marketing. He landed a prime job as vice-president of J. Walter Thompson, one of the largest U.S. advertising companies, and helped change the course of advertising forever (Daniels, 2000). As media, education, and business enter a convergent course in this 21st century with new tools for learning and the new knowledge industry, behaviorist theories remain a strong and silent partner y.\n\nA leading proponent of behaviorism, Edward Thorndike, with his 1899 article on \u201cAnimal Intelligence\u201d and subsequent book Educational Psychology in 1903, is often called the founder of the \ufb01eld of educational psychology. His educational psychology book made recommendations for teaching students, based on his research on animals (the Law of Effect and the Law of Exercise that establish connections between stimuli and responses). (He conducted studies with students, and not only animals, using this same basic framework.) The leading behaviorist in the educational domain, Burrhus Frederic (B.F.) Skinner, contributed the idea of operant conditioning\u2014how positive and negative reinforcement (reward and punishment) can be used as stimuli to shape how humans respond. With this variation, the theory of behavior modi\ufb01cation was born. All human actions are seen to be shaped (caused) by the stimulus of the external world on the body. In short, there is no reasoning mind creating reality, merely a hard-wired system that responds to what it experiences from external sources. Infamous for designing the glass \u201cAir Crib,\u201d which his daughter\u2014observed, measured, and \u201ctaught\u201d how to behave\u2014spent time living in, Skinner not only practiced what he preached, but also led the way for even more elaborate experiments to prove how educators could shape, reinforce, and manipulate humans through repeated drills. Much of this early work resurfaced in electronic learning systems today.\n\nWhat was salient in the behaviorist approach was that the proponents addressed the role of external stimuli\u2014that our bodies send messages to the brain that can be interpreted. What was missed was selectivity of the brain in interpreting how perceptions affect not only behavior, but create new perspectives layered on both internal predispositions and previously acquired interpreted experiences. In this chapter we propose that interactions among genetics, experience, and ongoing perceptual reactions along with what is felt in the whole body and interpreted in the mind are paramount to learning.\n\nIn short, even with the advent of new man-machine studies in the post\u2013World War II period, the role of perspectivity has been missing as a key part of the interpretive executive functioning of the brain Nevertheless, with the advent of the computer, intrepid behavioral scientists persisted in designing and using drill-and-practice methods to improve memorization tasks (e.g., Suppes, 1966). They turned to an examination of the role and ef\ufb01cacy of computers and technology in education, a subject understood in a behaviorist research agenda that valued measurable results and formal experimental methods, as Koschmann (1996, pp. 5\u20136) notes in his critique of the period. Accordingly, proponents of Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s asked how the computer (an external stimulus) affects (modi\ufb01es) the individual (a hard-wired learning system). Their research questions focused on how the process of learning could be improved by using the computer.\n\nWe see these classic debates between empiricism and idealism as being connected with bifurcation and a dualistic world view. It was not possible at the time to understand how the working of the brain, a network of perceptions, could be connected with perspectives, the interpretations that people as individuals and as a society, make. In short, an embodied notion of how learning is not internally nor externally \u201clocated.\u201d A holistic view of the world did not seem possible then, and for many scholars today, unfortunately, it still is an enigma.\n\nAn alternative approach to CAI is rooted in studying the individual mind and conducting experiments on how the mind works. The mind as a site of research (and not just idealization or speculation) has its modern roots in the work of Jean Piaget (b. 1896), a natural scientist trained in zoology but most renowned for his work as a developmental psychologist and epistemologist. After becoming disillusioned with standardized testing methodology at the Sorbonne in France, Piaget returned to Geneva in 1921 to dedicate the rest of his academic life to studying the child\u2019s conception of time (Piaget, 1969), space (Piaget & Inhelder, 1956), number (Piaget 1952) and the world (Piaget, 1930). Although the idea that children could do things at one age that they could not do at another was not new, it was Piaget who was able to lay out a blueprint for children\u2019s conceptual development at different stages of their lives. For example, the classic theory of conservation eludes the young child: a tall glass contains more water than a short one even if the young child pours the same water from one glass into the other. Until Piaget, no one had conducted a body of experiments asking children to think about these phenomena and then mapped the diverse views that children use to solve problems into categories. By closely observing, recording his observations, and applying these to an emerging developmental theory of mind, Piaget and his team of researchers in Geneva developed the famous hierarchy of thinking stages: sensori-motor, preoperational, concrete, and formal. Piaget did not limit all thinking into these four rigid categories but rather used them as a way to deepen discussion on how children learn.\nWhat is fundamentally different in Piaget\u2019s conception of mind is that unlike the behaviorist view that the external world affects the individual\u2014a uni-directional approach with no input from the individual\u2014the process of constructivist learning occurs in the mind of the child encountering, exploring, and theorizing about the world as the world is encountered as it moved through preset stages of life. The child\u2019s mind assimilates new events into existing cognitive structures and the cognitive structures accommodate the new event, changing the existing structures in a continually interactive process. Schema are formed as the child assimilates new events and moves from a state of disequilibrium to equilibrium, a state only to be put back into disequilibrium every time the child meets new experiences that cannot \ufb01t the existing schema. Beers (2001) has called the assimilation/accommodation process a dialectical inter-action among person, objects of creation (artifacts), and the curricular world in which the artifacts are created.\n\nHowever, Piaget also believed that learning is a spontaneous, individual cognitive process, distinct from the sort of socialized and nonspontaneous instruction one might \ufb01nd in formal education, and that these two are in a somewhat antagonistic relationship. Critiquing Piaget\u2019s constructivism, the great Soviet psychologist L. S. Vygotsky wrote: We believe that the two processes\u2014the development of spontaneous and of nonspontaneous concepts\u2014are related and constantly in\ufb02uence each other. They are parts of a single process: the development of concept formation, which is affected by varying external and internal conditions but is essentially a unitary process, not a con\ufb02ict of antagonistic, mutually exclusive forms of mentation. (Vygotsky, 1962, p. 85)Vygotsky heralded a departure from individual mind to social mind, and, as under his in\ufb02uence, educational theorizing moved away from its individual-focused origins and toward more socially or culturally situated perspectives. The paradigmatic approaches of key theorists in learning technology re\ufb02ect this change as contributions from anthropology and social psychology gained momentum throughout the social sciences. The works of Vygotsky and the Soviet cultural-historical school (notably A. R. Luria and A. N. Leontiev), when translated into English, began to have a major in\ufb02uence, especially through the interpretations and stewardship of educational psychologists like Sylvia Scribner, Jerome Bruner, and Michael Cole (Bruner, 1990; Cole & Engestrom, 1993; Cole & Wertsch, \u00a81996; Scribner & Cole, 1981). Vygotsky focused on the role of social context and mediating tools (language, writing, etc.) in the development of the individual, and argued that one cannot study the mind of a child without examining the \u201csocial milieu, both institutional and interpersonal\u201d in which she \ufb01nds herself (Katz & Lesgold, 1993). Vygotsky\u2019s in\ufb02uence, along with that of pragmatist philosopher John Dewey\u2019s seminal Democracy in Education (1916), opened up the study of technology in learning beyond individual cognition, thereby revealing its role in fostering social interaction and the betterment of a diverse, interconnected society. The ground in the last decade of the 20th century thus became fertile for a growing range of new media and computational environments for learning, teaching, and research based on new advances in brainbased cognitive science coupled with a socially mediated and distributed approach to the acqusition of knowledge (Pea & Bransford et al., 2000). This critical dichotomy between postpositivism and interpretivism would provide the philosophical inspiration for learning sciences research on technology in the \ufb01rst decade of the 21st century. But the path to social constructionism at the end of the 20th century \ufb01rst took a circuitous route through computeraided instruction.\n\nINSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY:\nCAI BEGINNINGS\n\nAn examination of the theoretical roots of computers in education exposes its behaviorist beginnings: The computer could reinforce activities that would bring about more ef\ufb01cient learning. For some, this meant \u201ccheaper,\u201d for others, \u201cfaster,\u201d and for yet others, it meant without needing a teacher (see Bromley, 1998, for a discussion). The oldest such tradition of computing in education is Computer-Aided Instruction, or CAI. This approach dates back to the early 1960s, notably in two research projects, at Stanford under Patrick Suppes (1966), and the PLATO project at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under Donald Bitzer and Dan Alpert (1970). Both projects utilized the then-new \u201ctime-sharing\u201d computer systems to create learning opportunities for individual students. The potential existed for a time-sharing system to serve hundreds or even thousands of students simultaneously, and this economy of scale was one of the main drivers of early CAI research. A learner could sit at a terminal and engage in a textual dialogue with the computer system: question and answer. As such, CAI can be situated mostly within the behavioral paradigm (Koschmann, 1996, p. 6), though its research is also informed by cognitive science (e.g., Suppes applied new cognitive learning and memory theories to guide the interactions with students).\n\nThe Stanford CAI project explored elementary school mathematics and science education, and the researchers worked with local schools to produce a formidable amount of research data (Suppes, Jerman, & Brian, 1968; Suppes & Morningstar, 1972). Suppes began with tutorial instruction as the key model, and saw that the computer could provide individualized tutoring on a far greater scale than was economically possible before. Suppes envisioned computer tutoring on three levels: the simplest is drill-and-practice work, in which the computer administers a question-and-answer session with the student, judging responses correct or incorrect, and keeping track of data from the sessions. The second level was a more direct instructional approach: The computer would give information to the student, and then quiz the student on the information, possibly allowing for different constructions or expressions of the same information. In this sense, the computer acts much like a textbook. The third level was to be more sophisticated dialogic systems, in which a more traditional tutor-tutee relationship could be emulated (Suppes, 1966). Clearly, the simple drill-and practice model is the easiest to actually implement, and as such the bulk of the early Stanford research uses this model, especially in the context of elementary school arithmetic (Suppes et al., 1968).\n\nThe research results from the Stanford experiments are not surprising: students do tend to improve over time with practice. For the time (the 1960s), however, to be able to automate the process was a signi\ufb01cant achievement. More interesting from our perspective are the re\ufb02ections Suppes offers, regarding the design of the human-computer interface: How and when should feedback be given? How can the system be tailored to different cognitive styles? How best to leverage the unprecedented amount of quantitative data the system collected about each student\u2019s performance and progress? (Suppes, 1966). These questions still form the cornerstone of much educational technology research.\n\nThe PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations) project at UIUC had a somewhat different focus (Alpert & Bitzer, 1970). Over several incarnations of the PLATO system through the 1960s, Bitzer, Alpert, and their team worked at the problems of integrating CAI into university teaching on a large scale, as indeed it began to be from the late 1960s. The task of taking what was then enormously expensive equipment and systems and making it economically viable in order to have individualized tutoring for students drove the development of the systems, and led PLATO to a long career in CAI\u2014in fact, the direct descendants of the original PLATO system are still being used and developed. The PLATO project introduced some of the \ufb01rst instances of computer-based manipulables, student-to-student conferencing, and computer-based \u201cdistance\u201d education (Woolley, 1994).\n\nFrom these beginnings, CAI and the models it provides for educational technology are now the oldest tradition in educational computing. While only partly integrated in the school system, CAI is widely used in corporate training environments, in remedial programs, and has had something of a resurgence with the advent of the World Wide Web as online training has become popular. It is worth noting that the company Suppes started with Richard Atkinson at Stanford in 1967, Computer Curriculum Corporation, and NovaNet, a PLATO descendant spun off from UIUC in 1993 were both recently acquired by Pearson Education, the world\u2019s largest educational publisher (Pearson Education, 2000).COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND AI RESEARCH\nIn order to historically situate the development of learning technology, it is also important to appreciate the impact of the \u201ccognitive revolution\u201d (Gardner, 1985) on both education and technology.\n\nFor our purposes, the contribution of cognitive science is twofold. First, the advent of the digital computer in the 1940s led quickly to research on arti\ufb01cial intelligence(AI). By the 1950s, AI was already a substantial research program at universities like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. And while AI research has not yet\u2014nor, we believe, is likely to\u2014produced an arti\ufb01cial mind, the legacy of AI research has had an enormous in\ufb02uence on our presentday computing paradigms, from information management to feedback and control systems and from personal computing to the notion of programming languages. All derive in large part from a full half-century of research in AI.\n\nSecond, cognitive science\u2014speci\ufb01cally the contributions of Piagetian developmental psychology and AI research\u2014gave the world the \ufb01rst practical models of mind, thinking, and learning. Prior to the cognitive revolution, our understanding of thinking was oriented either psychoanalytically or philosophically, out of the Western traditions of metaphysics and epistemology, or empirically, via behaviorism. In the latter case, as mentioned earlier, cognition was regarded as a black box between stimulus and response. Since no empirical study of the contents of this box was possible, speculation as to what went on inside was both discouraged and ignored. Cognitive science, especially by way of AI research, opened the box. For the \ufb01rst time, researchers could work from a model of mind and mental processes. In 1957, AI pioneer Herbert Simon went so far as to predict that AI would soon provide the substantive model for psychological theory, in the same way that Newton\u2019s calculus had once done for physics (Turkle, 1984, p. 244). Despite the subsequent humbling of AI\u2019s early enthusiasm, the effect this thinking has had on research in psychology and education and even the popular imagination (consider the commonplace notion of one\u2019s \u201cshort term memory\u201d) is vast.\n\nThe most signi\ufb01cant thread or thrust of early AI research was Allen Newell and Herbert Simon\u2019s \u201cinformation processing\u201d model at Carnegie-Mellon University. This research sought to develop a generalized problem solving mechanism, based on the idea that problems in the world could be represented as internal states in a machine and operated on algorithmically. Newell and Simon saw the mind as a \u201cphysical symbol system\u201d or \u201cinformation processing system\u201d (Simon, 1981 [1969], p. 27), and believed that such a system is the \u201cnecessary and suf\ufb01cient means\u201d for intelligence (p. 28). One of the venerable traditions of this model is the chess-playing computer, long bandied as exemplary of intelligence. Ironically, world chess master Gary Kasparov\u2019s historic defeat to IBM\u2019s \u201cDeep Blue\u201d supercomputer in 1997 had far less rhetorical punch than AI critic (and chess novice) Hubert Dreyfus\u2019 defeat in 1965, but the legacy of the information processing approach cannot be underestimated.\n\nYet it would be unfair to equate all of classical AI research with Newell and Simon\u2019s approach. Signi\ufb01cantly, research programs at Stanford and MIT, though perhaps lower pro\ufb01le, made signi\ufb01cant contributions to the \ufb01eld. Two threads in particular are worthy of comment here. One was the development of \u201cexpert systems,\u201d concerned with the problem of knowledge representation\u2014 for example Edward Feigenbaum\u2019s DENDRAL, a system that contained large amounts of domain-speci\ufb01c information in biology. Another was Terry Winograd\u2019s 1970 program, SHRDLU, which \ufb01rst tackled the issue of indexicality and reference in an arti\ufb01cial microworld (Gardner,1985). As Gardner points out, these developments demonstrated that Newell and Simon\u2019s \u201cgeneralized\u201d problem-solving approach would give way to more situated, domain speci\ufb01c approaches.\nThe culmination of this approach results in the Cognitive Tutors out of Carnegie Mellon University. These are both a successful product widely used in schools  www.carnegielearning.com) and an active ongoing research project (coordinated through the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center: www.learnlab.org). The Cognitive Tutors apply John Anderson\u2019s ACTR (Anderson, 1993) cognitive architecture (which is descended from Newell and Simon\u2019s) to represent the knowledge to be taught (mostly If-Then production rules) then this knowledge is represented in the tutor so that it can understand what the student is doing when solving problems and provide \u201cintelligence\u201d feedback (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995). These tutors show impressive results in tests compared to classroom instruction and when compared to traditional CAI (like the Suppes kind): they do around one effect size (one standard deviation) better than classroom instruction\u2014tradition CAI does 0.3 effect size better than classroom instruction so the Cognitive Tutors are 3 times as effective as traditional CAI (J. Kulik & C. Kulik, 1991). However, these Cognitive Tutors are effective at teaching how to solve problems in areas like high school algebra and geometry; there is some question remaining whether they can also teach an understanding of why these solution methods work.\n\nAt MIT in the 1980s, Marvin Minsky\u2019s work led to a theory of the \u201csociety of minds\u201d\u2014that, rather than intelligence being constituted in a straightforward representational and algorithmic way, intelligence is seen as the emergent property of a complex of subsystems working independently (Minsky, 1986). The notion of emergent AI, more recently explored through massively parallel computers, has with the availability of greater computing power in the 1980s and 1990s become the mainstream of AI research (Turkle, 1995, pp. 126\u2013127). Interestingly, Gardner (1985) points out that the majority of computing\u2014and therefore AI\u2014 research has been located within the paradigm de\ufb01ned by Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and George Boole in the 19th century. Babbage and Lovelace are commonly credited with the basic idea\nof the programmable computer; Lady Ada Agusta, Countess of Lovelace (also known as Ada Lovelace), in famous quote in Note 6 of her translation of the 1842 paper by L. F. Menabrea\u2014written more than 170 years ago, called Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage, neatly sums it up:The analytical engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.George Boole\u2019s contribution was the notion that a system of binary states (0 and 1) could suf\ufb01ce for the representation and transformation of logical propositions. But computing research began to \ufb01nd and transcend the limits of this approach. The rise of emergent AI was characterized as \u201cwaking up from the Boolean dream\u201d (Douglas Hofstadter, quoted in Turkle, p., 135). In this model, intelligence is seen as a property emergent from, or at least observable in, systems of suf\ufb01cient complexity. Intelligence is thus not de\ufb01ned by programmed rules, but by adaptive behavior within an environment.\n\nFrom internal representation to situated action. The idea of taking contextual factors seriously became important outside of pure AI research as well. A notable example was the reception given to Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s famous program, ELIZA. When it \ufb01rst appeared in 1966, ELIZA was not intended as serious AI; it was an experiment in creating a simple conversational interface to the computer\u2014outputting canned statements in response to certain \u201ctrigger\u201d phrases inputted by a user. But ELIZA, with her re\ufb02ective responses sounding a bit like a Rogerian analyst, became something of a celebrity\u2014much to Weizenbaum\u2019s horror (Turkle, 1995, p. 105). The popular press and even some psychiatrists took ELIZA quite seriously. Weizenbaum argued against ELIZA\u2019s use as a psychiatric tool, and against mixing up human beings and computers in general, but ELIZA\u2019s fame has endured. The interface and relationship that ELIZA demonstrates has proved signi\ufb01cant in and of itself, regardless of what computational sophistication may or may not lie behind it.\n\nAnother contextualist effort took place at Xerox\u2019 Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the 1970s, where a team led by Alan Kay developed the foundation for the \u201cpersonal computing\u201d paradigm we know today. Kay\u2019s team is most famous for developing the mouse-and-windows interface\u2014which Brenda Laurel (1990) later called the direct manipulation interface. However, at a more fundamental level, the Xerox PARC researchers de\ufb01ned a model of computing that branched away from a formalist, rulesdriven approach, and toward a notion of the computer as curriculum: an environment for designing, creating, and using digital tools. This approach partly came from explicitly thinking of children as the designers of computing technology. Kay wrote:We were thinking about learning as being one of the mainn effects we wanted to have happen. Early on, this led to a 90-degree rotation of the purpose of the user interface from \u201caccess to functionality\u201d to \u201cenvironment in which users learn by doing.\u201d This new stance could now respond to the echoes of Montessori and Dewey, particularly the former, and got me, on rereading Jerome Bruner, to think beyond the children\u2019s curriculum to a \u201ccurriculum of user interface.\u201d (Kay, 1996, p. 552)In the late 1980s, Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores\u2019 Understanding Computers and  ognition: A New Foundation for Design (1986) heralded a new direction in AI and intelligent systems design. Instead of a rationalist, computational model of mind, Winograd and Flores described the emergence of a decentered and situated approach. The book drew on the phenomenological thinking of Martin Heidegger, the biology of perception work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, and the speech-act theory of John Austin and John Searle to call for a situated model of mind-in-the-world, capable of (or dependent on) commitment and intentionality in real relationships. Winograd and Flores\u2019 work raised signi\ufb01cant questions about the assumptions of a functionalist, representational model of cognition, arguing that such a view is based on highly questionable assumptions about the nature of human thought and action.\n\nIn short, the question of how these AI and cognitive science developments have affected the role of technology in the educational arena can be summed up in the ongoing debate between instructionist \u201ctutoring\u201d systems and constructivist \u201ctoolkits.\u201d While the earliest applications of AI to instructional systems attempted to operate by creating a model of knowledge or a problem domain and then managing a student\u2019s progress in terms of deviation from that model (Suppes, 1966; Wenger, 1987), later and arguably more sophisticated construction systems looked more like toolkits for exploring and re\ufb02ecting on one\u2019s thinking in a particular realm (Papert, 1980; Brown & Burton, 1978;Lajoi and Derry, 1993).\n\nKINDS OF DIGITAL MEDIA LEARNING\n\nWhen theorizing about the role of digital media learning environments in learning, the tendency is often to use an instrumentalist and instructionist approach\u2014the computer, for example, is a useful tool for gathering or presenting information (which is often and incorrectly equated with knowledge). Even within the constructionist paradigm, the social dimension of the learning experience is forgotten, focusing only on the individual child. And, even when we remember the Vygotskian zone of proximal development (ZPD) with its emphasis on the socially mediated context of learning, we tend to overlook the differences that individuals themselves have in their learning styles when they approach the learning experience. And even when we consider group and individual differences, we fail to examine that individuals themselves try out many styles depending on the knowledge domain being studied and the context within which they are participating. And, most importantly, even when the idea that individuals have diverse points of viewing the world is acknowledged, technologists and new media designers often do little to construct learning environments that truly encourage social construction and knowledge creation.\n\nDesigning and building tools as perspectivity technologies, we argue, enables learners to participate as members of communities experiencing and creating new worlds from the points of viewing of their diverse personal identities while contributing to the public good of the digital commons. Using perspectivity technologies, learners\u2014like stars in a constellation\u2014are connected to each other within a force that enables them to change their position and viewpoint yet stay linked within the larger and also moveable construct of the total con\ufb01guration of many constellations, galaxies, and universes. It is within the elastic tension among all the players in the community\u2014the learner, the teacher, the content, the artifacts created, and most importantly the context of the forces within which they communicate\u2014that new knowledge in, around, and about the world is created.\n\nThe next section has been organized less chronologically and more functionally, examining technologies from a variety of perspectives: as information sources, curricular areas, communications media, tools, environments, partners, scaffolds, and \ufb01nally, as perspectivity toolkits.\n\nWe also return to the importance of using the Points of Viewing Theory as a framework for designing new media applications and tools. These assorted technology approaches are not intended to be mutually exclusive; they are headers that often illustrate one aspect of a technology from a particular angle. How a technology should be characterized depends on how it used in situ. A learning technology may be designed in a monological fashion while in the context of use it becomes dialogical with the presence of human actors (Bakhtin, 1981; Wegerif, 2007). And vice versa\u2014technologies designed from a social constructionist framework may \ufb01nd their promise betrayed if used to serve instructionist goals and a single prevailing world view. With the explosion of ubiquitous learning with handheld devices in recent years, eroding the\ntraditional distinction between formal and informal learning, the potential for complex, meaningful, dialogically rich learning is greater than it has ever been (Burbules, Q1 2009). Within this context, it is essential to consider how perspectivity technologies can better accommodate these changes and provide a guiding light for future research and development.\n\nDigital Media for Information\n\nWhen we investigate how meaning is made, we can no longer assume that actual social meanings, materially made, consist only in the verbal-semantic and linguistic contextualizations (paradigmatic, syntagmatic, intertextual) by which we have previously de\ufb01ned them. We must now consider that meaning-in-use organizes, orients, and presents, directly or implicitly, through the resources of multiple semiotic systems. (Lemke, 1998)\n\nAccess to information has been the dominant mythology of computers in education for many educators. Not taking the time to consider how new media texts bring with them new ways of understanding them, educators and educational technologists have often tried to add computers to learning as one would add salt to a meal. The idea of technology as information source has captured the imagination of school administrators, teachers, and parents hoping that problems of education could be solved by providing each student with access to the most current knowledge (Graves, 1999). It is no different these days: legislators and policy makers are still trying to bridge the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d As of 2012, the state of Maine is the only state in the United States with an Internet-connected computer on every desktop.\n\nAlthough a growing number of postmodern theorists and semioticians see computers and new media technologies astexts to deconstruct (Landow, 1992; Lemke, 2001), it is more common to see computers viewed as textbooks. In spite of Lemke\u2019s reminder that these new media texts require translation and not only digestion, the computer is commonly seen as merely a more ef\ufb01cient method of providing instruction and training, with information equated with knowledge. Learners working with courseware are presented with information and then tested or questioned on it, much as they would using traditional textbooks. The computer can automatically mark student responses to questions and govern whether or not the student moves on to the next section, freeing the teacher from this task\u2014an economic advantage noted by many educational technology thinkers.\n\nIn the late 1980s, multimedia\u2014audio, graphics, and video\u2014dominated the educational technology landscape. Curriculum and learning resources, \ufb01rst distributed as textbook and accompanying \ufb02oppy-disc, began to be distributed on videodisc or CD-ROM, media formats able to handle large amounts of multiple media information. In the best cases, multimedia resources employed hypertext or hypermedia (Landow, 1992; Swan, 1994) as navigation schemes, encouraging nonlinear traversal of content. Hypermedia, as such, represented a signi\ufb01cant break with traditional, linear instructional design models, encouraging users to explore resources by following links between discrete chunks of information rather than simply following a programmed course. One of the best early exemplars was Apple Computer\u2019s classic Visual Almanac: An Interactive Multimedia Kit (1989), which enabled students to explore rich multimedia vignettes about interesting natural phenomena as well as events from history and\nthe arts.\n\nThe rise of Internet and search engines such as Google has stimulated the production of computer-based curriculum resources once again. As a sort of universal multimedia platform, the web\u2019s ability to reach a huge audience very inexpensively has led to its widespread adoption in schools, training centers, corporations, and, signi\ufb01cantly, the home. More than packaged curriculum, however, the use of the Internet and World Wide Web as an open-ended research tool has had an enormous impact on classrooms. Since the software for browsing the web is free (or nearly free) and the technology and skills required to use it are so widespread, the costs of using the web as a research tool are largely limited to the costs of hardware and connectivity. This makes it an obvious choice for teachers and administrators often unsure of how to best allocate technology funds. The popular reputation of the web as a universal library or as access to the world\u2019s information (much more so that its reputation as a den of pornographers and pedophiles) has led to a popular mythology of children reaching \u201cbeyond the classroom walls\u201d to\ntap directly into rich information sources, communicate with scientists and experts, and expand their horizons to a global view. Of course, such discourse needs to be examined in the light of day: the web is a source of bad information as well as good, and we must also remember that downloading is not equivalent to learning. As early as 2000, Roger Schank observed that,\n\n[A]ccess to the Web is often cited as being very important to education, for example, but is it? The problem in the schools is not that the libraries are insuf\ufb01cient. The Web is, at its best, an improvement on information access. It provides a better library for kids, but the library wasn\u2019t what was broken. (Schank, 2000)\n\nIndeed he made a good point that the problem is elsewhere, yet within a short decade the \u201cpossibility\u201d of better use of the access to a universe of materials has arrived. In a similar vein, \u201ccorrespondence schools\u201d\u2014both university-based and private businesses dating back to the 19th century\u2014are mirrored in today\u2019s crop of online distance learning providers (Noble, 1999).\n\nIn the classic distance education model, a student enrolls, receives curriculum materials in the mail, works through the material and submits assignments to an \u201cinstructor\u201d or \u201ctutor\u201d by mail. Hopefully, the student completes everything successfully and receives accreditation. Adding computers and networks to this model changes little, except for lowering the costs of delivery and management substantially (consider the cost savings of replacing human tutor/markers with an AI system). Again, in one decade it is not uncommon for leading universities to offer high-quality online degrees. Most programs have some courses that are available to students and the \u201cpush-back\u201d from resistant faculty who associated DoIt-Yourself (DIY) learning has all but disappeared. Anya Kamenetz\u2019s 2010 DIYU: Edupunks, Edupreneurs, and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education became an instant read across higher education with blogs and tweets that raised fear throughout the academic establishment.\n\nThe title of a May 3, 2010, article in the Chronicle of Higher Education by Seth Godin was \u201cThe Coming Meltdown in Higher Education (as Seen by a Marketer).\u201d Jay Cross and colleagues  from the Internet Time Alliance, created the 2010 version of his \u201cunbook,\u201d which he and his friends call Working Smarter: Informal Learning in the Cloud. Updates to the unbook can be found regularly by Cross and friends at www.internettime.com. Despite this current groundswell, the basic pedagogical questions about education remain: To what extent do learners in isolation actually learn? The introduction of electronic communication and conferencing systems into distance education environments has no doubt be shown to improve student\u2019s experiences (Hiltz & Goldman, 2004), and this has certainly been a widespread Q2 development, but the economic and educational challenges driving online learning still make it an ambivalent choice for both students and educators concerned with the learning process and accreditation. It will take a new system of evaluation of credentials before institutional bricks and mortar will become even close to obsolete. After two decades of knowing introducing technologies into day-today work and study, institutions of higher education are \ufb01nally responding with full force to create new kinds of learning environments that include formal and informal learning (ateliers and open community labs) as well as online mixed with face-to-face (f2f) classroom learning.\n\nThe next major hurdle will be addressing global learning, a subject that New York University, for example, has moved into with full force with branches in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, not to mention satellite programs and infrastructure in Buenos Aires, Paris, London, Florence, Acra, Singapore, Prague, London, Tel Aviv, and more recently, Madrid. Digital Media for Literacy in STEM Economic urgency and a chronic labor shortage in IT (Information Technologies) and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) professions and the increasingly changing needs for updating computers and networks in the workplace continue to drive the demands for gaining design and computational literacy.\n\nLearning in both formal and informal settings, including businesses and schools, requires access to information and people who can design, built, and create curricular learning environments in disciplinary and cross-disciplinary areas. Although the \ufb01eld of technology studies as a program area has existed in high schools and universities since the 1970s, it is interesting how much variation there is in the curriculum, across grade levels, from region to region, and from school to school\u2014perhaps increasingly so as years go by. Apart from the U.S. College Board\u2019s Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Curriculum, which is focused on professional computer programming, what one school or teacher implements as the \u201ccomputer science\u201d or \u201cinformation technology\u201d curriculum is highly varied, and probably dependent on individual teachers\u2019 notions and attitudes toward what is important.\n\nThe range includes straightforward computer programming (as in the AP curriculum), multimedia production (Roschelle, Kaput, Stroup, & Kahn, 1998), technology management (Wolfson & Willinsky, 1998), exploratory learning (Harel & Papert, 1991), textbook learning about bits and bytes, and so on. Standards are hard to come by because the \ufb01eld is so varied and changing. A most straightforward conclusion one may draw from looking at our economy, workplace, and prospects for the future is that computer-based technologies are  increasingly part of how we work. It follows simply that knowing how to effectively use computers is a requirement for many jobs or careers. This basic idea drives the \u201cjob skills\u201d approach to computers in education. In this model, computer hardware and software, particularly of\ufb01ce productivity and data processing software are the cornerstone of technology curriculum, because skill with these applications is what \u201cemployers are looking for.\u201d One can \ufb01nd this model at work in most high schools and it is dominant in retraining and economic development programs.\n\nAnd although its simple logic is easy to grasp, perhaps this model is a reminder that simple  ideas can be limiting. Heeding this dilemma, Seymour Papert, invoking curriculum theorist Paolo Freire, writes,If \u201ccomputer skill\u201d is interpreted in the narrow sense of technical knowledge about computers, there is nothing the children can learn now that is worth banking. By the time they grow up, the computer skills required in the workplace will have evolved into something fundamentally different. But what makes the argument truly ridiculous is that the very idea of banking computer knowledge for use one day in the workplace undermines the only really important \u201ccomputer skill\u201d: the skill and habit of using the computer in doing whatever one is doing. (Papert, 1992, p. 51)Papert\u2019s critique of computer skills leads to a discussion of \u201ccomputer literacy,\u201d a term almost as old as computers themselves, and one that is notoriously elusive. As far back as 1985, Douglas Noble noted that no one is sure what exactly computer literacy is, but everyone seems to agree that it is good for us (Noble, 1985, p. 64).\n\nSharon Derry and Daniel Zalles (2011) go beyond a theory of literacy to exploring how literacy is important for scienti\ufb01c civic reasoning. They propose \u201cthat active, collective citizenship through responsible civic reasoning, empowered by tools of science and technology, is an important educational goal of our time.\u201d They challenge the public to explore the connection between societal phenomenon and discipline-based science, using a sixstep approach: (1) seeking consensus around what is worth studying; (2) leveraging the power structures to ensure adequate funding; (3) operationalizing systematic research; (4) employing a \u201cculture of principled, unbiased, constructive critical discourse\u201d; (5) \ufb01nding evidence for setting policy and taking civic action; and (6) evaluating effectiveness. In short, they argue that a civil society requires that children be literate/\ufb02uent with both civics and technologies.\n\nWe suggest that the two books by John Willinsky, The New Literacy (1990) and The Access Principle: The Case of Open Access to Research and Scholarship (2006) expand on the idea that one needs to be \u201cliterate in literacy\u201d (p. 236), a phrase we now change to literate in digital literacies. Willinsky\u2019s The New Literacy emerges from the roots of popular culture, the Progressive Education Movement and even further back to the Romantics. It is grounded in the critical and yet inspirational work that can be reached through the thoughtful inquiry of teachers and students working together to rede\ufb01ne a new kind of learning place. In essence, the school becomes the language of this new literacy. Fifteen years later in The Access Principle, Willinsky focuses more on how we come to know and share what we know in open access digital environments.\n\nPointing to a long history to make knowledge public, Willinsky encourages the movement of cloistered knowledges held in most part by institutional repositories toward the democratization of knowledge.[A]n open access to scholarly publishing is not simply a side issues, a matter of bussiness plans and delivery systems, in the pursuit of truth.... Rather, the potential expansion in the circulation of ideas is much about the quality of truth pursued in such settings. I would argue that the global scale of knowledge\u2019s circulation is critical to its very claim as knowledge. (2006, p. 34).Certainly, Willinsky could not have predicted what came to be called the Arab Spring in 2011. In this time of protest against the existing regimes in individual countries (Tunesia, Egypt, Syria, etc.) that are embodied in the \ufb01ght for greater freedom across the Arab world, we can see how easy to use and accessible mobile technologies as well as social media software such as Twitter and Facebook gave access to information that led to communities sharing their perspectives and critiquing existing traditions of truth through a more negotiated understanding of what was felt and understood on the ground. Although it is unclear how the quality of truth can ever be reached in complex international con\ufb02icts, perhaps, what can be found in these contested spaces is incremental agreements that bring about verisimilitude, understanding, and a more general acceptance that differences of experiences and viewpoints can be negotiated through access to knowledge, resources, and power to make changes for the good of society, a quest that the Points of Viewing Theory was designed to facilitate. If Michel Foucault\u2019s book Power/Knowledge (1980) ever needed a rereading, it is in this particular time when our media tools help both laypeople and professionals interpret information in the quest to build a more just society.\n\nStill, in this chapter, we must address what the nature of computer literacy with new media technology in STEM learning in education is. Early attempts to de\ufb01ne computer literacy come from such in\ufb02uential \ufb01gures as J. C. R. Licklider, one of the founders of what is now the Internet, and whose notion of computer literacy drew much on John Dewey\u2019s ideas about a democratic populus of informed citizens. As computers became almost ubiquitous in the \ufb01rst decade of the 21st century, people began what now seems like a lifelong exploration to understand the role of these new technologies in their lives. The inevitable reduction of \u201ccomputer literacy\u201d to a laundry list of knowledge and skills (compare with E. D. Hirsch\u2019s controversial Cultural Literacy) prompted Papert to respond with appeals to the richness of what \u201cliteracy\u201d means:When we say \u201cX is a very literate person,\u201d we do not mean that X is highly skilled at deciphering phonics. At the least, we imply that X knows literature, but beyond this we mean that X has certain ways of understanding the world that derive from an acquaintance with literary culture. In the same way, the term computer literacy should refer to the kinds of knowing that derive from computer culture. (1992, p. 52, italics added)Other contributions to the notion of digital literacy remain rooted in the particular perspectives of their contributors. Alan Kay (1996) wrote of an \u201cauthoring literacy.\u201d Journalist Paul Gilster (2000) talked about \u201cdigital literacy.\u201d Andrea diSessa (1998; 2000), creator of the Boxer environment,  wrote extensively on \u201ccomputational literacy,\u201d a notion he projected that will rise above the banality of earlier conceptions.\n\nClearly, by computational literacy I do not mean a casual familiarity with a machine that  computes. In retrospect, I \ufb01nd it remarkable that society has allowed such a shameful debasing of the term literacy in its conventional use in connection with computers. (diSessa 2000, p. 5) Spiro, Collins, and Ramchandran (2007), an educational pioneer of how learning changes with hypermedia, multimedia, and now web-base interactive media, explained how learners become literate using the global and well-known approach called Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT). Using the following analogy of \u201ccrisscrossing landscapes,\u201d they weave a way for learners to gain \u201cdeep learning\u201d in knowledge domains that are \u201cillstructured.\u201d When one criss-crosses landscapes of knowledge in many directions (the main instructional metaphor of CFT, drawn from Wittgenstein, a revisiting is not a repeating. The result is knowledge representations whose strength is determined not by a single conceptual thread running through all or most parts of the domain\u2019s representation, but rather from the overlapping of many shorter conceptual \u201c\ufb01bers\u201d (Wittgenstein, 1953), as be\ufb01ts an ill-structured domain. (Spiro, Collins, & Ramchandran, 2007, p. 96)\n\nThe dif\ufb01culty of coming to terms with computer or digital literacy in any straightforward way has led Mary Bryson and Suzanne de Castell (1998) to identify the \u201cmiracle worker\u201d discourse that results, in which \u201cexperts\u201d are called on to step into a situation and implement the wonders that technology promises.[W]e hear that what is essential for the implementation and integration of technology in the classroom is that teachers should become \u201ccomfortable\u201d using it...we have a master code capable of utilizing in one platform what for the entire history of our species thus far has been irreducibly different kinds of things... every conceivable form of information can now be combined with every other kind to create a different form of communication, and what we seek is comfort and familiarity? (de Castell, Bryson, & Jenson, 2000, italics added)Familiarity and comfort, indeed! Bring on the affordances, they are proposing! However dif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne, some sense of \u201cliteracy\u201d is going to be an inescapable part of thinking about digital technology and learning. If we move beyond a simple instrumental view of the computer and what it can do, and take seriously how it changes the ways in which we relate to our world, then the issue of how we relate to such technologies, in the complex sense of a literacy, will remain crucial.\n\nDigital Media as Thinking Tool\nDavid Jonassen is perhaps best known in the educational technology domain as the educator connected with bringing to prominence the idea of computer as mind tool (1996, 2005). Breaking rank with his previous instructionist approach detailing what he termed frames for instruction (Duffy; Jonassen, 1992), Jonassen\u2019s later work re\ufb02ects the inspiration of leading constructionist thinkers like Seymour Papert. One of the classic quotations on the use of the computer as a tool from Papert\u2019s landmark book, Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas (1980), is:For me, the phrase \u201ccomputer as pencil\u201d evokes the kind of uses I imagine children of the future making of computers. Pencils are used for scribbling as well as writing, doodling as well as drawing, for illicit notes as well as for of\ufb01cial assignments. (Papert, 210)Although Papert did not predict Facebook and Twitter, he did say that technologies of the future would enable \u201cillicit notes.\u201d Although it is easy to think of the computer as a simple tool\u2014a  technological device that we use to accomplish a certain task as we use a pen, abacus, canvas, ledger book, \ufb01le cabinet, and so on\u2014a tool can be much more than just a better pencil. It can be a vehicle for interacting with our intelligence\u2014a thinking tool and a creative tool. For example, a popular notion is that learning mathematics facilitates abstract and analytic thinking. This does not mean that mathematics can be equated with abstract thinking. The computer as a tool enables learners of mathematics to play with the elements that create the structures of the discipline. To use Papert\u2019s example, children using the Logo programming language explore mathematics and geometry by manipulating a virtual \u201cturtle\u201d on the screen to act out movements that form geometric entities (Papert, 1980). Children programming in Logo think differently about their thinking, becoming epistemologists. As Papert would say, Logo is not just a better pencil for doing mathematics but a tool for thinking more deeply about mathematics, by creating procedures and programs, structures within structures, constructed, deconstructed, and reconstructed into larger wholes.\n\nPapert led a groundbreaking series of research projects that brought computing technology to schoolchildren using Logo. In Mindstorms, Papert explained that Logo puts children in charge of creating computational objects\u2014originally, by programming a mechanical \u201cturtle\u201d (a 1.5-foot-round object that could be programmed to move on the \ufb02oor and could draw a line on paper as it moved around), and then later a \u201cvirtual\u201d turtle that moved on the computer screen. A proteg\u00b4 e of Jean Piaget, Papert was concerned with the dif\ufb01cult transition from \u201cconcrete\u201d to \u201cformal\u201d thinking. Papert saw the computer as the tool that could make the abstract concrete:Stated most simply, my conjecture is that the computer can concretize (and personalize) the formal. Seen in this light, it is not just another powerful educational tool. It is unique in providing us with the means for addressing what Piaget and many others see as the obstacle which is overcome in the passage from child to adult thinking. (Papert, 1980, p. 21)Beyond Piaget\u2019s notion of constructivism, the theory of constructionism focused its lens less on the stages of thought production and more on the artifacts that learners build as creative expressions of their understanding.\n\nPapert understood the computer as not merely being a tool (in the sense of a hammer) but as an object-to-think-with that facilitates novel ways of thinking. Constructionism\u2014the N word as opposed to the V word\u2014 shares constructivism\u2019s connotation of learning as building knowledge structures irrespective of the circumstances of the learning. It then adds the idea that this happens especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity, whether it\u2019s a sand castle on the beach or a theory of the universe. (Papert,1991, p. 1)\n\nBy the late 1980s, the research conducted by the Learning and Epistemology Research Group at MIT was one of the most in\ufb02uential forces in learning technology research. A large-scale intensive research project called Project Headlight was conducted at the Hennigan School in Boston, studying all manner of phenomena around the experience of schoolchildren and Logo-equipped computers. A snapshot of this research is found in the edited volume, Constructionism (Harel & Papert, 1991), which covers the perspectives of sixteen researchers. For example, Aaron Falbel and Ricki Goldman-Segall situated their research in Illich\u2019s theory of conviviality as described in Tools for Conviviality (Illich, 1973)\u2014a theory that, in its simplest form, recommends tools be simple to use, accessible to all, and bene\ufb01cial for humankind. Falbel worked with children to create animation from original drawings and to think of themselves as convivial learners (Falbel, 19XX). Goldman-Segall conducted a three-year\ndigital video ethnography of children\u2019s thinking styles in computer-rich learning cultures and created a computerbased video analysis tool called Learning Constellations to analyze her video cases (1990). In Judy Sachter\u2019s work, children explored their understanding of  three-dimensional rotation and computer graphics, leading the way for understanding how children understand gaming (Sachter, 19XX).\n\nAt the same time, Mitchell Resnick, Steve Ocko, and Fred Martin designed smart LEGO bricks (crickets) controlled by Logo ((Martin, 1995; Martin & Resnick, 1993; Resnick & Ocko, 1991). These Lego objects could be programmed to move according to Logo commands. Researcher Nira Granott asked adult learners to deconstruct how and why these Lego robotic creatures moved in the way they did. Her goal was to understand the construction of internal cognitive structures that allow an interactive relationship between creator and user (Granott,1991). Granott\u2019s theory of how diverse individuals understand the complex movements of Lego/Logo \u201ccreatures\u201d was woven into a new fabric, which Resnick\u2014working with Lego/Logo robots\u2014called distributed constructionism (Resnick, 1991, 1994). Uri Wilensky, with Resnick, deepened the theoretical framework around the behavior of complex systems, introducing a \u201clevels\u201d framework (Resnick & Wilensky, 1998; Wilensky & Reisman, 2006; Wilensky & Resnick, 1999).\n\nTo model, describe, predict and explain emergent phenomena in complex systems, Resnick and Wilensky designed StarLogo; Wilensky has more recently designed the more widely used successor, NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999) which also includes a module for conducting participatory simulations (Wilensky & Stroup, 1999). Wilensky, a mathematician concerned with expanding mathematics education, connected it more to science education and to probability (Wilensky, 1993), is often cited for his asking a simple question to young people: How do geese \ufb02y in formation? The answers that young people give show how interesting yet dif\ufb01cult emergent phenomena are to describe.\n\nMathematics was an important frame for much of the research conducted in Project Headlight. Papert himself was a noted mathematician. In one study at the Hennigan School, Idit Harel worked with groups of children creating games in Logo for other children to use in learning about fractions (1991). The idea that children could be designers of their own learning  environments was developed further by Yasmin Kafai who introduced computer design to understand how girls and boys think when playing and designing games, a topic of great interest to video game designers (Kafai, 1993, 1996). Kafai spent more than a decade creating a range of video game environments for girls and boys to design environments for learning (and now works with more tactile digial textures). Kafai connected the world of playing and designing to the life of the classroom in a number of studies in the 1990s and early 2000s. Here current work at the University of Pennsylvania focuses on topics connected with the Learning Sciences, constructionism, games, virtual worlds, and gender.\n\nSeymour Papert\u2019s legacy continues to grow and morph as his \ufb01rst generation of students from the early years at the MIT Media Lab expand their research in various academic and industry homes: Uri Wilensky at Northwestern University, Idit Harel at her company, WorldWideWorkshop, Carol Strohecker at the University of North Carolina, Edith Ackermann at MIT, Yasmin Kafai at the University of Pennsylvania, Mitchel Resnick at MIT, Ricki Goldman at New York University, Nira Granott at the University of Texas, Dallas, Fred Martin at University of Massachusetts, Lowell, Susan Imholz at Pepperdine, Yasmin Kafai at University of Pennsylvania, and David Schaffer at University at Wisconsin, Madison. Sustained for over thirty years now, this community of researchers has studied a range of learning environments using games, tools, robots, and video data analysis systems using a Papertian constructionist perspective that continues to spread among new generations of scholars.\n\nConstructionism may have taken on a more social, ecological and distributed approach than Papert \ufb01rst proposed, but these changes are to be expected given the changes in technologies in this same period.\n\nDigital Media for Scaffolding\n\nThe computer asscaffold is yet another alternative to tool, environment, or partner. This version makes reference to Vygotsky\u2019s construct of the zone of proximal development (ZPD).[T]he distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 86)The scaffold metaphor originally referred to the role of the teacher, embodying the characteristics of providing support, providing a supportive tool, extending the learner\u2019s range, allowing the learner to accomplish tasks not otherwise possible, and being selectively usable (Green\ufb01eld, 1984, p. 118). Vygotsky\u2019s construct has been picked up by designers of educational software, in particular the CSILE project at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE).\n\nAt OISE, Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter worked toward developing a collaborative knowledge-building environment and asked how learners (children) could be given relatively more control over the ZPD through directing the kinds of questions that drive educational inquiry (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991). The CSILE environment provided a scaffolded conferencing and notetaking environment in which learners themselves could be in charge of the questioning and inquiry of collaborative work\u2014something more traditionally controlled by the teacher\u2014in such a way that kept the endeavor from degenerating into chaos.\n\nAnother example of technological scaffolding comes from George Landow\u2019s research into using hypertext and hypermedia\u2014nonlinear, reader-driven text and media\u2014in the study of English literature (Landow & Delany, 1993). In Landow\u2019s research, a student could gain more information about some aspect of Shakespeare, for example, by following any number of links presented in an electronic document. A major component of Landow\u2019s work was his belief in providing students with the context of the subject matter. The technological scaffolding provides a way of managing that context\u2014so that it is not so large, or complicated, or daunting that it prevents learners from exploring, but \ufb02exible and inviting enough to encourage exploration beyond the original text. The question facing future researchers of these non-linear and alternately structures technologies may be this: Can the computer environment create a place in which the context or the culture, as anthropologist Clifford Geertz (1973) would say, is felt, understood, and can be communicated to others? More controversially, perhaps, can these technologies be designed and guided by the learners themselves without losing the richness that direct engagement with experts and teachers can offer them?\n\nDigital Media for Cognitive Partnering\n\nSomewhere amid conceiving of computing technology as arti\ufb01cial mind and conceiving of it as communications medium is the notion of computer as partner. This somewhat more romanticized version of \u201ctechnology as tool\u201d puts more emphasis on the communicative and interactive aspects of computing. A computer is more than a tool like the pencil that one writes with because, in some sense, it writes back. And although this idea has surely existed since early AI and ITS research, it wasn\u2019t until an important article in the early 1990s (Salomon, Perkins, & Globerson, 1991) that the idea of computers as \u201cpartners in cognition\u201d was truly elaborated.\n\nAs early as the 1970s, Gavriel Salomon had been exploring the use of media (television in particular) and its effect upon childhood cognition (Salomon, 1979). Well versed in Marshall McLuhan\u2019s (1964) adage, the medium is the message, later to become the medium is the massage, Salomon has built a bridge between those who propose an instrumentalist view of media (media effects theory) and those who understand media to be a cultural artifact in and of itself. Along these lines, in 1991, Salomon, David Perkins, and Tamar Globerson drew a very important distinction:Effects with technology obtained during partnership with it, and effects of it in terms of the transferable cognitive residue that this partnership leaves behind in the form of better mastery of \u201cskills and strategies.\u201d (Salomon, Perkins, & Globerson, 1991, p. 2)Their article came at a time when the effects of computers on learners were being roundly criticized (Pea & Kurland, 1987; Sloan, 1985), and helped break new ground toward a more distributed view of knowledge and learning (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1996 [1989]; Pea, 1985 &1993). To conceive of the computer as a partner in cognition\u2014or learning, or work\u2014is to admit it into the cultural milieu, to foreground the idea that the machine, in some way has agency or at least in\ufb02uence in our thinking.\n\nIf we ascribe agency to the machine, we are going some way toward anthropomorphizing it, a topic Sherry Turkle has written about extensively (Turkle, 1984, 1995). Goldman-Segall writes of her partnership with digital research tools as \u201ca partnership of intimacy and immediacy\u201d (1998a, p. 33). MIT interface theorist Andrew Lippman de\ufb01ned interactivity as mutual activity and  interruptibility (Brand, 1987), and Alluquere Rosanne Stone goes further, referring to the partnership with machines as \u201ca prosthetic device\u201d for constructing desire (Stone, 1995). Computers are, as Alan Kay envisioned in the early 1970s, personal machines.\n\nThe notion of computers as cognitive partners is further exempli\ufb01ed in research conducted by anthropologist Lucy Suchman at Xerox. Suchman\u2019s Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human- Machine Communication explored the difference between rational, purposive plans, and circumstantial, negotiated, situated actions. Rather than actions being imperfect copies of rational plans, Suchman showed how \u201cplans\u201d are idealized representations of real-world actions. With this in mind, Suchman argued that, rather than working toward more and more elaborate computational models of purposive action, researchers give priority to the contextual situatedness of practice:A basic research goal for studies of situated action, therefore, is to explicate the relationship between structures of action and the resources and constraints afforded by physical and social circumstances. (Suchman, 1987, p. 179)Suchman\u2019s colleagues at Xerox PARC in the 1980s designed tools as structures within working contexts; innovative technologies such as collaborative design boards, real-time virtual meeting spaces, and video conferencing between co-workers were a few of the environments at PARC where people could scaffold their existing practices.\n\nMedia for Social Constructionism\n\nHistorically, constructivist learning theories were rooted in the epistemologies of social  on structivist philosopher John Dewey, social psychologist Lev Vygotsky, developmental and cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner. Knowledge of the world is seen to be constructed through experience; the role of education is to guide the learner through experiences that provide opportunities to construct knowledge about the world. In Piaget\u2019s version, this process is structured by the sequence of developmental stages. In Vygostsky\u2019s cultural-historical version, the process is mediated by the tools and contexts of the child\u2019s sociocultural environment. As a result of the in\ufb02uence of Vygotsky\u2019s work, researchers in a variety of institutions view the computer and new media technologies as environments, drawing on the notion that learning happens best for children when they are engaged in creating personally meaningful digital media artifacts and sharing them publicly. Learning and Epistemology Group, the Center for Children and Technology, Vanderbilt\u2019s Cognition and Technology Group, TERC, the Concord Consortium in Boston, Georgia Tech, and SRI are just a few of the exemplary research settings involved in the exploration of learning and teaching using technologies as learning environments during the 1990s. Several of these communities (SRI International, Stanford, Berkeley, and the Concord Consortium) formed an association called CILT, the Center for Innovation in Learning and Teaching, which became a hub for researchers from many institutions. More recently, a National Science Foundation Science of Learning Center called LIFE (Learning in Informal and Formal Environments), was established. It is hosted at the University of Washington in partnership with Stanford University and SRI International.\n\nThe range of methodological perspectives employed in these various research institutions, however, is as diverse as might be expected. Moreover, the discussion about what constitutes good research varied from community to community with some using mostly qualitative methods and others using quantitative measures and methods. Qualitative research methods, with their emphasis on case studies and in-depth analyses, best describe the conclusions of a study that is constructionist by design. Constructionists tend to be interested in digging around in the complexity of a small set of events while instructionists tend to focus on the organization of a larger set of variables. An instructionist tends to \ufb01rst look at a whole system and then break the whole into smaller units to be learned or processed; constructionists build up. They put together small units and combine micro-procedures into the elements\u2014or chunks\u2014of larger structures and wholes. This does not mean that constructionists do not have plans as they tinker or play with computational objects. Far from it; constructionists have plans which are in continual \ufb02ux as the parts of any whole program are built, assembled, and integrated (Suchman, 1987). Even the smallest change in a procedure can dramatically alter the outcome of a program. The designer/constructionist \u201ctweaks\u201d code at both top and bottom levels in the in\ufb01nite re\ufb01nement of an artifact.\n\nWhen individuals and groups create digital media artifacts, those artifacts then inhabit the learning environment, creating an ecology that we share with one another and with our media constructions. Technology can be seen as an expressive tool that allows learners to manipulate objects-to-think-with and through exploration and re\ufb02ection to come to more formal understandings of systems and relationships. Technology is thus not just an instrument we use within an environment, but is part of the social and ecological environment itself.\n\nDigital Media for Collaborative and Distance Learning\n\nThe most signi\ufb01cant advancement of collaborative learning with computers is the development of the ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) community, which hosts a bi-annual conference and a journal called the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning. In a 1996 article, Timothy Koschmann suggested that the major educational technology paradigm of the late 1990s would be CSCL, a close relative of the emerging \ufb01eld of computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW). Educational technology, Koschmann pointed out, is now concerned with collaborative activities, largely using networks and computer conferencing facilities. Whether CSCL constitutes a paradigm shift is a question that is yet to be answered, but Koschmann\u2019s identi\ufb01cation of the trend is well noted. Two oft-cited research papers by Margaret Riel (and colleagues) into this category: Margaret Riel, James Levin, and colleagues on \u201cteleprenticeship\u201d (Levin, Riel, Miyake, & Cohen, 1987) and \u201clearning circles\u201d (Riel, 1993, 1996). Learning circles connected many students at great distances\u2014classroom to classroom as much as student to student\u2014in large-scale collaborative learning.\n\nHiltz and Turoff\u2019s Network Nation (1978), although originally concerned mostly with business communications and management science, explored teaching and learning with network technologies, applying their insights to practical problems of teaching and learning online. In general, the more the course is oriented to teaching basic skills (such as deriving mathematical proofs), the more the lecture is needed in some form as an ef\ufb01cient means of delivering illustrations of skills. However, the more the course involves pragmatics, such as interpretations of case studies, the more valuable is the CMC [Computer Mediated Communication] mode of delivery. (Hiltz & Turoff, 1993 [1978], p. 471)\n\n(Looking a bit further back in time, one needs to re\ufb02ect for a moment on the earliest beginnings of this research. It is often credited to the work of Douglas Engelbart at SRI in the 1960s (Bootstrap Institute, 1994). Englebart\u2019s work centered on the oNLine System (NLS), a combination of hardware and software that facilitated the \ufb01rst networked collaborative computing, setting the stage for workgroup computing, document management systems, electronic mail, and the \ufb01eld of computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW).\n\nThe \ufb01rst computer conference management information system, EMISARI, was created by Murray Turoff while working in the U.S. Of\ufb01ce of Emergency Preparedness in the late 1960s and was used for monitoring disruptions and managing crises. Turoff continued developing networked, collaborative computing at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in the 1970s working with Starr Roxanne Hiltz. Turoff and Hiltz founded the \ufb01eld of computer-mediated communication (CMC) with their landmark book, The Network Nation (1993 [1978]). The book describes a new world of computer conferencing and communications, and is to this day impressive in its comprehensive insightfulness. Hiltz and Turoff\u2019s work inspired a generation of computer mediated communication researchers, notably including technology theorist Andrew Feenberg (1987) at San Diego State University, and Virtual-U founder Linda Harasim (1990, 1993) at Simon Fraser University.\n\nParallel to the early development of CMC, research in CAI (Computer Assisted Learning) began to take seriously the possibilities of connecting students over networks. As mentioned earlier, the PLATO system at the University of Illinois was probably the \ufb01rst large-scale distributed CAI\nsystem. PLATO was a large time-sharing system, designed (and indeed economically required) to support thousands of users connecting from networked terminals. In the 1970s, PLATO began to offer peer-to-peer conferencing features, making it one of the \ufb01rst online educational\ncommunities (Woolley, 1994).\n\nDistance education researchers were interested in CMC, too, as an adjunct to or replacement for more traditional modes of communication, such as audio teleconferencing and the postal service. The British Open University was an early testbed of online conferencing. A. W. Bates (1988), and Alexander Romiszowski and Johan de Haas (1989) were looking into the opportunities presented by Q5 computer conferencing and the challenges of conducting groups in these text-only environments. Bates has written extensively about the management and planning of technology-based distance education, drawing on two decades of experience building \u201copen learning\u201d systems in the United Kingdom and Canada (Bates, 1995).\n\nIn the 1990s, Hiltz wrote extensively about Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) and education. Her 1994 book, The Virtual Classroom, elaborates a methodology for conducting education in computer-mediated environments emphasizing the importance of assignments using group collaboration to improve motivation. Hiltz hoped that students would share their assignments with the community rather than being \u201cmailed\u201d to the instructor. Hiltz was surely on a pioneering player in online learning during the late 1980s and early 1990s inspiring researchers around the world to realize the promise of \u201canyplace, anytime\u201d learning (Harasim, 1993) and study the dynamics of teachers and learners in online asynchronous conferencing systems.\n\nRoxanne Hiltz and Ricki Goldman (2005), in their collaboration on an edited book called Learning Together Online: Research on Asynchronous Learning Networks discuss the past, present, and future educational research on Asynchronous Networked Learning (ALN) community. In their \ufb01nal chapter the researchers remind us that being part of a social network is about growing a culture of learners. Using the example of jazz players, they note that,[W]hile some artists say they \ufb01nd that the required social networking keeps them away from their real passion, creating their works, many maintain that the continual push and pull with...the social world of their artistry enables them to see things with a greater perspective when returning to their work. What we are describing is a culture where the learners drive to create is appreciated, the artifacts that are created have a public sphere to be shown in, and the system is supported because it offers important values to the healthfulness of society. In short, cultures are created supporting members\u2019 activities and these cultures then produce sub-cultures while affecting changes to the overall culture. (Goldman & Hiltz, 2005.)In the early 1990s, students, teachers, and researchers around the world began to engage in networked collaborative projects. At the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at Northwestern University, the Collaborative Visualization (Co-Vis) project involved groups of young people in different schools conducting experiments and gathering scienti\ufb01c data on weather patterns (Edelson, Pea, & Gomez, 1996). Research at the Multimedia Ethnographic Research Lab (MERLin) at the University of British Columbia focused on how young people, teachers, and researchers conducted ethnographic investigations on a complex environmental crisis at Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island (Goldman-Segall, 1994), with the aim of communicating with other young people in diverse locations. The Global Forest project was centered on a CDROM database of video but used the World Wide Web to allow participants from around the world to share diverse points of viewing and interpretation of the video data. At the TERC research center, large-scale collaborative projects were designed in conjunction with the National Geographic Society Kids Network (Feldman, Konold, & Q6 Coulter, 2000; Tinker, 1996).\n\nThe TERC project was concerned with \u201cnetwork science\u201d and as with Riel\u2019s learning circles, multiple classrooms collaborated together, in this case gathering environmental science data and sharing in its analysis. For example, in the NGS Kids Network Acid Rain unit, students collect data about acid rain in their own communities, submit these data to the central database, and retrieve the full set of data collected by hundreds of schools. When examined by students, the full set of data may reveal patterns of acidity in rainfall that no individual class is able discover by itself based on its own data. Over time, the grid of student measurements would have the potential to be much more \ufb01nely grained than anything available to scientists, and this would become a potential resource for scientists to use. (Feldman, Konold, & Coulter, 2000, p. 7) One of the most interesting developments in CMC since the advent of the Internet is immersive virtual reality environments\u2014particularly MUDs and MOOs\u2014within which learners can meet, interact, and collaboratively work on research or constructed artifacts (Bruckman,\n1998; Dede, 1994; Haynes & Holmevik, 1998).\n\nVirtual environments, along with the popular but less interesting \u201cchat\u201d systems on the Internet, add synchronous communications to the synchronous modes so extensively researched and written about since Hiltz and Turoff\u2019s early work. One could position these immersive, virtual environments as perspectivity technologies as they create spaces for participants to create and share their worlds. There were many who predicted the cultural, social, economic, and educational impact of the Internet as a site for collaboration. Indeed, from the standpoint of the 21st century, most nonmaterial collaborations and works created collaboratively, in some way, involve the Internet. The result is that all education computing is a communications system, involving distributed systems, peerto-peer communication, telementoring, or some similar construct\u2014quite as Roxanne Star Hiltz and Murray Turoff predicted in the 1970s. Along with \u201csocial media\u201d as a common activity, perspectivity technologies (technologies which enable, encourage, and expand users\u2019 points of viewing) can be designed to create more democratic, interactive, convivial, and contextual communication that involve stakeholders\u2019 decisions (Goldman-Segall, 2000;Goldman & Dong, 2009). Goldman and Dong also discus the POV-T in relation to multimedia representations for teaching, learning, and research in socially networked\nlearning environments.\n\nThe Internet has clearly opened up enormous possibilities for shared learning. The emergence of broad standards for Internet software has lent a stability and relative simplicity to learning software. Moreover, the current widespread availability and use of Internet technologies could be said to mark the end of CMC as a research \ufb01eld unto itself, as it practically merges CMC with all manner of other conceptualizations of new media technological devices: CAI, intelligent tutoring systems, simulations, robotics, smart boards, wireless communications, wearable technologies, pervasive technologies, and even smart appliances.\n\nDigital Media as Perspectivity-Sharing\n\nSocial media and interactive video and computer games are engaging because they involve the perspectives and opinions of users who contribute to their networked communities. Using Perspectivity Technologies learners/participants become collaborators, curators, creators, and builders, layering their viewpoints and becoming connected with each other in ways that enable commensurability. Commensurabilty is a state where understanding of each other\u2019s cultures is reached, if only temporarily. One could trace the \ufb01rst glimmer of perspectivity technologies to Xerox\u2019 PARC in the 1970s. There, Alan Kay was inventing what we now recognize as the \u201cpersonal computer,\u201d a small, customizable device with substantial\ncomputing power, mass storage, and the ability to handle multiple media formats. Kay\u2019s advances, while simply pedestrian today, were at the time revolutionary. Kay\u2019s vision of small, self-contained personal computers was without precedent, as was his vision of how they would be used: as personalized media construction toolkits that would usher in a new kind of literacy. With this literacy would start the discourse between technology as scienti\ufb01c tool and technology as personal expression. The particular aim of [Xerox\u2019 Learning Research Group] was to \ufb01nd the equivalent of writing\u2014that is, learning and thinking by doing in a medium\u2014our new \u201cpocket universe.\u201d (Kay, 1996, p. 552)\n\nAt Bank Street College in the 1980s, a video and videodisc project called \u201cThe Voyage of the Mimi\u201d immersed learners in scienti\ufb01c exploration of whales and Mayan cultures. Learners identi\ufb01ed strongly with the student characters in the video stories. Similarly, the Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (CTGV) were working on video-based units in an attempt to involve students in scienti\ufb01c inquiry (Martin, 1987). \u201cThe Adventures of Jasper Woodbury\u201d was a series of videodisc-based adventures, which provided students with engaging content and contexts for solving mysteries and mathematical problems (Vanderbilt Learning Technology Center website). While both of these environments were outstanding exemplars of students using various media forms to get to know the people and the culture within the story structures, the lasting contribution is not only one of enhanced mathematical or social studies understanding, but rather a connection to people who are engaged in real-life inquiry.\n\nWith an AI orientation, computer scientist, inventor, and educator Elliot Soloway at the University of Michigan built tools to enable learners to create personal hypermedia documents, reminiscent of Kay\u2019s personalized media construction toolkits. Soloway and his colleagues continue to\nstudy project-based science through the design of sophisticated technologies developed for distributed knowledge construction since their landmark article called \u201cThe casebook of project practices: An example of an interactive multimedia system for professional development\u201d (Krajcik, Soloway, Blumenfeld, Marx, Ladewski, Bos & Hayes, 1996). Complementary pioneering work started by Marcia Linn at Berkeley analyzed the cognition of students who wrote programs in the computer language LISP, and Andrea diSessa, also at Berkeley, who studied students learning physics using his program called Boxer.\n\nFor diSessa, physics deals with,[A] rather large number of fragments rather than one or even any small number of integrated structures one might call \u201ctheories.\u201d Many of these fragments can be understood as simple abstractions from common experiences that are taken as relatively primitive in the sense that they generally need no explanation; they simply happen. (diSessa,1988, p. 52)Andrea diSessa\u2019s theory of physics resonates strongly with the notion of bricolage, a term \ufb01rst used by the French structural anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss (1968) to describe a person who builds from pieces and does not have a speci\ufb01c plan at the onset of the project. Levi-Strauss was often used as a point of departure for cognitive scientists interested in the analysis of fragments rather than in building broad generalizations from top-down rationalist structures. By the 1990s, French social theory has indeed in\ufb01ltrated the cognitive paradigm, legitimizing cultural analysis.\n\nStrongly in\ufb02uenced by the notion of bricolage, Goldman-Segall\u2019s (now Goldman) early digital ethnographies of children\u2019s thinking (1990, 1991, 1998) and more recent collaborative studies with her colleagues about girls\u2019 prototyping video games to promote mathematics learning in low socio-economic communities are rich examples of perspectivity theory. In these works, Goldman establishes unique partnerships among viewer, author, and media texts; a set of partnerships that revolves around, and is revolved around, the constant recognition of cultural connections as core factors in using new-media technologies.\n\nSituating her digital ethnographic work in Clifford Geertz\u2019s notion of the thick description, Goldman explores the tenuous, and often permeable, layered relations between creator, user, and media artifact through an online environment for video analysis (1989, 1998). A video segment, for example, is the representation of a moment in the making of cultures. A video object is a cultural object and also a \u201cpersonal subject-to think-with,\u201d something to turn around and reshape together. And, just as we change it through our manipulation, so it changes both our cultural possibilities and us. A fuller description of this theory can be found in the volume, Video Research in the Learning Sciences (Goldman, Pea, Barron & Derry, 2007), published with 67 learning science video researchers.\n\nAnother example of a perspectivity technology is described in the doctoral work of Maggie Beers who explored preservice teachers\u2019 learning modern languages to build and critique digital artifacts connecting self and other (Beers, 2001; Beers & Goldman-Segall, 2001). Beers has shown how groups of preservice teachers create video artifacts as representations of their various cultures in order to share and understand each others\u2019 perspectives as an integral part of learning a foreign language. The self becomes a strong reference point for understanding others while engaged in many contexts with media tools and artifacts.\n\nAnother exemplary application of perspectivity theory is demonstrated by Gerry Stahl. Stahl has been working on the idea of perspective and technology at the University of Colorado for more than a decade. His WebGuide forms the technical foundation into an investigation of the role of artifacts in collaborative knowledge building for deepening perspective. Drawing on Vygotsky\u2019s theories of cultural mediation, Stahl\u2019s work develops models of collaborative knowledge building, and the role of shared cultural artifacts\u2014and particularly digital media artifacts\u2014in that process (Stahl, 1999).\n\nIn sum, perspectivity technologies enhance, motivate, and provide new opportunities for learning, teaching, and research because they address how the personal point of view connects with evolving discourse communities. Perspectivity thinking tools enable knowledge-based cultures to grow, creating both real and virtual communities within the learning environment to share information, to alter the self/other relationship, and to open the door to a deeper, richer partnership with our technologies and one another. Just as a language changes as speakers alter the original form, so does the nature of discourse-communities change as cultures spread and variations of meanings are coconstructed.\n\nDigital Media for Playing and Learning With Games\n\nVideo and computer games are popular and motivating environments, and there have been calls to use them as a way to get students more engaged in education and to use them as effective environments for learning (e.g., Prensky, 2007). James Gee (2007) makes the case that video games have many of the characteristics that learning science researchers often recommend for the design of effective learning environments. When well-designed digital games represent conceptual play spaces in which learners/players can work in teams or by themselves to creatively solve problems, develop and test hypotheses, and investigate the game system and its rules (Barab, Sadler, Heiselt, Hickey, & Zuiker, 2007; Shaffer, 2006), learners can play at their own pace, set their own goals, and regulate their own exploration behaviors in an environment that also engages them on behavioral, cognitive, and emotional levels (Domagk, Schwartz, & Plass, 2010). However, the results from studies of how people learn content from and with video games are mixed. This suggests that careful research is needed to show under what conditions games are effective for learning.\n\nWhat we do know at this time is that experimental research has shown strong improvements of basic perceptual and cognitive processes as a result of playing certain video games. Several studies have shown that action games, that is, video games that require players to divide their attention over multiple targets (e.g., Halo), result in signi\ufb01cant increases in players\u2019 contrast sensitivity, as well as in the players\u2019 ability to do divided attention tasks, which is a basic attention cognitive skill (Green & Bavelier, 2003; Green\ufb01eld, deWinstanley, Kilpatrick, & Kaye, 1994). Play of video games using visual and spatial skills (e.g., Tetris) also increases those basic cognitive processes (Subrahmanyam & Green\ufb01eld, 1994); and, play of action video games (e.g., Unreal Tournament) results in increased spatial resolution and visual acuity (Green & Bavelier, 2007).\n\nTo understand the bene\ufb01t of using video games in a learning context, one needs to examine their potential future function in the learning process. Heuristics of existing games suggest four such functions: (1) prepare for future learning, (2) teach new knowledge or skills, (3) automate existing knowledge or skills, and (4) acquire 21st-century skills (Plass, Perlin, & Isbister, 2010). Preparation for future learning. Games to prepare for future learning do not aim to teach speci\ufb01c knowledge or skills, but to provide learners with a shared experience based on which content can be taught. Game genres typically used for such games therefore include adventure\ngames, open-ended simulation games, and role-playing games where students have an opportunity to take on different perspectives through role playing. Research by Hammer and Black (2009) suggests that the best use of video games in content (and perhaps other) learning might be in providing experience with the subject matter that will lead to better future learning of related material from a more formal learning setting.\n\nIn one study, Hammer and Black looked at expert players of the Civilization history simulation game and found that these expert players did not know any more about the historical content contained in the game than expert players of another unrelated game (Sim City) did. So far, this is consistent with the comparison research on content learning with video games. However, this study also examined how much the expert Civilization players would learn from reading a college textbook chapter on related historical content, and found that the Civilization players learned much more from reading the chapter than the expert players of the Sim City comparison game. Thus, having the experience of grappling with historical issues in the game may have provided the players with a set of experiences, as John Dewey (1938) said, that better prepared them for future learning from a more formal learning approach (Bransford & Schwartz, 2001).\n\nA related approach is the Teachable Agents Project at Vanderbilt. Using the Teachable Agents system, students learn by creating a concept map for a topic (e.g., river ecology) that then becomes what their online agent (avatar) knows about the topic. The system then puts questions to the agent and the students can see how well they know the topic by how well the agent does (and revise their and their agents\u2019 knowledge by changing the concept map and trying again). There is even a version where students\u2019 agents can \u201cplay\u201d against each other in a simulated TV quiz show, so that the students can see which concept maps work the best. Experimental research studies showed that students learning with Teachable Agents learned better (especially causal chains) than alternative approaches like standard classroom instruction and using concept maps. Teach new knowledge and skills. A strong case can be made that most if not all games teach the learner new knowledge or skills (Gee, 2007). However, the effectiveness or ef\ufb01cacy of games for learning at a large scale has not yet been suf\ufb01ciently investigated. Disagreement among researchers exists whether the very features that make games motivating and engaging\u2014the use of narratives to provide context and relevance, the design of emotional experiences, opportunities for discovery and exploration, and the use of compelling visual representations\u2014 facilitate learning or whether they introduce extraneous cognitive processing demands on working memory that suppress learning (Kirschner, Sweller, &Clark, 2006).\n\nStudies that have compared learning academic content (as opposed to attention and visual-spatial cognitive skills) have shown negative results for learning from video games. For example, Egenfeldt-Nielsen (2005) compared learning about European history from playing a history simulation game to learning the same content in a classroom, and found that students learned more from the classroom. Similarly, Mayer, MacNamara, and Adams (2011) found that students learned more about ecology by merely going through PowerPoint slides than they did from playing an ecology simulation game. On the other hand, qualitative and observational studies have showed student learning from video games (Barab, Zuiker, Warren, Hickey, Ingram-Goble, Kwon, & Herring., 2007; Squire, 2004). These results suggest that more sophisticated research methods have to be employed that use both qualitative and quantitative data in an interwoven way, such as through the adoption of POV-T (1998), to investigate the effectiveness of games for the acquisition of new knowledge and skills.\n\nThe game-plus approach is de\ufb01ned entails game learning in conjunction with other activities. Consistent with this games-plus approach, Steinkuehler and Duncan\u2019s (2009) found that players of Massively Multiplayer Online Games like World of Warcraft show informal scienti\ufb01c reasoning skills in online discussion forums that are supplements to the games and where players share their experiences. Another study consistent with this approach is Ahn (2007) and Black (2011) who looked at college undergraduates learning from an entrepreneurship simulation game (from Harvard Business School) as part of an entrepreneurship college course. The study found that students learned much more from playing the game (multiple times) when they also re\ufb02ected on and articulated their business and game-playing strategies, and related them to background readings in textbooks for the course (this is like the college textbook reading in the Hammer and Black study). They did not learn nearly as much from the game play if they did not re\ufb02ect on how it relates to this background reading.\n\nAll of the video game studies covered so far involve students learning from playing video games. However, a different, but effective, approach to video games and learning is to have students learn by creating video games themselves. Early studies by Harel (1991) and Kafai (1995) showed that students learned more about both fractions and computer programming (the Logo programming language designed for kids) if they created educational software or computer games to teach other students about fractions than they did if they learned about fractions and computer programming separately. Building on this work, Harel (now Harel Caperton) has established an online social networking environment called World Wide Workshop for kids to learn by creating online games (www.worldwideworkshop.org/). In related more recent work, Fadjo and Black (2011) have found that having students act out what they want their video game avatars to do, then programming a simple video game in which the avatars perform these actions (see discussion of embodied cognition in this chapter), is a more effective way for students to learn the programming and math skills than having them learn in alternative ways.\n\nIn a games and gender study involving the game Rapunsel, designed to teach middle school girls how to program by using a Java-like language to customize the avatars in the game, the strongest impact of the game was not on cognitive learning outcomes. After using the game for only four sessions, students\u2019 general self-ef\ufb01cacy, programming-related self-ef\ufb01cacy, and self-esteem increased signi\ufb01cantly, suggesting that games are able to impact learners\u2019 identity formation in a way that positively changes their attitudes toward their ability to perform science-related tasks (Plass, Goldman, Flanagan, & Perlin, 2009).\n\nAutomate existing knowledge or skills. The majority of games used for learning do not aim to teach signi\ufb01can't new knowledge or skills, but are designed to help the learner automate existing skills, such as basic arithmetic, algebra, Newtonian mechanics, history, or others. Game genres used for such games therefore typically include puzzle games, platformers, labyrinth games, and race games, often implemented as relatively short mini games. Research has shown that such games provide a venue for players to use their knowledge of biological and physical science topics, such as the water cycle (Lim, Nonis, & Hedberg, 2006) and principles of electromagnetism (Squire, Barnett, Grant, & Higginbotham, 2004), as well as math topics, such as measurement, whole numbers, equations, and graphing (Ke & Grabowski, 2007).\n\nChildren as young as six years of age have been found to develop stronger numeracy skills after playing computer games that provide practice in number sense and counting (Rasanen, Salminen, Wilson, Aunio, & Dehaene, 2009). At the high school level, videogames have been found to be effective tools for the reinforcement of algebra skills in an immersive three dimensional environment (Kebritchi, Hirumi, & Bai, 2010) as well as computer science concepts integrated into a labyrinth game (Papastergiou, 2009).\n\nAcquire 21st-century skills. Many games do not aim to teach academic knowledge or skills, or to automate existing knowledge or skills, but rather focus on the development of skills that has collectively have come to be known as 21st-century Skills, although most of them have been recognized for many decades, if not centuries, to be important predictors of success in life. These skills include creative problem solving, communication skills, team collaboration, emotional intelligence, and many others. Game genres typically used for such games include adventure games and role-playing games with large numbers of players, which are known as MMOs (Massive Multiplayer Games). Studies have shown that such games facilitate the acquisition of systems based reasoning and social knowledge construction (Steinkuehler & Duncan, 2009), collaborative problem solving (Squire, 2004), and civic thinking (Bagley & Shaffer, 2009).\n\nAll of the studies cited above assume that the games used in the investigations were well designed to facilitate learning. However, as Plass, Homer, and Hayward (2009) have shown, the design of games for learning is a highly complex and dif\ufb01cult process for which very little theory based, empirically validated guidance for designers exist. Another line of research has therefore been concerned with the identi\ufb01cation of design patterns for effective games for learning. This research, which is in part based on research of the design of effective simulations, has shown that icons are effective visual representations of key information, especially for younger learners and learners with low prior knowledge in the subject matter (Homer & Plass, 2010; Plass, Homer, Milne, Jordan, Kalyuga, Kim, & Lee, 2009;).\n\nOther research has investigated the mode of play for games teaching math skills, comparing collaborative play and competitive play to a single player version of a game. Results indicate that players enjoy playing with others more (in collaborative or competitive mode) and solve more problems in the competitive mode, but that they acquire a higher math \ufb02uency, an expression of the acquired math skills, when playing by themselves. A \ufb01nal study investigated the use of different learning mechanics in a game to teach middle school geometry. Players were asked to solve missing angles in order to clear the path for their avatar to free a peer from imprisonment. One mechanic was designed to require the player to compute the correct value of the missing angle and enter this number as response, whereas another mechanic asked\nlearners to identify which rule (e.g., complementary angles rule, supplementary angles rule, opposite angles rule, or the like) they would apply to solve the problem. Results suggest that computing the correct angles value was more situationally interesting than identifying the correct rule.\n\nHowever, participants in the rule condition were found to perform better in the game than those in the number condition. Results further suggest that in the number condition, but not the rule condition, playing more levels in the game diminishes the gain from pretest to posttest (Plass, Homer, Hayward et al., 2011). Games are an emerging medium for learning that requires research concerning both its effectiveness for learning and related design patterns. This research topic would bene\ufb01t from mixed methods, or what Goldman and colleagues call Quisitive Research (Goldman, Crosby, Swan & Shea, 2005; Goldman-Segall, 1996, Goldman,2007). In quisitive research perspectives from a fuller range of stakeholders use both quantitative and qualitative research methods along with emerging digital text and video tools for data analysis in order to investigate this topic further.\n\nEmotion, Empathy, Affective Computing, and Pespective-Taking\n\nThe history of emotional and social learning can be said to date back to the works by John Dewey\u2019s Experience in Education. It became a \u201cmantra\u201d of the Civil Rights Movement as well as the progressive, cooperative, and the whole child movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, the cluster of terms being used includes: social and emotional, empathetic learning, affective computing, and perpective-taking learning. According to Zins and Elias (2006):[S]ocial and emotional learning (SEL) is the capacity to recognize and manage emotions, solve problems effectively, and establish positive relationships with others...SEL is the process of acquiring and effectively applying the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to recognize and manage emotions; developing caring and concern for others; making responsible decisions; establishing positive relationships; and handling challenging situations capably. (Zin & Elias, 2006, p. 1)A series of research projects under computer scientist, Rosalind Picard, are aimed at investigating the emotional and environmental aspects of digital technologies. This work on \u201caffective computing\u201d (Picard, 1997, 2010) researches areas that include computer recognition of human affect, computer synthesis of affect, wearable computers, and affective interaction with computers. (See www.media.mit.edu/affect/). Needless to add, emotional learning has been of interest in the use of persuasive technologies in political and product advertising campaigns, as Ian Bogost (2007) points out. In educational research on gaming, interest in the emotional aspect of designing games for social good and as well as on developing historical empathy are currently at the forefront of renewed interest in emotions and learning.\n\nBelman and Flanagan (2010) argue that \u201cgames are particularly well-suited to supporting educational or activist programs in which the fostering of empathy is a key method or goal.\u201d As we discussed in the previous section, there is growing interest in harnessing the power of games for education. Belman and Flanagan ask: Why not design games to advance empathy and social activism? Some software interaction designers and academics have proposed that engaging players on the emotional level is a key element of their use. Sasha Barab and his colQ7 leagues (2005) designed Quest Atlantis, for example, which promotes children\u2019s educational and activist pursuits by engaging them with a fantasy that resonates at an emotional meta-level of cognition. Belman and Flanagan suggest that activist designers would \ufb01nd it useful to encourage empathetic play, a mode of play in which players intentionally try to infer the thoughts and feelings of people or groups represented in the game, and/or they prepare themselves for an emotional response, for example by looking for similarities between themselves and characters in the game. (Belman & Flanagan, 2010, p. 5-15)\n\nTaking a curricular and epistemological perspective, James Diamond, asks: How does game play in a history video game in\ufb02uence students\u2019 achievement of historical empathy? Although historical empathy is a construct that connotes \u201cperspective taking-in-historical-context\u201d, Diamond includes theory of mind in the construct. Using the video game, Mission US, he describes not only if players\u2019 abilities to achieve historical empathy change in the course of game play, but how students play and if their playing can inform future designs of games constructed to help students contextualize other people\u2019s thinking and behaviors (Diamond, 2012). Ashby and Lee (Ashby & Lee, 1987; Lee & Ashby, 2001)\u2014who are often cited as the pioneers of work on empathy in history education\u2014would be pleased to read this emerging work by Diamond.\n\nEmotional learning, including empthy development, is a major thematic for the future of educational research with digital media environments. Moreover, emotional learning along with social learning using social media, and embodied learning using interactive Wii and Kinectlike environments constitute the convergence of, not only new digital media technologies, but also a new paradigm of learning that depends upon the willingness of learners to share viewpoints and knowledge with each other. As Picard (2010), in an article titled \u201cEmotion Research by the People, for the People\u201d asks, how do we remind ourselves as researchers that the public as well must become part of the scholarly discourse, and that together we explore this new domain called emotional learning and perspective-taking.Today when a child teaches a distinguished scientist to upload video on the Internet, when non- researchers can participate in scienti\ufb01c labeling from home, and when gathering autonomic nervous system data 24/7 is as easy as slipping on a sweatband, emotion research is ready for a major leap forward. Ordinary people can gather data, upload it, compare their patterns, share what they learn, and if they wish, share it with scientists for emotion research. Research can be done by the people, for the people. Of course scientists still have to be involved: there is no substitute for deep scholarly study across experiments and for the rigorous development and test of new hypotheses and theories. At the same time, there is no longer any excuse for leaving people out of \ufb01ndings. Emotion research can bene\ufb01t all its participants, scientists and laypeople, instead of becoming academic in the modern de\ufb01nition. (Picard, 2010, italics added)Digital Media for Embodied Cognition/Learning\n\nSome of the current criticisms of traditional formal learning suggest that: learning can be fragile and lacking in depth; learning does not become a part of the way the student thinks about and interacts with the everyday world; and students too often forget what they have learned after the end of the learning events if it does not get applied to relevant situations outside the learning setting. In the 2010s, as new technological environments such as Wiis and Kinect allow for a more physical interaction, this technology along with an embodied cognition approach may provide a new approach on what it means to learn.\n\nAlong with the increased interest in emotions, the nervous system, neurobiology, as well as tools for leaving traces of our activities and emotional responses, cognitive science has also taken on this term to use Gibbs\u2019 (2006) statement that \u201cconceptual systems and thought processes are shaped by body-based interactions and experiences in the world\u201d (Kwah and Goldman., 2011). In this same paper, they add that emotional experiences in\ufb02uence cognition and must play a role in engagement in learning. As Gibbs so aptly wrote: \u201cThe brain is certainly part of an integrated dynamic system devoted to the momentby-moment embodied dynamic of everyday life\u201d (p. 9). He goes on to claim that \u201cthe regularities in people\u2019s kinesthetic-tactile experience not only constitutes the core of their self-conceptions as persons, but form the foundation for higher-order cognition (p. 15). We emphasize that an embodied approach can provide guidance for the design of new kinds of learning environments that can make knowledge more accessible, useable, and bene\ufb01cial for society, in accordance with the three tenets of Ivan Illich\u2019 de\ufb01nition of convivial tools (1973). For the purpose of this paper on the advances of digital media and how they affect learning, it mean that embodied digital media tools and environments can provide an alternative to the scenario of designing learning for the\nsolitary person sitting in front of a monitor.\n\nOne increasingly prominent approach to cognition is called embodied or perceptually grounded learning approach.This approach proposes that a full understanding of something involves being able to create a mental perceptual simulation of it when retrieving the information or reasoning about it (Barsalou, 2008; Glenberg, 1997). Both behavior and neuroimaging results have shown that many psychological phenomena that were thought to be purely symbolic show perceptual effects. For example, property veri\ufb01cation (e.g., retrieving the fact that a horse has a mane) was thought to involve a search from a concept node (horse) to a property node (mane) in a symbolic propositional network and thus the time to answer and errors was determined by how many network links needed to be searched and how many other distracting links were present. However, embodied cognition research shows that perceptual variables like size (e.g., more important properties are retrieved faster) affect veri\ufb01cation times and errors.\n\nAlso, neuroimaging results (e.g., fMRI) show that perceptual areas of the brain (involving shape, color, size, sound, and touch) also become active during this task, not just the symbolic areas. Thus, if one is familiar with horses and manes then doing even this simple property veri\ufb01cation\ninvolves a perceptual simulation. Glenberg, Gutierrez, Levin, Japuntich, and Kaschak (2004) discuss teaching reading comprehension by using a grounded cognition approach. These studies found that using toy farmers, workers, animals and objects increased their understanding and memory of the story they read. Further, if the students also imagined these actions for another related story after acting it out with the toys, they seemed to acquire the skill of forming the imaginary world of the story (Black, 2007) when reading other stories, and this increased their understanding and memory of these stories. Thus, this grounded cognition approach increased the students reading comprehension. These studies also seem to indicate that there are three steps involved in a grounded cognition approach to learning something: have an embodied experience; learn to imagine that embodied experience, and imagine the experience when learning from symbolic materials. Interestingly, it has also been shown that moving objects corresponding to story characters on a computer screen works just as well as moving toy objects in the physical environment (Glenberg, Goldberg, & Zhu, 2009).\n\nAn example of using an embodied cognition approach to designing learning environments and the learning advantages of doing so is provided by the graphic computer simulations with movement and animation that Han and Black (in press) used in perceptually enhancing the  learning experience. Chan and Black (2006) found that graphic computer simulations involving movement and animation were a good way to learn functional relations between system entities. Han and Black (in press) have enhanced the movement part of these interactive graphic simulations by adding haptic force feedback to the movement using graphic and sound simulations. Here the student moves the gears shown in the screen by moving a joy stick, and\nthen bar graphics on the screen show the input and output force levels for the two gears.\n\nAllowing the student to directly manipulate the gears enhances the students\u2019 learning, and enriching the movement experience by adding force feedback increases the students\u2019 performance even more. Thus the richer the perceptual experience, and therefore the mental perceptual simulation acquired, the better the student learning and understanding. Q9 Black, Segal, Vitale, & Fadjo (in press) reported on a number of embodied cognition technology learning environment projects and concluded that the richer the perceptual environment using multiple sensory modalities (e.g., using visuals, voiceovers, and movement) during initial learning the better the student learning. Secondly, they found that utilizing movements (e.g., gestures) that are conceptually congruent with the knowledge being learned increases student performance, learning, understanding, and motivation. A third \ufb01nding was that students who directly experience a phenomenon through activities like acting it out by moving their own bodies, learn about the topic in a more general way, which also increases learning, understanding, and motivation as does fourth, embodying their understanding in surrogates and then observing the surrogate behavior through activities like programming video-game-like virtual environments with avatar surrogates (with the Scratch programming environment) and\nprogramming robot surrogates like the LEGO NXT. Other recent technological developments, such as the Wii, offer mathematics-education researchers new ways of investigating deep cognitive and epistemological questions pertaining to the nature of knowing, learning, and teaching.\n\nFor example, in Gerofsky\u2019s study of secondary school students\u2019 learning about the features of graphs, such as roots, extrema, symmetries, asymptotes, re\ufb02ections over certain lines, domain and range, she found that embodied work appears to contribute to secondary school students\u2019 mathematical engagement and understanding (Gerofsky, 2011). She notes that:An integrated pedagogy that moves back and forth among explicit teaching of new concepts, embodied exploration of the \u201cfeel\u201d and \u201csound\u201d of mathematical graphs, and sessions of mathematical inquiry and problem solving would appear to be an ideal kind of balanced program to promote mathematical understanding. Another increasingly prominent approach to embodied cognition has been proposed by Dror Abrahamson, director of Embodied Design Research Lab at University of California, Berkeley.\nThe EDRL research group uses design-based research and video analysis to study embodied mathematics learning, along with a growing group of researchers in a variety of research universities and labs (Antle, Corness, & Droumeva, 2009; Cress, Fischer, Moeller, Sauter, & Nuerk, 2010; Dam, 2011; Goldman et al., 2011; Howison, Trninic, Reinholz, & Abrahamson, 2011; Leong & Horn, 2011; Kwah & Goldman, 2011; Nemirovsky, Tierney, & Wright, 1998). Abrahamson\u2019s research group creates useful empirical settings to pursue the (somewhat controversial) grounded-cognition conjecture that mathematical reasoning is not encoded and processed in the mind in the form of amodal symbols, but rather is enacted and evoked as embodied, dynamical, multimodal schemes. This conjecture can be traced back to the work of phenomenology philosophers (Heidegger, 1962; MerleauPonty, 1958/2005), yet it is converging with perspectives and empirical \ufb01ndings from the cognitive and learning sciences (Barsalou, 2010; Bruner, Oliver, & Green\ufb01eld, 1966; Dourish, 2001; Goldin, 1987; Hommel, Musseler, Aschersleben, & Prinz, 2001; Nu\u00b4nez, Edwards, & Matos, 1999; Piaget & Inhelder, 1969; Skemp, 1983).\n\nIn one type of embodied-interaction design being investigated by Abrahamson and collaborators (Abrahamson, Trninic, Gutierrez, Huth, & Lee, 2011; Petrick & Martin, 2011), students interact with the Mathematical Imagery Trainer for Proportion (hence, \u201cMIT-P\u201d). The MIT-P is an embodied-interaction system designed to foster the development of perceptuomotor schemas grounding notions of proportion. Participants use both hands to remote-control a pair of virtual objects on a computer display monitor, one object per each hand, in attempts to \u201cmake the screen green.\u201d The screen will be green only if the hands rise proportionately, in accordance with an unknown ratio set on the instructor\u2019s console. Once students determine qualitative interaction principles, such as that \u201cthe higher you go, you need a bigger distance between the hands,\u201d mathematical instruments are interpolated onto the screen, such as a Cartesian grid and numerals. Students develop the cognitive foundations of proportions via objectifying and articulating their amathematical solution strategies using the available semiotic resources (Bamberger & diSessa, 2003; Bartolini Bussi & Mariotti, 2008; Radford, 2003).\n\nAs such, Abrahamson\u2019s MIT tasks are de\ufb01ned in terms of a speci\ufb01ed goal state of an interactive system, which the student is to effect, that is, a target phenomenal invariance that the student is to generate. As a learning activity, this task is dramatically different from traditional schoolwork,\nbecause the solution method is unknown to the child. Moreover, this task is different from what mathematicians do, because there is no theorem to prove. Rather, this task is closest to forms of inquiry that scientists engage, for example a botanist who \ufb01rst encounters a specimen of an unknown species and is trying to understand its properties, or a chemist who has discovered a new element and is attempting to determine its reactions to various agitations. But then again, scientists who discover an undocumented phenomenon or material do not know a priori its potential behaviors that they have yet to witness (e.g., green), so that their interactions with the phenomenon are not oriented toward generating any speci\ufb01ed goal state. As such, the MIT task is rather unique.\n\nIn addition to analyses of student unmediated discovery (Abrahamson et al., 2011), researchers have examined the design from the perspectives of human computer interaction (Howison et al., 2011), design heuristics (AbraQ10 hamson & Trninic, 2011), and design process (Trninic,\nReinholz, Howison, & Abrahamson, 2010). Yet another approach to understanding embodied learning includes a close look at classroom gestures, perspectivity (Goldman-Segall & Maxwell, 2003, and \u201ccubist compositions\u201d (Nemirovsky et al 1998.). Nemirovsky, who was inspired by his work with Seymour Papert\u2019s notion of becoming the turtle when learning programming, along with Ferrara propose that mathematical reasoning proceeds through a process of imagining a situation from various viewpoints, through a form of \u201ccubist composition\u201d en route to articulating the rules and principles that unify knowledge of the whole. In their studies, they found that gestures were an essential modality for composing these partial perspectives of the whole.\n\nThe perspective of the gesture has received little attention in studies of gestures in classroom learning with the exception of studies by Crowder and colleagues (Crowder, 1996; Crowder & Warburton, 1995). Crowder\u2019s studies indicated that \ufb01rst- and third-person perspectives in\ngesture re\ufb02ected different knowledge orientations with a subjective, exploratory approach to knowing re\ufb02ected in \ufb01rst-person perspectives, and a summative approach re\ufb02ected in the third person. Many representational gestures convey a sense of being performed from a \ufb01rstor third-person perspective, what has been termed the \u201ccharacter viewpoint\u201d (McNeill, 1992). Crowder\u2019s work as well as McNeill\u2019s resonates closely with the theoretical underpinnings of Edith Ackermann\u2019s focus on perspectivetaking (Ackermann, 1995). In that same period, Goldman- Q11 Segall took a similar view on the need for subjective, \ufb01rst-person perspective as a way to reach con\ufb01gurational validity (1995)\u2014multiple viewpoints that become robust by \u201clooking through layers\u201d of interpretation (1996). Students learn to program by building physical artifacts that represent a \ufb01rst-person embodied object/subject-to-thinkwith. Enabling children to not only create their \ufb01rst-person viewpoints, but also critically share their collective viewpoints, building thick interpretations (2008, p. 24; 1998;).\n\nFor example, demonstrating the embodied understanding of children learning to make circles in the Logo programming language, Goldman-Segall\u2019s \ufb01lm called \u201cThe Growth of a Culture\u201d (1988) shows a group of girls making a circle with their bodies. When asked to make a circle as the Logo turtle would, Tnisha did not turn 360 degrees from one standpoint, but rather walked around the circle as the turtle icon in Logo would have done: forward 50, right angle 90\ndegrees, over and over again. At the same time, she looked into the camera saying that the circle is \u201cright here,\u201d while she gently pounded her left chest with her right palm of her\nhand. Papert in a \ufb01lmed documentary by Goldman-Segall (1990) said his classic line that young children learn to program and to think mathematically through becoming the turtle. Clearly, Papert was pointing toward what we are calling, empathic embodiments.\n\nIn a more recent exploratory case study in a junior high school programming class, Kwah & Goldman (2011) observed, interviewed, and videotaped teacher gestures during instruction as well as both teacher and student gestures during problem-solving interactions. They found\nthat \u201ca teacher\u2019s gestures are \ufb02exible constructions that enable programming concepts to be visibly modeled from multiple perspectives.\u201d (p. 1) More interesting, given that gestures are visible actions, students shared (mirrored), as artifacts of embodied imagery, the teacher\u2019s gestures while explaining the same ideas to their peers. While Kwah and Goldman are not, from this exploratory study, generalizing that students mirroring of teacher gestures increases learning, this research does indicate that gestures can serve as an aid for teachers to explain complex ideas of programming not as accessible to learners in more abstract ways. In short, understanding which gestures can promote understanding could become part of a cognitive toolkit for teachers that would bene\ufb01t student learning. In conclusion, although embodied interaction is the keystone activity in a multibillion-dollar gaming industry, sometimes called Body Movement-Controlled Video Games (BMCVGs), it is still little understood from a learning-sciences perspective, yet appears to promise rewarding design-based research into the nature of knowing, teaching, and learning.\n\nPIONEERING LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS\n\nIn this age of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and a host of other social media environments, games for learning environments, and handheld smart device to augment learning and create  communities, it is dif\ufb01cult to select the educational tools and decide which were the most pioneering ones that led to the kinds of tools and environments we use every day. Handheld computational devices are now ubiquitous and continually changing with each new \u201cApp.\u201d People of almost every age, socioeconomic, and ethnic background, country, and gender are texting, tweeting, and sharing private photos and videos. Websites and online tools are used continuously to share, promote, and \ufb02ame. They have become part of the mediated reality within which work, study, and play are mediated.\n\nOn buses, subways, trains, planes, and while crossing city intersections, people are connecting with each other. If there is one thing the Arab Spring that \ufb01rst erupted in Tunisia on January 9, 2011\u2014with protesters confronting the regime of the president Zine el Abidine Ben Ali\u2014taught us, it is that people have access to mobile handheld devices that are not only phones, but have the capacity to communicate instantly, create groups, share images and text, and whatever else can be found somewhere on the web in seconds, engaging in a new form of public-centric journalism and curatorialship. The average person with effort can become a knowledge maker, a\ntrendsetter, an investigator, and an expert who has curatorial power, if only over certain domains. A compelling personal narrative or story has become the vehicle for power, even political power as it is played out every day, not only by presidential hopefuls, but by leaders of repressive and violent groups. At this time, the quality of learning with these social media devices is not easy to evaluate\u2014the major critique being that the networked population is distracting itself to death, a play on the title of Neil Postman\u2019s book in 1985, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Other critiques are that\nmultitasking, the method of moving around the various applications with different purposes, leads to shallow concentration and lack of focus. Others argue that the human mind is capable and ready for this kind of activity. That boredom is the real villain of learning. Others argue\nthat social media, games, and sur\ufb01ng the web expand our ability to learn, help us keep in touch with communities and individuals, and promote new ways to socialize, \ufb01nd partners, and select friend recommended hotels, run businesses, and shop. There is some truth to both sides of each of these arguments, as one might expect. Early adopters are enthusiastic about what is coming down the pike and fall into each new device with few complaints.\n\nLuddites refuse to give up their vinyl albums and enjoy the time and space that the lack of constantly learning the next application affords. Added to those extremes, there is every shade between the two poles. More and more, parents, teachers, and users create methods to control time online and keep balance in the lives of their children and their own lives. In short, the jury is still out about the effectiveness of using social media as a learning device in spite of the fact that it seems like a seductive augmentation tool for accessing an in\ufb01nite amount of information and fun.\n\nThe authors of this chapter now focus on the historical roots of these current digital media environments, making the case that the earlier software were precursors to social media and games for learning. This next section is a selection of some of the pioneering and perspectival technological systems developed to aid, enhance, and inspire learning and research using one or more elements of the Points of Viewing Theory. This montage is an authorial selection, not a representation of all pioneering systems for learning. It provides the reader with a snapshot of precursor tools rooted in the role of learners to build their own environments and become partners in the learning and research process.\n\nLOGO\nLogo, one of the oldest and most in\ufb02uential educational technology endeavors, dates back to 1967. Logo is a dialect of the AI research language LISP, and was developed by Wally Feurzig\u2019s team at BBN, working with Papert. This program made computer programming accessible to children, not through dumbing down computer science, but by carefully managing the relationship between abstract and concrete. Logo gave children the means to concretize mathematics and geometry via the computer, which made them into explorers in the \ufb01eld of math. As mentioned before, Papert believed that if the best way to learn French is not to go to French class, but rather to spend time in France, then the best way to learn mathematics would be in some sort of \u201cMathland\u201d (Papert, 1980, p. 6). Logo provided a microworld operating in terms of mathematical and geometric ideas. By experimenting with controlling a programmable \u201cturtle,\u201d children had direct, concrete experience of how mathematical and geometric constructs work. Through re\ufb02ection on their experiments, they would then come to more formalized understandings of these constructs. Children became epistemologists thinking about their thinking about mathematics by living in and creating computer cultures.\n\nWith the growing availability of personal computers in the late 1970s and 1980s, the Logo turtle was moved onscreen, and the notion of the turtle in its abstract world called a microworld, a notion that has been the lasting legacy of the Logo research (Papert, 1980). The Logo movement was popular in schools in the 1980s, and versions of the language were developed for different computer systems. Some implementations of Logo departed from geometry microworlds, and were designed to address other goals, such as the teaching of computer programming (Harvey, 1997). Implementations of Logo are freely distributed on the Internet. See www.cs.berkeley.edu/\u223cbh/logo.html. The Logo Foundation at http:/el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/logo-foundation/ has continued to expand the culture of Logo over the years.\n\nSqueak\nSqueak is the direct descendant of Alan Kay\u2019s Dynabook research at Xerox PARC; the Dynabook was built the 1970s. Squeak is a multimedia personal computing environment based on the SmallTalk object-oriented programming language that formed the basis of Kay\u2019s investigations into \u201cpersonal\u201d computing (Kay, 1996). It is notable in that it is freely distributed on the Internet, runs on almost every conceivable computing platform, and is entirely decomposable\u2014while one can create new media tools and presentations as with other environments, one can also tinker with the underlying operation of the system\u2014how windows appear, or how networking protocols are implemented. A small but enthusiastic user community supports and extends the Squeak environment, creating such tools as web browsers, music synthesizers, three-dimensional graphics toolkits, and so on entirely within Squeak. See www.squeak.org.\n\nBoxer\nBoxer is a \u201ccomputational medium\u201d\u2014a combination of a programming language, a microworld environment, and a set of libraries and tools for building tools for exploring problem solving with computers. Developed by diSessa, Boxer blends the Logo work of Papert (1980) and the \u201cmutable medium\u201d notion of Kay (1996) in a \ufb02exible computing toolkit. diSessa\u2019s work has been ongoing since the 1980s, when he conceived of an environment to extend the Logo research into a more robust and \ufb02exible environment in which to explore physics concepts (diSessa, 2000). Boxer is freely distributed on the Internet.\n\nHyperCard\n\nIt is important to remember that in 1987 Apple Computer was exploring multimedia as the fundamental rationale for people wanting Macintosh computers. But, as there was little multimedia software available in the late 1980s, Apple decided to bundle a multimedia authoring toolkit with every Macintosh computer. This toolkit was HyperCard, and it proved to be an enormously popular with a wide variety of users, and especially in schools. HyperCard emulates a sort of magical stack of 3 \u00d7 5 index cards, and its multimedia documents were thus called stacks. An author could add text, images, audio, and even video components to cards and then use a simple and elegant scripting language to tie these cards together or perform certain behaviors. Two broad categories of use emerged in HyperCard: the \ufb01rst was collecting and enjoying predesigned stacks; the second was authoring one\u2019s own. In the online bulletin board systems of the early 1990s, HyperCard authors exchanged great volumes of \u201cstackware.\u201d Educators were some of the most enthusiastic users, either creating content for students (a stellar example of this is Apple\u2019s Visual Almanac, which married videodisc-based content with a HyperCard control interface) or encouraging students to create their own. Others used HyperCard to create scaffolds and tools for learners to use in their own media construction. A good snapshot of this HyperCard authoring culture is described in Ambron and Hooper\u2019s Learning with Interactive Multimedia (1990). HyperCard development at Apple languished in the mid-1990s and disappeared in the 2000s.\n\nConstellations/WebConstellations/Orion 1.0/Orion 2.0\n\nBuilding on the HyperCard platform, Learning Constellations (Goldman-Segall, 1989) was a collaborative video annotation tool that builds on the metaphor of stars (video chunks) and constellations (collections). Star video chunks could be combined to make constellations, but different users may place the same star in different contexts, depending on their understanding by viewing data from various perspectives. Learning Constellations was a datasharing system, promoting Goldman-Segall\u2019s notion of con\ufb01gurational validity by allowing different users to compare and exchange views on how they contextualize the same information differently in order to reach valid conclusions about the data (Goldman-Segall, 1995; Goldman-Segall & Rao, 1998). It also features collaborative ranking and annotation of data nodes. While other video analysis tools were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s, (Harrison & Baecker, 1992; Kennedy 1989; Mackay, 1989; Roschelle, Pea, & Trigg, 1990), Learning Constellations (aka Constellations) was the \ufb01rst video date analysis tool to analyze a robust video ethnographic data (Goldman-Segall, 1989, 1990, 1991).\n\nContinuing to use the HyperCard plaftorm, GoldmanSegall developed a updated version of Learning Constellations as a stand-alone application in 1993. She added a signi\ufb01cance measure to layer descriptions and \u201crate attributes\u201d the themes and keywords (Goldman-Segall, 1993). In 1998, the tool went online as a web-based collaborative video analysis tool called WebConstellations (Goldman-Segall, 1998c, 1999; Goldman-Segall & Rao, 1998). Every media type\u2014website page, text document, video chunk, or photo could become a star chunk and could be tagged, rated, and juxtaposed for comparative analysis. The most recent version, Orion 2.0 returned back to its original functionality of being a tool only video chunking, sorting, analysis, ethnographic theory-building and story-making. As a perspectivity technology, individuals enter into Orion, creating their own home page and inviting others to join in the analysis. Taking a lead in feature development, by 2007 each user could have a number of simultaneous projects with diverse research communities, in somewhat the same way that social media now enables groups to work.\n\nAdventures of Jasper Woodbury\n\nJasper Woodbury is the name of a character in a series of adventure stories that the (CTGV) use as the basis for \u201canchored instruction.\u201d The stories, presented on videodisc or CD-ROM are carefully crafted mysteries that present problems to be solved by groups of learners. Since the video can be randomly accessed, learners are encouraged to re-explore parts of the story in order to gather clues and develop theories about the problem to be solved. The Jasper series \ufb01rst appeared in the 1980s and there are now 12 stories (Cognition and Technology Group at\nVanderbilt University, 1997).\n\nCSILE/Knowledge Forum\n\nCSILE\u2014Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment\u2014was developed by Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) in the 1980s. CSILE is a collaborative, problem-based, knowledge-building environment. Learners can collaborate on data collection, analysis of \ufb01ndings, constructing and presenting conclusions by exchanging structured \u201cnotes,\u201d and attaching further questions, contributions, and so on to preexisting notes. CSILE was originally conceived to provide a dynamic scaffold for knowledge construction\u2014one that would let the learners themselves direct the inquiry process (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991). CSILE is now commercially developed and licensed as Knowledge Forum.\n\nStarLogo and NetLogo\n\nStarLogo and NetLogo are parallel-computing versions of Logo. By manipulating multiple (thousands), distributed \u201cturtles,\u201d learners can work with interactive models of complex interactions, population dynamics, and other decentralized systems. Developed by Mitchel Resnick, Uri Wilensky and a team of researchers at MIT, StarLogo was conceived as a tool to move learners\u2019 thinking \u201cbeyond the centralized mind-set\u201d and to study how people make sense of complex systems (Resnick 1991, 1994; Wilensky & Resnick, 1999). NetLogo\u2014an environment developed by Wilensky at the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at Northwestern University is in widespread use both in education and\nresearch.

An organization founded in 2004 by MIT Media Lab graduate and entrepreneur Idit Harel, World Wide Workshop addresses the problem of closing the digital divide and transforming education by reaching low socioeconomic youth in low-performing schools with learning networks and by taking a systemic approach to education innovation and reform. In 2006, the World Wide Workshop launched the Globaloria Learning Network (www.Globaloria.org). The Globaloria Learning Network (www.Globaloria.org) is a \u201cblended learning lab\u201d that provides a year-long digital curriculum, tools, resources, student and educator data tracking, and professional development for educators to engage, motivate and advance students\u2019 STEM learning through game design.\n\nYoung people in middle school and high school ages are immersed in blended learning (combining online and onsite), becoming game designers and mastering creative computational skills and core content knowledge. Academic researchers from several countries work with the\nWorld Wide Workshop to study constructionist digital literacy, motivation and engagement, and how new technology innovation can inform, engage and transform students, teachers, schools and communities.\n\nThe underlying constructionist digital literacy approach stems from her MIT Media Lab research and was also present in an earlier company Harel founded in the 1990s called MaMaMedia. The rationale of MaMaMedia was to enable kids and their parents to participate in web experiences that are creative, safe, constructionist by nature, and educational. Harel\u2019s book, Children Designers (Harel, 1991), lays the foundation for MaMaMedia, and for research in understanding how children in rich online environments construct software and design math games with representations of their thinking. MaMaMedia enabled girls and boys to be online playing games, learning how participate in the vast MaMaMedia community.\nMOOSE Crossing\n\nGeorgia Tech researcher Amy Bruckman created MOOSE Crossing as part of her doctoral work at the MIT Media Lab. MOOSE Crossing can be characterized as an breakthrough combination of Papert\u2019s Logo/ microworlds, the \u201cmutable media\u201d notions of Alan Kay (Kay, 1996), and a MOO (Haynes & Holmevik, 1998)\u2014a real-time, collaborative, immersive virtual environment. MOOSE Crossing is a microworld that learners can themselves enter, designing and programming the virtual environment from within. It becomes a lived-in text that one shares\nwith other readers/writers/designers. Bruckman (1998) stated that this early innovation, MOOSE Crossing, was \u201ccommunity support for constructionist learning.\u201d Indeed, it was.\n\nCalling a software system a place gives users a radically different set of expectations. People are familiar with a wide variety of types of places, and have a sense of what to do there...Instead of asking What do I do with this software?, people ask themselves, What do I do in this place? The second question has a very different set of answers than the \ufb01rst. (Bruckman, 1998, p. 49)\n\nBruckman\u2019s thesis is that community and constructionist learning go hand in hand. Her ethnographic accounts of learners inside the environment reveals very close, very personal bonds emerging between children in the process of designing and building their world in MOOSE Crossing. \u201cThe emotional support,\u201d she writes, \u201cis inseparable from the technical support. Receiving help from someone you would tell your secret nickname to is clearly very different from receiving help from a computer program or a schoolteacher\u201d (p. 128).\n\nSimCalc\n\nSimCalc\u2019s tagline is \u201cDemocratizing Access to the Mathematics of Change,\u201d and the goal is to make the understanding of change accessible to more learners than the small minority who take calculus classes. SimCalc, a project at the University of Massachusetts under James Kaput working with Jeremy Roschelle, and Ricardo Nemirovky, is a simulation and visualization system for learners to explore calculus concepts in a problembased model, one that avoids traditional problems with mathematical representation (Kaput, Roschelle, & Stroup,\n1998). The core software, called MathWorlds (echoing Papert\u2019s \u201cMathland\u201d idea) allows learners to manipulate variables and see results via real- time visualizations with both animated characters and more traditional graphs. SimCalc is freely available on the Internet. See www.simcalc.umassd.edu/\n\nParticipatory Sims\n\nParticipatory Sims, a project overseen by Uri Wilensky and Walter Stroup at Northwestern University, is a distributed computing environment built on the foundations of LOGO that encourages learners to collaboratively explore complex simulations. The Participatory Sims project centers on HubNet, a \u201cClassroom-based Network of Handheld Devices and Up-front Computer,\u201d which allows learners to participate in models of dynamic systems (Resnick, 1996) in a live, classroom environment. \u201cThe emergent behavior (see Figure 1) of the system and its relation to individual participant actions and strategies can then become the object of collective discussion and analysis\u201d (Wilensky & Stroup, 1999). See www.ccl.sesp.northwestern.edu/ps/index.html\n\nCoVis\n\nCoVis\u2014\u201cCollaborative Visualization\u201d\u2014a project that ran from Northwestern University in the 1990s, was clearly a strong predictor of what was to follow in education. It focused on science learning through projects using a telecommunications infrastructure, scienti\ufb01c visualization tools, and software to support collaboration between diverse schools in distributed locations (Edelson et al.,1996). Much of learners\u2019 investigation centred on atmospheric and environmental studies, allowing wide-scale (across the United States) data sharing. Learners could then use sophisticated data analysis tools to visualize and draw conclusions. CoVis made use of a variety of networked software: collaborative \u201cnotebooks,\u201d distributed databases, system visualization tools, as well as the WWW and electronic mail. The goal in the CoVis project was for young people to study topics in much the same way as professional scientists do.\n\nNational Geographic Kids Network\n\nAnother example of an early perspectivity environment in the late 1980s and 1990s was the National Geographic Kids Network. A number of very large-scale research projects explored the possibilities of connecting multiple classrooms across the United States for data sharing and collaborative inquiry (Feldman et al., 2000). Programs like National Geographic Kids Network (NGKNet), an NSFfunded collaboration between the National Geographic Society and educational technology research center TERC reached thousands of classrooms and tens of thousands of students (p. 30). TERC\u2019s NGKNet provided curriculum plans and resources around issues like acid rain, and tools, which facilitated large-scale data collection, sharing, and analysis of results. Other projects, like Classroom BirdWatch and EnergyNet focused on issues with comparable global signi\ufb01cance and local implications, turning large numbers of learners into a community of practice doing distributed scienti\ufb01c investigation. Feldman, Konold, and\nCoulter note that these large-scale projects question the notion of the individual child as scientist, pointing instead toward interesting models of collaborative engagement in\nscience, technology, and society issues (pp. 142\u2013143). Needless to say this work still continues to impress. See http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/\n\nTapped In\n\nTapped In is a Multi-User Online Educational Workspace (MEOW) for teachers and education professionals. The Tapped In project, led by Mark Schlager at SRI, began in the late 1990s as a MOO (textual VR) environment for synchronous collaboration and has since grown into a sophisticated (Web + MOO) multimedia environment for both synchronous and asynchronous work, with a large and active user population (Schlager & Schank, 1997). Q12\n\nTapped In uses similar technological infrastructure to MOOSE Crossing, but has a different kind of community of practice at work within it; Tapped In functions more like an ongoing teaching conference, with many weekly or monthly events, workshops, and happenings. Tapped In is an exemplary model of a multimode collaborative environment. See www.tappedin.sri.com/\n\nCoWeb\n\nAt Georgia Tech, Mark Guzdial and colleagues at the Collaborative Software Laboratory (CSL) created a variety of software environments building on the original educational computing vision of Alan Kay in the 1970s (Kay, 1996); the computer can be a tool for composing and experiencing dynamic media. Growing from Guzdial\u2019s previous work on theCaMILE project (Guzdial, 1997)\u2014a web-based \u201canchored collaboration\u201d environment, CSL\u2019s CoWeb project explores possibilities in designing and using collaborative media tools online (Guzdial, 1999). CoWeb and other CSL work is largely based on the Squeak environment, a direct descendant of Alan Kay\u2019s research at Xerox PARC in the 1970s.\n\nWebGuide\n\nWebGuide, a web-based, collaborative knowledgeconstruction tool, was created by Gerry Stahl and colleagues at the University of Colorado (Stahl, 1999). WebGuide is designed to facilitate personal and collaborative understanding through mediating perspectivity via cultural artifacts. WebGuide acts as a scaffold for group understanding. WebGuide is a structured conferencing system supporting rich interlinking and information reuse/recontextualization, as well as multiple views on the structure of the information set. Learners contribute information from individual perspectives, but this information can later be negotiated and re-collected in multiple contexts construct.\n\nCHALLENGING QUESTIONS\nModels of Mind or Culture Creation?\n\nFrom the vantage point of the mid-1990s, Jerome Bruner looked back on the cognitive revolution of the late 1950s, which he helped to shape, and re\ufb02ected on a lost opportunity. Bruner had imagined that the new cognitive paradigm would bring the search for meaning to the fore, distinguishing it from the behaviorism that preceded it (Bruner, 1990, p. 2). And yet, Bruner writes, the revolution went awry, not because it failed, but because it succeeded:Very early on, for example, emphasis began shifting from \u201cmeaning\u201d to \u201cinformation,\u201d from the construction of meaning to the processing of information. These are profoundly different matters. The key factor in the shift was the introduction of computation as the ruling metaphor and computability as a necessary criterion of a good theoretical model. (p. 4)The information-processing model of cognition became so dominant, Bruner argues, and the role of meaning and meaning-making ended up as much in disfavor as it had been in behaviorism. \u201cIn place of stimuli and responses, there was input and output,\u201d and hard empiricism ruled again, with a new vocabulary, but with the same disdain for mentalism (p. 7). Bruner\u2019s career as a theorist is itself instructive. Heralded by Gardner and others as one of the leading lights of 1950s cognitivism, Bruner has since the 1980s been one of a small but vocal group calling for a return to the role of culture in understanding the mind. This movement has been tangled up closely with the evolution of educational technology over the same period, perhaps illuminated in a pair of titles that bookend one researcher\u2019s decade-long trajectory: Etienne Wenger\u2019s (1987) Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence and Tutoring Systems: Computational and Cognitive Approaches to the Communication of Knowledge and his (1998) Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity.\n\nParadigm Shift With Digital Media or Incremental Changes?\n\nIn his 1996 article, \u201cParadigm Shifts and Instructional Technology: An Introduction,\u201d Timothy Koschmann began by identifying four de\ufb01ning paradigms of technology in education. In roughly chronological (but certainly overlapping) order, these are: Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI), characterized by drill-and-practice and programmed instruction systems; Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which drew on arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) research in order to create automated systems, which could evaluate a learner\u2019s progress and tailor instruction accordingly; the Logo-asLatin paradigm, led by Seymour Papert\u2019s \u201cmicroworld\u201d and children-as-programmers efforts; and \ufb01nally, ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), a \u201csocially oriented, constructivist\u201d approach that focuses on learners in practice, in groups. Koschmann invoked Thomas Kuhn\u2019s (1996) controversial notion of the incommensurability of competing paradigms:Kuhn held that the effect of a paradigm shift is to produce a divided community of researchers no longer able to debate their respective positions, owing to fundamental differences in terminology, conceptual frameworks, and views on what constitutes the legitimate questions of science. (Koschmann,1996, p. 2)Koschmann\u2019s analysis may well be accurate. The literature surrounding the effects learning technology produces certainly displays examples of this incommensurability, even within the writings of individual theorists. A counter perspective to Kuhn\u2019s view of paradigmatic shifts in scienti\ufb01c understanding was offered by Stephen Toulmin (1972), who argued that conceptual change must Q13 not be understood as a globally uni\ufb01ed, systematic shift in attitudes in beliefs about science; rather, it was a fragmented process, which was highly contextualized and dependent on local scienti\ufb01c practices. According to Toulmin, knowledge develops in a more piecemeal fashion rather than through seismic leaps; \u2018competing\u2019 paradigms continue to exert considerable in\ufb02uence on our understanding. Andrea diSessa (2006), arguing for a reappraisal Toulmin\u2019s neglected work on conceptual change, applied it to how the \u201cintuitive ideas\u201d which young learners brought to a physics lesson were crucial resources for developing \u201cknowledge in pieces,\u201d or the weaving of various threads of ideas into a \u201cdifferent, stronger, and more normative conceptual fabric\u201d (diSessa, 2006, p. 273). The application of these ideas to learning technologies casts doubt upon the notions of internal coherence of individual paradigms and their representative designers, as well as their impermeability to each other.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Papert\u2019s work with teaching children to program in Logo was originally concerned with bridging the gap between Piaget\u2019s concrete and formal thinking stages, particularly with respect to mathematics and geometry. But over time, Papert\u2019s work with children and Logo began to be talked about as \u201ccomputer cultures\u201d (Papert, 1980, pp. 22\u2013 23): Logo gave its practitioners a vocabulary, a framework, and a set of tools for a particular kind of learning through exploration. Papert envisaged a computer culture where children could express themselves as epistemologists, challenging the nature of established knowledge. But while Papert\u2019s ideas and the practice of Logo learning in classrooms contributed signi\ufb01cantly to the esprit de temps of the 1980s, it was dif\ufb01cult for many mainstream educational researchers and practitioners to adopt the mindset he believed would revolutionize learning.\n\nA large-scale research project to evaluate the claims of Logo in classrooms was undertaken by researcher Roy Pea (when he was at Bank Street College) and his colleagues in the mid-1980s. The Bank Street studies came to some critical conclusions about the work Papert and his colleagues were doing (Pea & Kurland, 1987 [1984]; Q14 Pea, Kurland, & Hawkins, 1987; Pea, 1987). Basically, the Bank Street studies concluded with a cautious note: they concluded that no signi\ufb01cant effects on cognitive development could be con\ufb01rmed, and called for much more extensive and rigorous research amid the excitement and hype. The wider effect of the Bank Street publications fed into something of a popular backlash against Logo in the schools. A 1984 article in the magazine, Popular Psychology summarized the Bank Street studies, and suggested bluntly that Logo had not delivered on Papert\u2019s promises.\n\nPapert responded to this critique (Papert, 1987 [1985]), arguing that the framing of research questions was overly simplistic. Papert chided his critics for looking for cognitive effects by isolating variables as if classrooms were \u201ctreatment\u201d studies. Rather than asking \u201ctechnocentric\u201d\nquestions like \u201cWhat is THE effect of THE computer?\u201d(p. 23), Papert called for an examination of the culturebuilding implications of Logo practice, and for something he called computer criticism, which he proposed as akin to literary criticism.\n\nPea and others responded (Pea, 1987b), claiming that Papert had unfairly characterized the Bank Street research (Papert had responded only to the Psychology Today article, not to the original literature), and arguing that as researchers they had a responsibility to adhere to accepted scienti\ufb01c methods for evaluating the claims of new technology. The effect of this exchange was to illuminate the vastly different perspectives of these researchers. Where Papert was talking about the open-ended promise of computer cultures, Pea and his colleagues, developmental psychologists, were evaluating the work from the standpoint of demonstrable changes in cognition (Pea & Kurland1987 [1984]). While Papert accused his critics of reductionism, Davy (1985) likened Papert to the proverbial man who looks for his keys under the streetlight \u201cbecause the light is better there.\u201d\n\nGavriel Salomon and Howard Gardner responded to this debate with an article that searched for middle ground (Salomon & Gardner, 1986): an analogy, they pointed out, could be drawn from research into television and mass media, a much older pursuit than educational computing, and one in which Salomon was an acclaimed scholar. Salomon and Gardner argued that one could not search for independent variables in such a complex area; instead, they called for a more holistic, exploratory research program, one that took more than the overt effects of the technology into account.\n\nIndeed, in 1991, Salomon and colleagues David Perkins and Tamar Globerson published a groundbreaking article that shed more light on the issue (Salomon et al., 1991). To consider the \u201ceffects of\u201d a technology, one had to consider what was changed after a learner had used a technology\u2014but in the absence of it. The questions that arise from this are whether there is any \u201ccognitive residue\u201d from the prior experience, and whether there is transfer between tasks. This is a different set of questions than arise from investigating the \u201ceffects with\u201d technology, which demand a more decentered, systemwide approach, looking at the learner in partnership with technology.\n\nWhile it contributed important new constructs and vocabulary to the issue, the Salomon, Perkins, and Globerson article is still deeply rooted in a traditional cognitive science perspective, like much of Pea\u2019s research, taking \ufb01rst the individual mind as the site of cognition. Salomon,\nPerkins, and Globerson, all trained in cognitive psychology, warn against taking the \u201ceffects with\u201d approach too far, noting that computers in education are still far from ubiquitous, and that the search for the \u201ceffects of\u201d is still key. From the perspective of today\u2019s ubiquitous computing technologies, which have taken the \u201ceffects with\u201d study of technology \u201cout of the lab,\u201d and into countless informal settings, a less rigid cognitive orientation is now the norm for understanding technology\u2019s diffuse, yet constitutive effects on human interaction and community building. The most visible example is the revolution in online social networks, online game play, and social\nmedia in general.\n\nIn a 1993 article, Pea responded to Salomon et al. (1991) from yet a different angle. Pea, now dean at Northwestern and working closely with his Learning Sciences colleagues, wrote on \u201cdistributed intelligence,\u201d and argued against taking the individual mind as the locus of cognition, criticizing Salomon and colleagues\u2019 individualist notions of cognitive residue:The language used by Salomon et al. (1991) to characterize the concepts involved in how they think about distributed intelligence is, by contrast, entity-oriented\u2014a language of containers holding things. (Pea 1993, p. 79) Pea, reviewing literature on situated learning by Brown et al. (1996 [1980]), Lave (1988), Wenger and Lave (1991), Greeno (1997) and by Winograd and Flores (1986), changed from the standard individualist framework of cognitive science to a more \u201csituative perspective\u201d while Salomon (1993) maintained that cognition must reside in the individual mind. Neither Salomon nor Pea in this exchange were comfortable with the notion of culture-making as a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d to mind, artifacts, and such empirically identi\ufb01able constructs. However, Pea\u2019s work on distributed cognition had a great impact on future studies on cognition in the context of emerging media technologies.\n\nThe question needs to be asked, are these advances made with the introduction of digital media technologies representative of a paradigm shift or are they merely a conversation among differing points of viewing, based on different measures and methods of studying the problem. Indeed, it seems that the proof is in the pudding. A cultural shift has occcured. The next step it to harness the scholarship to create a vision for seriously changing how learning can be re-created with more engagement and involvement with all the stakeholders. To be able to \ufb01nd the patterns in current research so that less time is spent in debates and more on reaching agreements.\n\nDevelopmental or Narrative Appoaches to Learning Theory?\n\nUnderstanding the nature of technology-based learning systems greatly depends on one\u2019s conceptualization of how learning occurs; is learning linear and developmental, or a more \ufb02uid and even random \u201csystem\u201d of making meaning of experience? Proponents of stage theory have tried to show how maturation takes place in logical causal sequences or stages according to observable stages in growth patterns\u2014the \ufb01nal stage being the highest and most coveted. Developmental theories, such as Freud\u2019s oral, anal and genital (Freud, 1952), Erikson\u2019s eight stages of psychological growth from basic trust to generativity (Erikson, 1950), or Piaget\u2019s stages from sensori-motor to formal operational thinking (see Grubner & Voneche, 1977), are based on the belief that the human organism must pass through these stages at critical periods in its development in order to reach full healthy integrated maturation, be it psychological, physical, spiritual, or intellectual. Strict adherence to developmentalism, particularly its unidirectional conception, has been signi\ufb01cantly challenged by Gilligan (1982), Gardner (1985), Fox Keller Q15 (1983), and Papert (1986), not to mention a wave of postmodern theorists\u2014proposing theories which address the fundamental issues underlying how we come to terms with understanding our thinking. One such challenge, raised\nby Ivan Illich and Barry Sanders (1984), re\ufb02ects on the Q16 prehistorical signi\ufb01cance of the narrative voice. Thinking about thinking as essentially evolving stages of development requires the kind of calibration only possible in a world of static rules and universal truths. They point out\nthat narrative thinking is rather a weaving of different layers or versions of stories that defy developmentalism.\n\nNarratives are never \ufb01xed in time or place. Before the written word and [p]rior to history...there is a narrative that unfolds, not in accordance with the rules of art and knowledge, but out of divine enthusiasm and deep emotion. Corresponding to this prior time is a different truth\u2014namely, myth. In this truly oral culture, before phonetic writing, there can be no words and therefore no text, no original, to which tradition can refer, no subject matter that can be passed on. A new rendering is never just a new version, but always a new song. (p. 4) Illich and Sanders contend that the prehistoric mode of thinking was a relativistic experience; that what was expressed at any given moment in time changed from the previous time it was expressed. There could be no \ufb01xed recall, nor \u201ctruth\u201d as we de\ufb01ne it today. This concept of knowledge as a continually changing truth, dependent on both communal interpretation and storytellers\u2019 innovation, dramatically changed with the introduction of writing.\n\nThe moment a story could be written down, it could be referred to. Memory changed from being an image of a former indivisible time to being a method of retrieving a \ufb01xed, repeatable piece or section of an experience. In other words, narrative intelligence is not acquired developmentally in stages, but rather, phenomenologically and emotionally, through experience. The development of prehistoric thinking (with image and imagination) through historical thinking (with writing and conceptual schemes) has also been called posthistorical thinking (Flusser, 2004).Q17 Beginning with photography and on through networked computing devices, new\nimage-based media, while born in conceptual thought, has enabled learners to tap into their \u201cimaginal capacity\u201d to re\ufb02ect on their own learning processes and rede\ufb01ne the world through multiple representations of knowledge, also changing the notion of a \ufb01xed truth.\n\nAnother notion to Illich and Sanders emerges in Carol Gilligan\u2019s research on gender and moral development (1982). Gilligan makes the case that the \u201cdifferent voice\u201d women bring includes an ethic of care, a tie between relationship and responsibility (1982, p. 173). Gilligan set the stage for a new mode of research, which includes intimacy and relationship rather than separation and objectivity, the tenets of traditional empiricism. Evelyn Fox Keller, a leading critic of the masculinization of science, heralded the relational model as a legitimate alternative for doing science. She pointed out that science is a deeply personal as well as a social activity (1985), historically preferential to a male and objectivist manner of thinking. Combining Thomas Kuhn\u2019s ideas about the nature of scienti\ufb01c thinking with Freud\u2019s analysis of the different relationship between young boys and their mothers and between girls and their mothers, Fox Keller analyzed underlying reasons for scienti\ufb01c objectivism. She claimed that boys are encouraged to separate from their mothers, and, girls to maintain attachments, in\ufb02uencing the manner in which the two genders relate to physical objects. The young boy, in competition with his father for his mother\u2019s attentions, learns to compete in order to succeed. Girls, not having to separate from their mothers, \ufb01nd that becoming personally involved\u2014getting a feeling for the organism, as Barbara McClintock (Fox Keller, 1985) would say\u2014is a preferred mode of making sense of their relationship with the physical world. Q18\n\nAs a result, girls may do science in a more connected style, seeking relationships with, rather than dissecting, what they investigate. Girls seek to understand meaning through these personal attachments. Just as science is not the purely cognitive endeavor we once thought it, neither is it as impersonal as we thought: science is a deeply personal as well as a social activity. (1985, p. 7) Obviously, we will never know if a scienti\ufb01c discipline would really be different if it had been driven by more relational or narrative in\ufb02uences. Yet we may want to ask how people with a tendency toward relational or narrative thinking can be both invited into the study of the sciences and be encouraged to contribute to its theoretical foundations. And, we may want to ask how new media and technologies expand how we study what we study, thereby inviting a range of epistemologically diverse thinkers into the mainstream of intellectual pursuits.\n\nBricolage and/or the Ecology of Digital Media\nTechnologies\n\nIn her \ufb01rst book, The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit (1984), Sherry Turkle explored the different styles of mastery that she observed in boys and girls in Logo classrooms. Returning to this topic, Turkle and Papert, in their 1991 article, \u201cEpistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete,\u201d outline two poles of technological mastery: hard and soft. Hard mastery, identi\ufb01ed with top-down, rationalist thinking, was observed in a majority of boys. Soft mastery, identi\ufb01ed with relational thinking and Claude Levi-Strauss\u2019s notion of \u00b4 bricolage, was observed in a majority of girls working with computers in a Boston elementary school (Turkle & Papert 1991, pp. 167\u2013168). The identi\ufb01cation of soft mastery and bricolage in programming was a turning point that led to a deeper examination of \u201cthe concrete,\u201d a subject woefully undervalued in contemporary life, and especially in math and science education.\n\nStanford scholar, Brigid Barron (2006) found that \u201clearners use strategies consistent with the bricoleur image described by Turkle, building on the concept introduced by Levi-Strauss [1966] where information is \ufb02exibly gathered and put together for new purposes.\u201d Barron revisited the role of the bricoleur to expand on what Nardi and O\u2019Day (1999) call information ecologies. Not only are information ecologies a product of both relational and material resources as Nardi and O\u2019Day suggest, but also, according to Barron, dynamic learning systems include a range of multiple in\ufb02uences that are dovetail well with understanding learning in formal and informal learning settings. She concludes with a call for changes.\n\nThe reports from the young learners shared...suggest that we should expect interest in learning to originate within and outside school and that adolescents have a signi\ufb01cant role to play in sustaining their own development. As researchers interested in human development, we are in a vital position to help envision what self-sustaining learning ecologies might look like and investigate how resourcefulness might be nurtured. (Barron, 2006, p. 221) Turkle and Papert\u2019s use the terms bricoleur and the notion of hard and soft to explain different approaches to computation, extends to other important domains: ecological stances, feminism, and ethnography of science and computation (1991, p. 372). They propose that hard and soft styles of creating knowledge and understanding systems as equally signi\ufb01cant to concrete thinking will gain respectability in the scienti\ufb01c community by attending more to the softer concrete way of thinking.\n\nThe development of a new computer culture would require more than technological progress and more than environments where there is permission to work with highly personal approaches. It would require a new and softer construction of the technological, with a new set of intellectual and emotional values more like those we apply to harpsichords than hammers. (Ibid, p. 184) Goldman-Segall offered a dynamic and \ufb02exible conceptualization of diversity of thinking called thinking attitudes (Goldman-Segall, 2008). These attitudes imply positionality and orientation, and are situated in time and place. She de\ufb01ned thinking attitudes as a transitional position held for a shorter period of time, one that is \ufb02uid and \ufb02exible (p. 245) This notion of thinking attitudes includes: meta/physical, historical, ethical, and pedagogical attitudes. Meta/physical attitudes address the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the story?\u201d They explore how children address causality, intention, existence, and truth. The meta/physical attitudes in adolescents are turning points, referring to the worlds of invention and imagination\u2014attitudes that are rooted in the physical situatedness of their interactions with the world. Historical attitudes address how things began. They encompass learning from the past and making sense of it. Ethical attitudes include our actions in relation to desire and external norms. Balancing right and wrong is particularly challenging. These attitudes address questions such as: \u201cWhat is fair?\u201d To a great extent, pedagogical (or activist) attitudes overlap with ethical attitudes. Pedagogical attitudes are concerned with such questions as \u201cWhat can we do? How do we change? How do we teach others to learn from what we did?\u201d Video excerpts available on the web: www.pointsofviewing.com\n\nThis dynamic epistemological theory of learning led to ways of knowing that include gender\ufb02exing: boys may take on thinking attitudes that are traditionally associated with those of girls, and vice versa (Goldman-Segall, 1996b, 1998a. 1998c). The underlying theme here is the primacy of situated points of viewing, rather than essential qualities. Learners become ethnographers, observing and engaging with the cultural environments in which they participate. She also recommends knowledge framing (1998). Framing is rooted in several diverse but interwoven contexts: Frames\u2014in contrast to the more essentialist notion of styles\u2014include the context set by the framer, what is framed, as well as what is left out of the frame. In other words, for learning, it is more important to have \ufb02exible thinking attitudes about the content knowledge so that the frames that are applied to that cluster of knowledge are appropriate and useful in understanding the domain under investigation. Related uses of framing can be found in the work by Marvin Minsky\u2019s on arti\ufb01cial intelligence (1986), Howard Gardner on multiple intelligences (1985), Erving Goffman on everyday sociology (1986), and Trinh Minh T. Ha on cinematography (1992).\n\nDistributed Cognition and Situated Learning\n\nOver the next decade, the focus had changed from understanding the mind of one child to understanding the situated minds of learners in collaborative teams. Simultaneously, learning environment theories moved to social constructionism, to problem-based learning (PBL) environments spearheaded by Cindy Hmelo-Silver and Howard Barrows, (2006), as well as to rich-media cases of teaching practices. The 1989 article by John Seely Brown, Alan Collins, and Paul Duguid called \u201cSituated Cognition and the Culture of Learning\u201d (1996 [1989]) is generally credited with introducing the concepts and vocabulary of situated cognition to the educational community. This in\ufb02uential article, drawing on research at Xerox PARC and at the Institute for Research on Learning (IRL), expressed the authors\u2019 concern with the limits to which conceptual knowledge can be abstracted from the situations in which it is situated and learned (p. 19), as is common practice in classrooms. Building upon the experiential emphasis of pragmatist thinkers like John Dewey and on the social contexts of learning of Russian activity theorists like Vygotsky and Leontiev, Brown and his colleagues proposed the notion of cognitive apprenticeship. In a cognitive apprenticeship model, knowledge and learning are seen as situated in practice: \u201cSituations might be said to co-produce knowledge through activity. Learning and cognition, it is now possible to argue, are fundamentally situated\u201d (p. 20). This idea is carried forward to an examination of tools and the way in which they are learned and used:Learning how to use a tool involves far more than can be accounted for in any set of explicit rules. The occasions and conditions for use arise directly out of the context of activities of each community that uses the tool, framed by the way members of each community see the world. The community and its viewpoint, quite as much as the tool itself, determine how a tool is used. (Brown et al., p. 23)\n\nThe work that brings the situated perspective \ufb01rmly home to the learning environment is Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger\u2019s Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation (1991), which goes signi\ufb01cantly beyond Brown\u2019s cognitive apprenticeship model. Core to Lave and Wenger\u2019s work is the idea of knowledge as distributed or stretched across a community of practice\u2014what Salomon later called the \u201cradical situated perspective\u201d (Salomon, 1993).\n\nIn our view, learning is not merely situated in practice\u2014as if it were some independently rei\ufb01able process that just happened to be located somewhere; learning is an integral part of generative social practice in the lived-in world\u2026Legitimate peripheral participation is proposed as a descriptor of engagement in social practice that entails learning as an integral constituent. (Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 35) This perspective \ufb02ips the argument over: it is not that learning happens best when it is situated (as if there were learning settings that aren\u2019t situated), but rather, learning is an integral part of all situated practice. So, rather than asking\u2014as Bransford and colleagues at Vanderbilt had\u2014\u201cHow can we create authentic learning situations?\u201d they ask \u201cWhat is the nature of communities of practice?\u201d and \u201cHow do newcomers and old-timers relate and interact within communities of practice?\u201d Lave and Wenger answer these questions through elaborating the nature of communities of practice in what they term legitimate peripheral participation.\n\nBy this we mean to draw attention to the point that learners inevitably participate in communities of practitioners and that mastery of knowledge and skill requires newcomers to move toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. (p. 29)\n\nLave and Wenger also elaborate on the involvement of cultural artifacts and technologies within communities of practice. As knowledge is stretched over a community of practice, it is also embodied in the material culture of that community, both in the mechanisms of practice and in the shared history of the community:Participation involving technology is especially signi\ufb01cant because the artifacts used within a cultural practice carry a substantial portion of that practices heritage \u2026Thus, understanding the technology of practice is more than learning to use tools; it is a way to connect with the history of the practice and to participate more directly in cultural life. (p. 101)\n\nArtifacts and technology are not just instrumental in embodying practice; they also help constitute the structure of the community. As Goldman-Segall, in her 1998 book, Points of Viewing Children\u2019s Thinking: A Digital Ethnographer\u2019s Journey, reminds us,The [tools we know have] are not just tools used by our culture; they are tools used for making culture. They are partners that have their own contribution to make with regard to how we build a cultural understanding of the world around us.... Readers of our socially constructed texts can either be silent lurkers or decide to make their presence known to us. Layers build. Patterns emerge, friendships or enmities grow, and digital inquiry becomes a re\ufb02exive practice\u2014with an emphasis on \ufb02exing, stretching, and strengthening our inquiry. (pp. 268\u2013269)\n\nSituated cognition, then, becomes perspectival knowledge, and the tools and artifacts we create become what Goldman coined \u201cperspectivity technologies\u201d: viewpoints, frames, lenses, and \ufb01lters; re\ufb02ections of selves with others. To understand the signi\ufb01cance of perspectivity in the role of learning, one has to turn to recent studies on the other side of the coin\u2014perception. This renewed interest in perceptually grounded research, or embodiment, encompasses the continually interacting parts of making meaning.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this chapter, the Points of Viewing Theory was applied to an already rich understanding of the use of computers, the Internet, and digital media. The range of possible contributors was so broad that we decided to focus only on those theories and tools that were directly connected with the notion of perspectival knowledge construction and perspectivity technologies. To those researchers whose work is not described in this chapter, we regret that we did not \ufb01nd the opportunity to include your work.\n\nPerspectivity technologies (Goldman, 2007) represent the next phase of thinking with our technology partners. Not only will we build them, shape them, and use them. They will also affect, in\ufb02uence, and shape us. They will become, if some researchers have their way, part of our bodies, not only augmenting our relationships but becoming members in their own right. As robotic objects become robotic subjects, we will have to consider how Steven Spielberg\u2019s robot in the movie AI felt when interacting with humans\u2014and hopefully we will be kinder to ourselves and to our robots. Thus, a perspectivity technology is not only a technology that enables us to better see each other\u2019s viewpoints and make decisions based on multiple points of viewing. It is also concerned with the creation and design of technologies that add perspectives. Technologies have built-in \ufb01lters. To explain this brie\ufb02y, one need only think of how recording an event with pen and paper, an audiotape recorder, and a digital video recorder each provide different perspectives of the same event. The technology provides an important \ufb01lter or lens. A viewpoint, one could say. And although that viewpoint is deeply in\ufb02uenced by who the \ufb01lmmaker is, or who the reporter is, there is a perspective that is contributed by the technology. A camera tells a different story than the audio or text tool.\n\nAs we use new media as communication devices, they affect how we communicate; they participate by being what they are, having a capacity to shape the story. Beyond the media is the message theme of Marshall McLuhan (1964), we are now deeply entrenched in a participatory relationship with our new media technologies because they have become part of our perspective, our consciousness, and our way of life. The level of interaction with our virtual creatures (technologies) transforms our relationships. We are never completely alone. We are connected through media devices even if we cannot see them. They see us.\n\nThat said, what has changed in learning? It might seem we have moved a long way from believing that learning is putting certain curriculum inside of students\u2019 heads and then testing them for how well they have learned that material. Yet, instructionism is still alive and well. From kindergarten to higher education, students are still being trained to be able to pass tests that will provide them with entrance into higher education. In spite of learning theories moving from behaviorism to cognitivism to distributed and situated cognition, educators are caught in the quagmire of preparing students for their future education instead of trying to make the present educational, engaging, and challenging fun. Teachers are caught in an entangled web of uncertainty as they scramble to learn the new tools of the trade (the Internet, distance learning environments, etc), learn the content they have to teach, and then organize the learning into modules that will \ufb01t into the next set of learning modules.\n\nThe irony is that when we think of who our best teachers were, they were the teachers who were able to elicit something within us and help us connect our lives to others\u2019 lives. Not a technology thing! The lives of poets, mathematicians, physicists, and the \ufb01sher down at the docks. These teachers created a sense of community in the classroom. We became part of a discovery process that had no end. Ideas came together that had not yet been put together\u2014at least in our own minds. We felt we invented something new. And indeed we and others\nwithin these learning environments did invent new ideas in our minds. Yet, people say that this cannot happen to most students in most classes and the best we can do is to teach the curriculum, provide a safe learning environment, and test people for what we wanted them to learn. This is not good enough. And if students do not become partners in their learning now, technologies will create islands of despair as more and more students stop learning how to be creative citizens interested in each other, in difference, and in understanding complexity. And technology could open up a gulf between people as well as lack of boundaries between work and play. In Sherry Turkle\u2019s book, Alone Together (2011) she explores these problematics of computer use reminding us about a serious problem facing a technologically seduced society. She argues that we are losing our sense of community, that being together in online environments, such as Facebook for example, can create more aloneness.\n\nConnectivity technologies once promised to give us more boundaries between work and leisure. But as the cell phone and smartphone eroded the bounndaries between work and leisure, all the time in the world was not enough. Even when we are not \u201cat work,\u201d we experience ourselves \u201con call\u201d; pressed, we want to edit out complexity and \u201ccut to the chase.\u201d (Turkle, 2001, p. 12) These comments have raised some online readers to \u201cpush-back,\u201d to use a common vernacular. In an online discussion, W\u0142odzimierz Sobkowiak, a professor of English philology at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland asks:Why should communities of necessity be \u201cconstituted by physical proximity only\u201d is beyond me, frankly, so I\u2019ll not even try to analyze this claim [by Turkle]...I can assure the reader that the shared concerns, real consequences, and common responsibilities\u2019 present in those environments are felt as not a bit less real than in the so-called Real Life. (Retrieved on August 15, 2011, from http://grou.ps/zajek/blogs/item/sherry-turkle-alonetogether)\n\nAlthough technologies have become many things for many people, they can be designed for the creative sharing of perspectives and viewpoints that lead to building better communities of practice in our schools and in our societies. Since the attack on the World Trade Center more than a decade ago on September 11, 2001, we have come to realize that the world is not what we thought it was. We know so little about each other. We know so little about the world. Our educational lenses have focused too long on educational goals that acted as blinders to the world around us. We thought we did not need to understand each other and out diverse perspectives on the world.\n\nThat one view of knowledge was enough. Yet, what we know and what we make is always a re\ufb02ection of our beliefs and assumptions about the world. We need to build new bridges in a socially constructed interconnected world where people have access to each other\u2019s customs, languages, and world views. And, we must rely on our technologies to build connections with peoples we do not know so that the gulf between us lessens. Perspectival knowledge, knowledge gleaned from being able to see others\u2019 perspectives, enables students, educators, and the public at large to take a second and third look at the many lenses which make up the human experience, even if from a distance. The purpose is not to always approve of what we see, but to learn how to put different worldviews into a new con\ufb01guration and uncover paths we might not yet see. And we might, if we are brave enough, respect students not only for what has been taught them after they have taken prescribed courses and completed assignments, but also respect them the moment they walk through the door\u2014or through the online portal as they engage in the formal or informal learning habitat.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAbrahamson, D., Trninic, D., Gutierrez, J.

the apple grows\nHe told me of a magic stream\nHis face was worn but his eyes were clear\nStanding in a slide zone\nI could be steppin' in a slide zone\nStanding in a slide zone\nI could be steppin' through a time zone\n\nHe went to find a shooting star\nAround the bend that's where they are\nI went along just for the ride\nSuddenly I began to glide\n\nStanding in a slide zone\nI could be steppin' through a time zone\n\nThe air raced by there was no sound\nWe drifted high above the ground\nAnd then said you know this place\nAnd then a smile lit up his face\n\nStanding in a slide

chain\nChain look like T-Pain Big Ass Chain\nChain look like I'm signed to Gucci Mane\nTell the label I don't need distribution\nFentanyl, I distribute it\nDo a feature, go and flip a cuban\nI ain't selling my soul like Lil Durk\nGive me 1.5 for an event, that'll work\nTake 20 bands, drop it all on merch\nPull the glick off the hip, shoot an A&R\nYou can keep yo money, I already got a car\nMy bitch badder than Nicki Minaj\nLook like Birdman gon' put me on\nWork cam\u0435 shoulder lean like Diddy Kong\nNappy h\u0435ad nigga, he ain't need a comb\nI don't need a deal 'less I'm buying work\nHang up on the label like, \"It won't work\"\nLike pootie thang mixed with joe dirk\nBig ass 30 clip hanging out my shirt\nIn the hood, kids love me like Trick Daddy\nBitch looking at me like, \"Damn, you blacking\"\nBut my pockets look like a blow-up mattress\nStarting to sweat, you know I'm blacking\nI need a bag like they did Chief Keef\nWon't end up in a deal like Lil Reese\nThey like, \"Neph, why you don't like Lil Reese?\"\n'Cause a bitch won't do me like Lil Reese\nI stole more cars than Lil Reese\nBeat yo ass on camera like Lil Reese\nKeep thinking you tough like Lil Reese\nYou

I used to\nI'm through with you\n\nYou're a hell of a singer and a powerful man\nBut you surround yourself\nWith people who demand so little of you\n\nYou touched my soul with your beautiful song\nYou even had me singing along right with you\nYou said \"I need you\"\nThen you changed the words and that harmony\nAnd you sang that song you'd written for me\nTo someone new\nBut nobody sings a love song quite like you do\nAnd nobody else can make me sing along\nAnd nobody else can make me feel\nThat things are right when you know they're wrong\nNobody sings a love song quite like you\n\nSing me a song sweet music man\nYour making a living doing one night stands\nThat do for you what you need them to\nYou're still a hell of a singer but a broken man\nAnd you surround yourself with people who demand\nSo little of you\n\nBut nobody sings a love song quite like you do\nYou travel the world with a six piece band\nThat does for you what you ask 'em to\nAnd you try to stay up with the songs you sung\nTo so many people that all begun to come\nBack on you\n\nSing me a song sad music man\nYou're making your living doing one night\nStands that's do with you they\nDon't need you, you're still a

transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.)

Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads.

He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear!

I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.)

Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah!

Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O!

Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls.

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches.

Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks.

Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding.

Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1454258", "artist_names": "Sammy Hagar", "full_title": "You Make Me Crazy by\u00a0Sammy\u00a0Hagar", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e2a5ea402b918664e856af81b55a9624.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e2a5ea402b918664e856af81b55a9624.500x500x1.jpg", "id": 1454258, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429852071, "path": "/Sammy-hagar-you-make-me-crazy-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Sammy-hagar-you-make-me-crazy-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1977, "month": 10, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "October 1977", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Oct. 1977", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e2a5ea402b918664e856af81b55a9624.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e2a5ea402b918664e856af81b55a9624.500x500x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "You Make Me Crazy", "title_with_featured": "You Make Me Crazy", "updated_by_human_at": 1618154062, "url": "https://genius.com/Sammy-hagar-you-make-me-crazy-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/37892", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6fa01540d70162810edf191310174e03.800x310x1.png", "id": 37892, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e2924af887ec5e7c2b497b750bcfaad0.650x430x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Sammy Hagar", "slug": "Sammy-hagar", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Sammy-hagar"}, "artist": "Sammy Hagar", "lyrics": "You Make Me Crazy LyricsFill me up to the top and take me away\nTo some little hidin' place in old Monterey\n'Cause you, you make me crazy\n\nCan't keep my hands off you, can't leave you alone\nYou've got the sweetest smile and a style of your own\nAnd you, mmm, you make me crazy\nYeah, you, you make me crazy\n\nOh well, I don't wanna know about your past\nLet's think of what we've got and make a good thing last\n'Cause you, you make me crazy\nWell, you knock me out\nOoh, but it feels all right\nYou turn me on all day and\nYou keep me up all night\nOh, yeah\n\nCall all my friends to say, \"I'm leavin' town.\"\nAnytime my baby comes around\nAnd ooh, mmm, makes me crazy\n\nWell, I'm crazy, crazy\nCrazy 'bout you baby\nI'm crazy, crazy, crazy\nI'm crazy 'bout you baby\n\nI'm crazy 'bout my baby\nI'm crazy, crazy 'bout my baby\n'Cause you, you make me crazy\nI'm outta my mind\nYou make me crazy\nOh, this can't be right, no\nYou make me crazy\nGot me up all night\nYou make me crazy\nCrazy, crazy 'bout you baby\nYou make me crazy\nOh, it's so wrong, but it's all right, yeah\nYou make me crazy\nOh, baby\nYou make me crazySee Sammy Hagar LiveGet tickets as low as $99You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/686471", "artist_names": "Peter Frampton (Ft.

turned thirty-one\nYou get to feelin' weary when the work day's done\nWell all you got to do is get up and into your kicks\nIf you're in a fix\nCome back baby\nRock and roll never forgets\n[Verse 2]\nYou better get yourself a partner\nGo down to the concert or the local bar\nCheck the local newspaper\nChances are you won't have to go too far\nYeah the rafters will be ringing 'cause the beat's so strong\nThe crowd will be swaying and singing along\nAnd all you got to do is get in into the mix\nIf you need a fix\nYou can come back baby\nRock and roll never forgets\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh the band's still playing it loud and lean\nListen to the guitar player making it scream\nAll you got to do is just make that scene tonight\nHey tonight, ooh\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell now sweet sixteen's turned thirty-one\nFeel a little tired feeling under the gun\nWell all of Chuck's children are out there playing his licks\nGet into your kicks\nAnd come back baby\nRock and roll never forgets\nSaid you can

kissed her, I was blistered, and it's time I spoke\nI got to sing it, shout it\nTell the world about it\nI can't believ\u0435 what I'm thinkin' of\nSing it, shout it\nTell the world about it\nI think I'm fallin' in love\n\nOoh, sh\u0435 looks so good tonight (Oooh)\nThere's somethin' special about the light (Oooh, don't you know?)\nOh, she seems to glow\nLike the moon on the sea (Oooh, don't you know, don't you know?)\nI know I'm late for our rendezvous (Oooh)\nBut I just wanna look for a minute or two (Oooh)\nI may never have much in this life (Oooh)\nBut at least I'll have a memory (Oooh)\n\n'Cause she moves with such a sweet precision\nHer arms can hold me like a prison\nHer lips are all I need to survive\nSo she blitzes me with kisses just to keep me alive\n\nI got to sing it, shout it\nTell the world about it\nI can't believe what I'm thinkin' of\nSing it, shout it\nTell the world about it\nI think I'm fallin' in love\nYou might also likeShe moves with such a sweet

is soft and warm, where we lay\nI've dreamed the whole night through\nOf how I'll say to you\nAll the things my heart wants to say\nLast night you heard me crying\n'Cause I had never loved a man before\nAnd I guess the tears were falling\n'Cause a little girl was lost\nBut now, love, I'm not crying anymore\n[Chorus]\nThis girl has turned into a woman\nAnd I've dreamed of this moment all my life\nThis girl has turned into a woman\nAnd I thank you for your tenderness last night\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'd never seen your head on my pillow\nI'd never seen your body without clothes\nI can't believe these feelings I've discovered\nThough I'm sure it's just what every lover knows\nNow, I won't cling to you or make you promise\nAnd if love's gone tomorrow, don't pretend\nBut right now I'm in love, and that's all I'm thinking of\nAnd I hope this feeling never, ever ends\n\n[Chorus]\nThis girl has turned into a woman\nAnd I've dreamed of this moment all my life\nThis girl has turned into a woman\nAnd I thank you for your tenderness last night\nAnd I want to love you once again tonightYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1471512",

Knoweth No Laws\"\n\nBefore twelve o'clock next day he had bought a box of colours, paintbrushes, and an easel. Pellerin consented to give him lessons, and Frederick brought him to his lodgings to see whether anything was wanting among his painting utensils.\n\nDeslauriers had come back, and the second armchair was occupied by a young man. The clerk said, pointing towards him:\n\n\"'Tis he! There he is! S\u00e9n\u00e9cal!\" Frederick disliked this young man. His forehead was heightened by the way in which he wore his hair, cut straight like a brush. There was a certain hard, cold look in his grey eyes; and his long black coat, his entire costume, savoured of the pedagogue and the ecclesiastic.\n\nThey first discussed topics of the hour, amongst others the Stabat of Rossini. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, in answer to a question, declared that he never went to the theatre.\n\nPellerin opened the box of colours.\n\"Are these all for you?\" said the clerk.\n\n\"Why, certainly!\"\n\n\"Well, really! What a notion!\" And he leaned across the table, at which the mathematical tutor was turning over the leaves of a volume of Louis Blanc. He had brought it with him, and was reading passages from it in low tones, while Pellerin and Frederick were examining together the palette, the knife, and the bladders; then the talk came round to the dinner at Arnoux's.\n\n\"The picture-dealer, is it?\" asked S\u00e9n\u00e9cal. \"A nice gentleman, truly!\"\n\n\"Why, now?\" said Pellerin. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal replied:\n\n\"A man who makes money by political turpitude!\"\n\nAnd he went on to talk about a well-known lithograph, in which the Royal Family was all represented as being engaged in edifying occupations: Louis Philippe had a copy of the Code in his hand; the Queen had a Catholic prayer-book; the Princesses were embroidering; the Duc de Nemours was girding on a sword; M. de Joinville was showing a map to his young brothers; and at the end of the apartment could be seen a bed with two divisions. This picture, which was entitled \"A Good Family,\" was a source of delight to commonplace middle-class people, but of grief to patriots.\n\nPellerin, in a tone of vexation, as if he had been the producer of this work himself, observed by way of answer that every opinion had some value. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal protested: Art should aim exclusively at promoting morality amongst the masses! The only subjects that ought to be reproduced were those which impelled people to virtuous actions; all others were injurious.\n\n\"But that depends on the execution,\" cried Pellerin. \"I might produce masterpieces.\"\n\n\"So much the worse for you, then; you have no right\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, you have no right to excite my interest in matters of which I disapprove. What need have we of laborious trifles, from which it is impossible to derive any benefit\u2014those Venuses, for instance, with all your landscapes? I see there no instruction for the people! Show us rather their miseries! arouse enthusiasm in us for their sacrifices! Ah, my God! there is no lack of subjects\u2014the farm, the workshop\u2014\u2014\"\n\nPellerin stammered forth his indignation at this, and, imagining that he had found an argument:\n\"Moli\u00e8re, do you accept him?\"\n\n\"Certainly!\" said S\u00e9n\u00e9cal. \"I admire him as the precursor of the French Revolution.\"\n\n\"Ha! the Revolution! What art! Never was there a more pitiable epoch!\"\n\n\"None greater, Monsieur!\"\n\nPellerin folded his arms, and looking at him straight in the face:\n\n\"You have the appearance of a famous member of the National Guard!\"\n\nHis opponent, accustomed to discussions, responded:\n\n\"I am not, and I detest it just as much as you. But with such principles we corrupt the crowd. This sort of thing, however, is profitable to the Government. It would not be so powerful but for the complicity of a lot of rogues of that sort.\"\n\nThe painter took up the defence of the picture-dealer, for S\u00e9n\u00e9cal's opinions exasperated him. He even went so far as to maintain that Arnoux was really a man with a heart of gold, devoted to his friends, deeply attached to his wife.\n\n\"Oho! if you offered him a good sum, he would not refuse to let her serve as a model.\"\n\nFrederick turned pale.\n\n\"So then, he has done you some great injury, Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Me? no! I saw him once at a caf\u00e9 with a friend. That's all.\"\nS\u00e9n\u00e9cal had spoken truly. But he had his teeth daily set on edge by the announcements in L'Art Industriel. Arnoux was for him the representative of a world which he considered fatal to democracy. An austere Republican, he suspected that there was something corrupt in every form of elegance, and the more so as he wanted nothing and was inflexible in his integrity.\n\nThey found some difficulty in resuming the conversation. The painter soon recalled to mind his appointment, the tutor his pupils; and, when they had gone, after a long silence, Deslauriers asked a number of questions about Arnoux.\n\n\"You will introduce me there later, will you not, old fellow?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Frederick. Then they thought about settling themselves. Deslauriers had without much trouble obtained the post of second clerk in a solicitor's office; he had also entered his name for the terms at the Law School, and bought the indispensable books; and the life of which they had dreamed now began.\n\nIt was delightful, owing to their youth, which made everything assume a beautiful aspect. As Deslauriers had said nothing as to any pecuniary arrangement, Frederick did not refer to the subject. He helped to defray all the expenses, kept the cupboard well stocked, and looked after all the household requirements; but if it happened to be desirable to give the door-keeper a rating, the clerk took that on his own shoulders, still playing the part, which he had assumed in their college days, of protector and senior.\n\nSeparated all day long, they met again in the evening. Each took his place at the fireside and set about his work. But ere long it would be interrupted. Then would follow endless outpourings, unaccountable bursts of merriment, and occasional disputes about the lamp flaring too much or a book being mislaid, momentary ebullitions of anger which subsided in hearty laughter.\n\nWhile in bed they left open the door of the little room where Deslauriers slept, and kept chattering to each other from a distance.\n\nIn the morning they walked in their shirt-sleeves on the terrace. The sun rose; light vapours passed over the river. From the flower-market close beside them the noise of screaming reached their ears; and the smoke from their pipes whirled round in the clear air, which was refreshing to their eyes still puffed from sleep. While they inhaled it, their hearts swelled with great expectations.\n\nWhen it was not raining on Sunday they went out together, and, arm in arm, they sauntered through the streets. The same reflection nearly always occurred to them at the same time, or else they would go on chatting without noticing anything around them. Deslauriers longed for riches, as a means for gaining power over men. He was anxious to possess an influence over a vast number of people, to make a great noise, to have three secretaries under his command, and to give a big political dinner once a month.\n\nFrederick would have furnished for himself a palace in the Moorish fashion, to spend his life reclining on cashmere divans, to the murmur of a jet of water, attended by negro pages. And these things, of which he had only dreamed, became in the end so definite that they made him feel as dejected as if he had lost them.\n\n\"What is the use of talking about all these things,\" said he, \"when we'll never have them?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" returned Deslauriers.\n\nIn spite of his democratic views, he urged Frederick to get an introduction into the Dambreuses' house.\n\nThe other, by way of objection, pointed to the failure of his previous attempts.\n\n\"Bah! go back there. They'll give you an invitation!\"\n\nTowards the close of the month of March, they received amongst other bills of a rather awkward description that of the restaurant-keeper who supplied them with dinners. Frederick, not having the entire amount, borrowed a hundred crowns from Deslauriers. A fortnight afterwards, he renewed the same request, and the clerk administered a lecture to him on the extravagant habits to which he gave himself up in the Arnoux's society.\n\nAs a matter of fact, he put no restraint upon himself in this respect. A view of Venice, a view of Naples, and another of Constantinople occupying the centre of three walls respectively, equestrian subjects by Alfred de Dreux here and there, a group by Pradier over the mantelpiece, numbers of L'Art Industriel lying on the piano, and works in boards on the floor in the corners, encumbered the apartment which he occupied to such an extent that it was hard to find a place to lay a book on, or to move one's elbows about freely. Frederick maintained that he needed all this for his painting.\n\nHe pursued his art-studies under Pellerin. But when he called on the artist, the latter was often out, being accustomed to attend at every funeral and public occurrence of which an account was given in the newspapers, and so it was that Frederick spent entire hours alone in the studio. The quietude of this spacious room, which nothing disturbed save the scampering of the mice, the light falling from the ceiling, or the hissing noise of the stove, made him sink into a kind of intellectual ease. Then his eyes, wandering away from the task at which he was engaged, roamed over the shell-work on the wall, around the objects of virt\u00f9 on the whatnot, along the torsos on which the dust that had collected made, as it were, shreds of velvet; and, like a traveller who has lost his way in the middle of a wood, and whom every path brings back to the same spot, continually, he found underlying every idea in his mind the recollection of Madame Arnoux.\n\nHe selected days for calling on her. When he had reached the second floor, he would pause on the threshold, hesitating as to whether he ought to ring or not. Steps drew nigh, the door opened, and the announcement \"Madame is gone out,\" a sense of relief would come upon him, as if a weight had been lifted from his heart. He met her, however. On the first occasion there were three other ladies with her; the next time it was in the afternoon, and Mademoiselle Marthe's writing-master came on the scene. Besides, the men whom Madame Arnoux received were not very punctilious about paying visits. For the sake of prudence he deemed it better not to call again.\n\nBut he did not fail to present himself regularly at the office of L'Art Industriel every Wednesday in order to get an invitation to the Thursday dinners, and he remained there after all the others, even longer than Regimbart, up to the last moment, pretending to be looking at an engraving or to be running his eye through a newspaper. At last Arnoux would say to him, \"Shall you be disengaged to-morrow evening?\" and, before the sentence was finished, he would give an affirmative answer. Arnoux appeared to have taken a fancy to him. He showed him how to become a good judge of wines, how to make hot punch, and how to prepare a woodcock rago\u00fbt. Frederick followed his advice with docility, feeling an attachment to everything connected with Madame Arnoux\u2014her furniture, her servants, her house, her street.\n\nDuring these dinners he scarcely uttered a word; he kept gazing at her. She had a little mole close to her temple. Her head-bands were darker than the rest of her hair, and were always a little moist at the edges; from time to time she stroked them with only two fingers. He knew the shape of each of her nails. He took delight in listening to the rustle of her silk skirt as she swept past doors; he stealthily inhaled the perfume that came from her handkerchief; her comb, her gloves, her rings were for him things of special interest, important as works of art, almost endowed with life like individuals; all took possession of his heart and strengthened his passion.\n\nHe had not been sufficiently self-contained to conceal it from Deslauriers. When he came home from Madame Arnoux's, he would wake up his friend, as if inadvertently, in order to have an opportunity of talking about her.\n\nDeslauriers, who slept in the little off-room, close to where they had their water-supply, would give a great yawn. Frederick seated himself on the side of the bed. At first, he spoke about the dinner; then he referred to a thousand petty details, in which he saw marks of contempt or of affection. On one occasion, for instance, she had refused his arm, in order to take Dittmer's; and Frederick gave vent to his humiliation:\n\n\"Ah! how stupid!\"\n\nOr else she had called him her \"dear friend.\"\n\n\"Then go after her gaily!\"\n\n\"But I dare not do that,\" said Frederick.\n\n\"Well, then, think no more about her! Good night!\"\n\nDeslauriers thereupon turned on his side, and fell asleep. He felt utterly unable to comprehend this love, which seemed to him the last weakness of adolescence; and, as his own society was apparently not enough to content Frederick, he conceived the idea of bringing together, once a week, those whom they both recognised as friends.\n\nThey came on Saturday about nine o'clock. The three Algerine curtains were carefully drawn. The lamp and four wax-lights were burning. In the middle of the table the tobacco-pot, filled with pipes, displayed itself between the beer-bottles, the tea-pot, a flagon of rum, and some fancy biscuits.\n\nThey discussed the immortality of the soul, and drew comparisons between the different professors.\n\nOne evening Hussonnet introduced a tall young man, attired in a frock-coat, too short in the wrists, and with a look of embarrassment in his face. It was the young fellow whom they had gone to release from the guard-house the year before.\n\nAs he had not been able to restore the box of lace which he had lost in the scuffle, his employer had accused him of theft, and threatened to prosecute him. He was now a clerk in a wagon-office. Hussonnet had come across him that morning at the corner of the street, and brought him along, for Dussardier, in a spirit of gratitude, had expressed a wish to see \"the other.\"\n\nHe stretched out towards Frederick the cigar-holder, still full, which he had religiously preserved, in the hope of being able to give it back. The young men invited him to pay them a second visit; and he was not slow in doing so.\n\nThey all had sympathies in common. At first, their hatred of the Government reached the height of an unquestionable dogma. Martinon alone attempted to defend Louis Philippe. They overwhelmed him with the commonplaces scattered through the newspapers\u2014the \"Bastillization\" of Paris, the September laws, Pritchard, Lord Guizot\u2014so that Martinon held his tongue for fear of giving offence to somebody. During his seven years at college he had never incurred the penalty of an imposition, and at the Law School he knew how to make himself agreeable to the professors. He usually wore a big frock-coat of the colour of putty, with india-rubber goloshes; but one evening he presented himself arrayed like a bridegroom, in a velvet roll-collar waistcoat, a white tie, and a gold chain.\n\nThe astonishment of the other young men was greatly increased when they learned that he had just come away from M. Dambreuse's house. In fact, the banker Dambreuse had just bought a portion of an extensive wood from Martinon senior; and, when the worthy man introduced his son, the other had invited them both to dinner.\n\n\"Was there a good supply of truffles there?\" asked Deslauriers. \"And did you take his wife by the waist between the two doors, sicut decet?\"\n\nHereupon the conversation turned on women. Pellerin would not admit that there were beautiful women (he preferred tigers); besides the human female was an inferior creature in the \u00e6sthetic hierarchy.\n\n\"What fascinates you is just the very thing that degrades her as an idea; I mean her breasts, her hair\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" urged Frederick, \"long black hair and large dark eyes\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Oh! we know all about that,\" cried Hussonnet. \"Enough of Andalusian beauties on the lawn. Those things are out of date; no thank you! For the fact is, honour bright! a fast woman is more amusing than the Venus of Milo. Let us be Gallic, in Heaven's name, and after the Regency style, if we can!\n\n'Flow, generous wines; ladies, deign to smile!'[2]\nWe must pass from the dark to the fair. Is that your opinion, Father Dussardier?\"\n\nDussardier did not reply. They all pressed him to ascertain what his tastes were.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, colouring, \"for my part, I would like to love the same one always!\"\n\nThis was said in such a way that there was a moment of silence, some of them being surprised at this candour, and others finding in his words, perhaps, the secret yearning of their souls.\n\nS\u00e9n\u00e9cal placed his glass of beer on the mantelpiece, and declared dogmatically that, as prostitution was tyrannical and marriage immoral, it was better to practice abstinence. Deslauriers regarded women as a source of amusement\u2014nothing more. M. de Cisy looked upon them with the utmost dread.\n\nBrought up under the eyes of a grandmother who was a devotee, he found the society of those young fellows as alluring as a place of ill-repute and as instructive as the Sorbonne. They gave him lessons without stint; and so much zeal did he exhibit that he even wanted to smoke in spite of the qualms that upset him every time he made the experiment. Frederick paid him the greatest attention. He admired the shade of this young gentleman's cravat, the fur on his overcoat, and especially his boots, as thin as gloves, and so very neat and fine that they had a look of insolent superiority. His carriage used to wait for him below in the street.\n\nOne evening, after his departure, when there was a fall of snow, S\u00e9n\u00e9cal began to complain about his having a coachman. He declaimed against kid-gloved exquisites and against the Jockey Club. He had more respect for a workman than for these fine gentlemen.\n\n\"For my part, anyhow, I work for my livelihood! I am a poor man!\"\n\n\"That's quite evident,\" said Frederick, at length, losing patience.\n\nThe tutor conceived a grudge against him for this remark.\n\nBut, as Regimbart said he knew S\u00e9n\u00e9cal pretty well, Frederick, wishing to be civil to a friend of the Arnoux, asked him to come to the Saturday meetings; and the two patriots were glad to be brought together in this way.\n\nHowever, they took opposite views of things.\n\nS\u00e9n\u00e9cal\u2014who had a skull of the angular type\u2014fixed his attention merely on systems, whereas Regimbart, on the contrary, saw in facts nothing but facts. The thing that chiefly troubled him was the Rhine frontier. He claimed to be an authority on the subject of artillery, and got his clothes made by a tailor of the Polytechnic School.\n\nThe first day, when they asked him to take some cakes, he disdainfully shrugged his shoulders, saying that these might suit women; and on the next few occasions his manner was not much more gracious. Whenever speculative ideas had reached a certain elevation, he would mutter: \"Oh! no Utopias, no dreams!\" On the subject of Art (though he used to visit the studios, where he occasionally out of complaisance gave a lesson in fencing) his opinions were not remarkable for their excellence. He compared the style of M. Marast to that of Voltaire, and Mademoiselle Vatnaz to Madame de Sta\u00ebl, on account of an Ode on Poland in which \"there was some spirit.\" In short, Regimbart bored everyone, and especially Deslauriers, for the Citizen was a friend of the Arnoux family. Now the clerk was most anxious to visit those people in the hope that he might there make the acquaintance of some persons who would be an advantage to him.\n\n\"When are you going to take me there with you?\" he would say. Arnoux was either overburdened with business, or else starting on a journey. Then it was not worth while, as the dinners were coming to an end.\n\nIf he had been called on to risk his life for his friend, Frederick would have done so. But, as he was desirous of making as good a figure as possible, and with this view was most careful about his language and manners, and so attentive to his costume that he always presented himself at the office of L'Art Industriel irreproachably gloved, he was afraid that Deslauriers, with his shabby black coat, his attorney-like exterior, and his swaggering kind of talk, might make himself disagreeable to Madame Arnoux, and thus compromise him and lower him in her estimation. The other results would have been bad enough, but the last one would have annoyed him a thousand times more.\n\nThe clerk saw that his friend did not wish to keep his promise, and Frederick's silence seemed to him an aggravation of the insult. He would have liked to exercise absolute control over him, to see him developing in accordance with the ideal of their youth; and his inactivity excited the clerk's indignation as a breach of duty and a want of loyalty towards himself. Moreover, Frederick, with his thoughts full of Madame Arnoux, frequently talked about her husband; and Deslauriers now began an intolerable course of boredom by repeating the name a hundred times a day, at the end of each remark, like the parrot-cry of an idiot.\n\nWhen there was a knock at the door, he would answer, \"Come in, Arnoux!\" At the restaurant he asked for a Brie cheese \"in imitation of Arnoux,\" and at night, pretending to wake up from a bad dream, he would rouse his comrade by howling out, \"Arnoux! Arnoux!\" At last Frederick, worn out, said to him one day, in a piteous voice:\n\n\"Oh! don't bother me about Arnoux!\"\n\n\"Never!\" replied the clerk:\n\n\"He always, everywhere, burning or icy cold,\nThe pictured form of Arnoux\u2014\u2014\"[3]\n\"Hold your tongue, I tell you!\" exclaimed Frederick, raising his fist.\n\nThen less angrily he added:\n\n\"You know well this is a painful subject to me.\"\n\n\"Oh! forgive me, old fellow,\" returned Deslauriers with a very low bow. \"From this time forth we will be considerate towards Mademoiselle's nerves. Again, I say, forgive me. A thousand pardons!\"\n\nAnd so this little joke came to an end.\n\nBut, three weeks later, one evening, Deslauriers said to him:\n\n\"Well, I have just seen Madame Arnoux.\"\n\n\"Where, pray?\"\n\n\"At the Palais, with Balandard, the solicitor. A dark woman, is she not, of the middle height?\"\n\nFrederick made a gesture of assent. He waited for Deslauriers to speak. At the least expression of admiration he would have been most effusive, and would have fairly hugged the other. However, Deslauriers remained silent. At last, unable to contain himself any longer, Frederick, with assumed indifference, asked him what he thought of her.\n\nDeslauriers considered that \"she was not so bad, but still nothing extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Ha! you think so,\" said Frederick.\n\nThey soon reached the month of August, the time when he was to present himself for his second examination. According to the prevailing opinion, the subjects could be made up in a fortnight. Frederick, having full confidence in his own powers, swallowed up in a trice the first four books of the Code of Procedure, the first three of the Penal Code, many bits of the system of criminal investigation, and a part of the Civil Code, with the annotations of M. Poncelet. The night before, Deslauriers made him run through the whole course, a process which did not finish till morning, and, in order to take advantage of even the last quarter of an hour, continued questioning him while they walked along the footpath together.\n\nAs several examinations were taking place at the same time, there were many persons in the precincts, and amongst others Hussonnet and Cisy: young men never failed to come and watch these ordeals when the fortunes of their comrades were at stake.\n\nFrederick put on the traditional black gown; then, followed by the throng, with three other students, he entered a spacious apartment, into which the light penetrated through uncurtained windows, and which was garnished with benches ranged along the walls. In the centre, leather chairs were drawn round a table adorned with a green cover. This separated the candidates from the examiners in their red gowns and ermine shoulder-knots, the head examiners wearing gold-laced flat caps.\n\nFrederick found himself the last but one in the series\u2014an unfortunate place. In answer to the first question, as to the difference between a convention and a contract, he defined the one as if it were the other; and the professor, who was a fair sort of man, said to him, \"Don't be agitated, Monsieur! Compose yourself!\" Then, having asked two easy questions, which were answered in a doubtful fashion, he passed on at last to the fourth. This wretched beginning made Frederick lose his head. Deslauriers, who was facing him amongst the spectators, made a sign to him to indicate that it was not a hopeless case yet; and at the second batch of questions, dealing with the criminal law, he came out tolerably well. But, after the third, with reference to the \"mystic will,\" the examiner having remained impassive the whole time, his mental distress redoubled; for Hussonnet brought his hands together as if to applaud, whilst Deslauriers liberally indulged in shrugs of the shoulders. Finally, the moment was reached when it was necessary to be examined on Procedure. The professor, displeased at listening to theories opposed to his own, asked him in a churlish tone:\n\n\"And so this is your view, monsieur? How do you reconcile the principle of article 1351 of the Civil Code with this application by a third party to set aside a judgment by default?\"\n\nFrederick had a great headache from not having slept the night before. A ray of sunlight, penetrating through one of the slits in a Venetian blind, fell on his face. Standing behind the seat, he kept wriggling about and tugging at his moustache.\n\n\"I am still awaiting your answer,\" the man with the gold-edged cap observed.\n\nAnd as Frederick's movements, no doubt, irritated him:\n\n\"You won't find it in that moustache of yours!\"\n\nThis sarcasm made the spectators laugh. The professor, feeling flattered, adopted a wheedling tone. He put two more questions with reference to adjournment and summary jurisdiction, then nodded his head by way of approval. The examination was over. Frederick retired into the vestibule.\n\nWhile an usher was taking off his gown, to draw it over some other person immediately afterwards, his friends gathered around him, and succeeded in fairly bothering him with their conflicting opinions as to the result of his examination. Presently the announcement was made in a sonorous voice at the entrance of the hall: \"The third was\u2014put off!\"\n\n\"Sent packing!\" said Hussonnet. \"Let us go away!\"\n\nIn front of the door-keeper's lodge they met Martinon, flushed, excited, with a smile on his face and the halo of victory around his brow. He had just passed his final examination without any impediment. All he had now to do was the thesis. Before a fortnight he would be a licentiate. His family enjoyed the acquaintance of a Minister; \"a beautiful career\" was opening before him.\n\n\"All the same, this puts you into a mess,\" said Deslauriers.\n\nThere is nothing so humiliating as to see blockheads succeed in undertakings in which we fail. Frederick, filled with vexation, replied that he did not care a straw about the matter. He had higher pretensions; and as Hussonnet made a show of leaving, Frederick took him aside, and said to him:\n\n\"Not a word about this to them, mind!\"\n\nIt was easy to keep it secret, since Arnoux was starting the next morning for Germany.\n\nWhen he came back in the evening the clerk found his friend singularly altered: he danced about and whistled; and the other was astonished at this capricious change of mood. Frederick declared that he did not intend to go home to his mother, as he meant to spend his holidays working.\n\nAt the news of Arnoux's departure, a feeling of delight had taken possession of him. He might present himself at the house whenever he liked without any fear of having his visits broken in upon. The consciousness of absolute security would make him self-confident. At last he would not stand aloof, he would not be separated from her! Something more powerful than an iron chain attached him to Paris; a voice from the depths of his heart called out to him to remain.\n\nThere were certain obstacles in his path. These he got over by writing to his mother: he first of all admitted that he had failed to pass, owing to alterations made in the course\u2014a mere mischance\u2014an unfair thing; besides, all the great advocates (he referred to them by name) had been rejected at their examinations. But he calculated on presenting himself again in the month of November. Now, having no time to lose, he would not go home this year; and he asked, in addition to the quarterly allowance, for two hundred and fifty francs, to get coached in law by a private tutor, which would be of great assistance to him; and he threw around the entire epistle a garland of regrets, condolences, expressions of endearment, and protestations of filial love.\n\nMadame Moreau, who had been expecting him the following day, was doubly grieved. She threw a veil over her son's misadventure, and in answer told him to \"come all the same.\" Frederick would not give way, and the result was a falling out between them. However, at the end of the week, he received the amount of the quarter's allowance together with the sum required for the payment of the private tutor, which helped to pay for a pair of pearl-grey trousers, a white felt hat, and a gold-headed switch. When he had procured all these things he thought:\n\n\"Perhaps this is only a hairdresser's fancy on my part!\"\n\nAnd a feeling of considerable hesitation took possession of him.\n\nIn order to make sure as to whether he ought to call on Madame Arnoux, he tossed three coins into the air in succession. On each occasion luck was in his favour. So then Fate must have ordained it. He hailed a cab and drove to the Rue de Choiseul.\n\nHe quickly ascended the staircase and drew the bell-pull, but without effect. He felt as if he were about to faint.\n\nThen, with fierce energy, he shook the heavy silk tassel. There was a resounding peal which gradually died away till no further sound was heard. Frederick got rather frightened.\n\nHe pasted his ear to the door\u2014not a breath! He looked in through the key-hole, and only saw two reed-points on the wall-paper in the midst of designs of flowers. At last, he was on the point of going away when he changed his mind. This time, he gave a timid little ring. The door flew open, and Arnoux himself appeared on the threshold, with his hair all in disorder, his face crimson, and his features distorted by an expression of sullen embarrassment.\n\n\"Hallo! What the deuce brings you here? Come in!\"\n\nHe led Frederick, not into the boudoir or into the bedroom, but into the dining-room, where on the table could be seen a bottle of champagne and two glasses; and, in an abrupt tone:\n\n\"There is something you want to ask me, my dear friend?\"\n\n\"No! nothing! nothing!\" stammered the young man, trying to think of some excuse for his visit. At length, he said to Arnoux that he had called to know whether they had heard from him, as Hussonnet had announced that he had gone to Germany.\n\n\"Not at all!\" returned Arnoux. \"What a feather-headed fellow that is to take everything in the wrong way!\"\n\nIn order to conceal his agitation, Frederick kept walking from right to left in the dining-room. Happening to come into contact with a chair, he knocked down a parasol which had been laid across it, and the ivory handle got broken.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed. \"How sorry I am for having broken Madame Arnoux's parasol!\"\n\nAt this remark, the picture-dealer raised his head and smiled in a very peculiar fashion. Frederick, taking advantage of the opportunity thus offered to talk about her, added shyly:\n\n\"Could I not see her?\"\n\nNo. She had gone to the country to see her mother, who was ill.\n\nHe did not venture to ask any questions as to the length of time that she would be away. He merely enquired what was Madame Arnoux's native place.\n\n\"Chartres. Does this astonish you?\"\n\n\"Astonish me? Oh, no! Why should it! Not in the least!\"\n\nAfter that, they could find absolutely nothing to talk about. Arnoux, having made a cigarette for himself, kept walking round the table, puffing. Frederick, standing near the stove, stared at the walls, the whatnot, and the floor; and delightful pictures flitted through his memory, or, rather, before his eyes. Then he left the apartment.\n\nA piece of a newspaper, rolled up into a ball, lay on the floor in the anteroom. Arnoux snatched it up, and, raising himself on the tips of his toes, he stuck it into the bell, in order, as he said, that he might be able to go and finish his interrupted siesta. Then, as he grasped Frederick's hand:\n\n\"Kindly tell the porter that I am not in.\"\n\nAnd he shut the door after him with a bang.\n\nFrederick descended the staircase step by step. The ill-success of this first attempt discouraged him as to the possible results of those that might follow. Then began three months of absolute boredom. As he had nothing to do, his melancholy was aggravated by the want of occupation.\n\nHe spent whole hours gazing from the top of his balcony at the river as it flowed between the quays, with their bulwarks of grey stone, blackened here and there by the seams of the sewers, with a pontoon of washerwomen moored close to the bank, where some brats were amusing themselves by making a water-spaniel swim in the slime. His eyes, turning aside from the stone bridge of N\u00f4tre Dame and the three suspension bridges, continually directed their glance towards the Quai-aux-Ormes, resting on a group of old trees, resembling the linden-trees of the Montereau wharf. The Saint-Jacques tower, the H\u00f4tel de Ville, Saint-Gervais, Saint-Louis, and Saint-Paul, rose up in front of him amid a confused mass of roofs; and the genius of the July Column glittered at the eastern side like a large gold star, whilst at the other end the dome of the Tuileries showed its outlines against the sky in one great round mass of blue. Madame Arnoux's house must be on this side in the rear!\n\nHe went back to his bedchamber; then, throwing himself on the sofa, he abandoned himself to a confused succession of thoughts\u2014plans of work, schemes for the guidance of his conduct, attempts to divine the future. At last, in order to shake off broodings all about himself, he went out into the open air.\n\nHe plunged at random into the Latin Quarter, usually so noisy, but deserted at this particular time, for the students had gone back to join their families. The huge walls of the colleges, which the silence seemed to lengthen, wore a still more melancholy aspect. All sorts of peaceful sounds could be heard\u2014the flapping of wings in cages, the noise made by the turning of a lathe, or the strokes of a cobbler's hammer; and the old-clothes men, standing in the middle of the street, looked up at each house fruitlessly. In the interior of a solitary caf\u00e9 the barmaid was yawning between her two full decanters. The newspapers were left undisturbed on the tables of reading-rooms. In the ironing establishments linen quivered under the puffs of tepid wind. From time to time he stopped to look at the window of a second-hand book-shop; an omnibus which grazed the footpath as it came rumbling along made him turn round; and, when he found himself before the Luxembourg, he went no further.\n\nOccasionally he was attracted towards the boulevards by the hope of finding there something that might amuse him. After he had passed through dark alleys, from which his nostrils were greeted by fresh moist odours, he reached vast, desolate, open spaces, dazzling with light, in which monuments cast at the side of the pavement notches of black shadow. But once more the wagons and the shops appeared, and the crowd had the effect of stunning him, especially on Sunday, when, from the Bastille to the Madeleine, it kept swaying in one immense flood over the asphalt, in the midst of a cloud of dust, in an incessant clamour. He felt disgusted at the meanness of the faces, the silliness of the talk, and the idiotic self-satisfaction that oozed through these sweating foreheads. However, the consciousness of being superior to these individuals mitigated the weariness which he experienced in gazing at them.\n\nEvery day he went to the office of L'Art Industriel; and in order to ascertain when Madame Arnoux would be back, he made elaborate enquiries about her mother. Arnoux's answer never varied\u2014\"the change for the better was continuing\"\u2014his wife, with his little daughter, would be returning the following week. The longer she delayed in coming back, the more uneasiness Frederick exhibited, so that Arnoux, touched by so much affection, brought him five or six times a week to dine at a restaurant.\n\nIn the long talks which they had together on these occasions Frederick discovered that the picture-dealer was not a very intellectual type of man. Arnoux might, however, take notice of his chilling manner; and now Frederick deemed it advisable to pay back, in a small measure, his polite attentions.\n\nSo, being anxious to do things on a good scale, the young man sold all his new clothes to a second-hand clothes-dealer for the sum of eighty francs, and having increased it with a hundred more francs which he had left, he called at Arnoux's house to bring him out to dine. Regimbart happened to be there, and all three of them set forth for Les Trois Fr\u00e8res Proven\u00e7aux.\n\nThe Citizen began by taking off his surtout, and, knowing that the two others would defer to his gastronomic tastes, drew up the menu. But in vain did he make his way to the kitchen to speak himself to the chef, go down to the cellar, with every corner of which he was familiar, and send for the master of the establishment, to whom he gave \"a blowing up.\" He was not satisfied with the dishes, the wines, or the attendance. At each new dish, at each fresh bottle, as soon as he had swallowed the first mouthful, the first draught, he threw down his fork or pushed his glass some distance away from him; then, leaning on his elbows on the tablecloth, and stretching out his arms, he declared in a loud tone that he could no longer dine in Paris! Finally, not knowing what to put into his mouth, Regimbart ordered kidney-beans dressed with oil, \"quite plain,\" which, though only a partial success, slightly appeased him. Then he had a talk with the waiter all about the latter's predecessors at the \"Proven\u00e7aux\":\u2014\"What had become of Antoine? And a fellow named Eug\u00e8ne? And Th\u00e9odore, the little fellow who always used to attend down stairs? There was much finer fare in those days, and Burgundy vintages the like of which they would never see again.\"\n\nThen there was a discussion as to the value of ground in the suburbs, Arnoux having speculated in that way, and looked on it as a safe thing. In the meantime, however, he would lie out of the interest on his money. As he did not want to sell out at any price, Regimbart would find out some one to whom he could let the ground; and so these two gentlemen proceeded at the close of the dessert to make calculations with a lead pencil.\n\nThey went out to get coffee in the smoking-divan on the ground-floor in the Passage du Saumon. Frederick had to remain on his legs while interminable games of billiards were being played, drenched in innumerable glasses of beer; and he lingered on there till midnight without knowing why, through want of energy, through sheer senselessness, in the vague expectation that something might happen which would give a favourable turn to his love.\n\nWhen, then, would he next see her? Frederick was in a state of despair about it. But, one evening, towards the close of November, Arnoux said to him:\n\n\"My wife, you know, came back yesterday!\"\n\nNext day, at five o'clock, he made his way to her house. He began by congratulating her on her mother's recovery from such a serious illness.\n\n\"Why, no! Who told you that?\"\n\n\"Arnoux!\"\n\nShe gave vent to a slight \"Ah!\" then added that she had grave fears at first, which, however, had now been dispelled. She was seated close beside the fire in an upholstered easy-chair. He was on the sofa, with his hat between his knees; and the conversation was difficult to carry on, as it was broken off nearly every minute, so he got no chance of giving utterance to his sentiments. But, when he began to complain of having to study legal quibbles, she answered, \"Oh! I understand\u2014business!\" and she let her face fall, buried suddenly in her own reflections.\n\nHe was eager to know what they were, and even did not bestow a thought on anything else. The twilight shadows gathered around them.\n\nShe rose, having to go out about some shopping; then she reappeared in a bonnet trimmed with velvet, and a black mantle edged with minever. He plucked up courage and offered to accompany her.\n\nIt was now so dark that one could scarcely see anything. The air was cold, and had an unpleasant odour, owing to a heavy fog, which partially blotted out the fronts of the houses. Frederick inhaled it with delight; for he could feel through the wadding of his coat the form of her arm; and her hand, cased in a chamois glove with two buttons, her little hand which he would have liked to cover with kisses, leaned on his sleeve. Owing to the slipperiness of the pavement, they lost their balance a little; it seemed to him as if they were both rocked by the wind in the midst of a cloud.\n\nThe glitter of the lamps on the boulevard brought him back to the realities of existence. The opportunity was a good one, there was no time to lose. He gave himself as far as the Rue de Richeli\u00e9u to declare his love. But almost at that very moment, in front of a china-shop, she stopped abruptly and said to him:\n\n\"We are at the place. Thanks. On Thursday\u2014is it not?\u2014as usual.\"\n\nThe dinners were now renewed; and the more visits he paid at Madame Arnoux's, the more his love-sickness increased. The contemplation of this woman had an enervating effect upon him, like the use of a perfume that is too strong. It penetrated into the very depths of his nature, and became almost a kind of habitual sensation, a new mode of existence.\n\nThe prostitutes whom he brushed past under the gaslight, the female ballad-singers breaking into bursts of melody, the ladies rising on horseback at full gallop, the shopkeepers' wives on foot, the grisettes at their windows, all women brought her before his mental vision, either from the effect of their resemblance to her or the violent contrast to her which they presented. As he walked along by the shops, he gazed at the cashmeres, the laces, and the jewelled eardrops, imagining how they would look draped around her figure, sewn in her corsage, or lighting up her dark hair. In the flower-girls' baskets the bouquets blossomed for her to choose one as she passed. In the shoemakers' show-windows the little satin slippers with swan's-down edges seemed to be waiting for her foot. Every street led towards her house; the hackney-coaches stood in their places to carry her home the more quickly; Paris was associated with her person, and the great city, with all its noises, roared around her like an immense orchestra.\n\nWhen he went into the Jardin des Plantes the sight of a palm-tree carried him off into distant countries. They were travelling together on the backs of dromedaries, under the awnings of elephants, in the cabin of a yacht amongst the blue archipelagoes, or side by side on mules with little bells attached to them who went stumbling through the grass against broken columns. Sometimes he stopped in the Louvre before old pictures; and, his love embracing her even in vanished centuries, he substituted her for the personages in the paintings. Wearing a hennin on her head, she was praying on bended knees before a stained-glass window. Lady Paramount of Castile or Flanders, she remained seated in a starched ruff and a body lined with whalebone with big puffs. Then he saw her descending some wide porphyry staircase in the midst of senators under a dais of ostriches' feathers in a robe of brocade. At another time he dreamed of her in yellow silk trousers on the cushions of a harem\u2014and all that was beautiful, the scintillation of the stars, certain tunes in music, the turn of a phrase, the outlines of a face, led him to think about her in an abrupt, unconscious fashion.\n\nAs for trying to make her his mistress, he was sure that any such attempt would be futile.\n\nOne evening, Dittmer, on his arrival, kissed her on the forehead; Lovarias did the same, observing:\n\n\"You give me leave\u2014don't you?\u2014as it is a friend's privilege?\"\n\nFrederick stammered out:\n\n\"It seems to me that we are all friends.\"\n\n\"Not all old friends!\" she returned.\n\nThis was repelling him beforehand indirectly.\n\nBesides, what was he to do? To tell her that he loved her? No doubt, she would decline to listen to him or else she would feel indignant and turn him out of the house. But he preferred to submit to even the most painful ordeal rather than run the horrible risk of seeing her no more. He envied pianists for their talents and soldiers for their scars. He longed for a dangerous attack of sickness, hoping in this way to make her take an interest in him.\n\nOne thing caused astonishment to himself, that he felt in no way jealous of Arnoux; and he could not picture her in his imagination undressed, so natural did her modesty appear, and so far did her sex recede into a mysterious background.\n\nNevertheless, he dreamed of the happiness of living with her, of \"theeing\" and \"thouing\" her, of passing his hand lingeringly over her head-bands, or remaining in a kneeling posture on the floor, with both arms clasped round her waist, so as to drink in her soul through his eyes. To accomplish this it would be necessary to conquer Fate; and so, incapable of action, cursing God, and accusing himself of being a coward, he kept moving restlessly within the confines of his passion just as a prisoner keeps moving about in his dungeon. The pangs which he was perpetually enduring were choking him. For hours he would remain quite motionless, or else he would burst into tears; and one day when he had not the strength to restrain his emotion, Deslauriers said to him:\n\n\"Why, goodness gracious! what's the matter with you?\"\n\nFrederick's nerves were unstrung. Deslauriers did not believe a word of it. At the sight of so much mental anguish, he felt all his old affection reawakening, and he tried to cheer up his friend. A man like him to let himself be depressed, what folly! It was all very well while one was young; but, as one grows older, it is only loss of time.\n\n\"You are spoiling my Frederick for me! I want him whom I knew in bygone days. The same boy as ever! I liked him! Come, smoke a pipe, old chap! Shake yourself up a little! You drive me mad!\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Frederick, \"I am a fool!\"\n\nThe clerk replied:\n\n\"Ah! old troubadour, I know well what's troubling you! A little affair of the heart? Confess it! Bah! One lost, four found instead! We console ourselves for virtuous women with the other sort. Would you like me to introduce you to some women? You have only to come to the Alhambra.\"\n\n(This was a place for public balls recently opened at the top of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, which had gone down owing to a display of licentiousness somewhat ruder than is usual in establishments of the kind.)\n\n\"That's a place where there seems to be good fun. You can take your friends, if you like. I can even pass in Regimbart for you.\"\n\nFrederick did not think fit to ask the Citizen to go. Deslauriers deprived himself of the pleasure of S\u00e9n\u00e9cal's society. They took only Hussonnet and Cisy along with Dussardier; and the same hackney-coach set the group of five down at the entrance of the Alhambra.\n\nTwo Moorish galleries extended on the right and on the left, parallel to one another. The wall of a house opposite occupied the entire backguard; and the fourth side (that in which the restaurant was) represented a Gothic cloister with stained-glass windows. A sort of Chinese roof screened the platform reserved for the musicians. The ground was covered all over with asphalt; the Venetian lanterns fastened to posts formed, at regular intervals, crowns of many-coloured flame above the heads of the dancers. A pedestal here and there supported a stone basin, from which rose a thin streamlet of water. In the midst of the foliage could be seen plaster statues, and Hebes and Cupid, painted in oil, and presenting a very sticky appearance; and the numerous walks, garnished with sand of a deep yellow, carefully raked, made the garden look much larger than it was in reality.\n\nStudents were walking their mistresses up and down; drapers' clerks strutted about with canes in their hands; lads fresh from college were smoking their regalias; old men had their dyed beards smoothed out with combs. There were English, Russians, men from South America, and three Orientals in tarbooshes. Lorettes, grisettes, and girls of the town had come there in the hope of finding a protector, a lover, a gold coin, or simply for the pleasure of dancing; and their dresses, with tunics of water-green, cherry-red, or violet, swept along, fluttered between the ebony-trees and the lilacs. Nearly all the men's clothes were of striped material; some of them had white trousers, in spite of the coolness of the evening. The gas was lighted.\n\nHussonnet was acquainted with a number of the women through his connection with the fashion-journals and the smaller theatres. He sent them kisses with the tips of his fingers, and from time to time he quitted his friends to go and chat with them.\n\nDeslauriers felt jealous of these playful familiarities. He accosted in a cynical manner a tall, fair-haired girl, in a nankeen costume. After looking at him with a certain air of sullenness, she said:\n\n\"No! I wouldn't trust you, my good fellow!\" and turned on her heel.\n\nHis next attack was on a stout brunette, who apparently was a little mad; for she gave a bounce at the very first word he spoke to her, threatening, if he went any further, to call the police. Deslauriers made an effort to laugh; then, coming across a little woman sitting by herself under a gas-lamp, he asked her to be his partner in a quadrille.\n\nThe musicians, perched on the platform in the attitude of apes, kept scraping and blowing away with desperate energy. The conductor, standing up, kept beating time automatically. The dancers were much crowded and enjoyed themselves thoroughly. The bonnet-strings, getting loose, rubbed against the cravats; the boots sank under the petticoats; and all this bouncing went on to the accompaniment of the music. Deslauriers hugged the little woman, and, seized with the delirium of the cancan, whirled about, like a big marionnette, in the midst of the dancers. Cisy and Deslauriers were still promenading up and down. The young aristocrat kept ogling the girls, and, in spite of the clerk's exhortations, did not venture to talk to them, having an idea in his head that in the resorts of these women there was always \"a man hidden in the cupboard with a pistol who would come out of it and force you to sign a bill of exchange.\"\n\nThey came back and joined Frederick. Deslauriers had stopped dancing; and they were all asking themselves how they were to finish up the evening, when Hussonnet exclaimed:\n\n\"Look! Here's the Marquise d'Ama\u00ebgui!\"\n\nThe person referred to was a pale woman with a retrouss\u00e9 nose, mittens up to her elbows, and big black earrings hanging down her cheeks, like two dog's ears. Hussonnet said to her:\n\n\"We ought to organise a little f\u00eate at your house\u2014a sort of Oriental rout. Try to collect some of your friends here for these French cavaliers. Well, what is annoying you? Are you going to wait for your hidalgo?\"\n\nThe Andalusian hung down her head: being well aware of the by no means lavish habits of her friend, she was afraid of having to pay for any refreshments he ordered. When, at length, she let the word \"money\" slip from her, Cisy offered five napoleons\u2014all he had in his purse; and so it was settled that the thing should come off.\n\nBut Frederick was absent. He fancied that he had recognised the voice of Arnoux, and got a glimpse of a woman's hat; and accordingly he hastened towards an arbour which was not far off.\n\nMademoiselle Vatnaz was alone there with Arnoux.\n\n\"Excuse me! I am in the way?\"\n\n\"Not in the least!\" returned the picture-merchant.\n\nFrederick, from the closing words of their conversation, understood that Arnoux had come to the Alhambra to talk over a pressing matter of business with Mademoiselle Vatnaz; and it was evident that he was not completely reassured, for he said to her, with some uneasiness in his manner:\n\n\"You are quite sure?\"\n\n\"Perfectly certain! You are loved. Ah! what a man you are!\"\n\nAnd she assumed a pouting look, putting out her big lips, so red that they seemed tinged with blood. But she had wonderful eyes, of a tawny hue, with specks of gold in the pupils, full of vivacity, amorousness, and sensuality. They illuminated, like lamps, the rather yellow tint of her thin face. Arnoux seemed to enjoy her exhibition of pique. He stooped over her, saying:\n\n\"You are nice\u2014give me a kiss!\"\n\nShe caught hold of his two ears, and pressed her lips against his forehead.\n\nAt that moment the dancing stopped; and in the conductor's place appeared a handsome young man, rather fat, with a waxen complexion. He had long black hair, which he wore in the same fashion as Christ, and a blue velvet waistcoat embroidered with large gold palm-branches. He looked as proud as a peacock, and as stupid as a turkey-cock; and, having bowed to the audience, he began a ditty. A villager was supposed to be giving an account of his journey to the capital. The singer used the dialect of Lower Normandy, and played the part of a drunken man. The refrain\u2014\n\n\"Ah! I laughed at you there, I laughed at you there,\nIn that rascally city of Paris!\"[4]\nwas greeted with enthusiastic stampings of feet. Delmas, \"a vocalist who sang with expression,\" was too shrewd to let the excitement of his listeners cool. A guitar was quickly handed to him and he moaned forth a ballad entitled \"The Albanian Girl's Brother.\"\n\nThe words recalled to Frederick those which had been sung by the man in rags between the paddle-boxes of the steamboat. His eyes involuntarily attached themselves to the hem of the dress spread out before him.\n\nAfter each couplet there was a long pause, and the blowing of the wind through the trees resembled the sound of the waves.\n\nMademoiselle Vatnaz blushed the moment she saw Dussardier. She soon rose, and stretching out her hand towards him:\n\n\"You do not remember me, Monsieur Auguste?\"\n\n\"How do you know her?\" asked Frederick.\n\n\"We have been in the same house,\" he replied.\n\nCisy pulled him by the sleeve; they went out; and, scarcely had they disappeared, when Madame Vatnaz began to pronounce a eulogy on his character. She even went so far as to add that he possessed \"the genius of the heart.\"\n\nThen they chatted about Delmas, admitting that as a mimic he might be a success on the stage; and a discussion followed in which Shakespeare, the Censorship, Style, the People, the receipts of the Porte Saint-Martin, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, and Dumersan were all mixed up together.\n\nArnoux had known many celebrated actresses; the young men bent forward their heads to hear what he had to say about these ladies. But his words were drowned in the noise of the music; and, as soon as the quadrille or the polka was over, they all squatted round the tables, called the waiter, and laughed. Bottles of beer and of effervescent lemonade went off with detonations amid the foliage; women clucked like hens; now and then, two gentlemen tried to fight; and a thief was arrested. The dancers, in the rush of a gallop, encroached on the walks. Panting, with flushed, smiling faces, they filed off in a whirlwind which lifted up the gowns with the coat-tails. The trombones brayed more loudly; the rhythmic movement became more rapid. Behind the medi\u00e6val cloister could be heard crackling sounds; squibs went off; artificial suns began turning round; the gleam of the Bengal fires, like emeralds in colour, lighted up for the space of a minute the entire garden; and, with the last rocket, a great sigh escaped from the assembled throng.\n\nIt slowly died away. A cloud of gunpowder floated into the air. Frederick and Deslauriers were walking step by step through the midst of the crowd, when they happened to see something that made them suddenly stop: Martinon was in the act of paying some money at the place where umbrellas were left; and he was accompanying a woman of fifty, plain-looking, magnificently dressed, and of problematic social rank.\n\n\"That sly dog,\" said Deslauriers, \"is not so simple as we imagine. But where in the world is Cisy?\"\n\nDussardier pointed out to them the smoking-divan, where they perceived the knightly youth, with a bowl of punch before him, and a pink hat by his side, to keep him company. Hussonnet, who had been away for the past few minutes, reappeared at the same moment.\n\nA young girl was leaning on his arm, and addressing him in a loud voice as \"My little cat.\"\n\n\"Oh! no!\" said he to her\u2014\"not in public! Call me rather 'Vicomte.' That gives you a cavalier style\u2014Louis XIII. and dainty boots\u2014the sort of thing I like! Yes, my good friends, one of the old r\u00e9gime!\u2014nice, isn't she?\"\u2014and he chucked her by the chin\u2014\"Salute these gentlemen! they are all the sons of peers of France. I keep company with them in order that they may get an appointment for me as an ambassador.\"\n\n\"How insane you are!\" sighed Mademoiselle Vatnaz. She asked Dussardier to see her as far as her own door.\n\nArnoux watched them going off; then, turning towards Frederick:\n\n\"Did you like the Vatnaz? At any rate, you're not quite frank about these affairs. I believe you keep your amours hidden.\"\n\nFrederick, turning pale, swore that he kept nothing hidden.\n\n\"Can it be possible you don't know what it is to have a mistress?\" said Arnoux.\n\nFrederick felt a longing to mention a woman's name at random. But the story might be repeated to her. So he replied that as a matter of fact he had no mistress.\n\nThe picture-dealer reproached him for this.\n\n\"This evening you had a good opportunity! Why didn't you do like the others, each of whom went off with a woman?\"\n\n\"Well, and what about yourself?\" said Frederick, provoked by his persistency.\n\n\"Oh! myself\u2014that's quite a different matter, my lad! I go home to my own one!\"\n\nThen he called a cab, and disappeared.\n\nThe two friends walked towards their own destination. An east wind was blowing. They did not exchange a word. Deslauriers was regretting that he had not succeeded in making a shine before a certain newspaper-manager, and Frederick was lost once more in his melancholy broodings. At length, breaking silence, he said that this public-house ball appeared to him a stupid affair.\n\n\"Whose fault is it? If you had not left us, to join that Arnoux of yours\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Bah! anything I could have done would have been utterly useless!\"\n\nBut the clerk had theories of his own. All that was necessary in order to get a thing was to desire it strongly.\n\n\"Nevertheless, you yourself, a little while ago\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"I don't care a straw about that sort of thing!\" returned Deslauriers, cutting short Frederick's allusion. \"Am I going to get entangled with women?\"\n\nAnd he declaimed against their affectations, their silly ways\u2014in short, he disliked them.\n\n\"Don't be acting, then!\" said Frederick.\n\nDeslauriers became silent. Then, all at once:\n\n\"Will you bet me a hundred francs that I won't do the first woman that passes?\"\n\n\"Yes\u2014it's a bet!\"\n\nThe first who passed was a hideous-looking beggar-woman, and they were giving up all hope of a chance presenting itself when, in the middle of the Rue de Rivoli, they saw a tall girl with a little bandbox in her hand.\n\nDeslauriers accosted her under the arcades. She turned up abruptly by the Tuileries, and soon diverged into the Place du Carrousel. She glanced to the right and to the left. She ran after a hackney-coach; Deslauriers overtook her. He walked by her side, talking to her with expressive gestures. At length, she accepted his arm, and they went on together along the quays. Then, when they reached the rising ground in front of the Ch\u00e2telet, they kept tramping up and down for at least twenty minutes, like two sailors keeping watch. But, all of a sudden, they passed over the Pont-au-Change, through the Flower Market, and along the Quai Napol\u00e9on. Frederick came up behind them. Deslauriers gave him to understand that he would be in their way, and had only to follow his own example.\n\n\"How much have you got still?\"\n\n\"Two hundred sous pieces.\"\n\n\"That's enough\u2014good night to you!\"\n\nFrederick was seized with the astonishment one feels at seeing a piece of foolery coming to a successful issue.\n\n\"He has the laugh at me,\" was his reflection. \"Suppose I went back again?\"\n\nPerhaps Deslauriers imagined that he was envious of this paltry love! \"As if I had not one a hundred times more rare, more noble, more absorbing.\" He felt a sort of angry feeling impelling him onward. He arrived in front of Madame Arnoux's door.\n\nNone of the outer windows belonged to her apartment. Nevertheless, he remained with his eyes pasted on the front of the house\u2014as if he fancied he could, by his contemplation, break open the walls. No doubt, she was now sunk in repose, tranquil as a sleeping flower, with her beautiful black hair resting on the lace of the pillow, her lips slightly parted, and one arm under her head. Then Arnoux's head rose before him, and he rushed away to escape from this vision.\n\nThe advice which Deslauriers had given to him came back to his memory. It only filled him with horror. Then he walked about the streets in a vagabond fashion.\n\nWhen a pedestrian approached, he tried to distinguish the face. From time to time a ray of light passed between his legs, tracing a great quarter of a circle on the pavement; and in the shadow a man appeared with his dosser and his lantern. The wind, at certain points, made the sheet-iron flue of a chimney shake. Distant sounds reached his ears, mingling with the buzzing in his brain; and it seemed to him that he was listening to the indistinct flourish of quadrille music. His movements as he walked on kept up this illusion. He found himself on the Pont de la Concorde.\n\nThen he recalled that evening in the previous winter, when, as he left her house for the first time, he was forced to stand still, so rapidly did his heart beat with the hopes that held it in their clasp. And now they had all withered!\n\nDark clouds were drifting across the face of the moon. He gazed at it, musing on the vastness of space, the wretchedness of life, the nothingness of everything. The day dawned; his teeth began to chatter, and, half-asleep, wet with the morning mist, and bathed in tears, he asked himself, Why should I not make an end of it? All that was necessary was a single movement. The weight of his forehead dragged him along\u2014he beheld his own dead body floating in the water. Frederick stooped down. The parapet was rather wide, and it was through pure weariness that he did not make the attempt to leap over it.\n\nThen a feeling of dismay swept over him. He reached the boulevards once more, and sank down upon a seat. He was aroused by some police-officers, who were convinced that he had been indulging a little too freely.\n\nHe resumed his walk. But, as he was exceedingly hungry, and as all the restaurants were closed, he went to get a \"snack\" at a tavern by the fish-markets; after which, thinking it too soon to go in yet, he kept sauntering about the H\u00f4tel de Ville till a quarter past eight.\n\nDeslauriers had long since got rid of his wench; and he was writing at the table in the middle of his room. About four o'clock, M. de Cisy came in.\n\nThanks to Dussardier, he had enjoyed the society of a lady the night before; and he had even accompanied her home in the carriage with her husband to the very threshold of their house, where she had given him an assignation. He parted with her without even knowing her name.\n\n\"And what do you propose that I should do in that way?\" said Frederick.\n\nThereupon the young gentleman began to cudgel his brains to think of a suitable woman; he mentioned Mademoiselle Vatnaz, the Andalusian, and all the rest. At length, with much circumlocution, he stated the object of his visit. Relying on the discretion of his friend, he came to aid him in taking an important step, after which he might definitely regard himself as a man; and Frederick showed no reluctance. He told the story to Deslauriers without relating the facts with reference to himself personally.\n\nThe clerk was of opinion that he was now going on very well. This respect for his advice increased his good humour. He owed to that quality his success, on the very first night he met her, with Mademoiselle Cl\u00e9mence Daviou, embroideress in gold for military outfits, the sweetest creature that ever lived, as slender as a reed, with large blue eyes, perpetually staring with wonder. The clerk had taken advantage of her credulity to such an extent as to make her believe that he had been decorated. At their private conversations he had his frock-coat adorned with a red ribbon, but divested himself of it in public in order, as he put it, not to humiliate his master. However, he kept her at a distance, allowed himself to be fawned upon, like a pasha, and, in a laughing sort of way, called her \"daughter of the people.\" Every time they met, she brought him little bunches of violets. Frederick would not have cared for a love affair of this sort.\n\nMeanwhile, whenever they set forth arm-in-arm to visit Pinson's or Barillot's circulating library, he experienced a feeling of singular depression. Frederick did not realise how much pain he had made Deslauriers endure for the past year, while brushing his nails before going out to dine in the Rue de Choiseul!\n\nOne evening, when from the commanding position in which his balcony stood, he had just been watching them as they went out together, he saw Hussonnet, some distance off, on the Pont d'Arcole. The Bohemian began calling him by making signals towards him, and, when Frederick had descended the five flights of stairs:\n\n\"Here is the thing\u2014it is next Saturday, the 24th, Madame Arnoux's feast-day.\"\n\n\"How is that, when her name is Marie?\"\n\n\"And Ang\u00e8le also\u2014no matter! They will entertain their guests at their country-house at Saint-Cloud. I was told to give you due notice about it. You'll find a vehicle at the magazine-office at three o'clock. So that makes matters all right! Excuse me for having disturbed you! But I have such a number of calls to make!\"\n\nFrederick had scarcely turned round when his door-keeper placed a letter in his hand:\n\n\"Monsieur and Madame Dambreuse beg of Monsieur F. Moreau to do them the honour to come and dine with them on Saturday the 24th inst.\u2014R.S.V.P.\"\n\n\"Too late!\" he said to himself. Nevertheless, he showed the letter to Deslauriers, who exclaimed:\n\n\"Ha! at last! But you don't look as if you were satisfied. Why?\"\n\nAfter some little hesitation, Frederick said that he had another invitation for the same day.\n\n\"Be kind enough to let me run across to the Rue de Choiseul. I'm not joking! I'll answer this for you if it puts you about.\"\n\nAnd the clerk wrote an acceptance of the invitation in the third person.\n\nHaving seen nothing of the world save through the fever of his desires, he pictured it to himself as an artificial creation discharging its functions by virtue of mathematical laws. A dinner in the city, an accidental meeting with a man in office, a smile from a pretty woman, might, by a series of actions deducing themselves from one another, have gigantic results. Certain Parisian drawing-rooms were like those machines which take a material in the rough and render it a hundred times more valuable. He believed in courtesans advising diplomatists, in wealthy marriages brought about by intrigues, in the cleverness of convicts, in the capacity of strong men for getting the better of fortune. In short, he considered it so useful to visit the Dambreuses, and talked about it so plausibly, that Frederick was at a loss to know what was the best course to take.\n\nThe least he ought to do, as it was Madame Arnoux's feast-day, was to make her a present. He naturally thought of a parasol, in order to make reparation for his awkwardness. Now he came across a shot-silk parasol with a little carved ivory handle, which had come all the way from China. But the price of it was a hundred and seventy-five francs, and he had not a sou, having in fact to live on the credit of his next quarter's allowance. However, he wished to get it; he was determined to have it; and, in spite of his repugnance to doing so, he had recourse to Deslauriers.\n\nDeslauriers answered Frederick's first question by saying that he had no money.\n\n\"I want some,\" said Frederick\u2014\"I want some very badly!\"\n\nAs the other made the same excuse over again, he flew into a passion.\n\n\"You might find it to your advantage some time\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing.\"\n\nThe clerk understood. He took the sum required out of his reserve-fund, and when he had counted out the money, coin by coin:\n\n\"I am not asking you for a receipt, as I see you have a lot of expense!\"\n\nFrederick threw himself on his friend's neck with a thousand affectionate protestations. Deslauriers received this display of emotion frigidly. Then, next morning, noticing the parasol on the top of the piano:\n\n\"Ah! it was for that!\"\n\n\"I will send it, perhaps,\" said Frederick, with an air of carelessness.\n\nGood fortune was on his side, for that evening he got a note with a black border from Madame Dambreuse announcing to him that she had lost an uncle, and excusing herself for having to defer till a later period the pleasure of making his acquaintance. At two o'clock, he reached the office of the art journal. Instead of waiting for him in order to drive him in his carriage, Arnoux had left the city the night before, unable to resist his desire to get some fresh air.\n\nEvery year it was his custom, as soon as the leaves were budding forth, to start early in the morning and to remain away several days, making long journeys across the fields, drinking milk at the farm-houses, romping with the village girls, asking questions about the harvest, and carrying back home with him stalks of salad in his pocket-handkerchief. At length, in order to realise a long-cherished dream of his, he had bought a country-house.\n\nWhile Frederick was talking to the picture-dealer's clerk, Mademoiselle Vatnaz suddenly made her appearance, and was disappointed at not seeing Arnoux. He would, perhaps, be remaining away two days longer. The clerk advised her \"to go there\"\u2014she could not go there; to write a letter\u2014she was afraid that the letter might get lost. Frederick offered to be the bearer of it himself. She rapidly scribbled off a letter, and implored of him to let nobody see him delivering it.\n\nForty minutes afterwards, he found himself at Saint-Cloud. The house, which was about a hundred paces farther away than the bridge, stood half-way up the hill. The garden-walls were hidden by two rows of linden-trees, and a wide lawn descended to the bank of the river. The railed entrance before the door was open, and Frederick went in.\n\nArnoux, stretched on the grass, was playing with a litter of kittens. This amusement appeared to absorb him completely. Mademoiselle Vatnaz's letter drew him out of his sleepy idleness.\n\n\"The deuce! the deuce!\u2014this is a bore! She is right, though; I must go.\"\n\nThen, having stuck the missive into his pocket, he showed the young man through the grounds with manifest delight. He pointed out everything\u2014the stable, the cart-house, the kitchen. The drawing-room was at the right, on the side facing Paris, and looked out on a floored arbour, covered over with clematis. But presently a few harmonious notes burst forth above their heads: Madame Arnoux, fancying that there was nobody near, was singing to amuse herself. She executed quavers, trills, arpeggios. There were long notes which seemed to remain suspended in the air; others fell in a rushing shower like the spray of a waterfall; and her voice passing out through the Venetian blind, cut its way through the deep silence and rose towards the blue sky. She ceased all at once, when M. and Madame Oudry, two neighbours, presented themselves.\n\nThen she appeared herself at the top of the steps in front of the house; and, as she descended, he caught a glimpse of her foot. She wore little open shoes of reddish-brown leather, with three straps crossing each other so as to draw just above her stockings a wirework of gold.\n\nThose who had been invited arrived. With the exception of Ma\u00eetre Lefaucheur, an advocate, they were the same guests who came to the Thursday dinners. Each of them had brought some present\u2014Dittmer a Syrian scarf, Rosenwald a scrap-book of ballads, Burieu a water-colour painting, Sombary one of his own caricatures, and Pellerin a charcoal-drawing, representing a kind of dance of death, a hideous fantasy, the execution of which was rather poor. Hussonnet dispensed with the formality of a present.\n\nFrederick was waiting to offer his, after the others.\n\nShe thanked him very much for it. Thereupon, he said:\n\n\"Why, 'tis almost a debt. I have been so much annoyed\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"At what, pray?\" she returned. \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Come! dinner is waiting!\" said Arnoux, catching hold of his arm; then in a whisper: \"You are not very knowing, certainly!\"\n\nNothing could well be prettier than the dining-room, painted in water-green. At one end, a nymph of stone was dipping her toe in a basin formed like a shell. Through the open windows the entire garden could be seen with the long lawn flanked by an old Scotch fir, three-quarters stripped bare; groups of flowers swelled it out in unequal plots; and at the other side of the river extended in a wide semi-circle the Bois de Boulogne, Neuilly, S\u00e8vres, and Meudon. Before the railed gate in front a canoe with sail outspread was tacking about.\n\nThey chatted first about the view in front of them, then about scenery in general; and they were beginning to plunge into discussions when Arnoux, at half-past nine o'clock, ordered the horse to be put to the carriage.\n\n\"Would you like me to go back with you?\" said Madame Arnoux.\n\n\"Why, certainly!\" and, making her a graceful bow: \"You know well, madame, that it is impossible to live without you!\"\n\nEveryone congratulated her on having so good a husband.\n\n\"Ah! it is because I am not the only one,\" she replied quietly, pointing towards her little daughter.\n\nThen, the conversation having turned once more on painting, there was some talk about a Ruysda\u00e9l, for which Arnoux expected a big sum, and Pellerin asked him if it were true that the celebrated Saul Mathias from London had come over during the past month to make him an offer of twenty-three thousand francs for it.\n\n\"'Tis a positive fact!\" and turning towards Frederick: \"That was the very same gentleman I brought with me a few days ago to the Alhambra, much against my will, I assure you, for these English are by no means amusing companions.\"\n\nFrederick, who suspected that Mademoiselle Vatnaz's letter contained some reference to an intrigue, was amazed at the facility with which my lord Arnoux found a way of passing it off as a perfectly honourable transaction; but his new lie, which was quite needless, made the young man open his eyes in speechless astonishment.\n\nThe picture-dealer added, with an air of simplicity:\n\n\"What's the name, by-the-by, of that young fellow, your friend?\"\n\n\"Deslauriers,\" said Frederick quickly.\n\nAnd, in order to repair the injustice which he felt he had done to his comrade, he praised him as one who possessed remarkable ability.\n\n\"Ah! indeed? But he doesn't look such a fine fellow as the other\u2014the clerk in the wagon-office.\"\n\nFrederick bestowed a mental imprecation on Dussardier. She would now be taking it for granted that he associated with the common herd.\n\nThen they began to talk about the ornamentation of the capital\u2014the new districts of the city\u2014and the worthy Oudry happened to refer to M. Dambreuse as one of the big speculators.\n\nFrederick, taking advantage of the opportunity to make a good figure, said he was acquainted with that gentleman. But Pellerin launched into a harangue against shopkeepers\u2014he saw no difference between them, whether they were sellers of candles or of money. Then Rosenwald and Burieu talked about old china; Arnoux chatted with Madame Oudry about gardening; Sombary, a comical character of the old school, amused himself by chaffing her husband, referring to him sometimes as \"Odry,\" as if he were the actor of that name, and remarking that he must be descended from Oudry, the dog-painter, seeing that the bump of the animals was visible on his forehead. He even wanted to feel M. Oudry's skull; but the latter excused himself on account of his wig; and the dessert ended with loud bursts of laughter.\n\nWhen they had taken their coffee, while they smoked, under the linden-trees, and strolled about the garden for some time, they went out for a walk along the river.\n\nThe party stopped in front of a fishmonger's shop, where a man was washing eels. Mademoiselle Marthe wanted to look at them. He emptied the box in which he had them out on the grass; and the little girl threw herself on her knees in order to catch them, laughed with delight, and then began to scream with terror. They all got spoiled, and Arnoux paid for them.\n\nHe next took it into his head to go out for a sail in the cutter.\n\nOne side of the horizon was beginning to assume a pale aspect, while on the other side a wide strip of orange colour showed itself in the sky, deepening into purple at the summits of the hills, which were steeped in shadow. Madame Arnoux seated herself on a big stone with this glittering splendour at her back. The other ladies sauntered about here and there. Hussonnet, at the lower end of the river's bank, went making ducks and drakes over the water.\n\nArnoux presently returned, followed by a weather-beaten long boat, into which, in spite of the most prudent remonstrances, he packed his guests. The boat got upset, and they had to go ashore again.\n\nBy this time wax-tapers were burning in the drawing-room, all hung with chintz, and with branched candlesticks of crystal fixed close to the walls. M\u00e8re Oudry was sleeping comfortably in an armchair, and the others were listening to M. Lefaucheux expatiating on the glories of the Bar. Madame Arnoux was sitting by herself near the window. Frederick came over to her.\n\nThey chatted about the remarks which were being made in their vicinity. She admired oratory; he preferred the renown gained by authors. But, she ventured to suggest, it must give a man greater pleasure to move crowds directly by addressing them in person, face to face, than it does to infuse into their souls by his pen all the sentiments that animate his own. Such triumphs as these did not tempt Frederick much, as he had no ambition.\n\nThen he broached the subject of sentimental adventures. She spoke pityingly of the havoc wrought by passion, but expressed indignation at hypocritical vileness, and this rectitude of spirit harmonised so well with the regular beauty of her face that it seemed indeed as if her physical attractions were the outcome of her moral nature.\n\nShe smiled, every now and then, letting her eyes rest on him for a minute. Then he felt her glances penetrating his soul like those great rays of sunlight which descend into the depths of the water. He loved her without mental reservation, without any hope of his love being returned, unconditionally; and in those silent transports, which were like outbursts of gratitude, he would fain have covered her forehead with a rain of kisses. However, an inspiration from within carried him beyond himself\u2014he felt moved by a longing for self-sacrifice, an imperative impulse towards immediate self-devotion, and all the stronger from the fact that he could not gratify it.\n\nHe did not leave along with the rest. Neither did Hussonnet. They were to go back in the carriage; and the vehicle was waiting just in front of the steps when Arnoux rushed down and hurried into the garden to gather some flowers there. Then the bouquet having been tied round with a thread, as the stems fell down unevenly, he searched in his pocket, which was full of papers, took out a piece at random, wrapped them up, completed his handiwork with the aid of a strong pin, and then offered it to his wife with a certain amount of tenderness.\n\n\"Look here, my darling! Excuse me for having forgotten you!\"\n\nBut she uttered a little scream: the pin, having been awkwardly fixed, had cut her, and she hastened up to her room. They waited nearly a quarter of an hour for her. At last, she reappeared, carried off Marthe, and threw herself into the carriage.\n\n\"And your bouquet?\" said Arnoux.\n\n\"No! no\u2014it is not worth while!\" Frederick was running off to fetch it for her; she called out to him:\n\n\"I don't want it!\"\n\nBut he speedily brought it to her, saying that he had just put it into an envelope again, as he had found the flowers lying on the floor. She thrust them behind the leathern apron of the carriage close to the seat, and off they started.\n\nFrederick, seated by her side, noticed that she was trembling frightfully. Then, when they had passed the bridge, as Arnoux was turning to the left:\n\n\"Why, no! you are making a mistake!\u2014that way, to the right!\"\n\nShe seemed irritated; everything annoyed her. At length, Marthe having closed her eyes, Madame Arnoux drew forth the bouquet, and flung it out through the carriage-door, then caught Frederick's arm, making a sign to him with the other hand to say nothing about it.\n\nAfter this, she pressed her handkerchief against her lips, and sat quite motionless.\n\nThe two others, on the dickey, kept talking about printing and about subscribers. Arnoux, who was driving recklessly, lost his way in the middle of the Bois de Boulogne. Then they plunged into narrow paths. The horse proceeded along at a walking pace; the branches of the trees grazed the hood. Frederick could see nothing of Madame Arnoux save her two eyes in the shade. Marthe lay stretched across her lap while he supported the child's head.\n\n\"She is tiring you!\" said her mother.\n\nHe replied:\n\n\"No! Oh, no!\"\n\nWhirlwinds of dust rose up slowly. They passed through Auteuil. All the houses were closed up; a gas-lamp here and there lighted up the angle of a wall; then once more they were surrounded by darkness. At one time he noticed that she was shedding tears.\n\nWas this remorse or passion? What in the world was it? This grief, of whose exact nature he was ignorant, interested him like a personal matter. There was now a new bond between them, as if, in a sense, they were accomplices; and he said to her in the most caressing voice he could assume:\n\n\"You are ill?\"\n\n\"Yes, a little,\" she returned.\n\nThe carriage rolled on, and the honeysuckles and the syringas trailed over the garden fences, sending forth puffs of enervating odour into the night air. Her gown fell around her feet in numerous folds. It seemed to him as if he were in communication with her entire person through the medium of this child's body which lay stretched between them. He stooped over the little girl, and spreading out her pretty brown tresses, kissed her softly on the forehead.\n\n\"You are good!\" said Madame Arnoux.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you are fond of children.\"\n\n\"Not all!\"\n\nHe said no more, but he let his left hand hang down her side wide open, fancying that she would follow his example perhaps, and that he would find her palm touching his. Then he felt ashamed and withdrew it. They soon reached the paved street. The carriage went on more quickly; the number of gas-lights vastly increased\u2014it was Paris. Hussonnet, in front of the lumber-room, jumped down from his seat. Frederick waited till they were in the courtyard before alighting; then he lay in ambush at the corner of the Rue de Choiseul, and saw Arnoux slowly making his way back to the boulevards.\n\nNext morning he began working as hard as ever he could.\n\nHe saw himself in an Assize Court, on a winter's evening, at the close of the advocates' speeches, when the jurymen are looking pale, and when the panting audience make the partitions of the pr\u00e6torium creak; and after having being four hours speaking, he was recapitulating all his proofs, feeling with every phrase, with every word, with every gesture, the chopper of the guillotine, which was suspended behind him, rising up; then in the tribune of the Chamber, an orator who bears on his lips the safety of an entire people, drowning his opponents under his figures of rhetoric, crushing them under a repartee, with thunders and musical intonations in his voice, ironical, pathetic, fiery, sublime. She would be there somewhere in the midst of the others, hiding beneath her veil her enthusiastic tears. After that they would meet again, and he would be unaffected by discouragements, calumnies, and insults, if she would only say, \"Ah, that is beautiful!\" while drawing her light hand across his brow.\n\nThese images flashed, like beacon-lights, on the horizon of his life. His intellect, thereby excited, became more active and more vigorous. He buried himself in study till the month of August, and was successful at his final examination.\n\nDeslauriers, who had found it so troublesome to coach him once more for the second examination at the close of December, and for the third in February, was astonished at his ardour. Then the great expectations of former days returned. In ten years it was probable that Frederick would be deputy; in fifteen a minister. Why not? With his patrimony, which would soon come into his hands, he might, at first, start a newspaper; this would be the opening step in his career; after that they would see what the future would bring. As for himself, he was still ambitious of obtaining a chair in the Law School; and he sustained his thesis for the degree of Doctor in such a remarkable fashion that it won for him the compliments of the professors.\n\nThree days afterwards, Frederick took his own degree. Before leaving for his holidays, he conceived the idea of getting up a picnic to bring to a close their Saturday reunions.\n\nHe displayed the utmost gaiety on the occasion. Madame Arnoux was now with her mother at Chartres. But he would soon come across her again, and would end by being her lover.\n\nDeslauriers, admitted the same day to the young advocates' pleading rehearsals at Orsay, had made a speech which was greatly applauded. Although he was sober, he drank a little more wine than was good for him, and said to Dussardier at dessert:\n\n\"You are an honest fellow!\u2014and, when I'm a rich man, I'll make you my manager.\"\n\nAll were in a state of delight. Cisy was not going to finish his law-course. Martinon intended to remain during the period before his admission to the Bar in the provinces, where he would be nominated a deputy-magistrate. Pellerin was devoting himself to the production of a large picture representing \"The Genius of the Revolution.\" Hussonnet was, in the following week, about to read for the Director of Public Amusements the scheme of a play, and had no doubt as to its success:\n\n\"As for the framework of the drama, they may leave that to me! As for the passions, I have knocked about enough to understand them thoroughly; and as for witticisms, they're entirely in my line!\"\n\nHe gave a spring, fell on his two hands, and thus moved for some time around the table with his legs in the air. This performance, worthy of a street-urchin, did not get rid of S\u00e9n\u00e9cal's frowns. He had just been dismissed from the boarding-school, in which he had been a teacher, for having given a whipping to an aristocrat's son. His straitened circumstances had got worse in consequence: he laid the blame of this on the inequalities of society, and cursed the wealthy. He poured out his grievances into the sympathetic ears of Regimbart, who had become every day more and more disillusioned, saddened, and disgusted. The Citizen had now turned his attention towards questions arising out of the Budget, and blamed the Court party for the loss of millions in Algeria.\n\nAs he could not sleep without having paid a visit to the Alexandre smoking-divan, he disappeared at eleven o'clock. The rest went away some time afterwards; and Frederick, as he was parting with Hussonnet, learned that Madame Arnoux was to have come back the night before.\n\nHe accordingly went to the coach-office to change his time for starting to the next day; and, at about six o'clock in the evening, presented himself at her house. Her return, the door keeper said, had been put off for a week. Frederick dined alone, and then lounged about the boulevards.\n\nRosy clouds, scarf-like in form, stretched beyond the roofs; the shop-tents were beginning to be taken away; water-carts were letting a shower of spray fall over the dusty pavement; and an unexpected coolness was mingled with emanations from caf\u00e9s, as one got a glimpse through their open doors, between some silver plate and gilt ware, of flowers in sheaves, which were reflected in the large sheets of glass. The crowd moved on at a leisurely pace. Groups of men were chatting in the middle of the footpath; and women passed along with an indolent expression in their eyes and that camelia tint in their complexions which intense heat imparts to feminine flesh. Something immeasurable in its vastness seemed to pour itself out and enclose the houses. Never had Paris looked so beautiful. He saw nothing before him in the future but an interminable series of years all full of love.\n\nHe stopped in front of the theatre of the Porte Saint-Martin to look at the bill; and, for want of something to occupy him, paid for a seat and went in.\n\nAn old-fashioned dramatic version of a fairy-tale was the piece on the stage. There was a very small audience; and through the skylights of the top gallery the vault of heaven seemed cut up into little blue squares, whilst the stage lamps above the orchestra formed a single line of yellow illuminations. The scene represented a slave-market at Pekin, with hand-bells, tomtoms, sweeping robes, sharp-pointed caps, and clownish jokes. Then, as soon as the curtain fell, he wandered into the foyer all alone and gazed out with admiration at a large green landau which stood on the boulevard outside, before the front steps of the theatre, yoked to two white horses, while a coachman with short breeches held the reins.\n\nHe had just got back to his seat when, in the balcony, a lady and a gentleman entered the first box in front of the stage. The husband had a pale face with a narrow strip of grey beard round it, the rosette of a Government official, and that frigid look which is supposed to characterise diplomatists.\n\nHis wife, who was at least twenty years younger, and who was neither tall nor under-sized, neither ugly nor pretty, wore her fair hair in corkscrew curls in the English fashion, and displayed a long-bodiced dress and a large black lace fan. To make people so fashionable as these come to the theatre at such a season one would imagine either that there was some accidental cause, or that they had got tired of spending the evening in one another's society. The lady kept nibbling at her fan, while the gentleman yawned. Frederick could not recall to mind where he had seen that face.\n\nIn the next interval between the acts, while passing through one of the lobbies, he came face to face with both of them. As he bowed in an undecided manner, M. Dambreuse, at once recognising him, came up and apologised for having treated him with unpardonable neglect. It was an allusion to the numerous visiting-cards he had sent in accordance with the clerk's advice. However, he confused the periods, supposing that Frederick was in the second year of his law-course. Then he said he envied the young man for the opportunity of going into the country. He sadly needed a little rest himself, but business kept him in Paris.\n\nMadame Dambreuse, leaning on his arm, nodded her head slightly, and the agreeable sprightliness of her face contrasted with its gloomy expression a short time before.\n\n\"One finds charming diversions in it, nevertheless,\" she said, after her husband's last remark. \"What a stupid play that was\u2014was it not, Monsieur?\" And all three of them remained there chatting about theatres and new pieces.\n\nFrederick, accustomed to the grimaces of provincial dames, had not seen in any woman such ease of manner combined with that simplicity which is the essence of refinement, and in which ingenuous souls trace the expression of instantaneous sympathy.\n\nThey would expect to see him as soon as he returned. M. Dambreuse told him to give his kind remembrances to P\u00e8re Roque.\n\nFrederick, when he reached his lodgings, did not fail to inform Deslauriers of their hospitable invitation.\n\n\"Grand!\" was the clerk's reply; \"and don't let your mamma get round you! Come back without delay!\"\n\nOn the day after his arrival, as soon as they had finished breakfast, Madame Moreau brought her son out into the garden.\n\nShe said she was happy to see him in a profession, for they were not as rich as people imagined. The land brought in little; the people who farmed it paid badly. She had even been compelled to sell her carriage. Finally, she placed their situation in its true colours before him.\n\nDuring the first embarrassments which followed the death of her late husband, M. Roque, a man of great cunning, had made her loans of money which had been renewed, and left long unpaid, in spite of her desire to clear them off. He had suddenly made a demand for immediate payment, and she had gone beyond the strict terms of the agreement by giving up to him, at a contemptible figure, the farm of Presles. Ten years later, her capital disappeared through the failure of a banker at Melun. Through a horror which she had of mortgages, and to keep up appearances, which might be necessary in view of her son's future, she had, when P\u00e8re Roque presented himself again, listened to him once more. But now she was free from debt. In short, there was left them an income of about ten thousand francs, of which two thousand three hundred belonged to him\u2014his entire patrimony.\n\n\"It isn't possible!\" exclaimed Frederick.\n\nShe nodded her head, as if to declare that it was perfectly possible.\n\nBut his uncle would leave him something?\n\nThat was by no means certain!\n\nAnd they took a turn around the garden without exchanging a word. At last she pressed him to her heart, and in a voice choked with rising tears:\n\n\"Ah! my poor boy! I have had to give up my dreams!\"\n\nHe seated himself on a bench in the shadow of the large acacia.\n\nHer advice was that he should become a clerk to M. Prouharam, solicitor, who would assign over his office to him; if he increased its value, he might sell it again and find a good practice.\n\nFrederick was no longer listening to her. He was gazing automatically across the hedge into the other garden opposite.\n\nA little girl of about twelve with red hair happened to be there all alone. She had made earrings for herself with the berries of the service-tree. Her bodice, made of grey linen-cloth, allowed her shoulders, slightly gilded by the sun, to be seen. Her short white petticoat was spotted with the stains made by sweets; and there was, so to speak, the grace of a young wild animal about her entire person, at the same time, nervous and thin. Apparently, the presence of a stranger astonished her, for she had stopped abruptly with her watering-pot in her hand darting glances at him with her large bright eyes, which were of a limpid greenish-blue colour.\n\n\"That is M. Roque's daughter,\" said Madame Moreau. \"He has just married his servant and legitimised the child that he had by her.\"\n\nFootnotes\n\n[2] Coules, bons vins; femmes, deignez sourire.\n\n[3] Toujours lui! lui partout! ou brulante ou glac\u00e9e, L'image de l'Arnoux.\n\n[4] Ah! j'ai l'y ri, j'ai l'y ri.
