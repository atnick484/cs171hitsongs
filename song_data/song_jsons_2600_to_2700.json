feel me? All ages and races\nReal sweet faces\nEvery different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican\nBlack, White, Cuban, and Asian\nI only came for two days of playing\nBut every time I come I always

the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with\nBut I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip\nLadies half-dressed, fully equipped\nAnd they be screamin' out, \"Will, we loved your last hit!\"\nSo I'm thinkin I'ma scoop me somethin hot\nIn this salsa-merengue melting pot\nHottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach\nTemperature get to ya, it's about to reach\nFive-hundred degrees in the Caribbean seas\nWith the hot mamis screaming \"\u00a1Ay, papi!\"\nEvery time I come to town, they be spottin' me\nIn the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me\nSo, cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show\nPound for pound, anywhere you go\nYo, ain't no city in the world like this\nAnd if you ask how I know, I got's to plead the fifth\nYou might also like[Hook]\nParty in the city where the

the atmosphere!\n(Put them up, put them up)\n(Put them up, put them up)\n(Put them up, put them up)\n[Verse 1]\nIt's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend\nThe one you let hit it and never called you again\n'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?\nYou act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim\nTo begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend\nLike you wasn't down and you called him again?\nPlus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him\nIf you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again\nTalking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian\nA Muslim, sleeping with the jinn\nNow that was the sin that did Jezebel in\nWho you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?\nShowing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend\nGirlfriend, let me break it down for you again\nYou know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine\nDon't be a hard rock when you really are a gem\nBaby girl, respect is just a minimum\nNiggas fucked up and you still defending 'em\nNow, Lauryn is only human\nDon't think I haven't been through the same predicament\nLet it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn\nIt's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in\nLook at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans\nFake nails done by Koreans\nCome again\n(A win win, come again\nA win win, come again)\nYou might also like[Hook]\nGuys, you know you'd better watch out\nSome girls, some girls are only about\nThat thing, that thing, that thing\nThat thing, that thing, that thing\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe second verse is dedicated to the men\nMore concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women\nHim and his men come in the club like hooligans\nDon't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)\nLet's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men\nCristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement\nThe pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men\nNeed to take care of they three or four kids\nAnd they face a court case when the child support late\nMoney taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men\nThe sneaky, silent men\nThe punk, domestic violence men\nQuick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men\nHow you gonna win when you ain't right within?\nHow you gonna win when you ain't right within?\nHow you gonna win when you ain't right within?\nUh-uh, come again (Yeah)\nHey, yo-yo, come again\nMy French men, come again\nMy sister, come again\n[Bridge]\nWatch out, watch out\nLook out, look out\nWatch out, watch out\nLook out, look out\nWatch out, watch out\nLook out, look out\nWatch out, watch out\nLook out, look out\n\n[Hook]\nGirls, you know you'd better watch out\nSome guys, some guys are only about\nThat thing, that thing,

the flow back in your ear\nThis ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission\nTo see if I can get your attention\nNow I wants to drop some information\nJust a little additive to your education\nI live my life by the code of the funk\n600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk\nWhen I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so\nThrow your hands up if you're down with the C-\nDouble O-L-I-O with the flow\nI'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know\nOne, two, three, it's like A, B, C\nIf hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free\nSlide, slide, but that's that past\nI got sumpin' brand new

some yak and do it all damn night\nMy name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world\nGet more bounce than a jheri curl\nToo many looky loos be lookin' for clues\nThere's a party goin' on, now what'cha gonna do, so\nGrab your partner, do-si-do\nNow if you don't know who it is, it's Coolio\nSlide, slide, but that's the past\nI got sumpin' brand new for that ass\n\n[Chorus]\nOne, two, three, four\nGet

co'ner on three like Dr. Dre\nComin' at 'em with a pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms\nI hope he don't trip 'cause I don't want to have to gat 'em\nSo move your body baby, drive the homies crazy\nThe way you shake that ass, it always amaze me\nAin't no party like a west coast party\n'Cause a west coast party don't stop\nSo when you see a young nigga in a Chevy hittin' switches\nThen you gotta give the nigga his props\nI got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean\nCoolio got the potion to get the party open\nSlide, slide, but that's the past\nI got sumpin' brand new for that ass\n\n[Chorus]\nOne, two, three, four\nGet your woman on the floor\nGotta\u2014gotta get up to get down\nGotta\u2014gotta get up to get down\nOne, two, three, four\nGet your woman on the

A jet-black vintage sports car sails down Sunset, cruising through the adult Disneyland that is nighttime Los Angeles. Neon and billboards reflected on the windshield.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Turn the music down, sir. ... Hey, cut the music.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckling) I'm sorry.\n\nMusic volume decreases.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: You know why I pulled you over?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, obviously, you felt the need to exercise your limited powers and punish me for ignoring the speed limit. It's okay. I understand. I-I like to punish peopl\u0435, too. Or at least I used to.\nPOLICE OFFICER: Licens\u0435 and registration.\n\nLUCIFER: (sighs) Coming right up.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Are you trying to bribe me, sir?\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, of course. Is that not enough? Take more. It's only money.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: It's against the law, sir.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) You people are funny about your laws, aren't you? You break the law sometimes, don't you?\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Sometimes... I put my siren on and drive really fast for no reason at all, just 'cause I can.\n\nLUCIFER: Right? And why wouldn't you? It's fun. It feels good to get away with something, doesn't it?\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Yeah.\n\nLUCIFER: Uh, it's okay, Officer. People like to tell me things, those deep, dark, naughty little desires that are on their mind. It's a gift. Must be something about this face. You're tempted to keep that, aren't you? Well, what are you waiting for, permission? Go on, take it, buy yourself something pretty. You deserve it. But if you don't mind, I really must be on my way.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Oh, yeah, of course. Hey, have a nice evening.\n\nLUCIFER: You, too, Officer. You, too.\n\nMusic volume increases. Lucifer pulls up in front of his bar, Lux.\nVALET PARKER: Hey, boss.\n\n\"Fame\" by David Bowie playing. Lucifer glides through... soaking up the sights and sounds of elegant debauchery like a proud, modern-day Gatsby. His eyes land on the exotic, dark-haired beauty tending bar over yonder. Mazikeen. She leans seductively with her back against the bar, doesn\u2019t turn around as Lucifer approaches...\n\nMAZE: Where have you been?\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, holed up in a ch\u00e2teau, copulating with a young woman named Faith. It's ironic, isn't it?\n\nMAZE: Thank you, Patrick. You can go.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) You little devil.\n\nMAZE: What? I dropped something.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I'm sure you did.\n\nMAZE: Now, Lucifer, I am a big fan of sex.\n\nLUCIFER: Obviously.\n\nMAZE: But I didn't leave Hell to be a bartender. Shouldn't you be spending your valuable time doing something more significant? (Lucifer scoffs.) You're the lord of Hell, for crying out loud.\n\nLUCIFER: I am retired, Maze. I've got nothing but time. Thank you.\n\nMusic plays in slow motion.\nMAZE: I think you have a visitor.\n\nLucifer sighs. Through the slow-motion crowd, Lucifer sees Amenadiel. The man is a study in grim intensity. He\u2019s Lucifer\u2019s brother and an angel. But Amenadiel\u2019s also a badass. Last thing he radiates is angelic goodness.\n\nLUCIFER: Amenadiel, how's it hanging, big guy? Huh?\n\nAMENADIEL: Your return to the Underworld has been requested.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, right, okay. Let me just, uh, check my calendar. Yeah, here it is. Uh, the seventh of never through to the 15th of ain't-gonna-happen. How does that work for you guys?\n\nAmenadiel just stares at him... grim, not amused.\n\nLUCIFER: (sighs) Look, remind Dad that I quit Hell because I was sick and tired of playing a part in his play.\n\nAMENADIEL: I'm gonna warn you against disrespecting our father, Lucifer.\n\nLUCIFER: Yeah, well, our father's been disrespecting me since the beginning of time, so pot-kettle, don't you think?\n\nAMENADIEL: You are a mockery of everything divine.\n\nLUCIFER: Thank you. Thank you, but lately I've been doing a fair amount of thinking. Now, do you think I'm the Devil because I'm inherently evil, just because dear old Dad decided I was?\n\nAMENADIEL: What exactly do you think happens when the Devil leaves Hell? (Lucifer scoffs.) All of those demons, all of those tormented and tortured souls, where do you think they go?\n\nLUCIFER: Don't know, don't care. Not my problem, brother. So consider the position officially open. And you, my feathered friend, can go to Hell. (In a blink, Amenadiel's wing-tip is at Lucifer's throat. Ancient steel fused at its tips. But Lucifer doesn't flinch, chuckles.) Yeah, try it. You think Father's upset now. (chuckles)\n\nAMENADIEL: You know, he will not be merciful for much longer.\n\nThreat planted, Amenadiel withdraws, and exits... and the club now slips back into regular motion. Lucifer only now deflates. Amenadiel clearly rattles him.\nLucifer stands outside, spinning a coin in his hand, still thinking about his conversation with Amenadiel... when a taxi slows to a stop in front of Lux. The rear window rolls down. A beautiful, hot mess appears. This is Delilah.\n\nDELILAH: Hey, you. Remember me?\n\nLUCIFER: (smiles... of course he does but teases...) You're famous, aren't you?\n\nGIRL: Delilah!\n\nLUCIFER: Delilah, isn't it?\n\nGIRL: I love you, Delilah!\n\nLUCIFER: Can I have your autograph?\n\nDELILAH: (chuckles) If I can have a drink.\n\nLux. Lucifer and Delilah sit at a booth.\n\nLUCIFER: So are you gonna tell me why you really came back?\n\nDELILAH: There's something I need to know.\n\nLUCIFER: And what's that?\n\nDELILAH: Did I... sell my soul to the Devil?\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) Well, that would imply the Devil's actually interested in your soul. Look, all I did was introduce you to a few key people who owed me favors, that's all.\n\nDELILAH: I mean, with all the good came a hell of a lot of bad.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, right, so the Devil made you do it, did he? The alcohol and the drugs, the topless selfies. The choices are on you, my dear. I mean, Jimmy Barnes? I can't believe you almost married that sweaty little imp.\n\nDELILAH: He produced my album. You introduced me to him.\n\nLUCIFER: I suggested you work with him, not sleep with him.\n\nDELILAH: Well, I got confused.\n\nLUCIFER: And then you left him at the altar.\n\nDELILAH: Yeah, that was rude of me.\n\nLUCIFER: No, actually, I quite enjoyed that bit. (both chuckle)\n\nDELILAH: You know, he trapped me in the bathroom at the Grammys, said he wanted to get back together. Then I hear he's marrying a supermodel... this weekend. And I'm jealous. Oh, God, I'm a mess.\n\nLUCIFER: God has nothing to do with your mess. Look... You didn't sell your soul, Delilah. You do owe me a favor.\n\nDELILAH: I'm scared.\n\nLUCIFER: You should be. Because what I'm about to ask you is gonna be quite difficult for you. Pull yourself together. That's it, that's all I'm asking. 'Cause you're wasting your talent, your life.\n\nDELILAH: Hmm?\n\nLUCIFER: You're human, darling. (chuckles)\nLucifer and Delilah walk out... saying goodbye...\n\nDELILAH: I'm gonna do as you asked. I'm gonna get it together. Promise, Lucifer.\n\nLUCIFER: Look, it's not about me. What happens now, that's up to you. Okay?\n\nDELILAH: Yeah.\n\nLUCIFER: Come here, you.\n\nTires squealing. Gunshots. A car accident.\n\nLUCIFER: (gasps) Oh, no, no, no, not yet.\n\nThe shooter in the car wreck gasps.\n\nLUCIFER: What did you do?\n\nSHOOTER: I'm sorry.\n\nLUCIFER: \"Sorry.\" Why did you end her life?\n\nSHOOTER: Why else? Money.\n\nLUCIFER: \"Money.\" Oh, it's times like this I wish I was still in Hell. All the fun activities I'd have planned for you.\n\nSHOOTER: Hey, man, I just pulled the trigger. (gasps, exhales weakly)\nSiren wails in distance. Helicopter whirring. \u0410 full-blown crime scene. Cherry tops spin. Police swarm. Coronor\u2019s put Delilah\u2019s body in a bag and into the back of their van as an unmarked cop car pulls up. Out hops LAPD homicide detective Chloe Decker. Beautiful, but downplays it on purpose. She\u2019s smart, cold and direct. Another plain-clothed detective walks up from the other direction. He\u2019s Daniel Espinoza.\n\nMAN: Want to hear what I've got so far?\n\nCHLOE: Lieutenant said this is my case.\n\nDAN: Yeah, Chloe, it is your case, but try not to take too much time. It's an easy one. That's our bad guy. Eddie Deacon, he's a low-level drug dealer. I found these in his pocket, and I found this in Delilah's purse, so obviously drug-related. She probably owed him a bunch of cash or something. She's not exactly selling out stadiums these days.\n\nCHLOE: How do you know he's low-level?\n\nDAN: Look at his car.\n\nCHLOE: Did you look at his watch? That thing ain't cheap.\n\nDAN: It's probably fake. Look... there's gonna be a lot of attention on this one, Chloe. I wouldn't pick at it too hard. Not after Palmetto Street.\n\nCHLOE: I asked for this case because of Palmetto Street, Dan. So, anyway, any witnesses?\n\nLUCIFER: Lucifer Morningstar.\n\nCHLOE: \"Lucifer Morningstar\"? Is that, uh, a stage name or something?\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) God-given, I'm afraid. You know, you look familiar. Have we met before?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah, five minutes ago. And I'm asking the questions. Talk to me about your relationship with the victim.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, she used to work here a few years back. I would occasionally accompany her while she sang. Then she became a big star and someone decided to end her life.\n\nCHLOE: Do you know the shooter?\n\nLUCIFER: No, but we did have an interesting little chat just before he kicked off. I asked him why he did it.\n\nCHLOE: Huh, like to play cop, do you?\n\nLUCIFER: (laughs) No, I just like to play in general, Detective. What about you?\n\nCHLOE: So, you had a conversation with a dead guy?\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead. His soul hadn't crossed the threshold.\n\nCHLOE: I see. Did he tell you why he did it?\n\nLUCIFER: Why, money, of course. You humans, you love your money, don't you?\n\nCHLOE: Yes. Yes, we do. And, uh, what planet are you from... London? (laughs)\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, he also said, \"I just pulled the trigger.\" Now, don't you think that's interesting?\n\nCHLOE: Delilah was shot to death by a drug dealer. And looks like Delilah herself kept the guy pretty busy. You know, it's sad, it's ugly, but it's not rocket science. Something probably went south between them. She gets riddled with bullets, and a nice little act of God takes him out.\n\nLUCIFER: You know, it doesn't work like that, Detective. It's quite a neatly wrapped little present for the LAPD, don't you think?\n\nCHLOE: Why don't you tell me something? How does she end up dying in a hailstorm of bullets, and you get away without a scratch? I think that's interesting. Don't you?\n\nLUCIFER: The benefits of immortality.\n\nCHLOE: \"Immortality.\" Mm, of course, uh, you spell that with one or two M's? I always forget.\n\nLUCIFER: What will your corrupt little organization do about this?\n\nCHLOE: Excuse me?\n\nLUCIFER: Will you find the person responsible? Will they be punished? Will this be a priority for you? Because it is for me.\n\nCHLOE: You got some balls on you, pal.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, thank you very much, but they're really quite average.\n\nCHLOE: I bet.\n\nLUCIFER: Now, are you sure that we haven't met? I could swear I've seen you naked. Have we had sex?\n\nCHLOE: We're done here.\n\nLUCIFER: Uh, Detective, wait! Someone out there needs to be punished. We're not done.\n\nCHLOE: Yeah. Yeah, we are.\n\nREVEREND: If there is anyone here that would oppose this holy union, speak now or forever hold your peace.\n\nLUCIFER: Excuse me. Yeah, I have a problem. Has-has anyone else noticed how incredibly, jaw-droppingly, loin-stirringly beautiful this young woman is and how short, sweaty and altogether fugly this homunculus is? I mean, what is this... a wedding or a kidnapping? Do you know what I mean? Yeah, good luck with that, Padre. Ooh, why you're at it, say hey for me. It's been a while. (chuckles) Jimmy Barnes! Remember me?\n\nJIMMY: Hey, man, this is a private event. How did you get in here?\n\nLUCIFER: Yeah, and quite a lavish one for a record producer on the outs. You do remember me, don't you?\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, yeah, I remember you. Now, what do you want? I'm a little busy.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I can't believe that you're getting married the day after your ex-fianc\u00e9e and once brightest star was murdered in cold blood.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, that's very sad. But you know what, she ruined my wedding once. I'm not about to let that happen again.\n\nLUCIFER: It's hard to be rejected, isn't it, Jimmy? Twice. (chuckles)\n\nJIMMY: What?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, you tried to get her back recently. I mean, I'd kill someone if they denied me once. Not that that's possible. So, come on, what do you say, Jimbo, huh? Did you want her dead?\n\nJIMMY: Look, stop looking at me that way, you freak. I am not playing that mind game with you. No, of course not! I was furious and I was humiliated when she dumped me, but I think, I-I think I've rebounded pretty well.\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, clearly. Respect.\n\nJIMMY: Should go play your mind games with 2Vile.\n\nLUCIFER: The rapper?\n\nJIMMY: Come on. Delilah dumped me for that lunatic. They were always fighting. He slapped her around a bunch. He surrounds himself with gun-toting morons 24-7. He is the real deal.\n\nLUCIFER: Right. (to the bride)Sorry, how rude. Allow me to introduce myself. Lucifer Morningstar.\n\nBRIDE: I really don't want to have sex with him tonight. (congregation gasping) Oh, my... I'm sorry, I... I can't believe I just said that.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, no, no, no. Let's be honest here. I mean, you're not marrying this human stain 'cause you're actually in love with him, right?\n\nBRIDE: God no.\n\nLUCIFER: No. Right. (claps) Well, I should get going. Ooh! Best of luck with you crazy kids, all right?\n\n\"Devil's Haircut\" by Beck playing. Doorbell rings.\n\nBUTLER: Good afternoon, sir.\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, I'm here to see the man sadly known as 2Vile... is he in?\n\nBUTLER: I'm sorry, sir. He's unavailable. He's in mourning, I'm afraid.\n\nLUCIFER: Right. I have narcotics for him.\n\nBUTLER: Right this way, sir.\n\nLucifer follows the Butler into the den. Furniture from MOMA. Killer city views. The ultimate in tacky Hollywood living.\n\nWOMAN: Here you go, baby.\n\nLUCIFER: Can someone please turn down this god-awful music! Hello, disc jockey! Thank you.\n\nTattooed hip-hop thug 2Vile appears through a thick haze of pot smoke.\n\n2VILE: Who's this clown?\n\nBUTLER: He has narcotics for you, sir.\n\nLUCIFER: My name is Lucifer Morningstar.\n\n2VILE: \"Lucifer Morningstar\"? (laughs) Now, that's a good hip-hop name.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, that offends me.\n\n2VILE: What, you don't like hip-hop?\n\nLUCIFER: No, I most certainly do not.\n\n2VILE: Well, that offends me. You have a problem with black people?\n\nLUCIFER: No, not in the slightest. I just hate your music. (laughs) And when I say \"your music,\" I mean your music. Not the music made by other black people. Without the blues, there'd be no devil's music whatsoever. There are, of course, many giants in the field. Just not you... am I being clear?\n\n2VILE: (chuckles) Yeah, you're being clear all right. Good. If you're looking to get yourself killed. (guns clicking)\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, well, don't waste your munitions... I'm immortal. Tell me about Delilah.\n\n2VILE: You ain't seen the news? Bitch is dead.\n\nThat ignites Lucifer. He violently shoves 2Vile, sending him shattering through a glass door, toppling over the balcony to certain death just as Lucifer grabs him by his blinged-out chains. Suspending him high above the hillside. Gunshots.\n\n2VILE: Don't shoot, you idiot! I didn't kill her.\n\nLUCIFER: Why should I believe you?\n\n2VILE: Because I loved the girl.\n\nLUCIFER: People sometimes kill people with whom they're in love. The heart's mysterious. So I'm told.\n\n2VILE: Ain't like that. Girl made me crazy!\n\nLUCIFER: Women can do that. Doesn't mean you should beat them up, does it?\n\n2VILE: We worked that out a long time ago. I hit her once 'cause I found out she was cheating on me.\n\nLUCIFER: All right. With whom?\n\n2VILE: I don't know. I don't know. She wouldn't tell me, all right? Said it was a big secret, some-some, uh, rich married guy.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, does she have a friend that she might've confided in?\n\n2VILE: She didn't trust no one, man. Uh, uh, her therapist. Her therapist is probably the only one who knows. She-she's some, uh, uh, Dr. Linda in-in Beverly Hills. Saw her, like, five times a week on the DL. Used a fake name, everything.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, did she now? Well, thank you for your time.\n\nCHLOE: LAPD! Guns down. On the floor, down! You two against the wall.\n\nLUCIFER: Detective, welcome to the party.\n\nCHLOE: Grab the bucket, collect the guns. Now!\n\nLUCIFER: You sly dog, you did listen to me.\n\nCHLOE: I ran the dead guy's cell phone. 2Vile was the last person he called.\n\n2VILE: Come on, man.\n\nCHLOE: What I find highly interesting is how you made the connection on your own.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I've been busy, my dear.\n\nCHLOE: Talk to me about Delilah.\n\nLUCIFER: We've been over that one, Detective.\n\nCHLOE: And why you called the shooter two days before she was murdered.\n\n2VILE: Fine. Yeah, I called Eddie 'cause he hooks me up sometimes. He met Delilah through me. Whatever. Don't make me a killer, do it?\n\nCHLOE: No, but it does make you a suspect.\n\n2VILE: What, so everyone on Eddie's phone's a suspect? Are you joking? You gonna drag half of Hollywood downtown. Be like the Oscars or something.\n\nMAN: Wait, aren't you that chick from that film?\n\nLUCIFER: Hmm, what's this? What film?\n\nMAN: You used to be an actress or something, right? Yeah. That teen movie... I forget what it's called.\n\nLUCIFER: Of course. Hot Tub High School. That's where I know you from.\n\nCHLOE: Let's just stick to my questions, shall we? So...\n\nLUCIFER: The one with the famous nude scene, coming out of the hot tub! It was, like, a complete Fast Times rip-off. She was, like, the new Phoebe Cates!\n\nCHLOE: Thanks, I appreciate that.\n\nLUCIFER: That was quite a nude scene.\n\nCHLOE: I have far too many bullets in this thing for you to still be talking. You, we need to have a conversation right now.\n\nLUCIFER: That's a waste of time, Detective. I've just threatened his life... he's not our guy. He would've said, trust me.\n\nCHLOE: You did what?\n\n2VILE: Yeah, isn't that illegal?\n\nCHLOE: Uh, little bit, yeah. You stay put. You, you're coming with me.\n\nLUCIFER: What? Ooh. (laughs) With pleasure. At least, perhaps now, you'll listen to me. Although, I'm not quite sure why I'm being arrested.\n\nCHLOE: Because you're interfering with a police investigation. You've broken I can't even count how many laws. And you pissed me off.\n\nLUCIFER: Right, I can get out of these, you know?\n\nCHLOE: Funny. How'd you do that?\n\nLUCIFER: (sighs) Come on, we're wasting time. We should be out there solving a homicide and punishing those responsible.\n\nCHLOE: \"We\"? You're insane. I'm taking you in. Get in the car.\n\nLUCIFER: No, that's boring. Not to mention pointless. Come on, I'll help you. It'll be fun.\n\nCHLOE: How could you possibly help me?\n\nLUCIFER: I have a certain skill set. I can be very persuasive with people and tend to see things that others cannot.\n\nCHLOE: So, you're psychic or something?\n\nLUCIFER: No, I can't read people's minds. I'm not a Jedi. People just like to tell me things.\n\nCHLOE: Hmm, just-just tell you things? Just confess their sins, just like that?\n\nLUCIFER: No, not their sins. I have no power over people's sins. I actually get a bad rap for that. I have the ability to draw out people's forbidden desires. The more simple the human, the easier it is. The more complex, the more challenging and exciting, really. But no, the actual sins, the sins are on you people.\n\nCHLOE: \"You people\"? I got it. I got it! The name? The whole Lucifer thing? And desire's, like, your superpower.\n\nLUCIFER: Mm, it's more like a gift from God really. Okay, look. Tell me, Detective, what do you desire more than anything else in this life?\n\nCHLOE: This is it? This is your big trick? (sighs) I guess, when I was a little girl, I... always wanted to be a cop like my daddy, so that... that one day I could help people and... and be taken seriously... ...when I say to shut up and get in the damn car.\n\nLUCIFER: You're not, like, a Jedi or something, are you?\n\nCHLOE: Get in the car.\n\nLUCIFER: No, no, no, no, no. Look. I know something you don't know.\n\nCHLOE: Really? What's that?\n\nLUCIFER: Won't say unless you take me with you on this. Please, come on. I got to 2Vile, didn't I?\n\nCHLOE: Why do you care about this so much? About Delilah?\n\nLUCIFER: Look, I just... I just do. Look, if I hadn't meddled with her career, maybe she wouldn't have died.\n\nCHLOE: Okay. Okay, fine... but if this little clue thing of yours doesn't pan out, these are going back on, and they're gonna stay on.\n\nLUCIFER: Is that a promise?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah, therapist in Beverly Hills with the first name Linda. See if Delilah was a client.\n\nLUCIFER: Ah-ah, actually, she had a pseudonym, which I also happen to know. I'm quite good at this, aren't I? Uh, Penny Lane.\n\nCHLOE: Okay. Delilah may have gone by Penny Lane. Thanks. Don't look so smug. Nothing's panned out yet.\n\nLUCIFER: No, no, no, it's not that. It's just that I knew that I recognized you.\n\nCHLOE: Right. Right, you've seen my boobies. It's exciting. What, are you 12?\n\nLUCIFER: So is the, uh... is the movie why you've got such a chip on your shoulder?\n\nCHLOE: Uh, it's low on the list of things I have to live down, I guess.\n\nLUCIFER: Right. Attractive female cop struggling to be taken seriously in a man's man's world... that it?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah, something like that.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, they're threatened. You're clearly smart and have notable instincts. Ignore them. Trust yourself.\n\nCell phone rings.\n\nCHLOE: Detective Decker. All right, text it to me. Thanks.\n\nLUCIFER: What's that?\n\nCHLOE: (sighs) What you were saying stands up. There's a Penny Lane who sees a Dr. Linda Martin in Beverly Hills.\n\nLUCIFER: Excellent. I'll clear my schedule. (cell phone rings) Ooh, someone's popular.\n\nCHLOE: Please stop talking. Hello. What? You're kidding me. Is she okay? Oh, of course, he's not there. Thanks. We got to make a pit stop.\n\nLUCIFER: What? No, absolutely not.\n\nCHLOE: My kid got into a fight. I got to pick her up.\n\nLUCIFER: What, can't she get herself home?\n\nCHLOE: She's seven.\n\nLUCIFER: Look, I'm not here to help you run errands. I'm here to help you solve a homicide.\n\nCHLOE: Really?\n\n(\"Sinister Kid\" by the Black Keys playing.)\n\nCHLOE: All right. Wait here.\n\nLUCIFER: With pleasure. Despise children.\n\nTRIXIE: I don't think you're allowed to smoke in here.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, dear, what will become of me?\n\nTRIXIE: My mother is a police officer. She could arrest you.\n\nLighter snaps shut.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, I think I might know your mother.\n\nTRIXIE: What's your name?\n\nLUCIFER: Lucifer.\n\nTRIXIE: (whispering) Like the Devil?\n\nLUCIFER: Exactly.\n\nTRIXIE: My name's Beatrice, but everybody calls me Trixie.\n\nLUCIFER: That's a hooker's name.\n\nTRIXIE: What's a hooker?\n\nLUCIFER: Ask your mother. So... why are you in trouble?\n\nTRIXIE: See that girl over there? She was bullying me. She created a fake Snapchat account and used it to make fun of me. So... I kicked her in the no-no-touch-touch square.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh. Oh, I see. Well played. Well played, indeed. (to the bully) Hello, mean girl. Did you know there's a special section of Hell reserved for bullies? So have fun.\n\nThe girl screams.\n\nCHLOE: What did you do?\n\nLUCIFER: Oh... I just think someone's feeling a little guilty.\n\nSchool bell rings.\n\nTRIXIE: Hi, Daddy.\n\nDAN: Hi, munchkin.\n\nCHLOE: Wow, shocker, you're late.\n\nDAN: Come on, give me a break. I'm putting a case to bed.\n\nCHLOE: Right, like I'm not working a case, too. Oh, yeah, the one you tried to steal from me.\n\nDAN: You mean the open and shut one. You did open and shut it, right?\n\nCHLOE: I'm being diligent, Dan. It's a high-profile case.\n\nDAN: Exactly, which is why you need to be smart about it.\n\nLUCIFER: She is smart. You're the dimwit. Perhaps you should refrain from arguing in front of the child. It's unbecoming.\n\nDAN: I don't know whether to laugh or to shoot you.\n\nLUCIFER: Surprise me.\n\nTRIXIE: Isn't he funny, Daddy?\n\nCHLOE: Hey, can you, uh, drop Trix at my mom's? We got to go. Thank you. Trixella, give Mommy a kiss. I love you so much. Good job standing up to the mean girl.\n\nTRIXIE: Thanks, Mommy. What's a hooker?\n\nCHLOE: Daddy will tell you.\n\nTRIXIE: Bye, Lucifer. It was nice meeting you.\n\nCHLOE: Hmm. Think she likes you.\n\nLUCIFER: Of course she does... what's not to like? Was your offspring planned or a mistake?\n\nCHLOE: Planned, sort of.\n\nLUCIFER: Really? 'Cause I've never understood the human desire to procreate.\n\nCHLOE: That's probably a good thing.\n\nLUCIFER: I mean, children are hideous little creatures, terrible, taxing burdens.\n\nCHLOE: Mmm. Mmm.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, um, yours is fine. I mean, you know, nothing to crow about, but nothing to be too embarrassed about, either, so that's quite good, isn't it?\n\nCHLOE: Are you at all aware of how dickish you sound?\n\nLUCIFER: No. Speaking of dicks... why was that ex-husband of yours pressuring you to close the case?\n\nCHLOE: No reason.\n\nLUCIFER: Strange.\n\nCHLOE: Yes, you are.\n\nLUCIFER: Did my father send you? (door opens)\n\nLINDA: Okay, Detectives, I'll see you now.\n\nCHLOE: Thank you.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh. \"Detectives.\"\n\nCHLOE: Dr. Martin, I'd like to ask you a few questions about Delilah.\n\nLUCIFER: You're thinking about it, aren't you?\n\nLINDA: What?\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, I wouldn't recommend it. I'm like walking heroin. Very habit-forming. It never ends well.\n\nLinda sighs.\n\nCHLOE: I'm sorry, do... do you two know each other? No, no, but I know that look.\n\nLINDA: I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nLUCIFER: That is interesting 'cause... you don't look at me that way.\n\nCHLOE: What way?\n\nLUCIFER: With carnal fascination.\n\nCHLOE: That's 'cause it doesn't exist.\n\nLUCIFER: No, you see, that's just it... with most women, it does. I tend to appeal to the dark, mischievous hearts in all of you, but you, Detective, you seem oddly immune to my charms.\n\nCHLOE: Referring to them as \"charms,\" I think, is a bit of a stretch. Truth be told, I find you repulsive. Like, on a chemical level.\n\nLUCIFER: That's fascinating. Now, tell me, Linda...\n\nLINDA: You say it's fascinating, and yet I can see that it disturbs you, doesn't it? Deeply.\n\nCHLOE: Dr. Martin, we know that, um, Delilah was having a clandestine affair with a wealthy married man, so if you just tell us his name, we will be on our way.\n\nLINDA: I'm sorry, I can't do that.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, she's one of the complex ones. Linda, darling, why don't you tell me? Hmm?\n\nLINDA: Well, I can't.\n\nLucifer chuckles.\n\nLINDA: I want to, but I can't. (laughs) Oh, you're the devil.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) Correct. Now, come on, Dr. Martin. I know you want to.\n\nLINDA: Oh, man, and it's really, really juicy, too.\n\nLUCIFER: Ooh, I bet it is.\n\nLINDA: No, I can't.\n\nCHLOE: What did you do to her? Did you roofie her?\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, no, it's not her fault. She's just reacting to me. Just watch and learn, okay? Right, the answer is yes, we can take a trip to pound town if we must, but first, you're gonna have to tell us, Linda, okay?\n\nLINDA: (moaning) Um... (chuckles) Okay... (chuckles) it's Grey Cooper.\n\nCHLOE: Grey Cooper? Seriously? That is juicy.\n\nLUCIFER: Grey Cooper, the actor? The one who's married to Amanda what's-her-chops?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah, yeah.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, no, he's horrible. So square-jawed, so handsome, so vanilla. Oh, I'm really quite disappointed in Delilah. That's truly terrible taste in the opposite sex.\n\nCHLOE: Thank you very much, Dr. Martin. We'll be in touch. All right, we got to go.\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, of course, but I... I made a deal, so I'm gonna have to hold up my end of the bargain. You wouldn't mind waiting outside?\n\nCHLOE: Are you seriously talking about having sex with her right now?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, it won't take long.\n\nLINDA: I do yoga. Hot... yoga. I'm freakishly flexible. Want to see? Wow! (chuckles) I really tried to keep that one in.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, you tried... that's what matters. Uh, look, I'm really sorry, but I'm gonna have to take a rain check. I will be back, okay?\n\nLINDA: I certainly hope so.\n\nLUCIFER: My word is my bond.\n\nLUCIFER: Excuse me! Excuse me. Ah, excuse me. Thank you.\n\nGUARD: Hey, hey, sir.\n\nTires squealing, gunfire.\n\nCREW MEMBER: Who the (bell rings) is this guy? What the hell are you doing?\n\nCHLOE: Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry, he's with me.\n\nLUCIFER: That's not Grey Cooper.\n\nCREW MEMBER: No, of course not. What the hell is this?\n\nCHLOE: We need to speak with Mr. Cooper.\n\nGREY: God, Delilah, yeah, heard about that this morning. I can't believe it. We did a movie together last year. Got pretty close.\n\nCHLOE: Lovers?\n\nGREY: Friends.\n\nLUCIFER: Friends who were lovers?\n\nCHLOE: Settle down. I'll handle the questions. Mr. Cooper, when did you last have contact with Delilah?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, actually, I just have one more question before you proceed with the boring ones. Tell me, Mr. Cooper, what do you want more than anything in this world? What's your deepest, darkest desire? You close your eyes, what do you see?\n\nGREY: I'm the president of the United States of America.\n\nLUCIFER: Ha! Well, who's the Devil now, eh?\n\nCHLOE: Those are some pretty big aspirations there, Mr. Cooper.\n\nGREY: (chuckles) Well, after the acting and stuff.\n\nCHLOE: No need to be embarrassed. Hell, if Arnold can do it, right? (chuckles) Now, you wouldn't want any nasty secrets screwing that up for you, though, would you?\n\nGREY: Is there a point to this?\n\nCHLOE: Mr. Cooper, were you having an affair with Delilah?\n\nAMANDA: Honey! Have you been getting my texts? I thought they were breaking you for lunch like a half hour ago. What's going on?\n\nGREY: These people are detectives.\n\nAMANDA: Real ones?\n\nCHLOE: We have some questions about Delilah.\n\nAMANDA: Oh. Oh. Yes, it's so sad.\n\nGREY: Yeah. Very sad.\n\nCHLOE: Your watch, where'd you get that?\n\nGREY: Oh, it's a prop.\n\nAMANDA: No, that's the one Delilah gave you, isn't it? For Time Will Tell?\n\nGREY: Right. That's the movie that we did. It was a wrap gift. (chuckles)\n\nCHLOE: Yeah. She buy a $10,000 watch for the whole crew?\n\nGREY: Uh, no. Just me, as far as I know. 'Cause we were, you know, costars and everything.\n\nLUCIFER: You know, you're gonna have to get much better at lying if you want to be president.\n\nGREY: I know, right?\n\nLUCIFER: So you were sleeping with her, then, yeah?\n\nGREY: Oh, yeah. (chuckles) (laughing) Crap. I just said that in front of people.\n\nAMANDA: Whatever. It's not like I didn't know. God, you are a terrible liar. And actor, by the way.\n\nGREY: You knew?\n\nAMANDA: Of course. Why else do you think I've been sleeping with Bobby?\n\nGREY: Are you serious?\n\nAMANDA: Oh, yeah. And it is good. Mmm. I climb that man like a tree. Right, Bobby?\n\nGREY: My bodyguard? What a clich\u00e9.\n\nAMANDA: Oh, I'm a clich\u00e9? Well, you're a dick.\n\nCHLOE: Oh, boy. Hey, guys... Come on! Hey, guys. Arrest them.\n\nAMANDA: Seriously? (grunting)\n\nCHLOE: One of them's got to be guilty.\n\nCHLOE: Thanks. (sighs) So, Grey and Amanda have zero connection to the shooter. (sighs) But the shooter had the same watch as Grey. That can't be a coincidence. Maybe Delilah gave him one, too, like kind of a go-to gift. I...\n\nLUCIFER: Well, that would imply she was actually sleeping with that maggot.\n\nCHLOE: Really? Jimmy, 2Vile, Grey Cooper. That's three other maggots she's sleeping with. I don't think there's a lot of discretion going on with her.\n\nLUCIFER: Yeah. I suppose you got a point.\n\nCHLOE: (chuckles softly) God, what am I doing here?\n\nLUCIFER: Wrong deity, but, yes, that is the eternal question.\n\nCHLOE: (chuckles) No. I mean here, in a bar, with you.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I don't know. You tell me, Detective. I mean, despite your proclaimed revulsion, you can't deny that there's a connection between us. Tell me, what do you actually want?\n\nCHLOE: You mean what do I desire more than anything else in this life?\n\nLUCIFER: Yes.\n\nCHLOE: Mm-hmm.\n\nLUCIFER: No tricks. Not that they work on you, you freak. (Chloe chuckles.) Seriously. I'm curious.\n\nCHLOE: I don't know. What-what I told you's true. I-I really do want to help people. My father was a cop. He was a great cop. My mother was an actress. Really cheesy one. (chuckles) I tried the acting thing. I took off my top. Wasn't really contributing to the betterment of society.\n\nLUCIFER: I disagree. I love that movie.\n\nCHLOE: (chuckles) So I quit. Decided to become a cop like my dad and, uh, dealt with the whole Hot Tub High School thing, until, um, I became a detective and found a whole new way to ostracize myself.\n\nLUCIFER: Ah, the... reason your ex-maggot was pressuring you to close this?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. There was a case, a shooting on Palmetto Street where a cop was shot, and I saw it differently than pretty much everyone in my department, including my ex. And I stuck my neck out, and it backfired. And, uh, now... (chuckles) no one wants to work with me.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I'm available.\n\nMAZE: Too bad your little prot\u00e9g\u00e9 isn't around to collect the check.\n\nREPORTER: The soundtrack album for the movie Time Will Tell has reached number 15 on the Billboard charts and is still climbing. Song and record sales...\n\nCHLOE: Oh, wow.\n\nLUCIFER: What?\n\nCHLOE: Delilah didn't give that watch to the drug dealer.\n\nJIMMY: Stop, stop, stop! (music stops) What is it? You got a gerbil in your throat? What's going on?\n\nLUCIFER: Hello, Jimmy.\n\nJIMMY: Really?\n\nLUCIFER: How's the album sales doing?\n\nJIMMY: What album?\n\nCHLOE: Soundtrack to Time Will Tell, which you produced. Whitney Houston hit the top ten for album sales after her death. Michael Jackson hit the stratosphere. Not sure you'll achieve such heights having Delilah killed, but that sure is a boatload of royalty checks headed your way. Guess you really needed the cash, huh? Which is why you had to pay the shooter with your watch.\n\nLUCIFER: The watch Delilah gave you. Now, that's just sick. But then you are, so...\n\nGun clicks.\n\nCHLOE: Hey, Jimmy?\n\nJIMMY: I made her, and she ruined me. She humiliated me. She owes me.\n\nLUCIFER: You're not God, Jimmy. You didn't make her. But you did destroy her. So I'm gonna punish you.\n\nJIMMY: You back off, you freak. I mean it. I am not going to jail for that bitch. No chance.\n\nCHLOE: Listen to him, Lucifer. Back off.\n\nLUCIFER: I told you, it's fine. I'm immortal. Why did you do that?\n\nCHLOE: He was gonna kill you.\n\nLUCIFER: No, no, no, no, no, no. You just... you just let him off too easy. He needs to pay! He needs to suffer! He needs to feel the pain, not escape it!\n\nCHLOE: Don't worry. I'm sure where he's going, the pain's coming.\n\nLUCIFER: No. No, it's not, actually. And you know why? Because I'm here and he's...\n\nGunshots. Chloe gasps.\n\nLUCIFER: Chloe... (gasping)\n\nCHLOE: (weakly) I don't want to die.\n\nLUCIFER: I won't let you. Your father will just have to wait for you. (gunshots) (groaning) Just... give me one second. (gunshots)\n\nJIMMY: (grunts) No, please! No, no, please! Please. Please don't kill me.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, Jimmy. You're gonna wish that's all I did to you.\n\nScreaming.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, look who's back.\n\nCHLOE: (groans) How long have I been out?\n\nLUCIFER: (sighs) Three years.\n\nCHLOE: What? (Lucifer chuckling) You're such an ass.\n\nLUCIFER: Thank you.\n\nCHLOE: Oh, God. He was firing at you. Why aren't you... more dead?\n\nLUCIFER: You're having a very hard time with the immortal thing, aren't you?\n\nCHLOE: (sighs) What happened with Jimmy?\n\nLUCIFER: Jimmy? Jimmy got what he deserved.\n\nCHLOE: Hmm? Well, I'm pretty sure I'd be dead if you hadn't helped me, so... thank you.\n\nLUCIFER: Sorry, what was that? That last bit. I didn't quite get that.\n\nCHLOE: Thank you.\n\nLUCIFER: You're welcome. And, besides, you know, you're far too interesting to let die.\n\nCHLOE: You saved my life because I'm interesting?\n\nLUCIFER: Wildly irritating as well, but yes.\n\nCHLOE: (chuckles softly) So what now?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I mean, I've obviously proven myself to be an invaluable crime-fighting tool. You're a pariah in the department. I think this could be the start of a beautiful friendship. Don't you?\n\nCHLOE: Who the hell are you?\n\nLUCIFER: I told you, I'm...\n\nTRIXIE: Lucifer!\n\nLUCIFER: Uh, yes. Hello, child. Um, just... Why don't you save some of this unpleasantness for your mother, yeah? (Chloe groans) Ooh. Sorry. Oh. God.\n\nTRIXIE: Are you hurt?\n\nCHLOE: I'm okay.\n\nLUCIFER: Right. Well, I'd stay for the family reunion, but it's giving me terrible IBS. So, look forward to seeing you soon, Chloe.\n\nCHLOE: I don't.\n\nLUCIFER: Bye, now. Glad you're not dead.\n\nLUCIFER: (groans) Bloody hell. What do you want from me?\n\nAMENADIEL: I've been watching you, Lucifer.\n\nLUCIFER: You perv.\n\nAMENADIEL: And I'm not sure I like what I see. You're showing restraint, mercy.\n\nLUCIFER: You scared I'm turning my back on the dark side, bro?\n\nAMENADIEL: Lucifer, there is a balance here that we must maintain. I strongly suggest you do what I told you to do and go back to Hell.\n\nLUCIFER: Don't threaten me, Amenadiel. I mean, you don't want to start a war.\n\nAMENADIEL: I would love a war. (Lucifer chuckling) Oh, Luci. My hatred for you grows stronger with every visit.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I wouldn't have it any other way, pal. I look forward to eating your heart one day. Peace. (wings flapping) Ugh.\n\nLUCIFER: I sense your disapproval, Maze. What is it?\n\nMAZE: I just can't understand why you would save a human life.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, there's... something different about her that I don't quite understand, and it vexes me.\n\nMAZE: Maybe it's not her that's different.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) Is this where I'm supposed to ask, \"Whatever do you mean?\"\n\nMAZE: I'm worried the humans are rubbing off on you. Stop caring. You're the Devil.\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, I am.\n\nLUCIFER: Okay. Right. Uh... Here's the deal. We can have as much naked cuddle time as you desire, but... you're gonna have to listen to me, too. There's a few things that I'd like to discuss with you. You know, just a... an existential dilemma or two. Deal?\n\nLINDA: Yes.\n\nLUCIFER: Lovely.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/29051", "artist_names": "LL Cool J (Ft.

man can need\nAnd ever ask for\nThis is love, girl\nThis is more than a crush\nYeah\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nIt was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw ya with your man\nSmilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand\nI was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back\nWe caught eyes for a moment, and that was that\nSo I skated off, as you strolled off\nLookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)\nI gotta take ya from your man that's my mission\nIf his love is real he got ta handle competition\nYou only knew him five months (That's right)\nBesides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts\nAnd I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you\nLooking at my own eyes in the rear view\nCatchin flash backs of our eye contact\nWish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back\nI would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears\nI can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years\nHey lover\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nI see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday\nYour man must think its safe for you to travel that way\nBut I don't want to violate your relationship\nSo I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip\nStill, he can't stop me from having daydreams\nTonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream\nKissing on your thighs under moonlight\nSearchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night\nI wonder one day could it be, simple dreams could turn into reality\nOur love would come down so naturally\nWe would walk down the aisle of destiny\nWhat your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared\nBreak ya off a little chump change to do your hair\nThat seems to be enough to satisfy your needs\nBut there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead\nHey lover\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nYou might also like[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nLast week I saw ya at the mall\nStandin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call\nI had a vision it was me on the other end\nTellin' you come by and then you walked in\nI touched you gently with my hands\nWe talked about travelin' the distant lands\nEscapin' all the madness out here in the world\nBecomin' my wife, no longer my girl\nThen, you let your dress fall down to the floor\nI kissed you softly and you yearned for more\nWe experienced pleasure unparalleled\nInto an ocean of love, we both fell\nSwimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss\nFantasies interchangin' with each kiss\nUndyin' passion unites our souls\nTogether we swim until the point of no control, but\nIt's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true\nWe never even spoke and your man swear he love you\nSo I'm a keep all these feelin's inside\nKeep my dreams alive until the right time\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than...\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nLover, hey lover, baby this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/859388", "artist_names": "Annie Lennox", "full_title": "No More \"I

hope you look at me through patient eyes\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've become amused\nI've become blind\nI've become what I know not breathes\nYou seem illiterate to all my emotions\nI stand corrected, how well you read\nYou speak the truth, you speak to me\nYou feel the love I have yet to find\nI know it's there, I know it's there\nBut I let the sandcastles kill my mind\nPathetic me, I long to be you\nI think I'm close but I stand so far\nThe turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear\nI miss the love only cause they starve\nOil and water, lust and sympathy\nI life and death my way through the sun\nWhere originates all the pain that leaves\nMy memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWell define my love with attitude\nOpen up your mind and it will sing to you\nYou can always tell\nBut I know remorse so well\nI left reality early due to the lack of love, reason\n\n[Chorus]\nWhatever it is I do\nI try to think about you\nI have a love for you that nothing hides\nWhatever it is I do\nI'm only thinking of you\nI hope you look at me through patient eyes\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe channel, a professional liar\nHow I long to contradict those vibes\nJoni help me, I think I'm falling\nIt's not the love and I quest the why\nI don't know, If I'm right, I'm right\nBut if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong\nThe fear of pity is always awake\nBut infinite sympathy's completely gone\nIt's the windows, the doors\nThe passageways to the truth\nOh my God, it echoes the mind\nIn total recall as wild as the deuce\nAnd so deceiving is the clouded heart\nSo superficial is the open wound\nI caress the infinite light\nThat even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nWell, define my love, that lives within you\nEven when I die, it will sing to you\nYou can only tell if remorse has done you well\nThe misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWhatever it is I do\nI try to think about you\nI seek the sympathy and I can't lie\nWhatever it is I do\nI'm only thinkin' of you\nI hope you look at me through patient eyes\nWhatever it is I do\nI try to think about you\nI seek the sympathy and I can't lie\nWhatever it is I do\nI'm only thinkin' of you\nI hope you look at me through patient eyes\nWhatever it is I do\nI try to think about you\nI seek the sympathy and I can't lie\nWhatever it is I do\nI'm only thinkin' of you\nI hope you look at me through patient eyesEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3318150", "artist_names": "Ja\u00ebl Tanalepy", "full_title": "She Won't

more\nBefore they really learn about life's score\nThe subject is not to be ignored (Kick it to 'em, Joe)\n[Pre-Chorus: Joe Sayles]\nI don't wanna be the one\nTo tell you how it's gotta be\nLivin' is

kid, he turns out bold\nIt may be from the way you treat him cold\nI guess that's how the story's told (Tell 'em what it is)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Joe]\nI don't wanna be the one\nTo tell you how it's gotta

quite contrary\nYo', how did you earn your dough\nYou didn't finish school, you ain't got no job\nBut to the human eye it's pretty simple\nYou're always talkin' about what you want is respect\nBut never thinkin' about the little boy you neglect\nSpendin' his formative years in a livin' hell\nNot realizin' one day he'd end up in jail\n\nNow on the other hand\nThere's Dan my man\nWho planned a

"lyrics": "O.P.P. Lyrics[Intro: Treach]\nArm me with harmony\nDave, drop a load on 'em\n\n[Verse 1: Treach]\nO.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it\nTo have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it\nO is for \"other,\" P is for \"people,\" scratch your temple\nThe last P, well, that's not that simple, huh\nIt's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten\nIt's five little letters that are missing here\nYou get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming\nIt seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it\nYou ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?\nYou get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow\nYou get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about\nThen you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?\nIt's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T\nIt's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)\nIt's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it\nThere's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it\nHow many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?\nWho think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?\nWell, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it\nBut if you don't, here's your membership\n[Chorus]\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nWho's down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nWho's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)\n\n[Verse 2: Treach]\nWell, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted\nThe first two letters the same, but the last is something different\nIt's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest\nIt's another five-letter word rhyming with \"cleanest\" or \"meanest\"\nI won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly\nI'll say the last P, hmm, stands for \"property\"\nNow lady, here comes a kiss\nBlow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly\nHave you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?\nAnd you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?\nYou looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away\nHe had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway\nYou couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care\n'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there\nWhen y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know\nAnd y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door\nNow don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high\nSay O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride\nNow when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts\nYou're now down with a discount\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nWho's down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nWho's down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies)\n\n[Verse 3: Treach]\nA scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that\nMatter fact, her and my girl was partners that\nHad a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument\nShe tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it\nThat wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling\n'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings\nI said, \"Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave\"\nShe said, \"Oh no, I love you, Treach,\" I said, \"Now, child, please\nYou gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go\"\nI said, \"Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window\nThis was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart\n'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start\"\nCome on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about\nWhen you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth\nThat's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment\nYou keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him\nExciting, isn't it? A special kinda business\nMany of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with\nHim or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it\nWhen O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it\n[Chorus]\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nWho's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nYou down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)\nWho's down with O.P.P.?

foreign shore\nTo find his country didn't want him back\nTheir bullets took his best friends in Saigon\nOur lawyers took his wife, his kids, no regrets\nIn a time I don't remember\nIn a war he can't

doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[Verse 1: Suzanne Vega]\nI am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner\nI am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee\nAnd he fills it only halfway and before I even argue\nHe is looking out the window at somebody coming in\n\n[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n\n[Verse 2: Suzanne Vega]\n\"It is always nice to see you,\" says the man behind the counter\nTo the woman who has come in, she is shaking her umbrella\nAnd I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos\nAnd I'm pretending not to see them and instead I pour the milk\n\n[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n\n[Verse 3: Suzanne Vega]\nI open up the paper, there's a story of an actor\nWho had died while he was drinking, it was no one I had heard of\nAnd I'm turning to the horoscope and looking for the funnies\nWhen I'm feeling someone watching me and so I raise my head\nYou might also like[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo,

the outside looking inside, does she see me?\nNo, she does not really see me 'cause she sees her own reflection\nAnd I'm trying not to notice that she's hitching up her skirt\nAnd while she's straightening her stockings, her hair has gotten wet\n\n[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n\n[Verse 5: Suzanne Vega]\nOh, this rain, it will continue through the morning as I'm listening\nTo the bells of the cathedral\nI am thinking of your voice\n[Chorus: Suzanne Vega]\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-dooEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 33,

stop, collaborate and listen\nIce is back with the brand new invention\nSomething grabs a hold of me tightly\nFlow like a harpoon daily and nightly\n\"Will it ever stop?\" Yo, I don't know\nTurn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow\nTo the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal\nLight up a stage and wax a chump like a candle\nDance, rush the speaker that booms\nI'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom\nDeadly when I play a dope melody\nAnything less than the best is a felony\nLove it or leave it, you better gangway\nYou better hit the bullseye, the kid don't play\nAnd if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\n[Chorus]\nIce, ice, baby\nVanilla Ice, ice, baby\nVanilla Ice, ice, baby\nVanilla Ice, ice, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow that the party is jumpin'\nWith the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'\nQuick to the point, to the point, no fakin'\nCookin' MCs like a pound of bacon\nBurnin' 'em if you're not quick and nimble\nI go crazy when I hear a cymbal\nAnd a hi-hat with a souped up tempo\nI'm on a roll, it's time to go solo\nRollin' in my 5.0\nWith the ragtop down so my hair can blow\nThe girlies on standby, wavin' just to say hi\n\u201cDid you stop?\u201d No, I just drove by\nKept on, pursuin' to the next stop\nI busted a left and I'm headin' to the next stop\nThe block was dead, yo, so I continued to\nA1A Beachfront Avenue\nGirls were hot wearing less than bikinis\nRockman lovers driving Lamborghinis\nJealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine\nShay with a gauge and Vanilla with a 9\nReady for the chumps on the wall\nThe chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball\nGunshots raged out like a bell\nI grabbed my 9, all I heard were shells\nFalling on the concrete real fast\nJumped in my car, slammed on the gas\nBumper to bumper, the avenue's packed\nI'm trying to get away before the jackers jack\nPolice on the scene, you know what I mean?\nThey passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends\nIf there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIce, ice, baby\nVanilla Ice, ice, baby\nVanilla Ice, ice, baby\nIce, ice, baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nTake heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet\nMiami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it\nMy town that created all the bass sound\nEnough to shake and kick holes in the ground\n'Cause my style's like a chemical spill\nFeasible rhymes that you can vision and feel\nConducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept\nWe make it hype and you want to step\nWith this.  Shay plays on the fade\nSlice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade\nSo fast, other DJs say, \u201cDamn!\u201d\nIf rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram\nKeep my composure when it's time to get loose\nMagnetized by the mic while I kick my juice\nIf there was a problem yo I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while my DJ revolves it\n[Chorus]\nIce ice, baby\nVanilla Ice, ice, baby\nVanilla Ice, ice, baby\nIce ice, baby\nVanilla Ice\n[Outro]\nYo man, let's get out of here\nWord to your mother\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)\nIce, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)\nIce53Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/859745", "artist_names": "Concrete

dinner in a fancy restaurant\nBut nothing, I said, nothing can take away these blues\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause nothing compares\nNothing compares to you\n[Verse 2]\nIt's been so lonely without you here\nLike a bird without a song\nNothing can stop these lonely tears from falling\nTell me, baby, where did I go wrong?\nI could put my arms around every boy I see\nBut they'd only remind me of you\nI went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me\nHe said, \"Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,\" but he's a fool\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause nothing compares\nNothing compares to you\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Bridge]\nAll the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard\nAll died when you went away\nI know that living with you, baby, was

true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone\nShe said you found someone\nAnd I thought of all the bad luck\nAnd the struggles we went through\nAnd how I lost me\nAnd you lost you\nWhat are these voices outside love's open door\nMake us throw off our contentment\nAnd beg for something more?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I'm learning to live without you now\nBut I miss you sometimes\nThe more I know, the less I understand\nAll the things I thought I knew\nI'm learning again\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI've been tryin' to get down\nTo the heart of the matter\nBut my will gets weak\nAnd my thoughts seem to scatter\nBut I think it's about\nForgiveness, forgiveness\nEven if, even if\nYou don't love me anymore\n\n[Verse 2]\nAh, these times are so uncertain\nThere's a yearning undefined\nAnd people filled with rage\nWe all need a little tenderness\nHow can love survive\nIn such a graceless age?\nAh, the trust and self-assurance\nThat lead to happiness\nThey're the very things\nWe kill, I guess\nOh, pride and competition\nCannot fill these empty arms\nAnd the work I put between us\nYou know it doesn't keep me warm\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm learning to live without you now\nBut I miss you, baby\nAnd the more I know, the less I understand\nAll the things I thought I figured out\nI have to learn again\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been tryin' to get down\nTo the heart of the matter\nBut everything changes\nAnd my friends seem to scatter\nBut I think it's about\nForgiveness, forgiveness\nEven if, even if\nYou don't love me anymore\n\n[Bridge]\nThere are people in your life\nWho've come and gone\nThey let you down\nYou know they hurt your pride\nYou better put it all behind you, baby\nCause life goes on\nYou keep carryin' that anger\nIt'll eat you up inside, baby\n[Chorus]\nI've been tryin' to get down\nTo the heart of the matter\nBut my will gets weak\nAnd my thoughts seem to scatter\nBut I think it's about\nForgiveness, forgiveness\nEven if, even if\nYou don't love me\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been tryin' to get down\nTo the heart of the matter\nBecause the flesh will get weak\nAnd the ashes will scatter\nSo I'm thinkin' about\nForgiveness, forgiveness\nEven if, even if\nYou don't love me\n\n[Outro]\nForgiveness (Yeah)\nForgiveness (Baby)\nForgiveness (Oh, oh)\nForgiveness (Ah, yeah)\nForgiveness (Oh)\nForgiveness\nEven if\nYou don't love me anymore\nForgiveness

step I take, you will be there\nEvery little step I make, we'll be together\n\n[Verse 1]\nI can't sleep at night, I toss and turn\nListening for the telephone\nBut when I get your call, I'm all choked up\nCan't believe you called my home\nAnd as a matter of fact, it blows my mind\nYou would even talk to me\nBecause a girl like you is like a dream come true\nA real life fantasy\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nNo matter what your friends try to tell you\nWe were made to fall in love\nAnd we will be together, any kind of weather\nIt's like that, it's like that girl\nYou might also like[Hook]\nEvery little step I take, you will be there\nEvery little step I make, we'll be together\nEvery little step I take, you will be there\nEvery little step I make, we'll be together\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody wants to know what's going down\nNot with the James, not the Jim, but the Bobby Brown\nNow I'm chilling much harder as you all know\nCause Bobby Brown was good to good to good to go solo\nBeen on the microphone a long long time\nI'm guaranteed to bust a stupid rhyme\nNow I'm on the mic and I'm rocking real fresher\nEverybody out there don't talk less about me\nCause I'm rocking it steady\nAnd when I'm on the mic, don't you dare call me Freddy\nCause I'm ready to really get paid\nAnd if anybody steps in my way they getting slayed\nMy name is Brown, that's what they call me\nYes, I drive a 560 SEC\nAnd when I'm on the mic, you gotta see me\nDriving down the block cause I'm blocking and locking\nWhen the sucker M.C.'s trying to drop my spot\nWhen I'm rocking on the microphone\nPeople gotta gotta gotta gotta leave me alone\nCause I really don't care, really don't give a damn\nMy name is Bobby, and not Uncle Sam!\n[Bridge]\nShaba dootin ba\nShaba dootin bop shoo ba\nShaba dootin ba\nShaba dootin bop shoo ba\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nNo matter what your friends try to tell you\nWe were made to fall in love\nWe will always be together, any kind of weather\nIt's like that, it's like that girl!\n\n[Hook]\nEvery little step I take, you will be there (yeah yeah)\nEvery little step I make, we'll be together\nEvery little step I take, you will be there (you'll be, you'll be there)\nEvery little step I make, we will be together12Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5541941", "artist_names": "Watsky", "full_title": "COVID Relief Freestyle by\u00a0Watsky",

my\u2005part\u2005is\nI hear my\u2005own voice\nI make my own choice\nI\u2005guess, we're fuckin' doing it\nThe horse is out the gates\nIt's\u205ftime\u205fto\u205fstart the race\nShoutout\u205fto Kathy Bates\u205fand also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld\nOr maybe it's more like Larry David\nBecause you know we're not playing\nShoutout to the Jews, the chosen people\nYou know that you cannot fuckin' lose\nBut also, shoutout to the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I don't care that I got seizures\nI got my fuckin' pills\nI'm gonna take 'em right around midnight\nSo I can get right\nI think that's what I gotta do\nShout out to the medical commun-\nItty I just get gritty\nI hope my rhymes are not shitty\nUmm, mic check are you with me?\nShout-out Bobby and Whitney\nBut not shout out to the bad things he did\nI don't know if I'm gonna have a kid\nI don't know if I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to drop it hot for you\n'Cause this is why I'm hot\nThis is why I'm not\nShoutout to Mims\nShoutout to Hims\nThat's that brand of underwear\nThat I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway\nI'm drivin' down the one way\nI'm cruisin' up the runway\nSpreading my wings\nLike I am a Cessna\nLike I am a chestnut\nRoastin' on an open fire, bing!\nCrosby, you got me\nMe, hot see?\nMe Watsky\nSee?\nSittin' in the hot seat\nNo, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat\nBut that word, beats droppin' me\nAnd meha coppin'\nShoutout to Frank Macoppin\nPlayground\nIn the fuckin' San Francisco SFC\nBecause you know how this go\nWe are the best in Dolores Park\nWe have a chorus singin' in the dark\nHark, the angel\nShoutout to Chuck Rangel\nRangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but\nIn December maybe I will be dismembered\nBy a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa\nComin' down my chimney\nWavin' fuckin' butcher knives\nThat\u2019d be fucking crazy\nWho is he\nWho is this robotic crazy Santa\nOh my \u2018lanta\nI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the ground\nMy fuckin' whole brood around me\nAnd I got my whole butt out\nHe's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away\nCut-out\nCut it out like on Full House\nJohn Stamos\nJohn Stains-Most in his pants\nBut that's okay\nWe don't judge people who like to dance away the day\nIf they need a Pepto-Bismol\nMy throat is not abysmal\nThis all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt\nI will not repent\nAnd I\u2019m not demented\nBut I meant it\nWhen I sent it\nFrom my brain\nI'm not plain\nIm not fuckin' around\nI\u2019m not cluckin' the ground\nJust right there it\u2019s only two feet\nThat\u2019s pretty cool man I eat\nFrom that cup right there\nThe one that\u2019s floatin' up in the air\nIt\u2019s got a fuckin' strawber-\n-ry smoothie\nI flow very smoothly\nBut you cannot do me\nDo me, do me like that\nI got that roomie type rap\nIt\u2019s mad philosophical\nI just keep on droppin' all\nOf the marbles in my brain\nThey\u2019re comin' out my nose\nAnd then they just remain\nOn the ground\nEven the cat\u2019s eye\nThat is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by\nDid you know at places\nPeople on the internet watch marble races\nI watched one\nIt was mad fun\nI picked the fuckin' blue marble\nAnd my pick wasn't all garbled\nIt came down the shoot\nIt was going all fuckin' cool\nAnd then it fuckin scooted past the red one\nThat kid from The Shining like Red-Rum\nMeaning murder\nWorder\nWordier\nAll my flows are so dirtier\nThan you could even fuckin' guess\nI'm not even fucking stressed\nI'm so damn relaxy\nShout out to a Maxi-Pad\nFor being so absorbent\nThat's a good fuckin' fuction\nMy girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it\nPut her hands in the air\nMaxi Pads doing what they do down there\nIf you are shaved or if you've got hair\nIt doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare\nDo what you wanna\nWord to your mama\nYour dude can't tell you what you gotta do\nGotta do what you wanna\nMake your own choice\nWith your body or your voice\nIf you are moist\nI know some people don't like that word\nPalabra\nBut you know you gotta like what you like\nThere was this one time this dude named Ike\nRan to be Prez\nAnd he fuckin' won\nEisenhower, that's what I said\nI's a power-rapper\nYes I am\nSo fuckin' dapper\nThe clapper\nDoesn't work on the lights on this green screen\nMan, that would be a dream scene\nIf I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want\nWhat I want, damn\nThat would be no scam\nI don't eat no Spam\nThat's 'cause I am a soft boy\nAnd I only eat Bok-Choy\n'Cause I'm a little veggie human\nAnd that's what I be doin'\nLet me clarify\nLike clarified butter\nAgain, word to your mother\nAnd also not to digress\nBut I gotta get it off of my chest\nWord to Mark Wahlberg\nWord to ballers\nWait, okay, let me make my main point\nAs I rap over this joint\nAnd that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy\nI also eat soy\nI also as a Jewish type dude not a goy\nGet lots of joy out of eatin' carrots\nOut of eatin' broccoli\nOut of eatin' lots of trees\nOut of smokin' lots of trees\nThat is true\nThat is not\nI don't smoke a lot\nBut I do when I party\nBut during COVID, I party hardly\nAnd I guess that's kinda sad\nBut I've had some calls with my dad\nPaul Watsky\nAnd Claire Watsky\nIt's rare, stop me\nIt's not, lots of Sundays\nI call my parentals\nAnd I just steal out my fuckin' mentals\nBut I don't pull out my dentals\nI go sometimes I do in a dream\nWhen I am on the scene\nAnd the ghost come and make me scream\nIt's like you are doing the most\nAnd I gotta fuckin' boast\nShout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast\nThat is some shit if you take a gander\nThat was said by Mr. Ned Flanders\nMr. Homer Simpson\nI'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on\nThey're like \u201cWatsky, I'll do everything for you\nI'll white knight for you and your fucking crew\u201d\nI'm like \u201cDude, don't be a simp\nActually, DO be a simp\nYou could be pimp\nYou could be wimp\nYou could fucking walk with a limp\nYou can have a crimp in your dimp-le\u201d\nI just get the whole tent pole\nUp in the sky cause I meant\nLots of people can come in\nCause I got a big tent\nSo if you are a lame\nFucking get bent\nAnd by lame, what I mean in this game\nIs the type of person who says that you're lame\nIs the type of person who judges\nIs the type of person who never budges\nWhen they get stubborn\nCause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard\n[?] 00:18:04\nWord!\nI think I got this whole thing turn-ed up\nBut that is bound to happen\n34 hours when you keep on rappin'\nSome words are going to collide like trains\nComing head to head, but it remains\nTo be seen that I get back on the track\nWith the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*\nWith my fucking clapping gums\nSo don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb\nSometimes\nCause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes\nBut it happens and I think that is the lesson\nThat you cannot achieve perfection\nAnd it's not even a worthy goal\nYou just gotta try to put that ball in the hole\nMore times than not\nThis is why I'm hot, as I said\nBut, you know Man's Not Hot?\nAlthough the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am\n'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham\nOn the microphone-o oh no\nCan't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno\nIce skatin' all over the beat\nMakin' it repeat\nI do not want to beat my meat, on the camera\nThat would be a bad fuckin' PR move\nWhen I'm all up in the groove with my meat out\nThey would be like \"oh, shout out\nThat will ruin my career\nIs that fuckin' clear?\nShowin' his whole rear?\nHe got fuckin' nakey\nMake me, take me\nYou cannot bake me\nIn my EZ bake oven\nNo Sara Lee\nI just keep on flowing, so merrily\nVerily, forsooth, did he do that shit\nOh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it\nHe's just Frank Coppin it\nAnd there is no halting' it\nI just put some fuckin malt in it\nMake it like some Yoo-hoo\nYoo-hoo!\nDid you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed\n[00:20:00]\n'Cause you could not rhyme\nLike I do, do the crime and you know that I'm\nJust puttin' lime on top of this shit\nAnd that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me\n'Cause you know when I put it on top\nThat I am going to make it drop\nTo the bottom of the urinal\nYou're all in my brain\nAnd I'm hearing y'all\nBut I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments\nI be too scared to see the tools\nBut I got to just remain bold\nAnd I've got to stay in the hold\nMy whole nuts life, oh, my nuts\nRemember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?\nRemember jungle?\n[00:20:41]\n\n[00:30:00]\nThey got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate\nVerbally, vocally, stoking the fire\nOf the couress I retired\nI feel one year\n'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear\nSee how I could sing, that took many years\nBefore I try to do with the din\nAnd now I only rapped\nAnd now I only try to cap, no cap\nI just try to get that back\nThat back, uh, back\nAnd I'm gone\nOver the fence\nNo shout out to my pens\n\nYou know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda\n\n[00:40:00]\nI'm sittin' on the veranda\nJust sippin' on my water\nLookin' at my ink blotter\nFeelin' like the best\nStarin' at my Rorschach test\nAnd it's tellin' me some dark crap\nIt's tellin' some star type of stuff\nLike oh shit, I'm gruff\nI'm like

twenty-two's?\nSlow down before you get your melon split or knocked by jake's\nCause nowadays, niggas act tough but be on some telling shit\nI learned the hard way, ninth grade I use to play the raw way\nTill I was tested, pulled out a weapon and caught that court case\nMom stressing, taking off work, rushing to court dates\nWhile pops angry, telling me Lico, go get your shit straight\nBelieve me fam', I know G's\nI was deep as a Spartan with my co-deez\nIf you about that, do it fadoli\nUse your minds eye, think for a second before you flex your desert\nRespect is something that's earned, I hope you take head to this message\nIt's ill in the boogie down\nSome niggas came through looking for you hoodie down\nMobbing six deep, gripping a four pound\nYou think you thugged out, but the way I see it you bugged out\nCould barely stand up straight, angel dust got you strung out\nWow, you got the juice now\n[Verse 2: Wati Heru]\nUnderneath the shadows of the two train, we hop turnstiles\nThe barrel spin like turn tables when the parties turned out\nIn return we turn the wrist a turning point eternally\nThe burner twist determine if he returns from eternity\nDon't be concerned with this, we firm with this like Escobar and Fox\nNever spent a term on D block but yet a nigga picking locks\nWe shoulda known better like case after we saw the cops\nStill no strangers stand by my spot\nThey exit or they're getting ox'd\nBy any God given chance I turn myself in\nMy attorney's in a fraternity, he'll turn that twenty-five into ten\nI'll do that bid, get big, turn twenty-five into ten\nSame cycle, stretch turn twenty-five outta' ten\nSo while they turning in they grave, I'm still collecting this yen\nSame corner, thirty-eight special in the side of the Timb's\nAnd if the jake turn the curb, I'm putting five into them\nSo now the table turn, El Ragga still survives in the end\nCause if I turn over the juice, another saga begins\n\n[Outro: Wati Heru]\nSaid I was whylin' out, I got the juice now\nLook who's whylin' now, you got the juice now\n\n[Outro 2: Bishop]\nWhat's the matter Raheem? Nothing to say?\nThat's cause you know I'm right\nIn your heart you know I'm right\nYou might also like[Q]\nYo big man, if you want respect you gotta earn it\n\n[Bishop]\nYou damn right\nYou gotta be ready to go down, stand up, and die for that shit like Blizzard did\nIf you want some juice\n\n[Q]\nBlizzard? Blizzard ain't sticking up to nothing now\n\n[Bishop]\nThat's cause we wasn't there to back him up\nIf we was there-\n\n[Q]\nIf we was there there'd be five dead niggas instead of oneEmbed"},

together\nWe feel miles apart inside\nWas it something I said or something I did?\nDid my words not come out right?\nThough I tried not to hurt you\nThough I tried\nBut I guess that's why they say:\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery rose has its thorn\nJust like every night has its dawn\nJust like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song\nEvery rose has its thorn\nYeah it does\n[Verse 2]\nI listen to our favorite song playing on the radio\nHear the DJ say, \u201clove's a game of easy come and easy go\u201c\nBut I wonder, does he know?\nHas he ever felt like this?\nAnd I know that you'd be here right now\nIf I could have let you know somehow, I guess\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery rose has its thorn\nJust like every night has its dawn\nJust like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song\nEvery rose has its thorn\n\n[Bridge]\nThough, it's been a while now\nI can still feel so much pain\nLike a knife that cuts you the wound heals\nBut the scar, that scar remains\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know I could have saved a love that night\nIf I'd known what to say\nInstead of making love, we both made our separate ways\nAnd now, I hear you found somebody new\nAnd that I never meant that much to you\nTo hear that tears me up inside\nAnd to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nEvery rose has its thorn\nJust like every night has its dawn\nJust like every cowboy sings a sad, sad

nothing to lose\nMaybe we'll make something\nMe, myself, I got nothing to prove\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got a fast car\nI got a plan to get us outta here\nI been working at the convenience store\nManaged to save just a little bit of money\nWon't have to drive too far\nJust 'cross the border and into the city\nYou and I can both get jobs\nFinally see what it means to be living\n[Verse 3]\nSee, my old man's got a problem\nHe lives with a bottle, that's the way it is\nHe says his body's too old for working\nHis body's too young to look like his\nWhen mama went off and left him\nShe wanted more from life than he could give\nI said, \"Somebody's gotta take care of him\"\nSo I quit school, and that's what I did\n\n[Refrain]\nYou got a fast car\nIs it fast enough so we can fly away?\nWe gotta make a decision\nLeave tonight, or live and die this way\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I remember when we were driving\nDriving in your car\nSpeed so fast, it felt like I was drunk\nCity lights lay out before us\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\nAnd I-I had a feeling that I belonged\nI-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou got a fast car\nWe go cruising, entertain ourselves\nYou still ain't got a job\nAnd I work in a market as a checkout girl\nI know things will get better\nYou'll find work and I'll get promoted\nWe'll move out of the shelter\nBuy a bigger house and live in the suburbs\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSo I remember when we were driving\nDriving in your car\nSpeed so fast, it felt like I was drunk\nCity lights lay out before us\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\nAnd I-I had a feeling that I belonged\nI-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\n\n[Verse 5]\nYou got a fast car\nI got a job that pays all our bills\nYou stay out drinkin' late at the bar\nSee more of your friends than you do of your kids\nI'd always hoped for better\nThought maybe together, you and me'd find it\nI got no plans, I ain't going nowhere\nSo take your fast car and keep on driving\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I remember when we were driving\nDriving in your car\nSpeed so fast, it felt like I was drunk\nCity lights lay out before us\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder\nAnd I-I had a feeling that I belonged\nI-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\n[Refrain]\nYou got a fast car\nIs it

my wants\nTo have a love that endures\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Babyface]\n'Cause every time I close my eyes\nI think of you\nAnd no matter what the season is\nI still love you\nWith all my heart\nAnd I wanna be with you\nWherever you are\n[Chorus: The Deele]\nI only think of you on two occasions\nThat's day and night\nI'd go for broke if I could be with you\nOnly you can make it right\n\n[Verse 2: Carlos \"Satin\" Greene]\nAn autumn love is special\nAt this time of the year\nBut when the leaves are gone\nDoes that love disappear?\nI never underestimate the new love of spring\nBut I'm glad to say in my heart\nI know my love's lasting\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Babyface]\n'Cause every time I close my eyes\nI think of you\nAnd no matter what the season is\nI still love you\nWith all my heart\nAnd I wanna be with you\nWherever you are\n\n[Chorus: The Deele]\nI only think of you on two occasions (What's that?)\nThat's day and night\nI'd go for broke if I could be with you\nOnly you can make it right\nI only

there was no risk that I wouldn't take\nAnd not a promise that I didn't make\nAll I asked was that you just hold on\nNow I'm wondering what I did wrong\n\nShould've known better\nThan to fall in love with you\nNow love is just a faded memory\nShould've known better\nNow I'm a prisoner to this pain\nAnd my heart still aches for you\n\nI gave you all of my body and soul\n(I gave you all of my body and soul)\nNever believing we might lose control\n(Never believing we might lose control)\nI took my hands off the wheel\n(I took my hands off the wheel)\n\nI can't remember if the lies were true\nIt's been a million years since I touched you\nWell I thought time might help me win this game\nBut being away from you is slowly driving me insane\n\nShould've known better\nThan to fall in
