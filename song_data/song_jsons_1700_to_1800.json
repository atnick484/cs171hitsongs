calling you?\nCan you hear me, can you hear me running?\nCan you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?\nThere's a gun and ammunition\nJust inside the doorway\nUse it only in emergency\nBetter

hear me, can you hear me running?\nCan you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?\n\nSwear allegiance to the flag\nWhatever flag they offer\nNever hint at what you really feel\nTeach the children quietly\nFor some day sons and daughters\nWill rise up and fight while we stood still\n\nCan you hear me, can you hear me running?\nCan you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?\nCan

missing you\n\n[Verse 1]\nEvery time I think of you\nI always catch my breath\nAnd I'm still standing here\nAnd you're miles away\nAnd I'm wondering why you left\n[Verse 2]\nAnd there's a storm that's raging\nThrough my frozen heart tonight\nI hear your name in certain circles\nAnd it always makes me smile\nI spend my time\nThinking about you\nAnd it's almost driving me wild\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd there's a heart that's breaking\nDown this long distance line tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't missing you at all\n(Missing you, missing you)\nSince you've been gone away\n(Missing you, missing you)\nI ain't missing you\n(Missing you, missing you)\nNo matter what I might say\n(Missing you, missing you)\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's a message in the wire\nAnd I'm sending you this signal tonight\nYou don't know\nHow desperate I've become\nAnd it looks like I'm losing this fight\nIn your world\nI have no meaning\nThough I'm trying hard to understand\nSee John Waite LiveGet tickets as low as $110You might

dick taste?\nI\u2005threw some fifties on the buffs, now I'm in shape\nAnd I done got my muscle up, boy I don't lift weights\nYou lil' niggas just some monkeys, bitch, we been apes\nTook me a shot of that Patron, and hit the thizz face\nAnd nigga, y'all can keep the streets, I love to get paid\nAnd I don't fuck with Android, I need the Ben Franks\nNigga, you will end up missed, off a mistake\nAnd we the only reason broke niggas skip states\nChoppa turn a big homie to a big shame\nIf she told you that she loyal, then that bitch fake\n5'10\", but stand tall like I'm 6'8\"\nTurn her to a super freak, like I'm Rick James\nAnd baby lethal with the head like she got six brains\nBig body hoggin' all the freeway, I'm in six lanes (Bitch)\n[Verse 2: Slimmy B]\nMind on a million, yeah, I gotta stay focused\nHand on the trigger, see a sucker, I'ma blow it\nAll these bands, bands, bands on me, I can't fold 'em\nHard body, all that sucker shit, I don't condone it\nMoncler on, winter time, when it's snowin'\nWe ain't cuffin' hoes, get the neck and let my bro hit\nGot her pussy wet off these words, I'm a poet\nBut if she got hair on that pussy, I don't want it\nYoung crest nigga, out the mud, I was chosen\nUp strap and shoot him with this cannon, like he posin'\nOnly thing I hit is bad bitches, my dick golden\nUsed to be my nigga, turned into a king cobra\nGas, break, dipped in that big body yolkin'\nBitch so thick, from the front, ass pokin'\nHit it from the back, leave her fuckin' back broken\nAll these bands, bands, bands on me, I can't fold 'em\nNigga\n\n[Verse 3: Yhung T.O.]\nAnd you can get your ass shot tryna act hard\nI just took the dub in the backyard\nNever leave the stick, nigga, that part\nAnd I know that you a bitch nigga at heart\nHad the boys on my ass, had to tuck the pole\nSent brody on that skit, told 'em up a soul\nDon't put your love in that bitch, they come and go\nSent some shots at that nigga, he tucked and rolled\nHigh as fuck behind the wheel with no control\nPut that Corvette in track, I'm switchin' modes\nCouldn't keep balance, I spilt the 'Tron\nAnd I don't smoke woods, just joints and cones\nNigga, free Noonie Mitch, I miss my thug\nOn one-nine with shit, got keep a drum\nAll my niggas uppin' sticks, we don't go ones\nSOB, RBE, it's the gang or noneYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

it's a lonelier place\nI kissed the morning goodbye\nBut down inside you know we never know why\nThe road is narrow and long\nWhen eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong\nI turn away from the wall\nI stumble and fall but I give you it all\n\n[Chorus]\nI am a woman in love and I'd do anything\nTo get you into my world and hold you within\nIt's a right I defend\nOver and over again\nWhat do I do?\n[Verse 2]\nWith you eternally mine\nIn love there is no measure of time\nWe planned it all at the start\nThat you and I live in each other's heart\nWe may be oceans away\nYou feel my love, I hear what you say\nNo truth is ever a lie\nI stumble and fall but I give you it all\n\n[Chorus]\nI am a woman in love and I'd do anything\nTo get you into my world and hold you within\nIt's a right I defend\nOver and over again\nWhat do I do?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nI am a woman in love and I'm talking to you\nYou know I know how you feel\nWhat a woman can do\nIt's a right I defend\nOver and over again\n\n[Outro]\nI am a woman in love and I'd do anything\nTo get you into my world and hold you within\nIt's a right I defend\nOver and over againYou might also like3Embed"},

folks around south Louisiana\nSaid Amos was a hell of a man\nHe could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator\nAnd just use one hand\nThat's all he got left cuz alligator bit it!\nLeft arm gone clean up to the elbow!\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell the Sheriff got wind that Amos\nWas in the swamp tracking alligator skin\nSo he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy\nBut he never come out again\nWell I wonder

the Good Times Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDon't look so sad, I know it's over\nBut life goes on and this old world will keep on turning\nLet's just be glad we had some time to spend together\nThere's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning\n\n[Chorus]\nLay your head upon my pillow\nHold your warm and tender body close to mine\nHear the whisper of the raindrops\nBlowing soft against the window\nAnd make-believe you love me one more time\nFor the good times\n[Verse 2]\nI'll get along, you'll find another\nAnd I'll be here if you should find you ever need me\nDon't say a word about tomorrow or forever\nThere'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me\n\n[Chorus]\nLay your head upon my pillow\nHold your warm and tender body close to mine\nHear the whisper of the raindrops\nBlowing soft

if you were true, there's no damn way that you\nCould fall in love with somebody that quickly\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd ain't it funny? All the twisted games\nAll the questions you used to avoid\nAin't it funny?

new to this\nBut I have seen this all before\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm never gonna let you close to me\nEven though you mean the most to me\n'Cause every time I open up, it hurts\nSo I'm never gonna get too close to you\nEven when I mean the most to you\nIn case you go and leave me in the dirt\n[Chorus]\nBut every time you hurt me, the less that I cry\nAnd every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry\nAnd every time you walk out, the less I love you\nBaby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know you're thinkin' I'm heartless\nI know you're thinkin' I'm cold\nI'm just protectin' my innocence\nI'm just protectin' my soul\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm never gonna let you close to me\nEven though you mean the most to me\n'Cause every time I open up, it hurts\nSo I'm never gonna get too close to you\nEven when I mean the
