ain't get to roll no Swishers\nI was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas\nAin't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses\nCan't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching\nEverybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping\nWhen I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings\nAnd all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget\nAnd I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it\nI don't understand these women who go around pretending\nAs if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance\n'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking\nGot Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time\n[Chorus]\nI wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind\nAK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines\nAnd all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind\nBut I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind\nBitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)\nI got murder on my mind (On my mind)\nI got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)\nI got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nYellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide\nHis face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized\nI didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise\nI reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice\nHis body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes\nHe grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die\nI told him, \"It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye\"\nAnd he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt\n\n[Chorus]\nWake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind\nAK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines\nAnd all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind\nBut I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind\nBitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)\nI got murder on my mind (On my mind)\nI got murder on my mind\nI got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind\n(I got murder on my mind)\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nBite like tarantula, bitch, I'm an animal\nMelly's a savage, no he not no amateur\nBad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera\nBitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)\nI might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy\nBake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy\n(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)\nI'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy\nHaha, murder on my mind, whoa, whoa\nI got murder on my mind (On my mind)\nI got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind, huh\n\n[Chorus]\nWake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind\nAK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines\nAnd all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind\nBut I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind\nBitch, I got murder on my mind\nI got murder on my mind\nI got murder on my mind\nI got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind\n(Murder on my mind)\n\n[Outro]\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh\nYoung Nigga World, bitch\nWhoa-oh-oh-oh218Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/3821533", "artist_names": "Blueface", "full_title":

turn it up, down, up, down, up, down\n\n[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Florida Georgia Line]\nWe just holding it down here in BFE\nStill rolling around with a burnt CD\nFree Bird, five minutes deep\nHead

little too far\nJust a little too far\n\n[Chorus 1]\n'Cause I was gonna be your forever\nYou were gonna be my wife\nWe didn't know any better\nDidn't have a clue about life\nBut I was what you wanted, you were what I needed\nAnd we could meet in between\nWe were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen\n[Verse 2]\nSo you went off to college and I got a job\nI was workin' that 9 to 5\nDreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive\nI spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'\nHowlin' at the moon\nScreaming for the days when you were coming back\nNo it couldn't come too soon\nCouldn't come too soon\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWhen I was gonna be your forever\nAnd you were gonna be my wife\nBut you went off to find better and I was learning all about life\nBut I was what you wanted, you were what I needed\nAnd we could meet in between\nWe were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo you came back after a long four years\nYour college boyfriend didn't work out\nSo we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now\nSure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me\nI went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee\nDown on one knee\nAnd I said\nYou might also like[Chorus 3]\nI'm gonna be your forever\nSo baby will you be my wife\nNow that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life\n'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need\nSo let's meet in between\nWe are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen\n\n[Outro]\nWe are

hormones prolly switch inside your DNA\nProblem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA\nDaddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA\nBackbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge\nSee, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front\nShit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son\nI know murder, conviction\nBurners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption\nScholars, fathers dead with kids and\nI wish I was fed forgiveness\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier\u2019s DNA (I\u2019m a soldier's DNA)\nBorn inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade\nWhen I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn\u2019t have nowhere to stay\nAt 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate\nAnd I'm gon' shine like I\u2019m supposed to, antisocial extrovert\nAnd excellent mean the extra work\nAnd absentness what the fuck you heard\nAnd pessimists never struck my nerve\nAnd Nazareth gonna plead his case\nThe reason my power's here on earth\nSalute the truth, when the prophet say\n[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]\nI-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA\nThis is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years\nI-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA\nI live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life\nI-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA\nI live a be-, fuck your life\n5, 4, 3, 2, 1\nThis is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'\nMoney and power, the mecca of marriages\n[Verse 2]\nTell me somethin'\nYou mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'\nI'd rather die than to listen to you\nMy DNA not for imitation\nYour DNA an abomination\nThis how it is when you in the Matrix\nDodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow\nAnd stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go\nAnd sleepin' in a villa\nSippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'\nDiamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors\nBeach inside the window, peekin' out the window\nBaby in the pool, godfather goals\nOnly Lord knows I've been goin' hammer\nDodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras\nEat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals\nYoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana\nWatchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes\nPhone never on, I don't conversate\nI don't compromise, I just penetrate\nSex, money, murder\u2014these are the breaks\nThese are the times,

beat, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nThese niggas prayed on my downfall (They what?)\nThese niggas prayed on my downfall\nOn all ten, bitch, I stood tall\nShow these disloyal niggas how to ball\n\n[Verse 1]\nGo get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right\nLet's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit\nYou ever been inside a federal court room?\nNigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?\nBein' broke did somethin' to my spirit\nAsked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me\nLook at me now, drivin' German engineering\nYou don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me\nKilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's\nTo hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?\nMu, 'member when you had them green things mailed?\nWith vacuum seals, tryin' not to have them green things smelled?\nFeds was on me, what you know about related through money?\nI don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney\nI fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody\nAny further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer\nMy nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe\nWill tell you every day before school I sold a half bow\nHow you think I won best dressed with no support?\nAnd had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court\nAyy, Dwan, though, ayy, Theo, ain't it a blessing?\nWe made it out Kentucky after all that happened?\nAfter the pre-trials, after the status\nAfter them impact statements, after the castle\n[Verse 2]\nAyy, JR, nigga, ain't it a blessing?\nWe made it out of Lansing after all that happened? (We did that bitch, nigga)\nAfter Michigan State, after Hubbard\nWhen our mans told on us, them bands they took from us\nJoy road bitch, but the money long as six mile\nBrick mile, knock your bitch down\nPick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out\nYes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud\nYes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out\nYes I caught cases on the road with them killers\nBro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya\nSpent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas\nStood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly\nI know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga\n'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas\nI'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga\n'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga\nUnc said Lil T, \"Get ahead of them niggas!\"\nWhen you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas\nYou killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas\nDon't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga\nSo let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it\nHere go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage\nFiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads\nGet it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge\nMy first offer was 30 years, not a day lower\nI told them crackers holler at me when they sober\nOn parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?\nYeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders\n(Boom-Boom-Boom!)\nYou hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on\nWhat was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio\nYou hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers\nWhoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor\nCuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas\nI wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas\nDon't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas\nAnd tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga\nI don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?\nThrough these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas\nFree my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas\nShoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas\nBoy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies\nBoy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody\nYou ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly\nI came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari\nThirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home\nShout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on\nGet 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along\nThis SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong\nThirty bands two times, watch this money clone\nThe feds say my name hot like when the oven on\nBitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone\nNiggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone\nWho said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him\nBetter check the black and white\nThat paperwork will vouch for him\nZero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him\nHe don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him\nI ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on\nSo soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on\nI'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong\nThe feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong\nI went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0\nThe state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store\nSay I can't even be in public with my hoodie on\nMichigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI know they prayed on my downfall\nI know they prayed on my downfall\nOn all ten, bitch, I stood tall\nShow these disloyal niggas how to ball81Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8, "api_path": "/songs/3028662", "artist_names": "Drake", "full_title": "Passionfruit by\u00a0Drake", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/dea304bcdf5066264930f1599c4f1fe8.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dea304bcdf5066264930f1599c4f1fe8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 3028662, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 104344, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1666936938, "path": "/Drake-passionfruit-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 232, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Drake-passionfruit-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 18}, "release_date_for_display": "March 18, 2017", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Mar. 18, 2017", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/dea304bcdf5066264930f1599c4f1fe8.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dea304bcdf5066264930f1599c4f1fe8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 3038334}, "title": "Passionfruit", "title_with_featured": "Passionfruit", "updated_by_human_at": 1666936938, "url": "https://genius.com/Drake-passionfruit-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/130", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/25aae6030be7bf4a2a9a281b0fb2d3ed.750x210x1.png", "id": 130, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/563e1b6590c65ab94586b8454e37aeaf.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Drake", "slug": "Drake", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Drake"}, "artist": "Drake", "lyrics": "TranslationsEspa\u00f1olPassionfruit Lyrics[Intro: Moodymann]\nHold on, hold on, fuck that\nFuck that shit\nHold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute\nFuck that shit\nStill on this mothafuckin\u2019 record\nI'ma play this mothafucka for y'all\nAyy, y\u2019all get some more drinks goin' on\nI'll sound a whole lot better\n\n[Verse 1]\nListen\nSeein' you got ritualistic\nCleansin' my soul of addiction for now\n'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah\nTension\nBetween us just like picket fences\nYou got issues that I won\u2019t mention for now\n\u2019Cause we're fallin\u2019 apart\n[Chorus]\nPassionate from miles away\nPassive with the things you say\nPassin' up on my old ways\nI can't blame you, no, no\nPassionate from miles away\nPassive with the things you say\nPassin' up on my old ways\nI can\u2019t blame you, no, no\n\n[Verse 2]\nListen\nHarder buildin' trust from a distance\nI think we should rule out commitment for now\n'Cause we're fallin' apart\nLeavin'\nYou're just doing that to get even\nDon't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now\nThey keep fallin' apart\n\n[Chorus]\nPassionate from miles away\nPassive with the things you say\nPassin' up on my old ways\nI can't blame you, no, no\nPassionate from miles away\nPassive with the things you say\nPassin' up on my old ways\nI can't blame you, no, no\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $134You might also like[Outro: Zo\u00eb Kravitz]\nUm, trying to think of the right thing to say232Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 14, "api_path": "/songs/2945277", "artist_names": "Jason Derulo (Ft.

recognize the feelings that's inside for ya\nAlthough I know your man and trust me he would die for ya\nThese quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now\nI saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken\nI came and talked to you but homie interfered now\nHe introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken\nSome people talk about that love at first sight shit\nTo keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true\nBut if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if\nI fell in love with you before I ever even knew\nI catch your eye then look away as if it never happened\nAt times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream\nIf eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you\nSometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dreams (Bigger dream)\nShe fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dream (Bigger dream), hm listen\nShe fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dreams (Bigger

holding up the wall waiting for the right song\nBetter holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights on\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd put my number in it\u2014\nI'm staring at you from afar\nI'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are\n'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines\nI mean the type that light the night time, I heard you got a man\nBut who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?\nTell me is your house a home?\nWhy you in the club looking like you out to zone?\nNow be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it\nText a nigga when your man leave you unattended\nOn a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it\nNo question, I know destiny well\nAnd though I sin the Lord blessing me still\nEvery saint got a past, every sinner got a future\nEvery loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday\nThey say it's just a matter of time\nAnd if I had my way then you would be mine, huh\nYou might also

two\nLike we already knew each other\nLike we've been talking all night\nAbout a minute into our first dance\nWe got blindsided by your friends\nAll in a hurry like you had to go\nDidn't they know you can't leave someone\nGirl, you can't leave someone\n[Chorus 1]\nIn the middle of a dance floor all alone\nIn the middle of an old school country song\nRight when I was just about to lean on in\nWhy'd you have to go then?\nBaby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light\nIt shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives\nGirl, it ain't right, no\nHow you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe were gonna dance 'till they shut it down\nPeople'd be staring while I spin you 'round\nThinking we were so in love, yeah\nThey wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up\nI'd get your number and I'd give you mine\nAnd we'd be hanging out tomorrow night\nBut now I don't know where you are\nI'm under these lights right here in the dark\n\n[Chorus 1]\nIn the middle of a dance floor all alone\nIn the middle of an old school country song\nRight when I was just about to lean on in\nWhy'd you have to go then?\nBaby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light\nIt shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives\nGirl, it ain't right, no\nHow you gonna leave me in the middle of a memory? yeah\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nYeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie\nTore the back half out of a book\nAnd no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me\nIt ain't right saying goodbye\n\n[Chorus 2]\nIn the middle of a dance floor all alone\nIn the middle of what could've been our song\nRight when I was just about to lean on in\nWhy'd you have to go then?\nBaby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light\nIt shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives\nBut, girl, it ain't right, no\nHow you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?\nIn the middle of a memory\nIn the middle of a memory2Embed"}, {"_type": "song",
