        "lyrics": "The Poetaster Act 5. Scene 1 LyricsBanquet halls are a very special place, where under one big roof so many different memories are made. From proms to weddings to baby showers, once that DJ starts to spin, there's something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with sing-along dance tunes. Top 40 hits come and go, and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening, but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time. Not only do they never go out of style, they are essential components of the perfect hoe-down in all banquet halls.\n\n1. The Chicken Dance\nThis song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can't help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding.\n\n2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios\nA major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat.\n\n3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA\nLight-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S.\n4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion\nThe words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, \"My heart will go on and OOOOOOON!\" with Celine.\n\n5. Don't Stop Believin, by Journey\nThe ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey's quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren't even born then know the words. It's a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song.\n\nThese time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they've got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones.\n\nriage, first gave sign\nUnto his contract; fire and air did shine,\nAs guilty of the match; and from the hill\nThe nymphs with shriekings do the region fill.\nHere first began their bane; this day was ground\nOf all their ills; for now, nor rumour's sound,\nNor nice respect of state, moves Dido ought;\nHer love no longer now by stealth is sought:\nShe calls this wedlock, and with that fair name\nCovers her fault. Forthwith the bruit and fame,\nThrough all the greatest Lybian towns is gone;\nFame, a fleet evil, than which is swifter none,\nThat moving grows, and flying gathers strength,\nLittle at first, and fearful; but at length\nShe dares attempt the skies, and stalking proud\nWith feet on ground, her head doth pierce a cloud!\nThis child, our parent earth, stirr'd up with spite\nOf all the gods, brought forth; and, as some write,\nShe was last sister of that giant race\nThat thought to scale Jove' s court; right swift of pace,\nAnd swifter far of wing; a monster vast,\nAnd dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed\nOn her huge corps, so many waking eyes\nStick underneath; and, which may stranger rise\nIn the report, as many tongues she bears,\nAs many mouths, as many listening ears.\nNightly, in midst of all the heaven, she flies,\nAnd through the earth's dark shadow shrieking cries,\nNor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep;\nBy day on tops of houses she doth keep,\nOr on high towers; and doth thence affright\nCities and towns of most conspicuous site:\nAs covetous she is of tales and lies,\nAs prodigal of truth: this monster\u2014\nLup.\n[within.] Come, follow me, assist me, second me! Where'! the\nemperor?\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] Sir, you must pardon us.\n\n2 Eques.\n[within.] Caesar is private now; you may not enter.\n\nTuc.\n[within.] Not enter!

Caesar, or respectest\nthine own safety, or the safety of the state, Caesar, hear me,\nspeak with me, Caesar; 'tis no common business I come about, but\nsuch, as being neglected, may concern the life of Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nThe life of Caesar! Let him enter. Virgil, keep thy seat.\nEnter Lupus, Tucca, and Lictors.\n\nEques.\n[within.] Bear back, there: whither will you? keep back!\n\nTuc.\nBy thy leave, goodman usher: mend thy peruke; so.\n\nLup.\nLay hold on Horace there; and on Mecaenas, lictors. Romans,\noffer no rescue, upon your allegiance: read, royal Caesar.\n[Gives a paper.] I'll tickle you, Satyr.\n\nTuc.\nHe will, Humours, he will; he will squeeze you, poet\npuck-fist.\n\nLup.\nI'll lop you off for an unprofitable branch, you satirical\nvarlet.\n\nTuc.\nAy, and Epaminondas your patron here, with his flagon chain;\ncome, resign: [takes off Mecaenas' chain,] though 'twere your great grandfather's, the law has made it mine now, sir. Look to him, my party-coloured rascals; look to him.\n\nCaes.\nWhat is this, Asinius Lupus? I understand it not.\n\nLup.\nNot understand it! A libel, Caesar; a dangerous, seditious\nlibel; a libel in picture.\n\nCaes.\nA libel!\n\nLup.\nAy, I found it in this Horace his study, in Mecaenas his\nhouse, here; I challenge the penalty of the laws against them.\n\nTuc.\nAy, and remember to beg their land betimes; before some of\nthese hungry court-hounds scent it out.\n\nCaes.\nShew it to Horace: ask him if he know it.\n\nLup.\nKnow it! his hand is at it, Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nThen 'tis no libel.\n\nHor.\nIt is the imperfect body of an emblem, Caesar, I began for\nMecaenas.\n\nLup.\nAn emblem! right: that's Greek for a libel. Do but mark how\nconfident he is.\n\nHor.\nA just man cannot fear, thou foolish tribune;\nNot, though the malice of traducing tongues,\nThe open vastness of a tyrant's ear,\nThe senseless rigour of the wrested laws,\nOr the red eyes of strain'd authority,\nShould, in a point, meet all to take his life:\nHis innocence is armour 'gainst all these.\n\nLup.\nInnocence! O impudence! let me see, let me see! Is not here an\neagle! and is not that eagle meant by Caesar, ha? Does not Caesar\ngive the eagle? answer me; what sayest thou?\n\nTuc.\nHast thou any evasion, stinkard?\n\nLup.\nNow he's turn'd dumb. I'll tickle you, Satyr.\n\nHor.\nPish: ha, ha!\n\nLup.\nDost thou pish me? Give me my long sword.\n\nHor.\nWith reverence to great Caesar, worthy Romans,\nObserve but this ridiculous commenter;\nThe soul 'to my device was in this distich:\nThus oft, the base and ravenous multitude\nSurvive, to share the spoils of fortitude.\nWhich in this body I have figured here,\nA vulture\u2014\n\nLup.\nA vulture! Ay, now, 'tis a vulture. O abominable! monstrous!\nmonstrous! has not your vulture a beak? has it not legs, and\ntalons, and wings, and feathers?\n\nTuc.\nTouch him, old buskins.\n\nHor.\nAnd therefore must it be an eagle?\n\nMec.\nRespect him not, good Horace: say your device.\n\nHor.\nA vulture and a wolf\n\nLup.\nA wolf! good: that's I; I am the wolf: my name's Lupus; I am\nmeant by the wolf. On, on; a vulture and a wolf\n\nHor.\nPreying upon the carcass of an ass\u2014\n\nLup.\nAn ass! good still: that's I too; I am the ass.

But impotent, they\nThought each man's vice belong'd to their whole tribe;\nAnd much good do't them! What they have done 'gainst me,\nI am not moved with: if it gave them meat,\nOr got them clothes, 'tis well; that was their end.\nOnly amongst them, I am sorry for\nSome better natures, by the rest so drawn,\nTo run in that vile line.\n\nPol.\nAnd is this all!\nWill you not answer then the libels?\n\nAut.\nNo.\n\nPol.\nNor the Untrussers?\n\nAut.\nNeither.\n\nPol.\nY'are undone then.\n\nAut.\nWith whom?\n\nPol.\nThe world.\n\nAut.\nThe bawd!\n\nPol.\nIt will be taken\nTo be stupidity or tameness in you.\n\nAut.\nBut they that have incensed me, can in soul\nAcquit me of that guilt.

They would think it strange, now,\nA man should take but colts-foot for one day,\nAnd, between whiles, spit out a better poem\nThan e'er the master of art, or giver of wit,\nTheir belly, made. Yet, this is possible,\nIf a free mind had but the patience,\nTo think so much together and so vile.\nBut that these base and beggarly conceits\nShould carry it, by the multitude of voices,\nAgainst the most abstracted work, opposed\nTo the stuff'd nostrils of the drunken rout!\nO, this would make a learn'd and liberal soul\nTo rive his stained quill up to the back,\nAnd damn his long-watch'd labours to the fire,\nThings that were born when none but the still night\nAnd his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes,\nWere not his own free merit a more crown\nUnto his travails than their reeling claps.\nThis 'tis that strikes me silent, seals my lips,\nAnd apts me rather to sleep out my time,\nThan I would waste it in contemned strifes\nWith these vile Ibides, these unclean birds,\nThat make their mouths their clysters, and still purge\nFrom their hot entrails. But I leave the monsters\nTo their own fate.

        "lyrics": "Kids (Screenplay) LyricsBLACK SCREEN\nThe very loud sound of people having sex. The sounds of deep\nmoaning and sexual huffs and puffs. After a few seconds the\nsound grows even louder. It should sound as if the two\npeople are fucking into a microphone. The sounds should be\npainful and raw.\n\nGIRL (O.S.)\nOh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.\n\nINT. BEDROOM - DAY\n\nThe face of a very pretty young girl with long blond hair.\nHer face is inches from the CAMERA, the CAMERA is above her,\nlooking down, almost like the POV of the person she's having\nsex with. She id breathing extremely heavily; her face is\nred-hot and sweaty. Every time she moves, she makes a deep\nmoaning noise. She looks likes she's on the verge of pain\nand ecstasy.\n\nGIRL\nOh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please Telly, Telly.\n\nThe CAMERA backs up to reveal Telly having sex with the\ngirl. Telly is seventeen years old. He is short, dirty,\nslightly muscular, he has an interesting face, he is a\nstreet-smart punk, He is biting his bottom lip, the two of\nthem are sweating like mad, the sound of the bed post\nsmashing against the wall combines with the rhythmical\nmoaning of the two.\n\nRAPID FADE TO BLACK\n\n\nBACK IN TIME - BEFORE THEY HAD SEX\nTelly is in bed with the girl. The two of them are sitting\nup in the big bed that is raised high of the ground. Telly\nis naked except for a tight pair of white underwater. He is\nsitting above the blankets with his legs spread apart. The\ngirl is partially covered, she is wearing a black bra, one\nof her nipples is poking through. The two of them are very\nsweaty, they both have messed up hair, there is a great\nfeeling of heat and wetness.\n\nThe windows to her room are open, the sound of outside of\noutside traffic is circulating. There is a small fan on her\ndresser that is blowing from side to side. Socks, shirts,\nand pants are lying on her hard wood floor. The room is neat\nexcept for the clothing. A large poster of the Beastie Boys\nhangs on the wall. She has many stuffed animals on her bed\nand dresser drawer, she also has a small dollhouse in the\ncorner.\n\nTelly and the girl are looking at each other.\n\nThe girl speaks slowly and softly, she has a very innocent\nbeauty about her.\n\nTELLY\nYou know what I want to do?\nGIRL\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do I want to do?\n\nGIRL\nYou want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.\n\nTELLY\n(smiling)\nWhy?\n\nGIRL\nBecause, you know why. You know.\n\nTELLY\nBecause your a virgin?\n\nGIRL\nBecause I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.\n\nTELLY\nYou think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have\nto worry about that kinda stuff.\n\nGIRL\nWhy is that?\n\nTELLY\nBecause I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we\nfucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.\n\nGIRL\nI wouldn't believe it?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know. I just think that you would love it.\n\nGIRL\nBut, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change.\nBetween us.\n\nTELLY\nWhat things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.\n(he begins to caress her cheek and hair)\nI want to make you happy. That's all.\n\nTelly scoots up to the girl and starts to kiss her. He\nsticks his tongue in her mouth. They kiss.\n\nTELLY\n(whispering)\nYou know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.\n\nGIRL\n(whispering)\nDo you care about me?\n\nTELLY\n(whispering)\nOf course I do.\n\nRAPID CUT TO BLACK\n\n\nAN EXTREME CLOSEUP OF THE GIRL'S FACE\n\nAs she screams in total agony. Telly and the girl are on the\nbed having sex. All the lights are on. This scene should\nlook very white and bleached out, very electric and\nshocking. Everything should be exposed as Telly takes\nadvantage of the virgin girl.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\n(slowly)\nVirgins. I love 'em. No diseases, no loose as a goose pussy,\nno skank. No nothin. Just pure pleasure.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n\nTHE CREDITS ROLL IN\n\nAs soon as the scene ends, so does the sound of the two\nhaving sex. Very fast, very hard-paced music accompanies the\ncredits. The music should be strong enough to maintain the\nintensity of the scene, Hard-core, Punk.\n\nCREDITS STOP\n\nFADE IN:\n\n\nINT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRCASE - DAY\n\nTelly gently shuts the door. He has a huge smile on his\nface. He looks down the center of the staircase and spits.\nHe watches his spit fall down till it smacks against the\nfloor. He runs down three flights of stairs as quickly as\npossible. He jumps down the last four steps and bumps into\nthe side of the wall. He is very happy. He runs down the\nskinny hallway and smacks the metal mailboxes.\n\n\nEXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - SIDEWALK - DAY\n\nTelly exits the building. CASPER is sitting on a middle\nstep. He is reading a comic book and drinking a 40oz. Bottle\nof malt liquor. The bottle is wrapped in a brown paper sack.\nAs he sips his drink he laughs at his comic book.\n\nCasper is Telly's second half. The two have been best\nfriends since grade school. Casper is small and funny,\neveryone likes him, he has a quick temper, and he isn't\nscared to fight someone twice his size. Telly provides\nCasper with a sense of adolescent wisdom. Casper makes Telly\nhappy; he's a smart ass, he has a strong New York accent, an\nassortment of tattoos, and crooked teeth. Telly and Casper\nare always together, They help each other to survive.\n\nTelly smacks Casper on the back of his head. Casper is\nstartled and spills a little bit of his beer onto his shoes.\n\nCASPER\nShit.\n\nTELLY\n(smiling)\nWas up bitch?\n\nCasper looks at Telly smiling.\n\nCASPER\nOh shit what happened?\n\nCasper is very excited. He stands up and pulls Telly's arm.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do you think?\n\nCASPER\nYou fucked it?\n\nTelly laughs and Casper jumps up and down.\n\nCASPER\nI knew you fucked it! I sat out her for like two hours! That\ngirl was like twelve, and you hit it up!\n\nTELLY\n(pounding his chest)\nWho am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.\n\nThey both start to laugh.\n\nThey move off the stairs and start walking down the\nsidewalk. The two of them are walking down the street,\nobvious to everything but themselves talking.\n\nCASPER\nWell, how was it?\n\nTELLY\nOh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.\n\nCASPER\nShe can fuck?\n\nTELLY\nHell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in\nshe screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.\n\nCASPER\nOh shit. How long did it take?\n\nTELLY\nDid what take?\n\nCASPER\nHow long did you fuck her?\n\nThey cross the street, paying no attention to speeding cars.\nCasper is listening to every word that Telly says. Casper\nseems much happier than Telly. Telly is laid-back. Casper is\nhyper as he jumps up and down and claws Telly's arm.\n\nTELLY\nWell it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took\nlike 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we\nfucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out\nand putting it back in. It hurts the first time.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nBut then when she got into it. She really got into it. It\nwas good.\n\nCASPER\nHow did she smell? Did her puss stink?\n\nTelly puts his four fingers together and then puts his hand\nin front of Caper's nose.\n\nTELLY\nTake a whiff.\n\nCasper takes a huge whiff, the snot in his nose makes a loud\nsound as he smells Telly's fingers.\n\nCASPER\nOh man, it smells like butterscotch.\n\nTELLY\nHell's yeah. She was so clean.\n\nCASPER\nOh man, that's the best.\n\nTELLY\nYou could tell she took care of herself. She had all these\npowders and creams in her bathroom.\n\nCASPER\nLet me smell it again.\n\nTelly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in\nthe odor.\n\nCASPER\nThat's why virgins are the best. I love that smell.\n\nAs they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits\nwith briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages\nall pass by.\n\nTELLY\nYou know what else?\n\nCASPER\nWhat?\n\nTELLY\nI can tell that she had just entered puberty.\n\nCASPER\nHow?\n\nTELLY\nWell, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her\nfamily, right.\n\nCASPER\nRight.\n\nTELLY\nAnd there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or\nsomething. And I said, you were cut when you were little.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nAnd she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year\nago. I look younger without my makeup.\n\nCasper starts to crack up.\n\nTELLY\nAnd I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this\ngirl is a baby.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nAnd for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know,\nbecause she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit,\nthat turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.\n\nThey both laugh.\n\nCASPER\nFuckin perverted bastard.\n\nThey continue to laugh and walk.\n\nTELLY\nI'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that\nshit.\n\nCASPER\nTo what? Virgins?\n\nTELLY\nYeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's\nlike lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex\nfantasies.\n\nCASPER\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTELLY\nI mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.\n\nCASPER\nYou mean like fucking two virgins at once.\n\nTELLY\n(laughing)\nThat would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like\nwhen I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I\nwould like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would\nhappen.\n\nCASPER\n(laughing)\nShe's probably smash you in the fucking face.\n\nTELLY\nI don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I\nwasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it\nslow. Show 'em some respect.\n\nCASPER\nDid you tell her that you loved her?\n\nTELLY\nLike. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin\nseduction guys.\n\nThey stop walking. Casper takes the last sip of his beer,\nthen throws it toward an orange trash can. He misses the can\nand the bottle smashes in the middle of a busy street.\n\nCASPER\nShit.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do you want?\n\nCASPER\nGet another forty.\n(burps)\nSmoke a blunt.\n\nTELLY\nAre you hungry?\n\nCASPER\nHell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a sec.\n\nCasper takes two steps away and starts urinating in\nsomeone's bushes. People walk by and stare.\n\nTELLY\nYou wanna go to Paul's house?\n\nCASPER\nWhat for? That guys a dick.\n\nTELLY\nI'm sue he's got food. He's always got those microwave\nburrito things in his freezer.\n\nCASPER\nYou think he's got any herb?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know, he quit dealin but I'll bet he'll smoke us\nout.\n\nCASPER\nYou think?\n\nTELLY\nProbably.\n\nCASPER\nHe lives on 76th?\n\nTELLY\n78th.\n\nCASPER\nDen less go Joe.\n\nHe zips up his pants.\n\nThey start walking again. Casper is carrying a folded up\ncomic book in his hand.\n\nCASPER\nTelly.\n\nTELLY\nYeah.\n\nCASPER\nDid she suck your dick?\n\nTELLY\nA little bit. But I didn't really want her to.\n\nCASPER\nWhy?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to\nsuck your dick. That's so easy.\n\nCASPER\nIt is right.\n\nTELLY\nI want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole\nphilosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's\nbasic because there's nothing lost.\n\nCASPER\nIt's no big deal, right?\n\nTELLY\nRight. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it.\nYou were the one. No one else can ever do it.\n\nCASPER\nYeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.\n(they both start laughing)\nIt's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like,\nif you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the\nvirgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were\ntheir first.\n\nTELLY\nYep.\n\nCASPER\nThey're gonna tell their grand kids.\n(mimicking an old lady)\nThat Telly. He sure was good in the sack!\n\nThe two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten\nthem very excited.\n\nThey walk in front of a Korean grocery. The grocery has a\nsmall outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc. A\nKOREAN GUY with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a\ntall wooden stool.\n\nTELLY\nYou thirsty?\n\nCASPER\nYeah, I feel dehydrated.\n\nTELLY\nYou got any money?\n\nCASPER\nThree pennies and a ball of lint.\n\nTELLY\nYou down with the boost?\n\nCASPER\n(whispers)\nUnzip my pack, yo.\n\nHe turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack.\n\n\nINT. KOREAN GROCERY - DAY\n\nThe grocery is your basic traditional market with a lunch\nbuffet. Behind the cash register is a middle-aged KOREAN\nMAN. He is watching a small black and white television set.\n\nThe two boys enter.\n\nCasper walks straight to the back where they keep the beer.\n\nTelly circles the buffet and then walks up to the cash\nregister.\n\nTELLY\nUh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nWhah?\n\nTELLY\nDiss digg.

Dissdee?\n\nCasper runs up to the counter and grabs his crotch.\n\nCASPER\nHe said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand\nEnglish?\n\nThe two of them both run out the door.\n\nTelly taps the Korean man who is sitting outside. The man\nlooks in the opposite direction while Casper grabs two\npeaches and puts them into his pocket.\n\nThe two boys run off.\n\nThe Korean man gets off his stool. He pulls his headphones\noff his ears.\n\nKOREAN MAN\nStupy fucky boys! Fucky!\n\nHe looks at his fruit stand and puts a peach in the spot\nthat Casper previously stole from.\n\n\nEXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - APARTMENT - DAY\n\nCasper and Telly are walking down the street. Casper is\neating a peach and drinking his 40oz. beer.

A velvet\npicture of Christ is hanging on the wall in the hallway.\nVery simple and plain, a generic adobe.\n\nCasper enters his house and flips on a lightswitch.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he walks into his house and hears some strange noises.\n\nThe sounds of his mother screaming from upstairs.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming from upstairs)\nGet away! Get away! Help! You monster! Please help!\n\nCasper puts his lunch box down and walks to the first stair\nto listen to his mother's screams.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nThe noises were coming from upstairs. In his parents room.\n\nCasper's mom continues to scream from upstairs.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He was just a\nlittle kid and he wasn't sure what to do.\n\nCasper moves off the step and runs into the kitchen.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he ran and got a big knife. The same knife his pops used\nto cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with.\n\nHe opens a drawer full of silverware and pulls out a\nhumongous glistening knife. He picks it up, and it shines on\nhis face.\n\nAs his mother screams he looks up at the ceiling with the\nknife in his hand.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming from upstairs)\nStop! Please stop! Oooh help!\n\nCasper runs up the stairs, he is holding the knife straight\nout.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he heard his mom's screams, and knew that she was in\ntrouble. It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed.\nLike someone was kicking her in the head.\n\nCasper runs down the hall and opens the door to his parents\nroom.\n\nWhat he sees is very shocking. His face becomes extremely\nanimated.\n\nCasper's mom is on the bed. She is completely naked except\nfor a pair of bright red high heel shoes. In between her\nlegs is a man wearing all black, including a black ski mask\nand motorcycle boots. He is having sex with Casper's mom. He\nhas her arms pinned down on the bed. He is grunting like a\npig.\n\nCasper watches for a moment in awe.\n\nMAN IN BLACK\nBitch. You fuckin bitch. Fuckin bitch. Slutty whore.\n\nThe man in black slaps Casper's mom hard on her naked ass.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming)\nNo! Stop! Get off me!\n\nShe is struggling to get loose.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski\nmask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old\nkid.\n\nCasper runs up to the bed. He climbs on top of the bed with\nthe big knife in the air, all the while the man in black is\nhaving sex with his mother. And they don't even notice\nCasper at first.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nAnd he goes and jumps on his parent's bed. And for a second\nhe just looks and watches.\n\nCasper takes his knife and starts stabbing the guy in black,\nover and over. His mother is kicking and trying to stop him.\nAll the while, she is screaming outrageously and blood is\npouring out.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nAnd you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything\nto happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over and\nover. But it was a mistake.\n\nCasper's mom is kicking Casper as he stabs the man.\n\nCasper is biting his tongue as he stabs the man.\n\nThe man falls off the bed and onto the floor.\n\nCasper's mom is going totally nuts. She is completely naked,\nwith blood all over her body. There is blood all over the\nsheets. His mom is clawing her face in complete hysterics.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\nYou fuck!!! It's your father!!! We were playing a game you\nfuck!!! That's your father!!! We were just playing!!!\n\nCasper looks very confused as he looks at his naked mother.\nHe has the knife in his hand, and a little blood on his\nT-shirt and cheek.\n\nCasper's mom continues to yell at him.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\nCasper, you fucker!!! Oh, my god!!! Help me God!!!\n\nCasper looks at his mother, then he looks at the dead guy on\nthe floor. He bends down and takes off the mask. It's his\nfather.\n\nCASPER\n(calmly)\nThat's my dad.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(crying)\nYou fuck. You killed your father!\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo Casper killed his father. He came home with a stomachache\nand ended up murdering his pops. It was a very embarrassing\nthing.\n\n\nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON A CEMENT BENCH - DAY\n\nTelly is in the same spot talking to Misha.\n\nTELLY\nSo that's why Casper is how he is.\n\nMISHA\nOh god. That's horrible.\n\nA quick shot of Casper smoking a blunt and laughing with his\nfriends.\n\nTELLY\nYep.\n\nMISHA\nHoly shi. That's all true?\n\nTELLY\nNo. I was just kidding.\n\nMISHA\n(outraged)\nWhat?!\n\nTELLY\nI lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post\noffice.\n\n\nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON THE FOUNTAIN - DAY\n\nCasper and all his friends are passing around the blunt,\nwhich by now is almost gone. All that is left is a roach and\nCasper is sucking on it really hard.\n\nCasper breathes out the smoke and then passes the roach to\nHamilton.\n\nCASPER\nYo, that weed is mad good.\n\nHamilton gets ready to puff.\n\nHAMILTON\nHells yeah. Gimmie a taste of the mothafuckin chronic.\n\nCasper rubs his eyes.\n\nHamilton puffs on the little roach.\n\nCasper grabs somebody's skateboard and stands on it. He\nstarts rolling around slowly and doing some tricks.\n\nThe other kids continue to smoke. They watch Casper and\nlaugh.\n\nCasper is slowly trying to do tricks, but he's so stoned\nthat he just falls off.\n\nAs he skates in front of is friends he doesn't pay any\nattention to where he's going.\n\nA tall HOODLUM with gold front teeth is walking by. He is\nwearing all Polo and a thick white Fila headband. He is\nbiting down on a chew stick.\n\nThe hoodlum walks by. He has a certain ominous strut. He is\nlooking at the ground as he walks.\n\nHe takes the chew stick out of his mouth and looks at some\ngirl's ass as she walks by. He makes a little noise with his\nmouth.\n\nAs the hoodlum walks by, Casper is rolling backward, not\npaying attention. He rolls into the hoodlum's heels. Casper\nfalls down and laughs. Everyone watching laughs, including\nTelly who is still sitting with Misha.\n\nCasper jumps up and grabs his skateboard. The hoodlum is\nturned around. Casper walks up to him with a smile.\n\nCASPER\nYo, sorry money.\n\nThe hoodlum is a good seven inches taller than Casper. He\nputs his arms out like he's upset.\n\nHOODLUM\nYeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm\nsaying?\n\nCASPER\n(smiling)\nYeah, watch where you walk dukes.\n\nHOODLUM\nWhat?\n\nCASPER\nNuffin G. Just forget it.\n\nHOODLUM\nWhat the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?\n\nCasper throws his skateboard down. He quickly turns around\nand pulls his pants up. He runs right up to the hoodlum and\nhe looks up at him.\n\nCASPER\nSup then? Sup?\n\nHOODLUM\nCome on bitch. Throw your fists up.\n\n\nEXT. THE CEMENT BENCHES - DAY\n\nTelly and Misha are watching. Telly stands up.\n\nTELLY\nUh oh. Casper's in the mix.\n\nHe quickly walks up.\n\n\nEXT. THE FOUNTAIN - DAY\n\nAll the guys jump up and start screaming.\n\nSTEVEN\nOh shit. Throw down.\n\nSteven and all the guys run up and surround the hoodlum.\nThey all start screaming taunts. \"Fuck 'em up Casper!\"\n\nCasper is inches from the hoodlum. They are both in a\nfighting stance. Casper keeps pulling his pants up. Casper\nhas a huge smile on his face, like this is his favorite\nthing in the whole world.\n\nCASPER\nSup. Sup.\n\nHOODLUM\nCome on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.\n\nCASPER\nI'm gonna fuck you up bitch.\n\nThey are both right about to swing.\n\nEveryone in the whole park has turned their attention to the\nscuffle.\n\nAll of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the\nHoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the\nguy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the\nhoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees.\n\nCasper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in\nthe face as hard as he can.\n\nEveryone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum.\nThey're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. \"Fuck\n'em up!\"\n\nHarold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard.\n\nHitting him on the legs and stomach.\n\nCasper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.\n\nCASPER\n(everytime he kicks the guy he says this)\nSuck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick!\n\nAll of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park,\nincluding Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start\nsmashing this guy, over and over.\n\nThe hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone\nfrantically tries to kill him.\n\nThe focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How\nmuch they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him,\nover and over, like animals in on the prey.\n\nThis should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the\nfallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating\nthe guy.\n\nTelly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he\nclears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts\nhis arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the\nhoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly\nsteps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face.\n\nCasper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face.\n\nCASPER\nSuck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick.\n\nEveryone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent\nand look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and\ndead.\n\nCasper bends over, right in his face.\n\nCASPER\n(smiling)\nNow get in my way! Bitch.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n\nINT. / EXT. TAXICAB - GOING DOWNTOWN - EVENING\n\nJennie is in the back of a speeding cab. She is looking out\nthe window. Her face looks sad.\n\nThe TAXI DRIVER is a funny looking old man.

Can I ask you a question?\n\nJennie just shrugs.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nCan I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a\npest.\n\nJENNIE\nWhat?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was\nlooking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you,\nbut your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be\nof any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin.\nHelp make you happy. Who knows? Somethin maybe.\n\nAs the taxi driver talks, he looks in the mirror, and then\nlooks at the road. He is driving fast and clumsy. He pulls\nout his cigar and then puts it back in his mouth.\n\nJENNIE\nNo. I'm OK. Thanks.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYou're OK?\n\nJENNIE\nYeah.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nBecause gee, you don't look OK. I mean your a very beautiful\nyoung lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...\n\nJENNIE\nYeah well, it's been a bad day.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nA bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was\nsmashed over by a car and when my wife found out she\ncollapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack.\nPartial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way.\nNot me. It's not good for the soul.\n\nThe taxi driver begins to laugh a really squeaky laugh.\n\nJENNIE\nSorry.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who\nknows? You don't. No one does.\n\nJennie continues to look glumly out the window.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYou know. I could tell you were sad by the way your eyes\ndrooped. Like an adopted kid. That's the way an adopted\nkid's eyes look. All sad like that. All droopy and sweet.\nLike the honey that I lick off my finger.\n\nHe starts to laugh. Jennie continues to look sadly out the\nwindow.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWould I be prying if I asked you what was wrong?\n\nJennie is silent.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nMiss, would I be prying?\n\nJENNIE\nEverything is wrong.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNo, not everything?

The taxi driver looks in the mirror and sees\nJennie smiling.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNow that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you\nsmile. Like a glamour girl.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom\nqueen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center\nof her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis.\nYou know you look a little bit like her.\n\nJENNIE\nThanks.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a\ncrush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in\nher mouth.\n\nHe stops at a red light and turns around to look at her.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nHey look. Whatever it is. Just forget about it. Life's too\nshort. Make yourself happy. I'll give you an example. When\nmy golden retriever passed away. God rest his soul.\n(he punches the roof of the cab)\nI was lonesome. I missed him. So I got a tattoo.\n\nHe pulls up his shirt and reveals a tattoo of a dog on his\nforearm. It says \"Bruno\" in big letters.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNow how do you like that? Now he's with me forever.\n\nThe light turns and he starts driving.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nI swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight\noff my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should\nmake yourself happy.\n\nJENNIE\nWhat if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything\nfalls apart?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You\nforget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My\ngrandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, \"Leon,\nmy darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't\nthink. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't\ntalk\" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be\nhappier.\n\nHe starts to laugh.\n\nA quick shot of his identification badge. He has a really\ngoofy smile and he's wearing the same Hawaiian shirt.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nThat's life.\n\nJennie is smiling.\n\nJENNIE\nYour a real philosopher.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.\n\nHe pulls up on Washington Square Park. He slams on the\nbrakes and turns around in his seat.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell here we are, Miss.\n\nJennie pulls some money out.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nAw, don't worry 'bout it. The rides on me.\n\nJennie has the money up to the glass.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nAll right, all right, I'll take it. But forget about the\ntip.\n\nHe takes her money.\n\nJENNIE\nThanks. Bye.\n\nThe taxi driver sticks his head out the window.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile, God notices. That's\nwhy the sun is shining.\n\nHe points up to the sky before pulling away.\n\n\nEXT. LOWER EAST SIDE - APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING\n\nTelly is standing in the road in front of Darcy's apartment\nbuilding.

OUTSIDE NASA - RAVE - NIGHT\n\nThis is the line to Nasa. People are lined up and down the\nblock waiting to get inside.

She comes\nto the front.\n\nSID, a short gay Chinese boy with orange hair, is carrying a\nclipboard guest list under his arm and has a Sesame Street\npurse in his other hand.

It has hallways and rooms.\nKids invade every inch of the club.\n\nAs Jennie walks in, the Techno music grows very loud. The\nmusic should sound as if you were stuck in a fast-paced\nvideo game.\n\nKids are running around everywhere. The CAMERA follows\nJennie through the club as if it is seeing everything Jennie\nsees.\n\nThe dance floor is packed with kids holding flashlights and\nsucking on pacifiers.\n\nAs she walks through the darkened hallways, people are\nagainst the walls making out.\n\nAs she gets to the end of the hallway, there is a big crowd\nof people.

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

girl with her friends\n'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'\n\n[Refrain: Destiny's Child]\nThough he say he got a girl\nYeah, it's true, you got a man\nBut the party ain't gon' stop\nSo let's make it hot, hot\n[Verse 1: Beyonc\u00e9]\nLast weekend, you stayed at home alone and lonely\nCouldn't find your man, he was chillin' with his homies\nThis weekend you're goin' out\nIf he try to stop you, you're goin' off\nYou got your hair done and your nails done too\nA new outfit and your Fendi shoes\nYou and your crew parlayin' at the hottest spot\nTonight you're gonna\nFind the fellas rollin' in the Lexus, trucks and Hummers\n\n[Refrain: Destiny's Child]\nThough he say he got a girl\nYeah, it's true, you got a man\nBut the party ain't gon' stop\nSo let's make it hot,

some noise\nYou know you got the right to get your party on\nSo get your haircut and your car washed too\nLookin' like a star in your Armani suit, you need to look your best\n'Cause you're turnin' heads tonight\nYou're gonna find a sexy chica\nThat's gon' dance all night if you wanna\n\n[Refrain: Destiny's Child & Beyonc\u00e9]\nThough he say he got a girl (Oh)\nYeah, it's true, you got a man

        "lyrics": "The One with the Jam LyricsChandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting reading a book and hears the bed in Joey's room creaking, and does a 'Oh no, not again' look on his face.\n\nJOEY: (from bedroom) WHOAA!!\n\nCHANDLER: (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.\n\nOpening Credits\nMonica and Rachel\u2019s apartment, Ross and Rachel are entering\n\nMONICA: Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.\nROSS: Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?\n\nMONICA: Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.\n\nRACHEL: I didn't know there were docks.\n\nJoey and Chandler enter.\n\nJOEY: Hey.\n\nCHANDLER: Hey.\n\nROSS: Aww, is it broken?\n\nJOEY: No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is wearing)\n\nRACHEL: Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?\n\nJOEY: Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.\n\nCHANDLER: Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.\n\nJOEY: What is this? Fruit?\n\nRACHEL: Monica's making jam.\nJOEY: Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?\n\nCHANDLER: Because the kids need new shoes.\n\nMONICA: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)\n\nJOEY: This will just be my batch.\n\n[Scene: Street, Phoebe is being followed by some guy, as they pass a flower vendor. Phoebe turns around and the guy quickly picks up some flowers and continues following her.]\n\nPHOEBE: (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.\n\nGUY: You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....\n\nPHOEBE: What?\n\nGUY: One more chance Ursula, please?\n\nPHOEBE: Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.\n\nGUY: Wh..\n\nPHOEBE: Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.\n\nGUY: Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!\nPHOEBE: Oh, you're not a dingus.\n\nGUY: I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.\n\nPHOEBE: Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.\n\nGUY: Well thanks. (starts to leave)\n\nPHOEBE: Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?\n\nGUY: Not really.\n\nPHOEBE: Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.\n\nGUY: Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)\n\nPHOEBE: Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?\n\nGUY: Yeah, okay.\n\nPHOEBE: Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.\n\nGUY: Sorry.\n\nMonica and Rachel\u2019s apartment, Ross and Rachel are entering.\n\nRACHEL: Mon?\n\nROSS: Mon?\n\nRACHEL: (reading) \u201cGone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.\u201d\n\nROSS: Wait a minute, look.\n\nRACHEL: What?\n\nROSS: Look, look, look.\n\nRACHEL: What, what, what?\n\nROSS: It's an empty apartment.\n\nRACHEL: Oooh.\n\nROSS: We're all alone in an empty apartment.\n\nRACHEL: Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. (they fall onto the couch)\n(Chandler enters and they both jump up and pretend that Ross is showing her something in the couch)\n\nROSS: There it is.\n\nRACHEL: Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.\n\nROSS: Hey.\n\nCHANDLER: Do I look fat?\n\nROSS AND RACHEL: Noo.\n\nCHANDLER: Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.\n\nRACHEL: Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.\n\nCHANDLER: Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....\n\nROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?\n\nRACHEL: Nooo!\n\nROSS: And it works both ways.\n\nCHANDLER: Okay, so you both just know this stuff?\n\nRACHEL: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.\n\nROSS: Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?\n\nCHANDLER: That's easy, baggage claim.\n\nROSS: (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.\n\nCHANDLER: Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.\n\n\nRACHEL: Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddly sleepers. (Chandler makes a disgusted face) Okay, I'm late for work.\n\nROSS: Oh.\n\nRACHEL: All right are you guys gonna come down?\n\nROSS: Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.\n\nRACHEL: Good luck Chandler.\n\nCHANDLER: Thank you Rachel.\n\nROSS: Bye sweetie.\n\nRACHEL: Bye hon.\n\nROSS: (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.\n\nCHANDLER: Well, I thought you guys were cuddly sleepers.\n\nROSS: Noo! No, not cuddly, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...\n\nCHANDLER: Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)\n\nROSS: I'm gonna use the cushion.\n\nCHANDLER: Yeah.\n\nROSS: Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.\n\nCHANDLER: Okay, the old hug and roll.\n\nROSS: Yep.\n\nCHANDLER: Okay, one question.\n\nROSS: Shoot.\n\nCHANDLER: You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?\n\nCentral Perk, Joey is putting jam on his muffin, lots of jam.\n\nJOEY: Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?\n\nRACHEL: (Looks at him) You're so pretty.\n\nPHOEBE: (entering) Hi!\n\nAll: Hey, Phoebe.\n\nPHOEBE: Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.\n\nJOEY: (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?\n\nPHOEBE: Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.\n\nCHANDLER: Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.\n\nPHOEBE: Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a teensy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.\n\nROSS: Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.\n\nPHOEBE: No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.\n\nJOEY: (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)\n\nPHOEBE: Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.\n\nMONICA: (entering) Hey guys.\n\nALL: Hey Mon.\n\nMONICA: Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry currant.\n\nJOEY: Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!\n\nCHANDLER: Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)\n\nJOEY: Put your hands together.\n\nMONICA: Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.\n\nJOEY: No more jam?!\n\nRACHEL: Well, what happened to your jam plan?\n\nMONICA: I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.\n\nCHANDLER: Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.\n\nROSS: What are you talking about?\n\nMONICA: I'm talking about me having a baby.\n\nROSS: What?\n\nRACHEL: Are you serious?\n\nMONICA: Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.\n\nROSS: Well, aren't you forgettin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!\n\nMONICA: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.\n\nCHANDLER: That, that's what's stupid.\n\nMONICA: I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.\n\nRACHEL: Down at the docks again?\n\nChandler's bedroom, Janice and him are cuddling.\n\nJanice: Night-night Bing-a-ling.\n\nCHANDLER: Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) \u201cLook at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1\u20262\u20263!\" (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)\n\nCentral Perk, Malcolm is giving Phoebe all of his spy equipment.\n\nMALCOLM: Here's my binoculars.\n\nPHOEBE: Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.\n\nMALCOLM: These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Libs, they're just for fun.\n\nPHOEBE: Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)\n\nMALCOM: Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?\n\nPHOEBE: Um, not even a little bit.\n\nMALCOM: It's about you.\n\nPHOEBE: Oh, okay then.\n\nMALCOM: (reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me even though I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.\n\nPHOEBE: Good. So what were you thinking?\n\nMALCOM: I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.\n\nPHOEBE: Really?\n\nMALCOM: No.\n\nPHOEBE: Oh.\n\nMALCOM: See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.\n\nPHOEBE: Oh, okay. (he kisses her)\n\nMonica and Rachel\u2019s apartment, Joey is eating jam straight out of the jar, and Chandler is staring at him in amazement. Joey offers him some.\n\nCHANDLER: No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.\n\nMONICA: (entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2\", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.\n\nCHANDLER: You mean there's more than one of us.\n\nROSS: Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....\n\nMONICA: You're gonna what?\n\nROSS: I'm gonna tell Mom.\n\nRACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.\n\nROSS: Crazy.\n\nMONICA: What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....\n\nROSS: (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...\n\nMONICA: Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?\n\nJOEY: Check it out!! Jam crackers!\n\nMONICA: Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy.

(goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.\n\nRACHEL: When did you go to a sperm bank?\n\nJOEY: Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?\n\nCHANDLER: And that's how you bought it?\n\nJOEY: Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.\n\nMONICA: Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.\n\nJOEY: Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.\n\nPHOEBE: (entering) Hellooo!\n\nALL: Hey.\n\nROSS: How's the maniac?\n\nPHOEBE: Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.\n\nRACHEL: Phoebe, what are you doing?\n\nPHOEBE: Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.\n\nRACHEL: Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.\n\nPHOEBE: Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.\n\nROSS: You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?\n\nPHOEBE: What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?\n\nCHANDLER: Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.\n\nPHOEBE: What are you saying I should do?\n\nMONICA: I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.\n\nPHOEBE: Thank you, Monica.\n\nJOEY: Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.\n\nMONICA: Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.\n\nCentral Perk.\n\nRACHEL: Oh my God, what happened?

No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.\n\nRACHEL: (turns around, not amused) Ross's what?\n\nJANICE: You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.\n\nSubway station, Phoebe is following Malcolm by finding behind the pillars until she comes up to one with a wire mesh garbage can next to it. Malcolm stops and starts walking the other way and passes Phoebe, who quick tries to hide behind the garbage can. But, Malcolm sees her.\n\nMALCOLM: Phoebe?\n\nPHOEBE: Yes? Yes! Oh.\n\nMALCOLM: What are you doing?\n\nPHOEBE: Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)\n\nMALCOLM: Were you following me?\n\nPHOEBE: Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.\n\nMALCOLM: So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.\n(Ursula walks past, and Malcolm finds behind the pillar)\n\nPHOEBE: Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?\n\nMALCOLM: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.\n\nPHOEBE: No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.\n\n\nMALCOLM: Uh-huh, I don't know.\n\nPHOEBE: Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?\n\nMonica and Rachel's, Joey is entering.\n\nJOEY: Hey.\n\nMONICA: Hey.\n\nJOEY: Where you going?\n\nMONICA: To the bank.\n\nJOEY: Sperm or regular?\n\nMONICA: Sperm.\n\nJOEY: So you're really doing this, huh?\n\nMONICA: Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.\n\nJOEY: Sounds nice.\n\nMONICA: 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...\n\nJOEY: No kiddin', hmm.\n\nMONICA: What?\n\nJOEY: No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.\n\nMONICA: Really? Why?\n\nJOEY: I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.\n\nMONICA: Hoyt?\n\nJOEY: It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.\n\nMONICA: Really, is he a swimmer?\n\nJOEY: He's got the body for it.\n\nMONICA: I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?\n\nJOEY: You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.\n\nMONICA: We do not have one of those signs.\n\nJOEY: Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.\n\nMONICA: Two girls and a boy?\n\nJOEY: Yeah!\n\nMONICA: And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.\n\nJOEY: Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good too.\n\nMONICA: Yeah.\n\nJOEY: Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for like a day. (hugs her again)\n(Suddenly Malcolm is looking through Monica's window with his binoculars and then knocks. Both Monica and Joey turn around to see who it is.)\n\nMONICA: She'll be back at 5! (Malcolm motions he can't hear her.) (Monica holds up her hand as does Joey) Five! (Malcolm gives thumbs up and leaves.)\n\nClosing Credits\nMonica and Rachel\u2019s apartment, Joey is finishing off the last of the jam.\n\nJOEY: I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribbiani. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if they met me in person.\n\nRACHEL: Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)\n\nJOEY: (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?\n\nRACHEL: Yeah.\n\nROSS: (entering) Hello.\n\nRACHEL: Hello.\n\nROSS: (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?\n\nCHANDLER: Sure. What's up?\n\nROSS: Just one uh, one additional relationship thought.
