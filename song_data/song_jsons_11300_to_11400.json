bones along the way\nI knew it wouldn't\nLast forever, semi-pro always means semi-paid\nI started climbing' drilling' rig, I'm oil field trash and\nProud as I can be\nThen I took my songs and guitar and sang'em to a man from Tennessee\n[Chorus]\nI've played every beer joint tavern from New York City out to Pasadena\nEvery corn dog fair and rodeo\nAnd sold out every basketball arena\nI like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city\nToo\nI am a red, white and blue blood graduate of honkytonk U\n\n[Verse 2]\nA star can't burn forever, and the brightest ones will someday lose their shine\nBut the glass won't\nEver be half empty in my optimistic mind\nI'll still have a song to sing and a band to turn it up and\nPlay it loud\nAs long as there's a bar room with a corner stage and a

all lights my life's like\nRiding in Cashville and running all stop lights\nHomie is that real, I pray I keep living\nMy momma just had a dream of seeing me in prison (damn!)\nMy daddy's a dope fiend, and I don't really miss him (fuck him!)\nAin't seen him in 10 years and a nigga still living\nThe same old two step we move to a rhythm\n50 holla get 'em Buck, you know I'm gonna get 'em,

Bitches doing what the thugs do\nGDs, Vice Lords, Crips and the Bloods too\nMove let me come through\nAin't a pair of handcuffs, can hold me\nI'm riding in the old school listening to some oldies\nMy gold keep shinin', them hoes keep crying\nThe handle of my .45 outlined in diamonds\nJust left Cashville, bout to fly to Miami\nHopin' Yayo watchin' Eminem perform at the Grammys\nThe reason niggas like Eric Benet, probably can't stand me\nCause I know money will make Halle Berry come out them panties, bitch!\nY'all niggas in trouble they should of never let me in-in\nYou might also like[Hook:

same love when we hug no more\nAnd I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now\nAfter all the years we've been down\nAin't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true\nWe family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nWe were so young, so full of life and vibrance\nSide by side, wherever you was riding, I went\nSo close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit\nWhen Ronnie died, you was right by my side\nWith a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes\nAnd a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it\nYou even had the same type of childhood I did\nSometimes I just wanna know why is it\nThat you succame to yours and mine, I survived it\nYou ran the streets, I nine-to-fived it\nWe grew up, grew apart as time went by us\nThen I blew up, to both yours and mines surprises\nNow I feel a vibe, I just can't describe it\nMuch as your pride tries to hide it\nYou're cold, your touch is just like ice\nAnd your eyes is a look of resentment\nI can sense it and I don't like it\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nHow come we don't even talk no more?\nAnd you don't even call no more?\nWe don't barely keep in touch at all\nAnd I don't even feel the same love when

killed a nigga first\n'Fore I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome\nBitch that I wasn't with, I woulda hit it and quit\nBut you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit\nI told you don't get involved with her\nYou would smoke in the car with her\nComing out of the bar with her, stumbling, half-drunk\nLike y'all was husband and wife or something\nBut me catching her fuckin' other niggas\nMust've hurt your pride or something\n'Cause you woof off at the mouth to people\nLike you want it with me\nWhen all I tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty\nAnd ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced\nYou acting like I ain't your mans and lying like she can't be loose\nBut I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth\nDon't hate the game or the player, the one that's changing is you\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nHow come we don't even talk no more?\nAnd you don't even call no more?\nWe don't barely keep in touch at

just happen\nBut Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown\nShady made it so my babies ain't starving at home\nSee the devil in your glance, since the ghetto, we been friends\nForever real intelligence, that's forever till the end\nI peep the hatreds in your eyes and the Satan in your lies\nAin't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise\nHow come when you talk, it's with bitter and spite?\nAnd how come it was my fault for what you did with your life?\nAnd every time I go to hear you and play, you look away\nWe barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face\n\n[Chorus:

gettin' wild for me\nAnd all the pretty chicks all wanna smile at me\nThese rap cats man they all got they style from me\nAnd if I ever seen them then they probably bow to me\nAnd when this beat drop I know they gon' lean\nWorld debut, I know they gon' fiend\nEverything, Mississippi to the Palm Springs\nGirls from brunettes down to blonde queens\nThese young boys don't know what a don mean\nI'm just a bad boy gone clean\nI'm the diamond chain choker, always remain sober\nDon't drink liquor and all the games over\nNeed a plane, I explain it to my broker\nThree bots in the hood top down, it ain't nova (My homie)\nYou know there's more man where that come from\nMe and Cudda Love rollin' back to back in one\n[Chorus]\nSee the names have all changed since I been around\nBut the game ain't the same since I left out\nOoh, you know we need ya, ooh, you know we need ya\nRight here's where we need ya, right here's where we need ya\nWelcome back\nWelcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)\nWelcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)\nYou know you like that\nWelcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)\nYou know you like that\nWelcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)\n\n[Verse 2: Ma$e]\nSee I rep the most high, still I'm the most fly\nWin so much, they wanna know who I'm coached by\nEveryday approached by chicks when I was on top\nWanna give me sosa, but I'm like don't try\nI see the hisses and the disses when I go by\nBut see the misses on my wristses when I float by\nSelf control, and I can't tell you no lie\nTryin' to find a soulmate, you end up being so tired\nI make my money man without the coca\nLivin' the vida without the loca\nI'm down south so they show me country love\nAnd I ain't even country thug\nThe people give me daps and hugs, so it must be love\nAnd I love the country grub\nIt feel good to hear people singing welcome back\nAnd I ain't even sellin' the track, cause I'm that Harlem cat\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSee the names have all changed since I been around\nBut the game ain't the same since I left out\nOoh, you know we need ya, ooh, you know we need

stupid! What type of facts are those?\nIf you grew up with holes in your zapatos\nYou'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough\nI'm like, \"Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!\nIf you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.\"\nGot beef with radio if I don't play they show\nThey don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so\nRap mags try and use my black ass\nSo advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads\nFuckers, I don't know what you take me as\nOr understand the intelligence that Jay Z has\nI'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb\nI got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one \u2013 hit me!\n[Chorus]\n99 problems, but a bitch ain't one\nIf you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son\nI got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one \u2013 hit me!\n[Verse 2]\nThe year is '94, in my trunk is raw\nIn my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law\nGot two choices, y'all: pull over the car or\nBounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor\nAnd I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake\nPlus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case\nSo I pull over to the side of the road\nI heard, \"Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?\"\n\u2018Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?\nDo I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know\nAm I under arrest or should I guess some more?\n\"Well, you was doing 55 in a 54\nLicense and registration and step out of the car\nAre you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.\"\nI ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit\n\"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?\"\nWell, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back\nAnd I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that\n\"Aren't you sharp as a tack?\nYou some type of lawyer or something?\nSomebody important or something?\"\nWell, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit\nEnough that you won't illegally search my shit\n\"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!\"\nI got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one \u2013 hit me!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n99 problems, but a bitch ain't one\nIf you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son\nI got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one \u2013 hit me!\n99 problems, but a bitch ain't one\nIf you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son\nI got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow once upon a time not too long ago\nA nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho\nThis is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy\nBut a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me\nI try to ignore him, talk to the Lord\nPray for him, but some fools just love to perform\nYou know the type, loud as a motorbike\nBut wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight\nAnd only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'\nAnd he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain\nAnd there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again\nBack through the system with the riff-raff again\nFiends on the floor, scratchin' again\nPaparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em\nD.A. try to give a nigga shaft again\nHalf a mil' for bail \u2018cause I'm African\nAll because this fool was harassin' them\nTryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine\nBut ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun\nI got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one \u2013 hit me!\n[Chorus]\n99 problems, but a bitch ain't one\nIf you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son\nI got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one \u2013 hit me!\n\n[Outro]\nYou crazy for this one, Rick\nIt's your boy130Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/766875", "artist_names": "Cassidy (Ft.

game?\nGot the keys to my dad's old truck\nTurn the radio on\nStill remember the song\nWe held hands and there it was\nLove....\n\nThe page just kept on turning\nThere i was with someone else\nFirst time in my life time\nI wasn't livin for myself\n\nI knew i wasn't fallin\nAnywhere I fell before\nThis place was different\nIt was deeper it was more...\nThen it took on a brand new meaning\nYeah it was strong and it was true\nKnew what I had to do...\n\nFound a ring\nHit my knees\nCouldn't talk\nCouldn't breathe...\nMy heart had me all choked up\nSaid \"I do,\"\nAs we cried\nWedding bells\nWaved good bye\nThe whole church knew it was\nLove....\nYou might also likeThen it took on a brand new meaning\nWhen the docter said \"It's time to watch your miracle arrive.\"\n\nThank the Lord\nCut the

two, you\u2014\nOne, two, three\nYoung Hov's a snake charmer, move your body like a snake, mama\nMake me wanna put the snake on you\nI'm on my eighth summer\nStill hot, Young's the eighth wonder\nAll I do is get bread\u2014yeah, I take Wonder\nI take one of your chicks straight from under your armpit\nThe black Brad Pitt, I mack 'til six in the AM\nAll day I'm P-I-M-P, I am simply\nAttached to the track like SMPTE\nIt's simply good, Young Hov, infinitely hood\nNi tu kari na kise de naal pyaar\nMundeya to bach ke rahi\nNi tu hune hune hoyi muteyaar\nMundeya to bach ke rahi\n\n[Jay-Z (over Labh

ain't gotta tell you, but it's ya boy Hov\nFrom the U.S., you just lay down slow\nCatch ya boy mingle in England, meddling in the Netherlands\nChecking in daily under aliases\nWe rebellious, we back home, screaming, \"Leave Iraq alone!\"\nBut all my soldiers in the field, I will wish you safe return\nBut only love kills war when will they learn\nIt's international Hov, been having a flow\nBefore Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow\nBefore Ronald Reagan got Manhattan the blow\nBefore I was cabbing it there back and forth\nRaw we had it all day, Papi in the hallway\nCop one on consignment to give you more yay\nYea, but that's another stor-ay\nBut for now, mami, turn it around and let the boy play (Jay)\n[Jay Z over Labh Janjua's verse]\nNahi teri jehi Sohni koi naar\nMundeya to bach ke

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nStormin' through the party like my name was El Ni\u00f1o\nWhen I'm hangin' out drinkin' in the back of an El Camino\nAs a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name\nTrashed my own house party 'cause nobody came\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWell, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school\nNever goin', never showin' up when we had to\nAttention that we crave\nDon't tell us to behave\nI'm sick of always hearin' \"act your age\"\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna waste my time\nBecome another casualty of society\nI'll never fall in line\nBecome another victim of your conformity and back down\n\n[Verse 2]\nBecause you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall\nBut what would you expect with a conscience so small?\nHeavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised\nMaiden and Priest were the gods that we praised\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense, and\nCuttin' people down is just a minor offense, then\nIt's none of your concern\nI guess I'll never learn\nI'm sick of being told to wait my turn\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna waste my time\nBecome another casualty of society\nI'll never fall in line\nBecome another victim of your conformity and back down\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't count on me\nTo let you know when\nDon't count on me\nI'll do it again\nDon't count on me\nIt's the point you're missin'\nDon't count on me\n'Cause I'm not listenin'\nYou might also like[Breakdown]\nWell, I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat\nBack-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothin'\nYou be standin' on the corner talking all that kufuffin\nBut you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffin'\n'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringin' off the hook\nYou're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book\nI like songs with distortion\nTo drink in proportion\nThe doctor said my mom should've had an abortion\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna waste my time\nBecome another casualty of society\nI'll never fall in line\nBecome another victim of your conformity and back down\n\n[Outro]\n(Waste my time with them)\nCasualty of society\n(Waste my time with them)\nVictim of your conformity and back down29Embed"}, {"_type":

when we turn 25\nKeep thinking times will never change\nKeep on thinking things will always be the same (Be the same)\nBut when we leave this year we won't be coming back\nNo more hanging out cause we're on a different track\nAnd if you got something that you need to say\nYou better say it right now cause you don't have another day (Another day)\n'Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down\nThese memories are playing like a film without sound\nAnd I keep thinking of that night in June\nI didn't know much of love, but it came too soon (Came too soon)\nAnd there was me and you, and then we got real blue\nStay at home talking on the telephone with me\nWe'd get so excited, we'd get so scared\nLaughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair\nAnd this is how it feels\n[Chorus]\nAs we go on\nWe remember\nAll the times we\nHad together\nAnd as our lives change\nCome whatever\nWe will still be\nFriends forever\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo if we get the big jobs, and we make the big money\nWhen we look back now, will our jokes still be funny?\nWill we still remember everything we learned in school?\nStill be trying to break every single rule (Every rule)\nWill little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man?\nCan Heather find a job that won't interfere with a tan?\nI keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye (Goodbye)\nKeep on thinking it's a time to fly\nAnd this is how it feels\n\n[Chorus]\nAs we go on\nWe remember\nAll the times we\nHad together\nAnd as our lives change\nCome whatever\nWe will still be\nFriends forever\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nLa, la, la,

song, yo\nThis song is for all the women out there\nThat have been lied to by their men\nAnd I know y'all been lied to over and over again\nThis is for y'all, yo, maybe you didn't break\nThe way you should've broke, yo\nBut I break, you know I'm sayin'?\nSo this is how it goes yo\nPsst... damn\nYo\n[Verse 1]\nLast year, Valentine's Day, you would just warmly say\n\"Babe I love you, love you, babe I swear\" (Yo, he's lying)\nHeld you when you were sick, even...\nThe whole time I'd think to myself, this isn't fair\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is this I see? You don't come home to me (No! Oh no!)\nWhen you don't come home to me, can't deal, can't bear (Man)\nYou keep tellin' me lies, but to your surprise\nLook, I found her red coat and you're (Bitch!) caught out there\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo sick of your games, I'll set your truck to flames\nAnd watch it blow up, blow up - tell me, how you gonna see her now?\nSo far from sincere, fabrications in my ear (I love you)\nDrive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is this I see? You don't come home to me (I don't believe this!)\nWhen you don't come home to me, I can't deal, can't bear (I won't)\nYou keep tellin' me lies, but to your surprise\nLook, I hope you're happy since you're caught out there\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nYeah, you've been caught\nYo, come on\nCome on\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe's so raunchy, so vulgar; not me, why the hell her?\nLook, she dresses a mess, what do you see? (Look at her! I don't know)\nIt's not all about cash, nor how much you flash (Hell no)\nHow I dress is a reflection of me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is this I see? You don't come home to me (Uh-uh)\nWhen you don't come home to me, can't deal, can't bear (Told you I won't)\nYou keep tellin' me lies, but to your surprise\nLook I got something for y'all since you're caught out there\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now! I hate you so much right now!\nAaaaaaaaaaaah! I hate you so much right now!\nI hate you so much right now!

Work LyricsYou know nothin's gettin' done\nWhen talk is all you hear\nLike someone revvin' up a truck\nThey never put in gear\nBut you don't see a cowboy run his mouth\nAnd strut around\nHe just takes the bull by the horns\nAnd throws him to the ground\nTakin' care of business not just puttin' on a show\nWhen it gets down to it, everybody knows\nIt ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done\nIf it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun\nIt ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts\nThunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work\n\nYou can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground\nArgue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down\nYou can stand there in the dark cussin' at the night\nOr you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light\nThere ain't no limit in this life to how far you can get\nBut if you're goin' all the way you gotta break a sweat\n\nIt ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done\nIf it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun\nIt ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts\nThunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work\n\nI've heard thunder talkin' up a storm\nRattlin' my windows and knockin' on my door\nBut I've seen lightnin' blow a cypress tree in half\nThe thunder's busy talkin', and lightnin's kickin'\n\n--- Instrumental ---\n\nIt ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done\nIf it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun\nIt ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts\nThunder's just a noise, boys,

have you reckon'd the earth much?\nHave you practis'd so long to learn to read?\nHave you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?\nStop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,\nYou shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)\nYou shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,\nYou shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,\nYou shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.\n\n3\n\nI have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the\nBeginning and the end,\nBut I do not talk of the beginning or the end.\nThere was never any more inception than there is now,\nNor any more youth or age than there is now,\nAnd will never be any more perfection than there is now,\nNor any more heaven or hell than there is now.\nUrge and urge and urge,\nAlways the procreant urge of the world.\nOut of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,\nAlways a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.\nTo elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is so.\n\nSure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well\nentretied, braced in the beams,\nStout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,\nI and this mystery here we stand.\n\nClear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is\nnot my soul.\nLack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,\nTill that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.\nShowing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,\nKnowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while\nthey discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.\nWelcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man\nhearty and clean,\nNot an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.\n\nI am satisfied \u2014 I see, dance, laugh, sing;\nAs the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side\nthrough the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day\nwith stealthy tread,\nLeaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the\nhouse with their plenty,\nShall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,\nThat they turn from gazing after and down the road,\nAnd forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,\nExactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and\nwhich is ahead?\n\n4\n\nTrippers and askers surround me,\nPeople I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,\nThe latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors\nold and new,\nMy dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,\nThe real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,\nThe sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or\nloss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,\nBattles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful\nnews, the fitful events;\nThese come to me days and nights and go from me again,\nBut they are not the Me myself.\nApart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,\nStands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,\nLooks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,\nLooking with side-curved head curious what will come next,\nBoth in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.\nBackward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,\nI have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.\n\n5\n\nI believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,\nAnd you must not be abased to the other.\nLoafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,\nNot words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture,\nnot even the best,\nOnly the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\nI mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,\nHow you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,\nAnd parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your\ntongue to my bare-stript heart,\nAnd reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held\nmy feet.\nSwiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,\nAnd I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\nAnd I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\nAnd that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the\nwomen my sisters and lovers,\n\nAnd that a kelson of the creation is love,\nAnd limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,\nAnd brown ants in the little wells beneath them,\nAnd mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder,\nmullein and poke-weed.\n\n6\n\nA child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full\nHands,\nHow could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any\nMore than he.\nI guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful\nGreen stuff woven.\nOr I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\nA scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,\nBearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we\nMay see and remark, and say Whose?\nOr I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the\nVegetation.\nOr I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,\nAnd it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow\nZones,\nGrowing among black folks as among white,\nKanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the\nSame, I receive them the same.\nAnd now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\n\nTenderly will I use you curling grass,\nIt may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,\nIt may be if I had known them I would have loved them,\nIt may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken\nSoon out of their mothers' laps,\nAnd here you are the mothers' laps.\nThis grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old\nMothers,\nDarker than the colourless beards of old men,\nDark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\n\nO I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,\nAnd I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths\nFor nothing.\nI wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men\nAnd women,\nAnd the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring\nTaken soon out of their laps.\nWhat do you think has become of the young and old men?\nAnd what do you think has become of the women and\nChildren?\nThey are alive and well somewhere,\nThe smallest sprout shows there is really no death,\nAnd if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at\nThe end to arrest it,\nAnd ceas'd the moment life appear'd.\n\nAll goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,\nAnd to die is different from what any one supposed, and\nLuckier.\n\n7\n\nHas any one supposed it lucky to be born?\nI hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I\nKnow it.\nI pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd\nBabe, and am not contain'd between my hat and boots,\nAnd peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one\nGood,\nThe earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all\nGood.\nI am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,\nI am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal\nAnd fathomless as myself,\n(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\nEvery kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and\nFemale,\nFor me those that have been boys and that love women,\nFor me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be\nSlighted,\n\nFor me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and\nThe mothers of mothers,\nFor me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,\nFor me children and the begetters of children.\nUndrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,\nI see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,\nAnd am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot\nBe shaken away.\n\n8\n\nThe little one sleeps in its cradle,\nI lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away\nFlies with my hand.\n\nThe youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy\nHill,\nI peeringly view them from the top.\n\nThe suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,\nI witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the\nPistol has fallen.\nThe blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of\nThe promenaders,\nThe heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb,\nThe clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,\nThe snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,\nThe hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,\nThe flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the\nHospital,\nThe meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\nThe excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly\nWorking his passage to the centre of the crowd,\nThe impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\nWhat groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or\nIn fits,\nWhat exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry\nHome and give birth to babes,\n\nWhat living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what\nhowls restrain'd by decorum,\nArrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made,\nacceptances, rejections with convex lips,\nI mind them or the show or resonance of them \u2014 I come and I\ndepart.\n\n9\n\nThe big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\nThe dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn\nwagon,\nThe clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,\nThe armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.\nI am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,\nI felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\nI jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and\ntimothy,\nAnd roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\n\n10\n\nAlone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,\nWandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,\nFalling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\n\nThe Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle\nand scud,\nMy eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously\nfrom the deck.\n\nThe boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\nI tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\nYou should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\n\nI saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far\nwest, the bride was a red girl,\nHer father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,\nOn a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\nShe had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her feet.\n\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\nAnd went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\nAnd brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and\nbruis'd feet,\nAnd gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\nAnd remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd north,\nI had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the corner.\n\n11\n\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\nTwenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\nShe owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,\nShe hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the\nwindow.\nWhich of the young men does she like the best?\nAh the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\n\nWhere are you off to, lady? for I see you,\nYou splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\n\nDancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\nThe rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\n\nThe beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from\ntheir long hair,\nLittle streams pass'd all over their bodies.\n\nAn unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,\nIt descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\nThe young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge\nto the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\nThey do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and\nbending arch,\nThey do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\n12\n\nThe butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his\nknife at the stall in the market,\nI loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\n\nBlacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\nEach has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great\nheat in the fire.\n\nFrom the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their movements,\nThe lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive\narms,\nOverhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\nThey do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\n\n13\n\nThe negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block\nSwags underneath on its tied-over chain,\nThe negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady\nAnd tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string-piece,\nHis blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens\nOver his hip-band,\nHis glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of\nHis hat away from his forehead,\nThe sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the\nBlack of his polish'd and perfect limbs.\n\nI behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not\nStop there,\nI go with the team also.\n\nIn me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well\nAs forward sluing,\nTo niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object\nMissing,\nAbsorbing all to myself and for this song.\n\nOxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade,\nWhat is that you express in your eyes?\nIt seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\nMy tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my\nDistant and day-long ramble,\nThey rise together, they slowly circle around.\n\nI believe in those wing'd purposes,\nAnd acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\nAnd consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\nAnd do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not\nSomething else,\nAnd the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills\nPretty well to me,\nAnd the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\n14\n\nThe wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\nYa-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\nThe pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\nFind its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\n\nThe sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the housesill,\nThe chickadee, the prairie-dog,\nThe litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\nThe brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread\nWings,\nI see in them and myself the same old law.\n\nThe press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred\nAffections,\nThey scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\nI am enamour'd of growing out-doors,\nOf men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\nOf the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes\nAnd mauls, and the drivers of horses,\nI can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take\nMe,\nNot asking the sky to come down to my good will,\nScattering it freely forever.\n\n15\n\nThe pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\nThe carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane\nWhistles its wild ascending lisp,\nThe married and unmarried children ride home to their\nThanksgiving dinner,\nThe pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong\nArm,\nThe mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon\nAre ready,\n\nThe duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,\nThe deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar,\nThe spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big\nWheel,\nThe farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe\nAnd looks at the oats and rye,\nThe lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,\n(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his\nMother's bedroom;)\nThe jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his\nCase,\nHe turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the\nManuscript;\nThe malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,\nWhat is removed drops horribly in a pail;\nThe quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard\nNods by the bar-room stove,\nThe machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his\nBeat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,\nThe young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him,\nThough I do not know him;)\nThe half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,\nThe western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean\nOn their rifles, some sit on logs,\nOut from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position,\nLevels his piece;\nThe groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,\nAs the woolly-pates ho in the sugar-field, the overseer views\nThem from his saddle,\nThe bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their\nPartners, the dancers bow to each other,\nThe youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and harks to\nThe musical rain,\nThe Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,\nThe squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth is offering\nMoccasins and bead-bags for sale,\nThe connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with\nHalf-shut eyes bent sideways,\n\nAs the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is\nThrown for the shore-going passengers,\nThe young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister\nWinds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the\nKnots,\nThe one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago\nBorne her first child,\nThe clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine\nOr in the factory or mill,\nThe paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the\nReporter's lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the signpainter\nIs lettering with blue and gold,\nThe canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts\nAt his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,\nThe conductor beats time for the band and all the performers\nFollow him,\nThe child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,\nThe regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the\nWhite sails sparkle!)\nThe drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,\nThe pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser\nHiggling about the odd cent;)\nThe bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the\nClock moves slowly,\nThe opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd lips,\nThe prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her\nTipsy and pimpled neck,\nThe crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and\nWink to each other,\n(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)\nThe President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the\nGreat Secretaries,\nOn the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with\nTwined arms,\nThe crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in\nThe hold,\nThe Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his\nCattle,\n\nAs the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by\nThe jingling of loose change,\nThe floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the\nRoof, the masons are calling for mortar,\nIn single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the\nLaborers;\nSeasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is\nGather'd, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes\nOf cannon and small arms!)\nSeasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the\nMower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;\nOff on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole\nIn the frozen surface,\nThe stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter\nStrikes deep with his axe,\nFlatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood\nOr pecan-trees,\nCoon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through\nThose drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,\nTorches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or\nAltamahaw,\nPatriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and\nGreat-grandsons around them,\nIn walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers\nAfter their day's sport,\nThe city sleeps and the country sleeps,\nThe living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,\nThe old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband\nSleeps by his wife;\nAnd these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,\nAnd such as it is to be of these more or less I am,\nAnd of these one and all I weave the song of myself.\n\n16\n\nI am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,\nRegardless of others, ever regardful of others,\nMaternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,\nStuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff\nThat is fine,\nOne of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same\nAnd the largest the same,\nA Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant\nAnd hospitable down by the Oconee I live,\nA Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the\nLimberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,\nA Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin\nLeggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,\nA boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier,\nBadger, Buck-eye;\nAt home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with\nFishermen off Newfoundland,\nAt home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and\nTacking,\nAt home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine,\nOr the Texan ranch,\nComrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners,\n(loving their big proportions,)\nComrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake\nHands and welcome to drink and meat,\nA learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,\nA novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,\nOf every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,\nA farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,\nPrisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.\nI resist any thing better than my own diversity,\nBreathe the air but leave plenty after me,\nAnd am not stuck up, and am in my place.\n(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,\nThe bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in\nTheir place,\nThe palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)\n\n17\n\nThese are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands,\nThey are not original with me,\nIf they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or\nNext to nothing,\nIf they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they\nAre nothing,\nIf they are not just as close as they are distant they are\nNothing.\nThis is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the\nWater is,\nThis the common air that bathes the globe.\n18\nWith music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,\nI play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches\nFor conquer'd and slain persons.\nHave you heard that it was good to gain the day?\nI also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in\nWhich they are won.\nI beat and pound for the dead,\nI blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for\nThem.\nVivas to those who have fail'd!\nAnd to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!\nAnd to those themselves who sank in the sea!\nAnd to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome\nHeroes!\nAnd the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest\nHeroes known!\n\n19\n\nThis is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,\nIt is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make\nAppointments with all,\nI will not have a single person slighted or left away,\nThe kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,\nThe heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;\nThere shall be no difference between them and the rest.\nThis is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of\nHair,\n\nThis the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,\nThis the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,\nThis the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.\n\nDo you guess I have some intricate purpose?\nWell I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica\nOn the side of a rock has.\nDo you take it I would astonish?\nDoes the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering\nThrough the woods?\nDo I astonish more than they?\nThis hour I tell things in confidence,\nI might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.\n\n20\n\nWho goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;\nHow is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?\nWhat is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?\nAll I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,\nElse it were time lost listening to me.\nI do not snivel that snivel the world over,\nThat months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.\nWhimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids,\nConformity goes to the fourth-remov'd,\nI wear my hat as I please indoors or out.\nWhy should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\nHaving pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd\nWith doctors and calculated close,\nI find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.\nIn all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,\nAnd the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.\nI know I am solid and sound,\nTo me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,\nAll are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.\nI know I am deathless,\nI know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,\nI know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt\nStick at night.\n\nI know I am august,\nI do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,\nI see that the elementary laws never apologize,\n(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house\nBy, after all.)\n\nI exist as I am, that is enough,\nIf no other in the world be aware I sit content,\nAnd if each and all be aware I sit content.\n\nOne world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is\nMyself,\nAnd whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or\nTen million years,\nI can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can\nWait.\n\nMy foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,\nI laugh at what you call dissolution,\nAnd I know the amplitude of time.\n\n21\n\nI am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,\nThe pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are\nWith me,\nThe first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I\nTranslate into a new tongue.\nI am the poet of the woman the same as the man,\nAnd I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,\nAnd I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.\n\nI chant the chant of dilation or pride,\nWe have had ducking and deprecating about enough,\nI show that size is only development.\n\nHave you outstript the rest? are you the President?\nIt is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and\nStill pass on.\n\nI am he that walks with the tender and growing night,\nI call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.\n\nPress close bare-bosom'd night \u2014 press close magnetic\nNourishing night!\nNight of south winds \u2014 night of the large few stars!\nStill nodding night \u2014 mad naked summer night.\n\nSmile O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!\nEarth of the slumbering and liquid trees!\nEarth of departed sunset \u2014 earth of the mountains misty-topt!\nEarth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!\nEarth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!\nEarth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!\nFar-swooping elbow'd earth \u2014 rich apple-blossom'd earth!\nSmile, for your lover comes.\n\nProdigal, you have given me love \u2014 therefore I to you give\nLove!\nO unspeakable passionate love.\n\n22\n\nYou sea! I resign myself to you also \u2014 I guess what you mean,\nI behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,\nI believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,\nWe must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of\nSight of the land,\nCushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,\nDash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.\n\nSea of stretch'd ground-swells,\nSea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,\nSea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet always-ready\nGraves,\nHowler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,\nI am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.\n\nPartaker of influx and efflux, I, extoller of hate and conciliation,\nExtoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.\n\nI am he attesting sympathy,\n(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house\nThat supports them?)\nI am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the\nPoet of wickedness also.\n\nWhat blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\nEvil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand\nIndifferent,\nMy gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,\nI moisten the roots of all that has grown.\n\nDid you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?\nDid you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and\nRectified?\n\nI find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,\nSoft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,\nThoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.\n\nThis minute that comes to me over the past decillions,\nThere is no better than it and now.\n\nWhat behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not\nSuch a wonder,\nThe wonder is always and always how there can be a mean\nMan or an infidel.\n\n23\n\nEndless unfolding of words of ages!\nAnd mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.\n\nA word of the faith that never balks,\nHere or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time\nAbsolutely.\n\nIt alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,\nThat mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.\n\nI accept Reality and dare not question it,\nMaterialism first and last imbuing.\n\nHurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!\nFetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,\nThis is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a\nGrammar of the old cartouches,\nThese mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown\nSeas,\nThis is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a\nMathematician.\n\nGentlemen, to you the first honors always!\nYour facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,\nI but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.\n\nLess the reminders of properties told my words,\nAnd more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,\nAnd make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor\nmen and women fully equipt,\nAnd beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.\n\n24\n\nWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,\nTurbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.\n\nNo sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,\nNo more modest than immodest.\n\nUnscrew the locks from the doors!\nUnscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!\n\nWhoever degrades another degrades me,\nAnd whatever is done or said returns at last to me.\n\nThrough me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the\ncurrent and index.\nI speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,\nBy God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.\n\nThrough me many long dumb voices,\nVoices of the interminable generation of prisoners and slaves,\nVoices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,\nVoices of cycles of preparation and accretion,\nAnd of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,\nAnd of the rights of them the others are down upon,\nOf the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,\nFog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.\n\nThrough me forbidden voices,\nVoices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,\nVoices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.\n\nI do not press my fingers across my mouth,\nI keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,\nCopulation is no more rank to me than death is.\n\nI believe in the flesh and the appetites,\nSeeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.\n\nDivine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from,\nThe scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,\nThis head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.\n\nIf I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,\nTranslucent mould of me it shall be you!\nShaded ledges and rests it shall be you!\nFirm masculine colter it shall be you!\nWhatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!\nYou my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!\nBreast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!\nMy brain it shall be your occult convolutions!\nRoot of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!\nMix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!\nTrickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!\nSun so generous it shall be you!\nVapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!\nYou sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!\nWinds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!\nBroad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!\nHands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd, it shall be you.\n\nI dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,\nEach moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,\nI cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of\nMy faintest wish,\nNor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the\nFriendship I take again.\n\nThat I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,\nA morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the\nMetaphysics of books.\n\nTo behold the day-break!\nThe little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,\nThe air tastes good to my palate.\n\nHefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising,\nFreshly exuding,\nScooting obliquely high and low.\n\nSomething I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,\nSeas of bright juice suffuse heaven.\n\nThe earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,\nThe heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,\nThe mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!\n\n25\n\nDazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill\nMe,\nIf I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\nWe also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,\nWe found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the\nDay-break.\nMy voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\nWith the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes\nOf worlds.\nSpeech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\nIt provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\nWalt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?\nCome now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of\nArticulation,\nDo you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are\nFolded?\nWaiting in gloom, protected by frost,\nThe dirt receding before my prophetical screams,\nI underlying causes to balance them at last,\n\nMy knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the\nMeaning of all things,\nHappiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in\nSearch of this day.)\nMy final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I\nReally am,\nEncompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,\nI crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward\nYou.\nWriting and talk do not prove me,\nI carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,\nWith the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\n\n26\n\nNow I will do nothing but listen,\nTo accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute\nToward it.\n\nI hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of\nFlames, clack of sticks cooking my meals.\nI hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,\nI hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or\nFollowing,\nSounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the\nDay and night,\nTalkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh\nOf work-people at their meals,\nThe angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the\nSick,\nThe judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips\nPronouncing a death-sentence,\nThe heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves,\nThe refrain of the anchor-lifters,\nThe ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of\nSwift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory\nTinkles and color'd lights,\nThe steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching\nCars,\n\nThe slow march play'd at the head of the association marching\nTwo and two,\n(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with\nBlack muslin.)\n\nI hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)\nI hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,\nIt shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\n\nI hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,\nAh this indeed is music \u2014 this suits me.\n\nA tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,\nThe orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\n\nI hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)\nThe orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,\nIt wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd\nThem,\nIt sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent\nWaves,\nI am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\nSteep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in\nFakes of death,\nAt length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\nAnd that we call Being.\n\n27\n\nTo be in any form, what is that?\n(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back\nThither,)\nIf nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell\nWere enough.\n\nMine is no callous shell,\nI have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,\nThey seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\n\nI merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,\nTo touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I\nCan stand.\n\n28\n\nIs this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\nFlames and ether making a rush for my veins,\nTreacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\nMy flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is\nHardly different from myself,\nOn all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\nStraining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\nBehaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\nDepriving me of my best as for a purpose,\nUnbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\nDeluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and\nPasture-fields,\nImmodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\nThey bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the\nEdges of me,\nNo consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my\nAnger,\nFetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\nThen all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\n\nThe sentries desert every other part of me,\nThey have left me helpless to a red marauder,\nThey all come to the headland to witness and assist against\nMe.\n\nI am given up by traitors,\nI talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the\nGreatest traitor,\nI went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me\nThere.\n\nYou villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in\nIts throat,\nUnclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.\n\n29\n\nBlind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd\nTouch!\nDid it make you ache so, leaving me?\n\nParting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual\nLoan,\nRich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\n\nSprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and\nVital,\nLandscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.\n\n30\n\nAll truths wait in all things,\nThey neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,\nThey do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,\nThe insignificant is as big to me as any,\n(What is less or more than a touch?)\n\nLogic and sermons never convince,\nThe damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\n\n(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,\nOnly what nobody denies is so.)\n\nA minute and a drop of me settle my brain,\nI believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\nAnd a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\nAnd a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for\nEach other,\nAnd they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it\nBecomes omnific,\nAnd until one and all shall delight us, and we them.\n\n31\n\nI believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of\nThe stars,\nAnd the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and\nThe egg of the wren,\nAnd the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,\nAnd the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\nAnd the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\n\nAnd the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any\nStatue,\nAnd a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of\nInfidels.\nI find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,\nGrains, esculent roots,\nAnd am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,\nAnd have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\nBut call any thing back again when I desire it.\nIn vain the speeding or shyness,\nIn vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my\nApproach,\nIn vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd\nBones,\nIn vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,\nIn vain the ocean setting in hollows and the great monsters\nLying low,\nIn vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,\nIn vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,\nIn vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,\nIn vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,\nI follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the\nCliff.\n\n32\n\nI think I could turn and live with animals, they're so placid\nAnd self-contain'd,\nI stand and look at them long and long.\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition,\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\nOwning things,\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands\nOf years ago,\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\n\nSo they show their relations to me and I accept them,\nThey bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in\nTheir possession.\n\nI wonder where they get those tokens,\nDid I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop\nThem?\n\nMyself moving forward then and now and forever,\nGathering and showing more always and with velocity,\nInfinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,\nNot too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,\nPicking out here one that I love, and now go with him on\nBrotherly terms.\n\nA gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my\nCaresses,\nHead high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\nLimbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\nEyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly\nMoving.\n\nHis nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,\nHis well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around\nAnd return.\nI but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,\nWhy do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\nEven as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\n\n33\n\nSpace and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,\nWhat I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,\nWhat I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,\nAnd again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the\nMorning.\nMy ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,\nI skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,\nI am afoot with my vision.\n\nBy the city's quadrangular houses \u2014 in log huts, camping\nWith lumbermen,\nAlong the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet\nBed,\nWeeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and\nParsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,\nProspecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new\nPurchase,\nScorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down\nThe shallow river,\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where\nThe buck turns furiously at the hunter,\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where\nThe otter is feeding on fish,\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where\nThe beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;\nOver the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton\nPlant, over the rice in its low moist field,\nOver the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum\nAnd slender shoots from the gutters,\nOver the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over\nThe delicate blue-flower flax,\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer\nThere with the rest,\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the\nBreeze;\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on\nBy low scragged limbs,\nWalking the path worn in the grass and beat through the\nLeaves of the brush,\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the\nWheatlot,\nWhere the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great\nGold-bug drops through the dark,\nWhere the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and\nFlows to the meadow,\nWhere cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous\nShuddering of their hides,\n\nWhere the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons\nStraddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons\nFrom the rafters;\nWhere trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its\nCylinders,\nWhere the human heart beats with terrible throes under its\nRibs,\nWhere the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in\nIt myself and looking composedly down,)\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat\nHatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\nWhere the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are\nCorrupting below;\nWhere the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the\nRegiments,\nApproaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,\nUnder Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my\nCountenance,\nUpon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood\nOutside,\nUpon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good\nGame of base-ball,\nAt he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,\nBull-dances, drinking, laughter,\nAt the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash,\nSucking the juice through a straw,\nAt apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,\nAt musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings,\nHouse-raisings;\nWhere the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,\nScreams, weeps,\nWhere the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks\nAre scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,\n\nWhere the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the\nStud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,\nWhere the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with\nShort jerks,\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and\nLonesome prairie,\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square\nMiles far and near,\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the\nLong-lived swan is curving and winding,\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs\nHer near-human laugh,\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid\nBy the high weeds,\nWhere band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground\nWith their heads out,\nWhere burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled\nTrees,\nWhere the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the\nMarsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,\nWhere the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm\nNoon,\nWhere the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the\nWalnut-tree over the wall,\nThrough patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired\nLeaves,\nThrough the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,\nThrough the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon,\nThrough the office or public hall;\nPleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd\nWith the new and old,\nPleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,\nPleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and\nTalks melodiously,\nPleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,\nPleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist\npreacher, impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole\nforenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\n\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the\nClouds, or down a lane or along the beach,\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I\nIn the middle;\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy,\n(behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)\nFar from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet,\nOr the moccasin print,\nBy the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish\nPatient,\nNigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a\nCandle;\nVoyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\nHurrying with the modern crowd as eager and flickle as any,\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from\nMe a long while,\nWalking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God\nBy my side,\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the\nStars,\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and\nThe diameter of eighty thousand miles,\nSpeeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in\nIts belly,\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing,\nI tread day and night such roads.\n\nI visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\nAnd look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.\n\nI fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\nI help myself to material and immaterial,\nNo guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\n\nI anchor my ship for a little while only,\nMy messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns\nTo me.\n\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\nPike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\nI ascend to the foretruck,\nI take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the\nWonderful beauty,\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the\nScenery is plain in all directions,\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out\nMy fancies toward them,\nWe are approaching some great battle-field in which we are\nSoon to be engaged,\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass\nWith still feet and caution,\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living\nCities of the globe.\n\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\nI turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride\nMyself,\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\nMy voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\nThey fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.\n\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\nThe courage of present times and all times,\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of\nThe steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful\nOf days and faithful of nights,\nAnd chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we\nWill not desert you;\n\nHow he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days\nAnd would not give it up,\nHow he saved the drifting company at last,\nHow the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated\nFrom the side of their prepared graves,\nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\nSharp-lipp'd unshaved men;\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\nI am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.\n\nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,\nThe mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry\nWood, her children gazing on,\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\nBlowing, cover'd with sweat,\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the\nMurderous buckshot and the bullets,\nAll these I feel or am.\n\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the\nMarksmen,\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the\nOoze of my skin,\nI fall on the weeds and stones,\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with\nWhip-stocks.\n\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments,\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself\nBecome the wounded person,\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\nI am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris,\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my\nComrades,\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\nThey have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly life me forth.\n\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for\nMy sake,\nPainless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are\nBared of their fire-caps,\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\nDistant and dead resuscitate,\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the\nClock myself.\n\nI am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,\nI am there again.\n\nAgain the long roll of the drummers,\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars,\nAgain to my listeing ears the cannon responsive.\n\nI take part, I see and hear the whole,\nThe cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,\nThe ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable\nRepairs,\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped\nExplosion,\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\n\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously\nWaves with his hand,\nHe gasps through the clot Mind not me \u2014 mind\n\u2014 the entrenchments.\n\n34\n\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\n'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and\nTwelve young men.\nRetreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their\nBaggage for breastworks,\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine\nTimes their number, was the price they took in advance,\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing\nAnd seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners\nOf war.\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and\nAffectionate,\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in\nSquads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\nThe work commenced about five o'clock and was over by\nEight.\nNone obey'd the command to kneel,\nSome made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and\nStraight,\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and\nDead lay together,\nThe maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw\nThem there,\nSome half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,\nThese were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the\nBlunts of muskets.\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two\nMore came to release him,\nThe three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.\n\nAt eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve\nYoung men.\n\n35\n\nWould you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\nList to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it\nTo me.\n\nOur foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\nHis was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or\nTruer, and never was, and never will be;\nAlong the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.\n\nWe closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,\nMy captain lash'd fast with his own hands.\n\nWe had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first\nFire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.\n\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\nTen o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the\nGain, and five feet of water reported,\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the\nAfter-hold to give them a chance for themselves.\n\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\nThey see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\n\nOur frigate takes fire,\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\nIf our colors are struck and the fighting done?\n\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun\nOur part of the fighting.\n\nOnly three guns are in use,\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's\nMain-mast,\nTwo well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry\nAnd clear his decks.\n\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\nThe main-top,\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\n\nNot a moment's cease,\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the\nPowder-magazine.\n\nOne of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought\nWe are sinking.\n\nSerene stands the little captain,\nHe is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\n\nToward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender\nTo us.\n\n36\n\nStretch'd and still lies the midnight,\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass\nTo the one we have conquer'd,\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders\nThrough a countenance white as a sheet,\nNear by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and\nCarefully curl'd whiskers,\nThe flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and\nBelow,\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\nFormless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of\nFlesh upon the masts and spars,\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe\nOf waves,\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong\nScent,\nA few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields\nBy the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\n\nThe hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and\nLong, dull, tapering groan,\nThese so, these irretrievable.\n\n37\n\nYou laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\nIn at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!\nEmbody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain,\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and\nKeep watch,\nIt is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.\n\nNot a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd\nTo him and walk by his side,\n(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with\nSweat on my twitching lips.)\n\nNot a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am\nTried and sentenced.\n\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the\nLast gasp,\nMy face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me\nPeople retreat.\n\nAskers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in\nThem,\nI project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\n\n38\n\nEnough! enough! enough!\nSomehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!\nGive me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers,\nDreams, gaping,\nI discover myself on the verse of a usual mistake.\n\nThat I could forget the mockers and insults!\nThat I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\nBludgeons and hammers!\nThat I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion\nAnd bloody crowning!\n\nI remember now,\nI resume the overstaid fraction,\nThe grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or\nTo any graves,\nCorpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\n\nI troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an\nAverage unending procession,\nInland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\nOur swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\nThe blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of\nYears.\n\nEleves, I salute you! come forward!\nContinue your annotations, continue your questionings.\n\n39\n\nThe friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\nIs he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\n\nIs he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?\nIs he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?\nThe mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?\n\nWherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,\nThey desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them,\nStay with them.\n\nBehavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass,\nUncomb'd head, laughter, and naivet\u00e8,\nSlow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and\nEmanations,\nThey descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,\n\nThey are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly\nOut of the glance of his eyes.\n\n40\n\nFlaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask \u2014 lie over!\nYou light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.\n\nEarth! you seem to look for something at my hands,\nSay, old top-knot, what do you want?\n\nMan or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,\nAnd might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,\nAnd might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and\nDays.\n\nBehold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,\nWhen I give I give myself.\n\nYou there, impotent, loose in the knees,\nOpen your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,\nSpread your palms and life the flaps of your pockets,\nI am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to\nSpare,\nAnd any thing I have I bestow.\n\nI do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,\nYou can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold\nYou.\n\nTo cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,\nOn his right cheek I put the family kiss,\nAnd in my soul I swear I never will deny him.\n\nOn women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler\nBabes,\n(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant\nRepublics.)\n\nTo any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the\nDoor,\n\nTurn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,\nLet the physician and the priest go home.\n\nI seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,\nO despairer, here is my neck,\nBy God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight\nUpon me.\n\nI dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,\nEvery room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,\nLovers of me, bafflers of graves.\n\nSleep \u2014 I and they keep guard all night,\nNot doubt, not disease shall dare to lay finger upon you,\nI have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\nAnd when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell\nYou is so.\n\n41\n\nI am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,\nAnd for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.\n\nI heard what was said of the universe,\nHeard it and heard it of several thousand years;\nIt is middling well as far as it goes \u2014 but is that all?\n\nMagnifying and applying come I,\nOutbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,\nTaking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,\nLithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,\nBuying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,\nIn my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the\nCrucifix engraved,\nWith Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and\nImage,\nTaking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,\nAdmitting they were alive and did the work of their days,\n(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise\nAnd fly and sing for themselves,)\n\nAccepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself,\nBestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,\nDiscovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,\nPutting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves\nDriving the mallet and chisel,\nNot objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of\nSmoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious\nAs any revelation,\nLads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less\nTo me than the gods of the antique wars,\nMinding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,\nTheir brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their\nWhite foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;\nBy the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple\nInterceding for every person born,\nThree scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty\nAngels with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,\nThe snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past\nAnd to come,\nSelling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for\nHis brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;\nWhat was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod\nAbout me, and not filling the square rod then,\nThe bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,\nDung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,\nThe supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to\nBe one of the supremes,\nThe day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good\nAs the best, and be as prodigious;\nBy my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,\nPutting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the\nShadows.\n\n42\n\nA call in the midst of the crowd,\nMy own voice, orotund sweeping and final.\n\nCome my children,\nCome my boys and girls, my women, household and\nIntimates,\n\nNow the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his\nPrelude on the reeds within.\n\nEasily written loose-finger'd chords \u2014 I feel the thrum of your\nClimax and close.\n\nMy head slues round on my neck,\nMusic rolls, but not from the organ,\nFolks are around me, but they are no household of mine.\n\nEver the hard unsunk ground,\nEver the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward\nSun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,\nEver myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,\nEver the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb,\nThat breath of itches and thirsts,\nEver the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one\nHides and bring him forth,\nEver love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,\nEver the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.\n\nHere and there with dimes on the eyes walking,\nTo feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,\nTickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once\nGoing,\nMany sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for\nPayment receiving,\nA few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.\n\nThis is the city and I am one of the citizens,\nWhatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars,\nMarkets, newspapers, schools,\nThe mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories,\nStocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.\n\nThe little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and\nTail'd coats,\nI am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or\nFleas,)\nI acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and\nShallowest is deathless with me,\n\nWhat I do and say the same waits for them,\nEvery thought that flounders in me the same flounders in\nThem.\n\nI know perfectly well my own egotism,\nKnow my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,\nAnd would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.\n\nNot words of routine this song of mine,\nBut abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;\nThis printed and bound book \u2014 but the printer and the\nPrinting-office boy?\nThe well-taken photographs \u2014 but your wife or friend close\nAnd solid in your arms?\nThe black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her\nTurrets \u2014 but the pluck of the captain and engineers?\nIn the houses the dishes and fare and furniture \u2014 but the host\nAnd hostess, and the look out of their eyes?\nThe sky up there \u2014 yet here or next door, or across the way?\nThe saints and sages in history \u2014 but you yourself?\nSermons, creeds, theology \u2014 but the fathomless human brain,\nAnd what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?\n\n43\n\nI do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,\nMy faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,\nEnclosing worship ancient and modern and all between\nAncient and modern,\nBelieving I shall come again upon the earth after five\nThousand years,\nWaiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting\nThe sun,\nMaking a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with\nSticks in the circle of obis,\nHelping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,\nDancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt\nAnd austere in the woods a gymnosophist,\nDrinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas\nAdmirant, minding the Koran,\n\nWalking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and\nKnife, beating the serpent-skin drum,\nAccepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified,\nKnowing assuredly that he is divine,\nTo the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting\nPatiently in a pew,\nRanting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like\nTill my spirit arouses me,\nLooking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement\nAnd land,\nBelonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.\n\nOne of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk\nLike a man leaving charges before a journey.\n\nDown-hearted doubters dull and excluded,\nFrivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd,\nAtheistical,\nI know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt,\nDespair and unbelief.\n\nHow the flukes splash!\nHow they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts\nOf blood!\n\nBe at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,\nI take my place among you as much as among any,\nThe past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,\nAnd what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all\nPrecisely the same.\n\nI do not know what is untried and afterward,\nBut I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.\n\nEach who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd,\nNot a single one can it fail.\n\nIt cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,\nNor the young woman who died and was put by his side,\nNor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew\nBack and was never seen again,\nNor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it\nWith bitterness worse than gall,\nNor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,\nNor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish\nKoboo call'd the ordure of humanity,\nNor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to\nSlip in,\nNor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of\nThe earth,\nNor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of\nMyriads that inhabit them,\nNor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.\n\n44\n\nIt is time to explain myself \u2014 let us stand up.\nWhat is known I strip away,\nI launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.\n\nThe clock indicates the moment \u2014 but what does eternity\nIndicate?\n\nWe have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,\nThere are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.\nBirths have brought us richness and variety,\nAnd other births will bring us richness and variety.\n\nI do not call one greater and one smaller,\nThat which fills its period and place is equal to any.\nWere mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother,\nMy sister?\nI am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,\nAll has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,\n(What have I to do with lamentation?)\nI am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of\nThings to be.\n\nMy feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,\nOn every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between\nThe steps,\nAll below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.\n\nRise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,\nAfar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even\nThere,\nI waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic\nMist,\nAnd took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.\n\nLong I was hugg'd close \u2014 long and long.\n\nImmense have been the preparations for me,\nFaithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.\n\nCycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful\nBoatmen,\nFor room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,\nThey sent influences to look after what was to hold me.\n\nBefore I was born out of my mother generations guided me,\nMy embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.\n\nFor it the nebula cohered to an orb,\nThe long slow strata piled to rest it on,\nVast vegetables gave it sustenance,\nMonstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited\nIt with care.\n\nAll forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me,\nNow on this spot I stand with my robust soul.\n\n45\n\nO span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!\nO manhood, balanced, florid and full.\n\nMy lovers suffocate me,\nCrowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,\nJostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to\nMe at night,\nCrying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging\nAnd chirping over my head,\nCalling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,\nLighting on every moment of my life,\nBussing my body with soft balsamic busses,\nNoiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving\nThem to be mine.\n\nOld age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying\nDays!\n\nEvery condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what\nGrows after and out of itself,\nAnd the dark hush promulges as much as any.\n\nI open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,\nAnd all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the\nRim of the farther systems.\n\nWider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,\nOutward and outward and forever outward.\n\nMy sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,\nHe joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,\nAnd greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside\nThem.\n\nThere is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,\nIf I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,\nWere this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would\nNot avail in the long run,\nWe should surely bring up again where we now stand,\nAnd surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.\n\nA few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues,\nDo not hazard the span or make it impatient,\nThey are but parts, any thing is but a part.\n\nSee ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,\nCount ever so much, there is limitless time around that.\n\nMy rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,\nThe Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,\nThe great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be\nThere.\n\n46\n\nI know I have the best of time and space, and was never\nMeasured and never will be measured.\n\nI tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)\nMy signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut\nFrom the woods,\nNo friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,\nI have no chair, no church, no philosophy,\nI lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,\nBut each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,\nMy left hand hooking you round the waist,\nMy right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the\nPublic road.\n\nNot I, not any one else can travel that road for you,\nYou must travel it for yourself.\n\nIt is not far, it is within reach,\nPerhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not\nKnow,\nPerhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.\n\nShoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us\nHasten forth,\nWonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.\n\nIf you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your\nHand on my hip,\nAnd in due time you shall repay the same service to me,\nFor after we start we never lie by again.\n\nThis day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the\nCrowded heaven,\nAnd I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those\nOrbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in\nThem, shall we be fill'd and satisfied then?\nAnd my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and\nContinue beyond.\n\nYou are also asking me questions and I hear you,\nI answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.\n\nSit a while dear son,\nHere are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,\nBut as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes,\nI kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your\nEgress hence.\n\nLong enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,\nNow I wash the gum from your eyes,\nYou must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of\nEvery moment of your life.\n\nLong have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,\nNow I will you to be a bold swimmer,\nTo jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me,\nShout, and laughingly dash with your hair.\n\n47\n\nI am the teacher of athletes,\nHe that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves\nThe width of my own,\nHe most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the\nTeacher.\n\nThe boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived\nPower, but in his own right,\nWicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,\nFond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,\nUnrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp\nSteel cuts,\n\nFirst-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff,\nTo sing a song or play on the banjo,\nPreferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with\nSmall-pox over all latherers,\nAnd those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.\n\nI teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?\nI follow you whoever you are from the present hour,\nMy words itch at your ears till you understand them.\n\nI do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time\nWhile I wait for a boat,\n(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of\nYou,\nTied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)\n\nI swear I will never again mention love or death inside a\nHouse,\nAnd I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or\nHer who privately stays with me in the open air.\n\nIf you would understand me go to the heights or\nWater-shore,\nThe nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of\nWaves a key,\nThe maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.\n\nNo shutter'd room or school can commune with me,\nBut roughs and little children better than they.\n\nThe young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,\nThe woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take\nMe with him all day,\nThe farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound\nOf my voice,\nIn vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and\nSeamen and love them.\n\nThe soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,\nOn the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do\nNot fail them,\n\nOn that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know\nMe seek me.\n\nMy face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in\nHis blanket,\nThe driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,\nThe young mother and old mother comprehend me,\nThe girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget\nWhere they are,\nThey and all would resume what I have told them.\n\n48\n\nI have said that the soul is not more than the body,\nAnd I have said that the body is not more than the soul,\nAnd nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,\nAnd whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his\nOwn funeral drest in his shroud,\nAnd I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of\nThe earth,\nAnd to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod\nConfounds the learning of all times,\nAnd there is no trade or employment but the young man\nFollowing it may become a hero,\nAnd there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the\nWheel'd universe,\nAnd I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool\nAnd composed before a million universes.\n\nAnd I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,\nFor I who am curious about each am not curious about\nGod,\n(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about\nGod and about death.)\nI hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God\nNot in the least,\nNor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than\nMyself.\nWhy should I wish to see God better than this day?\nI see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and\nEach moment then,\nIn the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own\nFace in the glass,\nI find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is\nSign'd by God's name,\nAnd I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er\nI go,\nOthers will punctually come for ever and ever.\n\n49\n\nAnd as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is\nIdle to try to alarm me.\n\nTo his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,\nI see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,\nI recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,\nAnd mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.\n\nAnd as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that\nDoes not offend me,\nI smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,\nI reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of\nMelons.\n\nAnd as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many\nDeaths,\n(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)\n\nI hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,\nO suns \u2014 O grass of graves \u2014 O perpetual transfers and\nPromotions,\nIf you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?\n\nOf the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,\nOf the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing\nTwilight,\nToss, sparkles of day and dusk \u2014 toss on the black stems that\nDecay in the muck,\nToss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.\n\nI ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,\nI perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams\nReflected,\nAnd debouch to the steady and central from the offspring\nGreat or small.\n\n50\n\nThere is that in me \u2014 I do not know what it is \u2014 but I know it\nIs in me.\n\nWrench'd and sweaty \u2014 calm and cool then my body becomes,\nI sleep \u2014 I sleep long.\n\nI do not know it \u2014 it is without name \u2014 it is a word unsaid,\nIt is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.\n\nSomething it swings on more than the earth I swing on,\nTo it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.\n\nPerhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers\nAnd sisters.\n\nDo you see O my brothers and sisters?\nIt is not chaos or death \u2014 it is form, union, plan \u2014 it is eternal\nLife \u2014 it is Happiness.\n\n51\n\nThe past and present wilt \u2014 I have fill'd them, emptied them,\nAnd proceed to fill my next fold of the future.\n\nListener up there! what have you to confide to me?\nLook in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,\n(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a\nMinute longer.)\n\nDo I contradict myself?\nVery well then I contradict myself,\n(I am large, I contain multitudes.)\n\nI concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.\n\nWho has done his day's work? who will soonest be through\nWith his supper?\nWho wishes to walk with me?\n\nWill you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too\nLate?\n\n52\n\nThe spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains\nOf my gab and my loitering.\n\nI too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,\nI sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\n\nThe last scud of day holds back for me,\nIt flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the\nShadow'd wilds,\nIt coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.\n\nI depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,\nI effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.\n\nI bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,\nIf you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\n\nYou will hardly know who I am or what I mean,\nBut I shall be good health to you nevertheless,\nAnd filter and fibre your blood.\nFailing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,\nMissing me one place search another,\nI stop somewhere waiting for you.56Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1336378", "artist_names": "Lari White", "full_title": "Stepping Stone by\u00a0Lari\u00a0White", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/2badacb24a4df4817f9102756cfe6954.225x225x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2badacb24a4df4817f9102756cfe6954.225x225x1.jpg", "id": 1336378, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429770393, "path": "/Lari-white-stepping-stone-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Lari-white-stepping-stone-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/2badacb24a4df4817f9102756cfe6954.225x225x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2badacb24a4df4817f9102756cfe6954.225x225x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Stepping Stone", "title_with_featured": "Stepping Stone", "updated_by_human_at": 1591562788, "url": "https://genius.com/Lari-white-stepping-stone-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/354622", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/8d087a09e709161e1eb606c7385f8463.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 354622, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/8d087a09e709161e1eb606c7385f8463.600x600x1.jpg", "index_character": "l", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Lari White", "slug": "Lari-white", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Lari-white"}, "artist": "Lari White", "lyrics": "Stepping Stone LyricsHere I am at another dead end\nStopped in my tracks again\nCloser then I've been to where I wanna be\nA broken heart standing in my way\nBig as life on a real bad day\nMaking lemons into lemonade\nAin't nothing new to me No\n\nThis ain't no stumbling block\nIt's just a stepping stone\nI'm gonna climb right up on top\nAnd take a good look at where I'm going\nAnd it ain't gonna slow me down\nHold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)\nThis ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)\nIt ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)\nThis ain't no stumbling block\nIt's just a stepping stone\nNow looking back I realize\nHow hard it is to recognize\nOpportunity in disguise\nThat's some Calamity\nSo I ain't gonna cuss my luck\nEvery time a door slams shut\nI know a window's gonna open up\nJust as long as I believe\n\nThis ain't no stumbling block\nIt's just a stepping stone\nI'm gonna climb right up on top\nAnd take a good look at where I'm going\nAnd it ain't gonna slow me down\nHold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)\nThis ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)\nIt ain't no stumbling block (Stepping Stone)\nThis ain't no stumbling block\nIt's just a stepping stone\n\nStepping Stone..
