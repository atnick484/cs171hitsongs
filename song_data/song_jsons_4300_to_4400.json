in view\nWhen the money ran out and the engine blew\nHung my tears out to dry\nThen my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I, I was walkin' the clouds\nFeelin' so safe and sound\nSomethin' else knocks me down\n[Chorus]\nWell, oh, that's the way it is\nYou gotta roll with the punches\nThat's the way it goes\nYou gotta bend when the wind blows\nYou live you learn\nYou crash and burn\nIt's hit or miss (that's the way)\nAnd that's the way it is\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne fine day you wake up\nCompletely, hoplessly fallin' in love\nHe's just what you're lookin' for\nThe only problem is, that the man's not sure\nAnother guy'll give you everything\nThe only problem is you don't feel a thing\nWell, I know from experience\nNothin's ever gonna make perfect sense\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, one day you get what you want\nBut it's not what you think\nThen you get what you need\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, oh, that's the way it is\nYou gotta roll with the punches\nThat's the way it goes\nYou gotta bend when the wind blows\nYou live you learn\nYou crash and burn\nIt's hit or miss (that's the way)\nAnd that's the way it is\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nYeah\nThey say your soul is growin' but\nSometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd that's the way it is\nYou gotta roll with the punches\nAnd that's the way it goes\nYou gotta bend when the wind blows\nThat's the way it is\nYou gotta roll with the punches\nThat's the way it goes\nYou gotta bend when the wind blows\nYou live you learn\nYou crash and burn\nIt's hit or miss\nOh, and that's the

'em\n'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts\nThen it's \"beep beep\" and I'm pickin' them up\nLet 'em play with the dick in the truck\nMany chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs\nDivorce him and split his bucks\nJust because you got good head\nI'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?\nShit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'\nMe give my heart to a woman?\nNot for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'\nHeart cold as assassins, I got no passion\nI got no patience and I hate waitin'\nHo, get your ass in and let's ride!\nCheck em out now, ride!\nRide!\nCheck em

out with me\nAnd you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB\nLivin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it\nBut nigga if you hatin' I\nThen you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked\nJust break it; you gotta pay like you weigh\nWet with two pairs of clothes on\nNow get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track\nTimbaland, let me spit my prose on\nPump it up in the pro-zone\nThat's the track

about the world like it's someplace that you've been\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nYou see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one\nCause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around

loser's day parade\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nYou see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one\nCause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWhen

I'd pictured at all\nIn those paint by number\nFantasies I've had\n\nSo it took me by complete suprise\nWhen my heart got lost in those deep green eyes\nShe's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more\nNo, it wasn't at first sight\nBut the moment I looked twice\nI saw the women I was born to love\nHer laughter filled my soul\nWhen I hold her I don't wanna let go\nWhen it comes to her, I can't get enough\n\nSo it took me by complete suprise\nWhen my heart got lost in those deep green eyes\nShe's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more!\n\nMore than I dreamed of\nMore than any man deserves...and I couldn't\nAsk for a more than a love like hers\n\nSo it took me by complete suprise\nWhen my heart got lost in those deep green eyes\nShe's not at all what I was lookin for, she's

this red head pulled up in a blue sports car\nShe said, \"I bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever.\"\nIt took a second to put it all together and I said\nOoh la la la la la\nLooking good

PHD\nNow I'm modeling for money.\"\nImagine little miss 4.0 just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue\nI said you've come a long way since graduation\nLet me say without hesitation\nYou've

myself\nLookin' for the payback, listen for the playback\nThey say that every man bleeds just like me\nAnd I feel like number one, yet I'm last in line\nI watch my youngest son and it helps to pass the time\nI take too many pills that helps to ease the pain\nI made a couple dollar bills, still I feel the same\nEverybody knows my name they say it way out loud\nA lot of folks fuck with me, it's hard to hang out in crowds\nI guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am\nOutstretched hands and one night stands, still I can't find love\n[Chorus]\nAnd when your walls come tumblin' down\nI will always be around\nAnd when your walls come tumblin' down\nI will always be around\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeople don't know 'bout the things I say and do\nThey don't understand about the shit I've been through\nIt's been so long since I've been home\nI've been gone, I've been gone for way too long\nMaybe I've forgot all the things I miss\nOh, somehow I know there's more to life than this\nI've said it too many times and I still stand firm\nYou get what you put in and people get what they deserve\n\n[Bridge]\nStill I ain't seen mine\nNo, I ain't seen mine\nI've been givin', just ain't been gettin'\nI've been walkin' that there line\nSo, I think I'll keep walkin' with my head held high\nI keep movin' on and only God knows why\nOnly God, Only God, Only God knows why\nOnly God knows why, why, why\nOnly God knows why\nSee Kid Rock LiveGet tickets as low as $215You might also like[Outro]\nTake me to the river, ey\nWon't you take me to the river, hey, hey, yeah6Embed"},

every day\nAnd every morning when I make my coffee\nI can't believe my life's turned out this way\nAll I could say was\n[Chorus]\nLove's the only house\nBig enough for all the pain in the world\nLove's the only house\nBig enough for all the pain\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe was walking by the other day and I said\nHey baby, how you've been\nYeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old\nAnd she's got her daddy's little grin\nAnd you only wanted what you can't have\nAnd baby you can't have me now\nI gave my heart to another\nYeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other\nAnd I found out the hard way that\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou drive three miles from all this prosperity\nDown across the river and you see a ghetto there\nAnd we got children walking around with guns\nAnd they got knives and drugs and pain to spare\nAnd here I am in my clean white shirt\nWith a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home\nAnd we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness\nLiving together alone, all I can say is\nSee Martina McBride LiveGet tickets as low as $40You might also like[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I can't explain it and I can't understand\nBut I'll come down and get my hands dirty\nAnd together we'll make a stand\n\n[Verse 4]\nSomewhere 'cross the parking lot some bands playing out of tune\nCity streets are going burn if we don't do something soon\nAnd se\u00f1orita can't quit crying\nBaby's due now any day\nDon Juan left got sick of trying\nNo one there to show him the way\nShe came down to the grocery store\nAnd she said I want to buy a little carton of milk\nBut I don't have any money\nI said hey I'll cover you honey\nBecause the pain's got to go somewhere\nYeah the pain's got to go someplace\nSo come on down to

\"Call for a good time\"\nAnd I only wanted to catch your attention\nBut you overlooked me somehow\nBesides you had too many boyfriends to mention\nAnd I played my guitar too loud\nHow do you like me now?!\n[Chorus]\nHow do you like me now?\nNow that I'm on my way?\nDo you still think I'm crazy\nStanding here today?\nI couldn\u2019t make you love me\nBut I always dreamed about\nLivin' in your radio\nHow do you like me now?!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I took off to Tennessee\nI heard that you made fun of me\nNever imagined I'd make it this far\nThen you married into money girl\nAin't it a cruel and funny world?\nHe took your dreams and he tore them apart\nHe never comes home\nAnd you\u2019re always alone\nAnd your kids hear you crying down the hall\nAlarm clock starts ringing\nWho could that be

say I can't believe son that you're grown\n\nHe said Dad\nThis could be the best day of my life\nI've been dreaming day and night\nOf being like you\nNow its me and her\nWatching you and mom I've

inside for you\nIs more than any words can say\nPray to God on bended knee\nWe'll always be together babe\nYou and me\nIf there's a high or low\nAnything can be babe\nI'll be there for you\nPick you up off your feet, yeah\nPray to God on bended knee\nWe'll always be together babe\nYou and me\nWhen I'm in my nine to five\nI smile across my lips when I\nDaydream about the night before\nI count the minutes till I'm in your arms once more\nMy friends they don't understand, no\nIn me they see a brand new man\nI give you props and tell them that\nMy shorty's bout it\nShe personifies the love she gives\n\nCHORUS\n\nOh how I've waited for this moment in my life\nIt's you that I adore\nBaby with you I am secure\nMy life is in your hands\nAnd now I understand\nWhat it means to be in love again,

"lyrics": "Hot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever\n\nRap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo!

shed\n[Verse 2]\nShe don't care about my big screen\nOr my collection of DVD's\nThings like that just never mattered much to her\nPlus she don't watch too much TV\nAnd she don't care that I can fly
