Love Lyrics[Chorus]\nI've been down one time\nI've been down two times\nBut now I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love\n\nLet me tell ya all about it\nI've been out here so very long, I've lost all my direction\nBaby when you came my way I thought I'd found my protection\nBut a strong wind came into my life, surely took me by surprise\n& I can't seem to control these tears that's falling from my eyes\nListen to me\nBaby I depended on you, for a love & affection\nBut now you gone and deserted me, can't you see that I'm in desperation\nI'm in the middle of a bad love storm, ew yeah I just can't let it boy I\nLooked around and all I could see, was water coming over me\n\nAll I do is cry, all I do is walk around and cry\nBut right now I'm drowning, oh I'm drowning in the sea of love\n\nBut that's alright, I don't mind drowning for your love\nThat's alright baby, hear me when I say it's alright\nYou got the kind of love that make me feel alright\nYou got the kind of love baby that make me cry all night long\nYou got the kind of love baby make me do things I don't wanna do\nAnd it's alrightYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

string for you\nOh, yeah, and need I say\nI can't break away\nYou control every\nLittle thing I do\n\nI used to be a swinger\nTil you wrapped me\nRound your finger\n\nJust like a yo-yo\nJust like a

just like a yo-yo\nHeard what he said\nLike a yo-yo\nOh, just like a yo-yo\nYou might also likeWhere I go and what I do\nWell, it all just depends on you\nYou build me up just to let me down\nBut I dare not to make a sound\n\nCause I'm so afraid\nYou will cast me away\nLike a beat up, worn out toy\n\nSo I hold on tight\nWith all my might just\nTo be your loving boy, yeah\n\nNo matter what they say or do\nI gotta bounce right\nBack to you now\nJust like a yo-yo\nJust like a yo-yo\n\nTurning, turning\nLove keeps burning\nLike a fire in my heart\nWhen were apart but\nWhen were back

the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies\nTurning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying\nHealing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes\n\n[Verse 2]\nWaking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin\nWiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been\nTeaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying\nTalking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend\n[Chorus]\nLoving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again\n\n[Verse 3]\nComing close together with a feeling that I've never known before in my time\nShe ain't ashamed to be a woman nor afraid to be a friend\nI don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind\nBut dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again\n\n[Outro]\nMmm, mmm\nAhYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6,

"Steve-albini", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Steve-albini"}, "artist": "Steve Albini", "lyrics": "Keynote Address at Melbourne, Australia\u2019s Face the Music Conference 2014 LyricsI\u2019m going to first explain a few things about myself. I\u2019m 52-years-old, I have been in bands continuously, and active in the music scene in one way or another since about 1978. At the moment I\u2019m in a band, I also work as a recording engineer and I own a recording studio in Chicago. In the past I have also been a fanzine writer, radio club DJ, concert promoter and I ran a small record label. I was not terribly successful at any of those things, but I have done them, so they qualify as part of my CV.\n\nI work every day with music and with bands and I have for more than 30 years. I\u2019ve made a couple thousand records for independent bands and rock stars, for big labels and small ones. I made a record two days ago and I\u2019ll be making one on Monday when I get off the plane. So I believe this puts me in a pretty good position to evaluate the state of the music scene today, as it relates to how it used to be and how it has been.\n\nWe\u2019re all here to talk about the state of the music scene and the health of the music community. I\u2019ll start by saying that I\u2019m both satisfied and optimistic about the state of the music scene. And I welcome the social and technological changes that have influenced it. I hope my remarks today will start a conversation and through that conversation we can invoke an appreciation of how resilient the music community is, how supportive it can be and how welcoming it should be.\n\nI hear from some of my colleagues that these are rough times: that the internet has cut the legs off the music scene and that pretty soon nobody will be making music anymore because there\u2019s no money in it. Virtually every place where music is written about, there is some version of this troubling perspective. People who used to make a nice income from royalties, they\u2019ve seen the royalties dry up. And people who used to make a living selling records are having trouble selling downloads as substitute for records, and they no longer make records.\n\nSo there is a tacit assumption that this money, lost money, needs to be replaced and a lot of energy has been spent arguing from where that money will come. Bitchiness about this abounds, with everybody insisting that somebody else should be paying him, but that he shouldn\u2019t have to pay for anybody else. I would like to see an end to this dissatisfaction.\n\nIt\u2019s worthwhile to remember from where we\u2019ve come. From where this bitchiness originates. In the 1970s through the 1990s, the period in which I was most active in bands in the music scene \u2013 let\u2019s call this the pre-internet era. The music industry was essentially the record industry, in that records and radio were the venues through which people learned of music and principally experienced it. They were joined by MTV and videos in the 80s and 90s, but the principle relationship people had with music was as sound recordings. There was a booming band scene and all bands aspired to getting recorded, as a mark of legitimacy.\nBut recording was a rare and expensive enterprise, so it wasn\u2019t common. Even your demo tape required considerable investment. So when I started playing in bands in the 70s and 80s most bands went through their entire lifecycle without so much as a note of their music ever being recorded.\n\nNow I\u2019m going to describe the scene as I observed it in America, but I understand that most of the structures and conditions I observed have parallels in other markets. Maybe somebody from my generation can add the local Aussie colour to my comments \u2013 I prefer them shouted in as thick an accent as you can muster.\n\nAs a yardstick for the economics of the day or for the era, in 1979 you could buy a 45rpm single for a buck, a new album for $5, go see a club gig for $1 or a stadium gig for $7. I know these things because I still have some old ticket stubs and price stickers on my records. Note the relative parity between the live show costs and the recorded music costs. A gradual inflation of prices remained under way through the 90s, making recorded music more expensive, though it remained the principal means of experience.\n\nThe whole industry depended on these sales, and sales depended on exposure. Bands on big labels toured, essentially to promote their recordings. And the labels provided promotional and logistical support to keep the bands on the road. This supported a network of agents and managers and roadies and promotional staff, so the expense was considerable.\n\nRetail outlets also offered special placements and promotion: displays, posters, mentions in print ads, giveaways, trinkets and what were called end cap displays. Record labels paid handsomely for these promotions and the stores used the sale of these promotions as additional income. Chain stores especially relied on corporate chain-wide promotions, regardless what the stores might think their local clientele might like. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to see big displays of hair metal bands in urban outlets where they couldn\u2019t sell a single stick but the labels had paid for their utility, so up they went.\n\nRadio stations were enormously influential. Radio was the only place to hear music from any people and record companies paid dearly to influence them. Direct payola had been made illegal but this was a trivial workaround. Record pluggers acting as programming consultants were the middlemen. They paid radio stations for access to their programmers and conducted meetings where new records were promoted.\n\nThese promotional offers were quite lucrative. But their metrics depended on radio stations recording that they had added the records to their playlist. To satisfy this requirement and keep the promotional money flowing, radio stations often played tiny fragments of songs jumbled one after the other in any incomprehensible flow during late-night programming hours, to satisfy the programming requirement that they add songs to their playlist. Popular radio stations also staged mammoth concerts, often for free or for nominal cover featuring bands that the labels were promoting. These unpaid radio gigs were a drag on their touring income but the promotional value was presumed to be worth it.\n\nJournalists and editors who could place reviews, program directors and independent DJs who could add records to playlists or played in nightclubs, were subject to much buttering up. Promotional trinkets and advance copies of records were sent their way. Sometimes by the box. Presumably these were listening and file copies. But they were actually a bribe. These promotional copies were immediately sold secondhand to record stores and it was not uncommon for such stores to be overstocked with a new release prior to its official release as a result. My wife worked in a record store that bought records secondhand in the 90s. And their biggest repeat customers, by a long shot, were the people on these label promo lists. The staff at her store kept a tally for awhile and the editor of the local weeklies music section made a comfortable second income amounting to a $1,000 or more a month from selling these promo copies.\n\nSo it was a leaky system, riddled with inefficiencies, but a lot of people made a living through it. Record store owners, buyers, employees, ad agencies, designers, club owners, label reps, A&R, producers, recording studios, publicists, lawyers, journalists, program directors, distributors, tour managers, booking agents, band managers, and all the ancillary services they required: banking, shipping, printing, photography, travel agencies, limos, spandex wardrobe, cocaine dealers, prostitutes. Because of this great bulk of the industry needed to sustain itself. Every facet of the industry was tailored to this need.\n\nThe most significant bit of tailoring was an accounting trick called recouping costs. The costs of making a record wasn\u2019t borne by the record label, except initially. Those costs were recouped or taken out of the income the band might otherwise run as royalties. The same was true of all those promo copies, posters, radio pluggers and payola men, producers, publicists, tour support, 8x10 glossies, shipping, freight \u2013 basically anything that could be associated with a specific band or record was ultimately paid for by the band, not by the record label.\n\nAs the label shifted from vinyl to CD as the dominant format, the labels could easily sell the CD as a convenient, compact, trouble-free way to listen to music. The profit margin exploded and the money got stupid. Retails costs of a CD was half again or double more than an LP but the manufacturing, shipping and storage costs were a tiny fraction. The labels even used vinyl\u2019s legacy as a tool to increase this profit margin by charging bands for unique packaging, despite the fact that CD packaging was designed to be standardised. Or pre-emptively charging back for broken CDs at a rate implying that someone was attacking the inventory with an axe.\n\nIn the end the bands operating under this system earned very little from their record sales, unless they were monumental stars. Often enough bands would conduct their entire careers with a label and never reach the point where they had sufficiently recouped to get paid anything at all. Now the label made its per-piece profit on every record sold. And could recoup the cost of any records unsold. And all those other people got paid using the money that would have otherwise gone to the bands as royalties. Unsurprisingly, those other people also got paid pretty well. It stands to reason that if the label is paying you with someone else\u2019s money, the label doesn\u2019t need to care how much you charge.\n\nDuring the 90s there was something of an arms race to see who could write the biggest deal. That is, the deal with the most money being spent on the band\u2019s behalf. In a singularly painless contest the money would either be paid to the band as a royalty, which would take that money out of the system and put it into things like houses and groceries and college educations. Or it could be paid to other operators within the industry, increasing the clout and prestige of the person doing the spending. It\u2019s as if your boss, instead of giving your paycheck to you, could pay that money to his friends and business associates, invoking your name as he did. Since his net cost was the same and his friends and associates could return the favour, why would he ever want to let any of that money end up in your hands? It was a system that ensured waste by rewarding the most profligate spendthrifts in a system specifically engineered to waste the band\u2019s money.\nNow bands existed outside that label spectrum. The working bands of the type I\u2019ve always been in, and for those bands everything was always smaller and simpler. Promotion was usually down to flyers posted on poles, occasional mentions on college radio and fanzines. If you had booked a gig at a venue that didn\u2019t advertise, then you faced a very real prospect of playing to an empty room. Local media didn\u2019t take bands seriously until there was a national headline about them so you could basically forget about press coverage. And commercial radio was absolutely locked up by the payola-driven system of the pluggers and program directors.\n\nInternational exposure was extraordinarily expensive. In order for your records to make it into overseas hands you had to convince a distributor to export them. And that was difficult with no means for anyone to hear the record and decide to buy it. So you ended up shipping promotional copies overseas at a terrific expense, never sure if they would be listened to or not.\n\nThe one exception to this was the brilliant BBC DJ John Peel. He listened religiously to every single record he received in the mail, devoting hours of every day to the task. I sent him a copy of the first album I ever made and not only did he play the record on air, he sent me back a postcard with a personal remembrance of Chicago, of visiting a matron aunt as a child in Evanston, the suburb where my post office box was kept. I treasured that note as the first indication that John Peel was a great man.\n\nSo these independent bands had to be resourceful. They\u2019d built their own infrastructure of independent clubs, promoters, fanzines and DJs. They had their own channels of promotion, including the beginnings of the internet culture that is so prevalent today \u2013 that being bulletin boards, and newsgroups. These independent bands even made their own record label. Some were collectives and those that weren\u2019t were likely to operate on a profit-sharing basis that encouraged efficiency, rather than a recoupable patronage system that encouraged indulgence.\n\nThat\u2019s where I cut my teeth, in that independent scene full of punks and noise freaks and drag queens and experimental composers and jabbering street poets. You can thank punk rock for all of that. That\u2019s where most of us learned that it was possible to make your own records, to conduct your own business and keep control of your own career. If a bunch of pimply glue sniffers could do it, we reasoned, then anybody could.\n\nThe number of records released this way was incredible. Thousands of small releases made their way into the \u201cmom and pop\u201d independent speciality stores, which then provided a market for independent distribution. It was the beginnings of an alternative to the label paradigm. It was cumbersome and slow but it was more efficient than a shotgun approach with the big labels, whose answer to every problem was to spend more of the band\u2019s money on it.\n\nIt was the beginning of what we would call the peer network. By mid-90s there were independent labels and distributors moving millions of dollars of records and CDs. And there was a healthy underground economy of bands making a reasonable income owing to the superior efficiencies of the independent methods. My band, as an example, was returned 50% of the net profit on every title that we released through our record label. I worked it out and that earned us a better per-piece royalty than Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Prince, Madonna or any other superstar operating concurrently. And we were only one of thousands of such bands.\n\nSo, that was the system as it was. That\u2019s what we lost when the internet made everything available everywhere for free. And make no mistake about it, we have lost it. There is still an independent label network but it\u2019s a slim fraction of what it was. The labels continuing to survive do so by supplying niche music to a discerning audience. And because they have been steeled in the art of efficiency their constitution allows them to scale everything to suit the remaining demand.\n\nYou may have noticed that in my description of the mass market music scene and the industry as it was pre-internet I made little mention of the audience or the bands. Those two ends of the spectrum were hardly considered by the rest of the business. Fans were expected to listen to the radio and buy records and bands were expected to make records and tour to promote them. And that was about all the thought either were given. But the audience was where all the money came from and the bands were where all the music came from.\n\nThrough the internet, which more than anything else creates access to things, limitless music eventually became available for free. The big record companies didn\u2019t see how to make money from online distribution so they effectively ignored it, leaving it to the hackers and the audience to populate a new landscape of downloading. People who prefer the convenience of CDs over LPs naturally prefer downloaded music even more. You could download it or stream it or listen from YouTube or have your friends on message boards or acquaintances send you zip files. In the blink of an eye music went from being rare, expensive and only available through physical media in controlled outlets to being ubiquitous and free worldwide. What a fantastic development.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of shade thrown by people in the music industry about how terrible the free sharing of music is, how it\u2019s the equivalent of theft, etc. That\u2019s all bullshit and we\u2019ll deal with that in a minute. But for a minute I want you to look at the experience of music from a fan\u2019s perspective, post-internet. Music that is hard to find was now easy to find. Music to suit my specific tastes, as fucked up as they might be, was now accessible by a few clicks or maybe posting a query on a message board. In response I had more access to music than I had ever imagined. Curated by other enthusiasts, keen to turn me on to the good stuff; people, like me, who want other people to hear the best music ever.\n\nThis audience-driven music distribution has other benefits. Long-forgotten music has been given a second life. And bands whose music that was ahead of its time has been allowed to reach a niche audience that the old mass distribution failed to find for them, as one enthusiast turns on the next and this forgotten music finally gets it due. There\u2019s a terrific documentary about one such case, the Detroit band Death whose sole album was released in a perfunctory edition in, I believe, 1975 and disappeared until a copy of it was digitised and made public on the internet. Gradually the band found an audience, their music got lovingly reissued, and the band has resurrected, complete with tours playing to packed houses. And the band are now being allowed the career that the old star system had denied them. There are hundreds of such stories and there are speciality labels that do nothing but reissue lost classics like that once they surface.\n\nNow look at the conditions from a band\u2019s perspective, the conditions faced by a band. In contrast to back in the day, recording equipment and technology has simplified and become readily available. Computers now come pre-loaded with enough software to make a decent demo recording and guitar stores sell microphones and other equipment inexpensively that previously was only available at a premium from arcane speciality sources. Essentially every band now has the opportunity to make recordings.\nAnd they can do things with those recordings. They can post them online in any number of places: Bandcamp, YouTube, SoundCloud, their own websites. They can link to them on message boards, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter and even in the comment streams of other music. \u201cLOL,\u201d \u201cthis sucks,\u201d \u201cmuch better,\u201d \u201cdeath to false metal,\u201d \u201cLOL\u201d. Instead of spending a fortune on international phone calls trying to find someone in each territory to listen to your music, every band on the planet now has free, instant access to the world at its fingertips.\n\nI cannot overstate how important a development that is. Previously, in the top-down paradigm allowed local industry to dictate what music was available in isolated or remote markets, markets isolated by location or language. It was inconceivable that a smaller or independent band could have market penetration into, say, Greece or Turkey, Japan or China, South America, Africa or the Balkans. Who would you ask to handle your music? How would you find him? And how would you justify the business and currency complications required to send four or five copies of a record there?\n\nNow those places are as well-served as New York and London. Fans can find the music they like and develop direct relationships with the bands. It is absolutely possible \u2013 I\u2019m sure it happens every day \u2013 that a kid in one of these far-flung places can find a new favourite band, send that band a message, and that singer of that band will read it and personally reply to it from his cell phone half a world away. How much better is that? I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s infinitely better than having a relationship to a band limited to reading it on the back of the record jacket. If such a thing were possible when I was a teenager I\u2019m certain I would have become a right nuisance to the Ramones.\n\nA couple of years ago my band mounted a tour of eastern Europe. We played all the hot spots: the Czech Republic, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, we made it as far as Istanbul, Turkey. It was a magical experience, playing in front of audiences who were relatively unjaded by the routine of touring bands and we were welcomed like friends. We played to full houses at the same size venues as the rest of Europe. The same sizes as we would play here in Australia. And the audiences seem equivocally familiar with our music. The key difference being that most of the places have literally never sold a single record. Essentially 100% of our exposure had been through informal means over the internet or hand-to-hand.\n\nOn that trip we established contacts with local promoters and arts organisations and audiences developed an appetite for our music and we have since sold quite a few records into the region. Our next tour through the region was easier as a result and we\u2019re going back to Istanbul this spring, using contacts made on that first exploratory trip. I expect to have a marvellous time.\n\nIn short, the internet has made it much easier to conduct the day-to-day business of being in a band and has increased the efficiency. Everything from scheduling rehearsals using online calendars, to booking tours by email, to selling merchandise and records from online stores, down to raising the funds to make a record is a new simplicity that bands of the pre-internet era would salivate over. The old system was built by the industry to serve the players inside the industry. The new system where music is shared informally and the bands have a direct relationship to the fans was built by the bands and the fans in the manner of the old underground. It skips all the intermediary steps.\n\nBands now have default control of their exposure. It\u2019s no longer necessary to pay people to pay other people to play your records on the radio, only to have those people lie about doing so. It\u2019s no longer necessary to spend money to let people hear your band. It happens automatically.\n\nThere\u2019s another, much subtler change that all this instigated. Since people no longer have to make do listening to whatever is on the radio playlist and are no longer limited to owning what the store decides to stock, they have become much more indulgent in their tastes. My friends now normally listen to exotic playlists that they have dreamed up themselves, full of counterintuitive and contrasting choices that are uniquely theirs.\n\nOur office bearer has a hi-fi in that studio office and is as likely to be playing the new 45 from the hardcore band Leather or electro drone by Tim Hecker as he is to be playing a deep cut of Cincinnati soul or handbag disco or improv guitar noodlings, whether newly released from Oren Ambarchi or 30 years old from the Takoma label. People can now listen only to music they are ecstatic about, all the time.\n\nThere are active online communities for every kind of music and its subcultures. Whether you\u2019re into Dusty\u2019s Deep Cut reggae, minimal electronics, symphonic pop, Texas blues, Japanese noise, power electronics, children\u2019s music, christmas music, Raymond Scott, or Burl Ives, I guarantee there is an online community where you can connect with other enthusiasts to indulge the minute specificity of your tastes.\n\nThese online communities are now a vital part of the scene and this debate and others are hashed out there daily. I\u2019ve probably unconsciously lifted some of my positions in these remarks from discussions I\u2019ve had online so I\u2019d like to confess that plagiarism now, as a way to encourage all of you to get involved in these forums where all the interesting conversations about music is happening.\n\nImagine a great hall of fetishes where whatever you felt like fucking or being fucked by, however often your tastes might change, no matter what hardware or harnesses were required, you could open the gates and have at it on a comfy mattress at any time of day. That\u2019s what the internet has become for music fans. Plus bleacher seats for a cheering section.\n\nAs a result fans are more ardent for this music. They are willing to spend more on seeing it played live. They are willing to buy more ephemera and eager to establish a personal relationship to the people who make the music. Gig prices have escalated as a result. And the merchandise tables at gigs are universally teeming with activity. Back home, gigs that used to cost five or six bucks are now 20 or 30. Over here the ticket inflation has been more pronounced, with club gigs going for $80 or more. As a result gig income for bands has increased exponentially. My band has been playing a lot of the same places for the entirety of our existence, over 20 years now. I guess you could say we\u2019ve saturated our audience, no matter how long we stay at it. Some of these perennial gigs are now paying an over of magnitude better than they were 10 or 15 years ago. That\u2019s right, some places where we used to earn four or five hundred dollars we now earn four or five grand.\n\nThis ease of access, redoubled interest and increase in income has created a new partnership and possibilities between individuals, bands and visual artists, online film-makers, choreographers and other kinds of public people. Collaborations take place in real time or displaced over the internet where the parties often never meet face-to-face. I have a dear friend who found himself with a bunch of time on his hands last year so he formed a couple of new bands. One of these bands was entirely populated by people he only knew online and all of their music was made by online collaboration. This music was a pure result of the interconnectivity of the internet.\n\nAll of that, all of those characteristics, all of those possibilities were instigated and made possible by the online sharing of music. If not directly, as in the case of building an audience for the band Death and my own band in the Balkans and beyond, then indirectly by changing the expectations of the listeners and musicians.\n\nThis explains my enthusiasm for the way the music scene has changed, but what about my optimism? I would like to address a platitude about the online exposure of music. From all quarters we hear that, this is the platitude: \u201cWe need to figure out how to make internet distribution work for everyone.\u201d I use finger quotes to indicate intellectual distance between myself and the quotation. I have a friend, Tim Midgett, who uses three fingers for finger quotes to indicate extra irony. This is a two jobber.\n\nI disagree with this rather inoffensive platitude. It\u2019s innocuous and vapid and fills the air after someone asks the question, \u201cHow is the music scene these days?\u201d And it maintains hope that the current state of affairs as mentioned, presumed to be tragic, can be changed for the better. For \u201ceveryone\u201d. That word everyone is important to the people using the sentence. In their mind the physical distribution model worked for everyone. But the new one does not. Not yet, not yet. Not until we \u201cfigure it out\u201d. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all going to get tired of me doing that [air quotes].\n\nI disagree that the old way is better. And I do not believe this sentence to be true: \u201cWe need to figure out how to make this digital distribution work for everyone.\u201d I disagree with it because within its mundane language are tacit assumptions: the framework of an exploitative system that I have been at odds with my whole creative life. Inside that trite sentence, \u201cWe need to figure out how to make this work for everyone,\u201d hides the skeleton of a monster.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning. \u201cWe need to figure out\u201d: the subject of that sentence, the first-person plural, sounds inclusive but the context defeats that presumption. Who would have the power to implement a new distribution paradigm? Who would be in the room when we discuss our plans for it? Who would do the out figuring we need to do? Industry and consumers? Consumers is a likely response, but did the consumers get a vote about how their music would be compressed or tagged or copy protected or made volatile? Did anybody? Did the consumers get a choice about whether or not Apple stuck a U2 album on their iTunes library? Of course not. These things were just done and we had to deal with them as a state of being. Consumers rebelling or complaining about things \u2013 \u201cmarket pushback\u201d \u2013 isn\u2019t the same thing as being involved in the decision to do something. Clearly the \u201cwe\u201d of this sentence doesn\u2019t include the listener. I believe any attempt to organise the music scene that ignores the listener is doomed.\n\nHow about the bands? Do the bands get a seat at the \u201cwe\u201d table, while our figuring-out needs are met? Of course not. If you ask bands what they want \u2013 and I know this because I\u2019m in a band and I deal with bands every day \u2013 what they want is a chance to expose their music and to have a shot at getting paid by their audience. I believe the current operating status satisfies the first of these conditions exquisitely and the latter at least as well as the old record label paradigm.\n\nSo who is this \u201cwe\u201d? The administrative parts of the old record business, that\u2019s who. The vertical labels who hold copyright on a lot of music. They want to do the figuring. They want to set the agenda. And they want to do all the structural tinkering. The bands, the audience, the people who make music and who pay for it \u2013 they are conspicuously not in the discussion.\n\nHow about the word \u201cneed\u201d, we \u201cneed\u201d to figure out? The need is actually a \u201cwant\u201d, a preference. These remnants of the music industry are unsatisfied with how the internet, the bands and the audience can get along fine without them. So they prefer to change things to re-establish relevance. You see this in the spate of 360 deals that are being offered now, where everything a band does, from their music to their T-shirts to their Twitter accounts belong to the record label. In exchange the record label offers startup money. I believe this approach is doomed by things like Kickstarter, which have proven more effective and efficient at raising money directly from the audience that wants to support the music.\n\nHow about the infinitive \u201cto figure out\u201d? We need \u201cto figure out\u201d. That presumes that we can know how to attack a global distribution enterprise long after the internet has crowdsourced an efficient and painless way to do precisely that. There\u2019s a reason the water faucet hasn\u2019t changed radically over the years. Time and trial have demonstrated that the best and simplest way to control hot water is by turning a tap. Problem solved, no further solving of the hot water faucet problem is required. I cannot be the only one who is annoyed by the constantly misaligned proximity faucets in public washrooms. Imagine if listening to music was as frustrating as that.\n\nThe next part of the sentence: \u201cmake\u201d distribution work. This implies that we have control over the distribution, that we can make it do some things but not others. The internet proves this to be a fallacy. Once we release music it\u2019s out of our control. I use the verb \u201crelease\u201d because it\u2019s common vernacular. But I think it\u2019s a perfect description. Even more apt if you consider what happens when you release other things, say a bird or a fart. When you release them they\u2019re in the world and the world will react and use them as it sees fit. The fart may wrinkle noses until it dissipates. The bird may fly outside and crap on windshields; it may get shot down by a farmer. It\u2019s been released, so you have no control over it. You can\u2019t recall the fart, however much you would like to. You can\u2019t protect the bird.\n\nDistribution is a problematic word. Its prior meaning implies scarcity and allocation of physical products. You can inventory them, you could tax them, duty them, you could search somebody\u2019s book bag for them. None of that is true with digital files. If it were possible to return digital files to the strict control of the record labels (it is impossible, don\u2019t worry), what would be their incentive to be honest in their accounting? In the physical distribution model you could inventory the titles in the warehouse during an audit and compare them with the delivery manifests from the press manufacturing plant, and know with reasonable accuracy how many copies had been sold. How on earth would you inventory a digital file? Count how many were left on the shelf?\n\nThat word is problematic, but the most problematic word in the sentence is the word \u201cwork\u201d: we need to figure out how to make it \u201cwork\u201d. Work is an impossible word in this context. Depending on who uses it, it will have contradictory meanings. For a label the system would work if it generated a profit per play, controlled access to music while providing access to the audience for advertisers as an additional income, and allowed the availability of push marketing for promotion. For the listener it would mean open access, ability to find specific and niche music, continuous playback, lack of nuisance, ease of use, freedom from spying, low or no cost, utility on different devices, lack of push marketing and lack of advertising. For a band it would mean finding an audience and having no barrier to participation, and no limits on amount of material made available. You can see how this is problematic. It is literally impossible for a system to satisfy all of these needs simultaneously when they are contradictory.\n\nAnd the hybrid approaches being tried are clumsy and insulting. I recently tried streaming a podcast from an official licensed site. When the cats started fighting I missed a little bit, having to separate the cats and then feed the cats and then calmed them down. I came back to my computer and tried to replay the last few minutes that I had missed but was greeted with a notice that due to copyright agreements this player was not allowed to rewind the podcast. I find it unimaginable that the people who posted the podcast wanted that provision enabled. And the site just ensured that I would never bother with their product again.\n\nThe conclusion of that sentence, the \u201cfor everyone\u201d is also problematic. I don\u2019t think it is necessary or even preferable to have everyone involved in defining the experience with music or more generally the relationship with the band and its audience. We seem to accept that record stores, who were once the welcoming face of the industry and the recipient of much promotional patronage described earlier, are not coming along in the digital era. Record stores now get their appeal from carrying secondhand records, something the industry used to have a regular shit fit about. And by carrying speciality and niche material that is too marginal for corporate attention, they are clearly not part of the \u201ceveryone\u201d in the sentence.\n\nSo there\u2019s no reason to insist that other obsolete bureaux and offices of the lapsed era be brought along into the new one. The music industry has shrunk. In shrinking it has rung out the middle, leaving the bands and the audiences to work out their relationship from the ends. I see this as both healthy and exciting. If we\u2019ve learned anything over the past 30 years it\u2019s that left to its own devices bands and their audiences can get along fine: the bands can figure out how to get their music out in front of an audience and the audience will figure out how to reward them.\n\nThe internet has facilitated the most direct and efficient, compact relationship ever between band and audience. And I do not mourn the loss of the offices of inefficiencies that died in the process. I suppose some people are out of work. But the same things happened when the automobile replaced the horse, and all the blacksmiths had to adapt, spending their time making garden gates rather than horseshoes.\n\nWhen I read over these notes on the plane today I felt like I spent too much time enumerating complaints, and I don\u2019t want to conclude without reiterating how terrific the current music environment is. I see more bands and I hear more music than ever before in my life. There are more gigs, more songs available than ever before, bands are being treated with more respect, and are more in control of their careers and destinies. I see them continuing as a constellation of enterprises: some big, some small \u2013 most small but all of them with a more immediate response from their audience and a greater chance to succeed. It is genuinely exciting.\n\nI\u2019ve been talking an awful long time, but I have not yet mentioned the intellectual property debate. I\u2019ll try to get that out of the way briefly now. I would like to leave room for questions after I speak, and though I\u2019m leaving out a lot \u2013 publishing, stolen credits, sampling, fair use, inspiration \u2013 I suspect there will be a healthy discussion afterward and think that such discussions are necessary and overdue.\n\nFrom my part, I believe the very concept of exclusive intellectual property with respect to recorded music has come to a natural end, or something like an end. Technology has brought to a head a need to embrace the meaning of the word \u201crelease\u201d, as in bird or fart. It is no longer possible to maintain control over digitised material and I don\u2019t believe the public good is served by trying to.\n\nThere is great public good by letting creative material lapse into the public ownership. The copyright law has been modified so extensively in the past decades that now this essentially never happens, creating absurdities whenever copyright is invoked. There\u2019s a huge body of work that is not legally in the public domain, though its rights holder, authors and creators have died or disappeared as businesses. And this material, from a legal standpoint now removed from our culture \u2013 nobody may copy it or re-release it because it\u2019s still subject to copyright.\n\nOther absurdities abound: innocuous usage of music in the background of home videos or student projects is technically an infringement and official obstacles are set up to prevent it. If you want a video of your wedding reception \u2013 your father\u2019s first dance with a new bride \u2013 it\u2019s off limits unless it is silent. If your little daughter does a kooky dance to a Prince song don\u2019t bother putting it on YouTube for her grandparents to see or a purple dwarf in assless chaps will put an injunction on you. Did I offend the little guy? Fuck him. His music is poison and he hits women.\n\nMusic has entered the environment as an atmospheric element, like the wind, and in that capacity should not be subject to control and compensation. Well, not unless the rights holders are willing to let me turn the tables on it. If you think my listening is worth something, OK then, so do I. Play a Phil Collins song while I\u2019m grocery shopping? Pay me $20. Def Leppard? Make it $100. Miley Cyrus? They don\u2019t print money big enough.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1287633", "artist_names": "Tommy James", "full_title": "Draggin' the Line

Lyrics[Intro]\n(Scat singing)\n\n[Verse 1]\nEvery Sunday morning before daybreak\nDown upon the farm, on the fishpond\nAll the little ducks, they go paddling\nLook out goldfish, you're for breakfast\n\n[Verse 2]\nSunday morning, hear the churchbells ringing\nHigh up in the trees the birds were singing\nIn the dewey grass spiders spinning\nRooster calls and cocks his doodle\n[Verse 3]\nAll around the farm animals stirring\nThrough the morning mist the bulls are beefing\nIn the grassy meadows cows are munching\nDaisy Bell, it's time for milking\n\n[Chorus 1]\nThere's such a lot to be done on the farm\nIn the sunshine, and when it's lunchtime\nIt's hop down the pub for a pint\nBack on the tractor to finish the plowing\n\n[Verse 4]\nStanding all alone, Fred the scarecrow\nHasn't got a clue how the wheat grows\nDoesn't mind the rain, hates the cold though\nSpecially when those icewinds blow snow\n\n[Verse 5]\nAll along the lane, bees are buzzing\nLittle furry things in hedgerows scurrying\nIn amongst the corn the bunnies are bouncing\nMust have springs upon their feet\n\n[Chorus 2]\nBehind the cowshed\nThe plowman is taking a peek\nAt the farmer's daughter\nWho's hanging her undies in the sun\nYou might also like[Chorus 3]\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us\nDown here on the farm\n\n[Break]\n(Scat singing)\n\n[Verse 6]\nIt's a lovely day for country walking\nThe vicar's on his bike, Billy's skateboarding\nFarmer and his dog out back shooting\nGun goes off and hits the tweeting\n\n[Verse 7]\nLots of smelly stinks around the farmyard\nGreat big pile of sh... behind the rhubarb\nSitting in his pram, baby bunting\nDoes a burp and starts his grunting\n\n[Chorus 4]\nGive him a drink, he's gone pink\nWants his mummy, needs changing, I think\nSuch a lot can be done on the farm\nIn the sunshine, and when it's lunchtime\nIt's hop down the pub for a pint\nSneak out the backway with Nelly the barmaid\n[Outro]\nTo the woods\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the farm\nBetter get on your boots and join us, down on the

Someone knocks on the bathroom door. The title, \u201cRussian Doll,\u201d comes on screen. There\u2019s another knock on the door. Nadia turns the sink off. More knocks on the door. Nadia looks over. A large glowing piece of art is hanging on the door. She walks over and pulls the door handle, which is a repurposed gun. \u201cGotta Get Up\u201d by Harry Nilsson begins playing. As Nadia exits the bathroom and into the hallway, a woman enters past her. Nadia approaches two women talking and helps light one\u2019s cigarette.\n\nWOMAN 1: Hey, happy birthday.\n\nNadia leaves and passes another woman.\n\nNADIA: Oh, hey.\nWOMAN 2: Hey, baby.\n\nNadia walks into a room, passing a man.\n\nMAN 1: Hey, happy birthday.\n\nNadia walks into another room, patting a woman on the shoulder.\n\nNADIA: Cool jacket.\n\nThey wave at each other.

Two minutes ago, I turned 36. Staring down the barrel of my own mortality always beats fun.\n\nMAXINE: Don't be morbid. This is your party, and I'm making you a fucking birthday chicken.\n\nNADIA: Thank you.\n\nMAXINE: You're welcome.\n\nLizzy enters the kitchen.\n\nLIZZY: Oh, my God, that bathroom, so killer.

He has survived more than the three of us can imagine.\n\nMaxine gets up and walks away.\n\nLIZZY: Okay, maybe you should consider making Oatmeal a strictly indoor cat to be safe.\n\nLizzy walks around the table to Nadia and rubs her shoulders.\n\nNADIA: Man, okay. You know what? (They both begin walking to another part of the room) I don't believe in dictating the boundaries of a sentient being's existence. For you, it's safety. For me and Oatmeal, it's a prison.\n\nLIZZY: However old you feel, Nad, you definitely sound 22.\n\nThey stop walking.\n\nNADIA: Thank you. It's my bad attitude that keeps me young. All right. Let's make some choices.\n\nThey look around the room.\nCUT TO: INT. BEDROOM\nCut to a shot of Maxine\u2019s fish tank. Nadia and Mike are alone in Maxine\u2019s bedroom. Nadia examines the fish. Mike stands against a wall, talking.\n\nMIKE: So when people say working class, what they really mean is people who can't afford to go to college. So these people, they feel sidelined by the American dream, right? So they resort to xenophobia and the bigotry, which the right stokes with pundit bullying, which is why we're in the situation we're in now. It's people voting against their own interests. They don't know-\n\nNADIA: (Interrupting) You got kids?\n\nMIKE: What is that? Your pick-up line?\n\nNADIA: Well, hasn't failed me yet.\n\nNadia gets up and walks near to Mike.\n\nMIKE: Yeah, I've got a son.\n\nMike\u2019s phone dings, and he picks it up.\n\nNADIA: I don't want to see a picture.\n\nMIKE: It's not a picture, it's a text.\n\nNADIA: Oh, from your wife?\n\nMIKE: His mother and I split up last year.\n\nNADIA: Huh. I have a cat.\n\nMIKE: Your place is great.\n\nNADIA: Oh, it's not my place. It's just my party. You know, this whole building used to be a school for Jews.\n\nMIKE: Right.\n\nNADIA: Seriously. Yeshiva students used to study the Talmud right where you're standing.\n\nNadia gets close to Mike.\n\nMIKE: What do you do?\n\nNadia walks towards the dresser.\n\nNADIA: I'm a software engineer. You know, I freelance. Uh, I used to work for Rock n' Roll games.\n\nMIKE: No shit. I play Dark Justice all the time. Battleground Blackout too. What's your handle?\n\nMike walks over to Nadia.\n\nNADIA: I don't play.\n\nMIKE: You don't play. Uh-uh.\n\nThey embrace.\n\nMIKE: Jesus, you're wet.\n\nNADIA: I know, right? It's like, don't go chasing waterfalls.\n\nMIKE: Lisa Left Eye Lopes was always my favorite because she burned down\n\nTOGETHER: That guy's house.\n\nThey begin to make out passionately.\nCUT TO: EXT. SIDEWALK\nCut to a wide shot of the sidewalk outside of Maxine\u2019s apartment. Mike and Nadia exit the building. Cut to a medium shot. Nadia begins smoking and looks across the street at a homeless man. He asks for money from a woman passing by, and then a man.\n\nHORSE: Hi, do you have a quarter? Hi, do you have a quarter?\n\nMAN: No.\n\nCut back to Mike and Nadia.\n\nMIKE: You all right?\n\nNADIA: I think I know that guy.\n\nCut back to the homeless man. Another man is giving him some money.\n\nMAN: Okay, here you go. Take it easy.\n\nMIKE: Worries me a bit.\n\nCut back to Mike and Nadia.\n\nNADIA: Let's get some provisions.\n\nNadia walks out of shot. Mike laughs, then follows her.\nCUT TO: INT. DELI\nNadia picks something off of a shelf in the deli. Some men are talking behind her.\n\nMAN 1: I'm telling you, my sister, you should go for her. She's fucking hot. She's fucking hot.\n\nMAN 2: I text her a lot. She doesn't -\n\nMAN 3: This is great. I feel like I'm choking you, but I'm not.\n\nCut to the front of the store. Mike is buying cigarettes. Nadia approaches.\n\nNADIA: Okay, big boy. All right. All right. Yes. Yes. See.\n\nMike gestures to the pack of condoms in his hand.\n\nMIKE: That's lambskin.\n\nNADIA: Now, that's a good call, 'cause my little pussy lips are allergic to latex.\n\nMIKE: Well, good, then. Where's the guy?\n\nFarran and Alan enter through the front door.\n\nFARRAN: Wait for me in the back. It's okay.\n\nAlan has trouble standing. Farran gets behind the counter.\n\nNADIA: Hey, Farran, how's it going?\n\nFARRAN: Hey. Ah, it's been better. Came to get smokes?\n\nNADIA: You seen Oatmeal?\n\nFARRAN: Uh, not for a while. Um, I leave the Meow Mix back there, but, uh, nothing.\n\nAlan knocks a number of items off of a shelf.\n\nNADIA: What's up with your friend?\n\nFARRAN: He's having a rough night.\n\nNadia approaches Alan to get a better look.\n\nMAN 1: Dude, I'm telling you. She's into you.\n\nMAN 2: Okay, 'cause I just texted her.\n\nMAN 1: I talk to my sister all the fucking time, and she thinks you're fucking hot.\n\nMAN 3: Just text her.\n\nAlan disappears from view. The other men shopping begin walking up front with their items and talk to Nadia.\n\nMAN 2: Hey. Hey, legs. Where's Clockwork Bar?\n\nNADIA: You want to take a left at Disneyland, dipshit.\n\nMAN 3: Oh, come on. We're new to the neighborhood. Where can we party?\n\nNADIA: Avenue D and 8th Street.\n\nMAN 3: All right. Thank you.\n\nNADIA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nMAN 1: Was that so hard?\n\nMan 1 winks at Nadia.\n\nNADIA: Fucking seriously, bro?\n\nMAN 1: Okay.\n\nNADIA: Jesus.\n\nMAN 1: Nice.\n\nNadia looks away from the men and back to where Alan was, but turns away and walks back to the counter.\n\nMAN 1: Hey, muchos, bro.\n\nMan 1 approaches the counter. He fakes out Mike, laughs, and leaves with the other two men.\n\nMAN 1: I think that guy's fucking her.\n\nMAN 3: Alright, alright, alright.\n\nMIKE: Where did you send them?\n\nNADIA: A hardware store that closed in 1996.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. SIDEWALK\nCut to a shot of Nadia\u2019s apartment building. A man walks on the sidewalk.\nCUT TO: INT. NADIA\u2019S APARTMENT\nCut to a shot of Nadia smoking in her apartment.\n\nMIKE: I don't know why anal play is still so taboo for straight males. It's almost parodic at this point, but, it's like I tell my students-\n\nNADIA: Hey, I don't want to hear about you fucking your students. I don't like that.\n\nMIKE: This whole thing's for your cat? A tree at the top, cat's at the bottom. He's a climber, I guess.\n\nMike buttons his pants and puts on his jacket.\n\nNADIA: That's bold, assuming that my cat is male. I mean, I get it, right? I'm single and I choose to foster a pet, so it must be a pathetic attempt to fill the hole in my soul that would otherwise be filled by what? A penis? No, thanks. I'm full up.\n\nMIKE: So what do you want me to do? Call you a sad cat lady so you could say you aren't one?\n\nMike sits down in a chair opposite Nadia.\n\nNADIA: Oh, come on. I mean, being a feline lover is not and has never been sad. I mean, the one, in practical application, just means the one I'm gonna die with. You know, to take care of me when I'm infirm and shit. So, my move is gonna be to wait till I'm in like my late 60s and then seal the deal. That is, of course, assuming I don't die between then and now.\n\nMIKE: Why didn't you talk like this before we fucked?\n\nNADIA: I didn't know you liked this type of shit. I thought you were a real sick fuck, but I see you're pretty deep, actually.\n\nMIKE: Why don't you come over here and sit on my face right now?\n\nNADIA: I would but I just called you an Uber.\n\nShe shows him her phone. Cut to Nadia sitting at her desk. She has dual monitors, with code on one screen and an animation on the other. \u201c...And the Rain\u201d by John Maus plays. Nadia types something. She opens her pack of cigarettes and realizes it\u2019s empty.\nCUT TO: EXT. STREET\nNadia walks on the sidewalk. She looks across the street and notices Oatmeal outside the park.\n\nNADIA: Hey, little one. Come here.\n\nNadia walks out into the street and is hit and killed by a taxi.\n\nDRIVER: Fuck!\n\nWOMAN 1: Oh, my God.\n\nWOMAN 2: Holy shit.\n\nWOMAN 3: Are you okay?\n\nThe driver gets out of his car to inspect Nadia. Oatmeal gets up and runs into the park. A number of people approach Nadia\u2019s body. A knock on a door is heard.\nCUT TO: INT. MAXINE\u2019S HOUSE\nCut to a shot of the glowing sculpture in Maxine\u2019s bathroom. There\u2019s a knock on the door. The sink is heard running, and then another series of knocks. Cut to a shot of Nadia standing at the sink from behind. More knocking is heard. Nadia turns around. \u201cGotta Get Up\u201d by Harry Nilsson plays. Nadia continues to look around as the knocking on the door continues. Nadia opens the door. Two women walk past her and into the bathroom. Cut to Nadia entering the kitchen. Maxine is there preparing food.\n\nMAXINE: Sweet birthday baby! Having fun?\n\nNadia cautiously approaches.\n\nMAXINE: It's laced with cocaine like the Israelis do it.\n\nMaxine hands her the joint from across the table. Nadia takes it from her.\n\nNADIA: Max.\n\nMAXINE: You're not having fun? You hate your party?\n\nNADIA: What was I just doing?\n\nMAXINE: What? What do you mean? You were in the bathroom. You mean before that?\n\nNadia turns and looks around.\n\nNADIA: Do you ever think it's weird? You know, just, like, partying in an old Yeshiva school?\n\nMAXINE: Why would it be weird?\n\nNADIA: Because this was once, you know, a sacred place.\n\nNadia turns back around and hands the cigarette back to Maxine.\n\nMAXINE: It's New York. Real estate is sacred. What's up with you?\n\nNADIA: Oatmeal is gone.\n\nMAXINE: Gone? No. He always comes back.\n\nNadia says nothing and looks closely at Maxine. Maxine returns a strange look. Nadia nods and points back at Maxine. Lizzy approaches. Nadia points at her, then backs into the crowd and walks away..\n\nLIZZY: What's up with the baby?\n\nMAXINE: I don't know. But if nobody eats my chicken, I'm gonna fucking kill myself.\n\nLIZZY: Max, the bathroom looks straight killer.\n\nMAXINE: Oh, thank you. Is it vaginal enough?\n\nLIZZY: Okay, let it go. Let... Let that go. It's a party. Come on. We're dancing.\n\nCut to a close up shot of the fishtank.\n\nMIKE: It's like John Updike said, \"Every marriage tends to consist of an aristocrat and a peasant, (Cut to shot of Mike pacing) of a teacher and a learner.\" Since my ex has tenure at Ford-\n\nNADIA: You got kids?\n\nMIKE: What is that, your pick-up line?\n\nNADIA: A son. You have a son.\n\nMIKE: Have we met before?\n\nNADIA: I think I have amnesia.\n\nMIKE: But you just remembered something. Amnesia means you forget stuff.\n\nNADIA: You know, it's a myth that fish have no memory. Some fish they can remember months. And a channel catfish can remember hearing a human announcing food up to five years after last hearing it.\n\nNadia inspects the fish tank. Cut to her re-entering the main room. She approaches Maxine.\n\nMAXINE: Hey.\n\nNADIA: Didn't you used to have more fish?\n\nNadia takes the joint from Maxine.\n\nMAXINE: What? No. I have two, Ketchup and Mustard. Are they right-side up?\n\nNADIA: No, they're alive.\n\nNadia begins smoking the joint.\n\nRUTH: The fucking stairs almost killed me. (Cut to Ruth) Nothing in this world is easy except pissing in a shower.\n\nRuth approaches Nadia and Maxine.\n\nMAXINE: Hi, Ruth.\n\nRUTH: Happy birthday, muffin.\n\nMaxine walks away. Nadia and Ruth hug. Mike walks towards the two of them, looks at them, and then walks away, looking at his phone.\n\nRUTH: And, no, no, I am not late. No, it's only 11 ish.\n\nNADIA: I don't know what I'm doing.\n\nShe looks over at Mike, who then leaves while talking on his phone.\n\nNADIA: I was gonna go home and fuck this guy, but now I just feel so profoundly empty. Do you know when menopause starts?\n\nRUTH: Uh, why don't we sit crooked and talk straight?\n\nCut to Maxine rolling a joint. Ruth and Nadia sit on a couch while Maxine sits in a chair opposite them.\n\nNADIA: I don't know. I was having the most intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, like I've done this already, you know? This night, this party.\n\nRUTH: This conversation?\n\nNADIA: No, this, this feels new. I think this is new. So that makes me think that, uh, you know, maybe I'm okay.\n\nRUTH: This was always gonna be a tough birthday.\n\nNADIA: Ruth, you know, you're a great shrink and everything, but you're not my shrink. And not everything is about Mom.\n\nRUTH: But I think she would've been proud you made it to 36.\n\nNADIA: Mmm. I don't know. I mean, she was pretty competitive. Eh, ipso facto, maybe she would've been pretty excited that I was actually finally older than she ever was.\n\nRUTH: There you have it.\n\nMaxine gets up.\n\nMAXINE: Okay, I'm gonna make another chicken. Will you guys eat another chicken?\n\nNADIA: Top ten idea. Top ten chicken.\n\nA man picks up a projector.\n\nMAN: Maxine, what is this?\n\nMaxine takes it from him.\n\nMAXINE: Oh. I got this at a Circuit City liquidation sale, but I put my own projections onto it. It's a little geeky, but I think you guys are gonna like it. Yeah?\n\nMAN: Yeah.\n\nMAXINE: Fine. Okay. Let's, let's get into it. Okay.\n\nMaxine gets the projector set up. She then addresses the group.\n\nMAXINE: This is a safe space. I'm looking for a communal experience and, and not a solo performance. Lights, please.\n\nMaxine projects her art on the wall. \u201cMorning After\u201d by Ariel Pink & Weyes Blood starts playing. The camera slowly zooms in on Nadia. She gets a distressed look on her face and has a flashback to being hit by the taxi. She gets up and leaves. Maxine looks agitated. Cut to Nadia entering the bathroom. Lizzy and another woman are making out inside.\n\nLIZZY: What the fuck? Oh, hey, Nad.\n\nNADIA: I think I'm gonna throw up.\n\nLIZZY: Are you okay?\n\nNADIA: Lizzy, does this bathroom seem weird to you?\n\nLIZZY: You drink too much?\n\nWOMAN 1: (Laughing) Me too.\n\nNADIA: No. No, no, no, no, no. Not more than usual.\n\nLIZZY: You smoke too much?\n\nNadia sits on the toilet.\n\nNADIA: Uh, I can't remember the last time I ate, but then other things are so clear, you know? Like they already happened and I'm doing them again. I think I'm dead.\n\nWOMAN 1: We're all dead.\n\nLIZZY: Sees a Fellini film once.\n\nJOHN: Hey, are you okay?\n\nLIZZY: John, yeah, we're all good. Nad's just a little under the weather.\n\nNADIA: No, no, no. Uh, I'm okay, I'm okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay.\n\nLizzy and her friend leave. Another woman enters.\n\nWOMAN 2: Are you fucking kidding me? There are people hopping up and down on one leg out here.\n\nLIZZY: Oh, well, she's the birthday girl and he's her ex, so if I were you, I'd get a backup plan.\n\nLizzy herds the others out of the bathroom. She goes to close the door.\n\nLIZZY: You guys aren't out in 20 minutes, I'll tell the line to wait longer.\n\nNADIA: Okay, thanks, Lucy.\n\nLizzy closes the door.\n\nJOHN: Hi.\n\nNADIA: Hi.\n\nCut to a shot of the party. A woman leads her boyfriend by the hand to another part of the apartment. The camera follows them, then stops on John and Nadia at a table.\n\nNADIA: Honestly, I think I'd feel better if you just told me, \"You sound like a crazy bitch.\u201d\n\nJONG: No, I just want to understand. So you think you were hit by a car while you were chasing your cat, and now you're reliving your birthday?\n\nNADIA: No, I don't think. I'm telling you it actually happened.\n\nJOHN: Okay, well, let's say that you were actually hit by a car.\n\nNADIA: Again, not hypothetical. Just a fact is what I'm trying to tell you.\n\nJOHN: So somebody who was actually struck by a vehicle maybe would have marks or something. But you, right now, look fantastic. In fact, you look beautiful.\n\nNADIA: Okay, thank you, but I feel like we're talking about something else-\n\nJOHN: And remember-\n\nNADIA: I'm grateful that you're complimenting me.\n\nJOHN: I'm not-\n\nNADIA: But you're not hearing me.\n\nJOHN: I'm just saying it didn't seem like it affected you, whatever this thing that happened.\n\nNADIA: Oh, I see. So now it's just a metaphor for our relationship.\n\nJOHN: My point is, is that you're okay.\n\nNADIA: Ah, yeah, I did smoke one of Maxine's joints, and I think that, uh, maybe it's just, yeah\u2026 me and cocaine are like oil and vinegar. I just think I'm not good at mixing substances.\n\nJOHN: Or metaphors.\n\nNADIA: Did I not say like oil and vinegar? Is that not a fucking simile? Okay, how are you?\n\nJOHN: You really want to know?\n\nNADIA: I do.\n\nJOHN: Well, my divorce is straight up harrowing at this point, and the last six months of my life have been an onslaught of personal failure and, uh other people's misery.\n\nNADIA: In a fun way? Sorry. How is Lucy?\n\nJOHN: She's gonna be fine. But I miss you very much.\n\nNADIA: Don't use your kid to try to guilt me to get back together.\n\nJOHN: Don't use my kid to ease your guilt.\n\nNADIA: I lost my cat.\n\nJOHN: What do you mean? What happened to Oatmeal? Doesn't he go out down to the park and to the deli, like stuff like that?\n\nNadia puts her head down. John pats her reassuringly.\n\nNADIA: It's been three days.\n\nJOHN: You want to go find him?\n\nNadia shoots up.\n\nNADIA: Really?\n\nJOHN: Yeah.\n\nCUT TO: EXT.

Do I know you?\n\nHORSE: What?\n\nNADIA: Do we know each other?\n\nHORSE: Fuck off!\n\nJOHN: Sounds like you guys have a lot in common.\n\nCut to a shot of Oatmeal running outside the park. He meows.\n\nNADIA: Oatmeal.\n\nNadia runs into the street. John pulls her out of the way just before she\u2019s hit by a taxi.\n\nJOHN: Hey! What are you doing? Did you not see that car?\n\nNADIA: That was Oatmeal. Let's go.\n\nJOHN: No, we're not going anywhere, okay? I'm taking you home cause you need to go to sleep.\n\nNADIA: Wait, so now you're not gonna help me look for Oatmeal?\n\nJOHN: I thought Oatmeal was a line you were using to get me to go home with you.\n\nNADIA: Oh, you think I need a line.\n\nJOHN: Yeah, because this is you we're talking about. I wouldn't have known it was your birthday party if Maxine hadn't texted me.\n\nNADIA: Oh my god. Do you know who gets mad about not being invited to birthday parties? Little girls. Grow up. Jesus.\n\nNadia walks away from him into the street. She looks both ways. A car honks.\n\nNADIA: Uh-oh, cars. Fucking Christ.\n\nNadia starts smoking as she continues walking. \u201cIf\u201d by Kat Edmonson begins playing. Cut to Nadia entering the park. She looks around for Oatmeal.\n\nNADIA: Oatmeal. Fuck.\n\nNadia spots Oatmeal in a bush.\n\nNADIA: Oatmeal. Oatmeal. Come here, my little fucking baby. (She approaches him) My little maniac. Who's a little lost boy? Yeah, you're the fucking one. (She picks him up) You're the one, baby. I love you.\n\nCut to Nadia holding Oatmeal. She sits on a railing next to a river. Oatmeal purrs.\n\nNADIA: Did we do it? Yeah, we fucking did it.\n\nAs Nadia looks around, the purring stops. She looks down. Oatmeal has disappeared from her arms.\n\nNADIA: Oatmeal? The fuck? Fuck, fuck, fuck! Ah!\n\nNadia falls off of the railing into the river.\nCUT TO: INT. MAXINE\u2019S HOUSE\nCut to Nadia looking in the mirror. She spits up a load of water in the sink.

Nadia opens the door.\n\nNADIA: Fuck. Excuse me.\n\nShe exits past two women. Cut to the kitchen. Maxine is smoking and preparing food.\n\nMAXINE: Sweet birthday baby, having fun? It\u2019s laced-\n\nNADIA: The universe is trying to fuck with me, and I refuse to engage. Do you hear me? I won't do it! And I don't give a fuck if you disappear my cat.\n\nMaxine approaches a distressed Nadia.\n\nMAXINE: Nadia, you're acting a little-\n\nNadia grabs the joint out of Maxine\u2019s hand.\n\nNADIA: What is in this?\n\nMAXINE: It's laced with cocaine, just like the Israelis.\n\nNADIA: No, man, no. I have tried cocaine many times, and nothing has ever fucked me up like this did.\n\nMAXINE: Yeah, you haven't even smoked it yet.\n\nNADIA: All right, Maxine. If there is a chance, I mean any chance, that there is something in here other than cocaine, I really need you to just tell me.\n\nMAXINE: Come on, Nads. Stop acting like such a victim. You're a cockroach.\n\nNADIA: I am not a cockroach. Why would you call me a cockroach? What does that even fucking mean, a cockroach?\n\nMAXINE: You can eat anything, take anything, do anything. It's impossible to destroy you. You'll never die.\n\nNadia laughs hysterically.\n\nNADIA: I am dying constantly! Ouch!\n\nThe cigarette burns Nadia\u2019s fingers. She drops it.\n\nMAXINE: Nads, if you're gonna act like this, then maybe you should just leave, okay?\n\nNADIA: Hah!\n\nNadia walks away.\n\nMAXINE: Don\u2019t bail on my party for you!\n\nCut to outside the apartment. Mike is on the phone outside.\n\nMIKE: Look, I'm at a work thing, so just call me when you get back into town. I miss you, too.

walked along\nUnder branches lit up by the moon\nPosing our questions to Owl and Eeyore\nAs our days disappeared all too soon\n\nBut I wandered much further today than I should\nAnd I can't find my way to the three-acre wood\n\nSo help me if you can, I've got to get\nBack to the house at Pooh Corner by one\nYou'd be surprised there's so much to be done\nCount all the bees in the hive\nChase all

"The Grapes of Wrath Chapter 6 LyricsTHE REVEREND CASY and young Tom stood on the hill and looked down on the\nJoad\u2005place.\u2005The small unpainted\u2005house was mashed at one corner,\u2005and it had been\npushed off its foundations so that it slumped at an angle, its blind front windows\npointing at a spot of sky well above the horizon. The fences were gone and the cotton\ngrew in the dooryard and up against the house, and the cotton was about the shed barn.\nThe outhouse lay on its side, and the cotton grew close against it. Where the dooryard\nhad been pounded hard by the bare feet of children and by stamping horses' hooves and\nby the broad wagon wheels, it was cultivated now, and the dark green, dusty cotton\ngrew. Young Tom stared for a long time at the ragged willow beside the dry horse\ntrough, at the concrete base where the pump had been. \"Jesus!\" he said at last. \"Hell\nmusta popped here. There ain't nobody livin' there.\" At last he moved quickly down the\nhill, and Casy followed him. He looked into the barn shed, deserted, a little ground\nstraw on the floor, and at the mule stall in the corner. And as he looked in, there was a\nskittering on the floor and a family of mice faded in under the straw. Joad paused at the\nentrance to the tool-shed leanto, and no tools were there\u2014a broken plow point, a mess\nof hay wire in the corner, an iron wheel from a hayrake and a rat-gnawed mule collar, a\nflat gallon oil can crusted with dirt and oil, and a pair of torn overalls hanging on a\nnail. \"There ain't nothin' left,\" said Joad. \"We had pretty nice tools. There ain't nothin'\nleft.\"\nCasy said, \"If I was still a preacher I'd say the arm of the Lord had struck. But now I\ndon't know what happened. I been away. I didn't hear nothin'.\" They walked toward the\nconcrete well-cap, walked through cotton plants to get to it, and the bolls were forming\non the cotton, and the land was cultivated.\n\"We never planted here,\" Joad said. \"We always kept this clear. Why, you can't get\na horse in now without he tromps the cotton.\" They paused at the dry watering trough,\nand the proper weeds that should grow under a trough were gone and the old thick\nwood of the trough was dry and cracked. On the well-cap the bolts that had held the\npump stuck up, their threads rusty and the nuts gone. Joad looked into the tube of the\nwell and listened. He dropped a clod down the well and listened. \"She was a good\nwell,\" he said. \"I can't hear water.\" He seemed reluctant to go to the house. He dropped\nclod after clod down the well. \"Maybe they're all dead,\" he said. \"But somebody'd a\ntold me. I'd a got word some way.\"\n\"Maybe they left a letter or something to tell in the house. Would they of knowed\nyou was comin' out?\"\n\"I don' know,\" said Joad. \"No, I guess not. I didn't know myself till a week ago.\"\n\"Le's look in the house. She's all pushed out a shape. Something knocked the hell\nout of her.\" They walked slowly toward the sagging house. Two of the supports of the\nporch roof were pushed out so that the roof flopped down on one end. And the housecorner was crushed in. Through a maze of splintered wood the room at the corner was\nvisible. The front door hung open inward, and a low strong gate across the front door\nhung outward on leather hinges.\nJoad stopped at the step, a twelve-by-twelve timber. \"Doorstep's here,\" he said. \"But\nthey're gone\u2014or Ma's dead.\" He pointed to the low gate across the front door. \"If Ma\nwas anywheres about, that gate'd be shut an' hooked. That's one thing she always\ndone\u2014seen that gate was shut.\" His eyes were warm. \"Ever since the pig got in over to\nJacobs' an' et the baby. Milly Jacobs was jus' out in the barn. She come in while the pig\nwas still eatin' it. Well, Milly Jacobs was in a family way, an' she went ravin'. Never\ndid get over it. Touched ever since. But Ma took a lesson from it. She never lef' that\npig gate open 'less she was in the house herself. Never did forget. No\u2014they're gone\u2014\nor dead.\" He climbed to the split porch and looked into the kitchen. The windows were\nbroken out, and throwing rocks lay on the floor, and the floor and walls sagged steeply\naway from the door, and the sifted dust was on the boards. Joad pointed to the broken\nglass and the rocks. \"Kids,\" he said. \"They'll go twenty miles to bust a window. I done\nit myself. They know when a house is empty, they know. That's the fust thing kids do\nwhen folks move out.\" The kitchen was empty of furniture, stove gone and the round\nstovepipe hole in the wall showing light. On the sink shelf lay an old beer opener and a\nbroken fork with its wooden handle gone. Joad slipped cautiously into the room, and\nthe floor groaned under his weight. An old copy of the Philadelphia Ledger was on the\nfloor against the wall, its pages yellow and curling. Joad looked into the bedroom\u2014no\nbed, no chairs, nothing. On the wall a picture of an Indian girl in color, labeled Red\nWing. A bed slat leaning against the wall, and in one corner a woman's high button\nshoe, curled up at the toe and broken over the instep. Joad picked it up and looked at it.\n\"I remember this,\" he said. \"This was Ma's. It's all wore out now. Ma liked them shoes.\nHad 'em for years. No, they've went\u2014an' took ever'thing.\"\nThe sun had lowered until it came through the angled end windows now, and it\nflashed on the edges of the broken glass. Joad turned at last and went out and crossed\nthe porch. He sat down on the edge of it and rested his bare feet on the twelve-bytwelve step. The evening light was on the fields, and the cotton plants threw long\nshadows on the ground, and the molting willow tree threw a long shadow.\nCasy sat down beside Joad. \"They never wrote you nothin'?\" he asked.\n\"No. Like I said, they wasn't people to write. Pa could write, but he wouldn't. Didn't\nlike to. It give him the shivers to write. He could work out a catalogue order as good as\nthe nex' fella, but he wouldn't write no letters just for ducks.\" They sat side by side,\nstaring off into the distance. Joad laid his rolled coat on the porch beside him. His\nindependent hands rolled a cigarette, smoothed it and lighted it, and he inhaled deeply\nand blew the smoke out through his nose. \"Somepin's wrong,\" he said. \"I can't put my\nfinger on her. I got an itch that somepin's wronger'n hell. Just this house pushed aroun'\nan' my folks gone.\"\nCasy said, \"Right over there the ditch was, where I done the baptizin'. You wasn't\nmean, but you was tough. Hung onto that little girl's pigtail like a bulldog. We baptize'\nyou both in the name of the Holy Ghos', and still you hung on. Ol' Tom says, 'Hol' 'im\nunder water.' So I shove your head down till you start to bubblin' before you'd let go a\nthat pigtail. You wasn't mean, but you was tough. Sometimes a tough kid grows up\nwith a big jolt of the sperit in him.\"\nA lean gray cat came sneaking out of the barn and crept through the cotton plants to\nthe end of the porch. It leaped silently up to the porch and crept low-belly toward the\nmen. It came to a place between and behind the two, and then it sat down, and its tail\nstretched out straight and flat to the floor, and the last inch of it flicked. The cat sat and\nlooked off into the distance where the men were looking.\nJoad glanced around at it. \"By God! Look who's here. Somebody stayed.\" He put\nout his hand, but the cat leaped away out of reach and sat down and licked the pads of\nits lifted paw. Joad looked at it, and his face was puzzled. \"I know what's the matter,\"\nhe cried. \"That cat jus' made me figger what's wrong.\"\n\"Seems to me there's lots wrong,\" said Casy.\n\"No, it's more'n jus' this place. Whyn't that cat jus' move in with some neighbors\u2014\nwith the Rances. How come nobody ripped some lumber off this house? Ain't been\nnobody here for three-four months, an' nobody's stole no lumber. Nice planks on the\nbarn shed, plenty good planks on the house, winda frames\u2014an' nobody's took 'em.\nThat ain't right. That's what was botherin' me, an' I couldn't catch hold of her.\"\n\"Well, what's that figger out for you?\" Casy reached down and slipped off his\nsneakers and wriggled his long toes on the step.\n\"I don' know. Seems like maybe there ain't any neighbors. If there was, would all\nthem nice planks be here? Why, Jesus Christ! Albert Rance took his family, kids an'\ndogs an' all, into Oklahoma City one Christmus. They was gonna visit with Albert's\ncousin. Well, folks aroun' here thought Albert moved away without sayin' nothin'\u2014\nfiggered maybe he got debts or some woman's squarin' off at him. When Albert come\nback a week later there wasn't a thing lef' in his house\u2014stove was gone, beds was\ngone, winda frames was gone, an' eight feet of plankin' was gone off the south side of\nthe house so you could look right through her. He come drivin' home just as Muley\nGraves was going away with the doors an' the well pump. Took Albert two weeks\ndrivin' aroun' the neighbors' 'fore he got his stuff back.\"\nCasy scratched his toes luxuriously. \"Didn't nobody give him an argument? All of\n'em jus' give the stuff up?\"\n\"Sure. They wasn't stealin' it. They thought he lef' it, an' they jus' took it. He got all\nof it back\u2014all but a sofa pilla, velvet with a pitcher of an Injun on it. Albert claimed\nGrampa got it. Claimed Grampa got Injun blood, that's why he wants that pitcher.\nWell, Grampa did get her, but he didn't give a damn about the pitcher on it. He jus'\nliked her. Used to pack her aroun' an' he'd put her wherever he was gonna sit. He never\nwould give her back to Albert. Says, 'If Albert wants this pilla so bad, let him come an'\nget her. But he better come shootin', 'cause I'll blow his goddamn stinkin' head off if he\ncomes messin' aroun' my pilla.' So finally Albert give up an' made Grampa a present of\nthat pilla. It give Grampa idears, though. He took to savin' chicken feathers. Says he's\ngonna have a whole damn bed of feathers. But he never got no feather bed. One time\nPa got mad at a skunk under the house. Pa slapped that skunk with a two-by-four, and\nMa burned all Grampa's feathers so we could live in the house.\" He laughed.\n\"Grampa's a tough ol' bastard. Jus' set on that Injun pilla an' says, 'Let Albert come an'\nget her. Why,' he says, 'I'll take that squirt and wring 'im out like a pair of drawers.'\"\nThe cat crept close between the men again, and its tail lay flat and its whiskers\njerked now and then. The sun dropped low toward the horizon and the dusty air was\nred and golden. The cat reached out a gray questioning paw and touched Joad's coat.\nHe looked around. \"Hell, I forgot the turtle. I ain't gonna pack it all over hell.\" He\nunwrapped the land turtle and pushed it under the house. But in a moment it was out,\nheaded southwest as it had been from the first. The cat leaped at it and struck at its\nstraining head and slashed at its moving feet. The old, hard, humorous head was pulled\nin, and the thick tail slapped in under the shell, and when the cat grew tired of waiting\nfor it and walked off, the turtle headed on southwest again.\nYoung Tom Joad and the preacher watched the turtle go\u2014waving its legs and\nboosting its heavy, high-domed shell along toward the southwest. The cat crept along\nbehind for a while, but in a dozen yards it arched its back to a strong taut bow and\nyawned, and came stealthily back toward the seated men.\n\"Where the hell you s'pose he's goin'?\" said Joad. \"I seen turtles all my life. They're\nalways goin' someplace. They always seem to want to get there.\" The gray cat seated\nitself between and behind them again. It blinked slowly. The skin over its shoulders\njerked forward under a flea, and then slipped slowly back. The cat lifted a paw and\ninspected it, flicked its claws out and in again experimentally, and licked its pads with\na shell-pink tongue. The red sun touched the horizon and spread out like a jellyfish,\nand the sky above it seemed much brighter and more alive than it had been. Joad\nunrolled his new yellow shoes from his coat, and he brushed his dusty feet with his\nhand before he slipped them on.\nThe preacher, staring off across the fields, said, \"Somebody's comin'. Look! Down\nthere, right through the cotton.\"\nJoad looked where Casy's finger pointed. \"Comin' afoot,\" he said. \"Can't see 'im for\nthe dust he raises. Who the hell's comin' here?\" They watched the figure approaching\nin the evening light, and the dust it raised was reddened by the setting sun. \"Man,\" said\nJoad. The man drew closer, and as he walked past the barn, Joad said, \"Why, I know\nhim. You know him\u2014that's Muley Graves.\" And he called, \"Hey, Muley! How ya?\"\nThe approaching man stopped, startled by the call, and then he came on quickly. He\nwas a lean man, rather short. His movements were jerky and quick. He carried a gunny\nsack in his hand. His blue jeans were pale at knee and seat, and he wore an old black\nsuit coat, stained and spotted, the sleeves torn loose from the shoulders in back, and\nragged holes worn through at the elbows. His black hat was as stained as his coat, and\nthe band, torn half free, flopped up and down as he walked. Muley's face was smooth\nand unwrinkled, but it wore the truculent look of a bad child's, the mouth held tight and\nsmall, the little eyes half scowling, half petulant.\n\"You remember Muley,\" Joad said softly to the preacher.\n\"Who's that?\" the advancing man called. Joad did not answer. Muley came close,\nvery close, before he made out the faces. \"Well, I'll be damned,\" he said. \"It's Tommy\nJoad. When'd you get out, Tommy?\"\n\"Two days ago,\" said Joad. \"Took a little time to hitchhike home. An' look here\nwhat I find. Where's my folks, Muley? What's the house all smashed up for, an' cotton\nplanted in the dooryard?\"\n\"By God, it's lucky I come by!\" said Muley. \"Cause ol' Tom worried himself. When\nthey was fixin' to move I was settin' in the kitchen there. I jus' tol' Tom I wan't gonna\nmove, by God. I tol' him that, an' Tom says, 'I'm worryin' myself about Tommy. S'pose\nhe comes home an' they ain't nobody here. What'll he think?' I says, 'Whyn't you write\ndown a letter?' An' Tom says, 'Maybe I will. I'll think about her. But if I don't, you\nkeep your eye out for Tommy if you're still aroun'.' 'I'll be aroun',' I says. 'I'll be aroun'\ntill hell freezes over. There ain't nobody can run a guy name of Graves outa this\ncountry.' An' they ain't done it, neither.\"\nJoad said impatiently, \"Where's my folks? Tell about you standin' up to 'em later,\nbut where's my folks?\"\n\"Well, they was gonna stick her out when the bank come to tractorin' off the place.\nYour grampa stood out here with a rifle, an' he blowed the headlights off the cat', but\nshe come on just the same. Your grampa didn't wanta kill the guy drivin' that cat', an'\nthat was Willy Feeley, an' Willy knowed it, so he jus' come on, an' bumped the hell\nouta the house, an' give her a shake like a dog shakes a rat. Well, it took somepin outa\nTom. Kinda got into 'im. He ain't been the same ever since.\"\n\"Where is my folks?\" Joad spoke angrily.\n\"What I'm tellin' you. Took three trips with your Uncle John's wagon. Took the\nstove an' the pump an' the beds. You should a seen them beds go out with all them kids\nan' your granma an' grampa settin' up against the headboard, an' your brother Noah\nsettin' there smokin' a cigarette, an' spittin' la-de-da over the side of the wagon.\" Joad\nopened his mouth to speak. \"They're all at your Uncle John's,\" Muley said quickly.\n\"Oh! All at John's. Well, what they doin' there? Now stick to her for a second,\nMuley. Jus' stick to her. In jus' a minute you can go on your own way. What they doin'\nthere?\"\n\"Well, they been choppin' cotton, all of 'em, even the kids an' your grampa. Gettin'\nmoney together so they can shove on west. Gonna buy a car and shove on west where\nit's easy livin'. There ain't nothin' here. Fifty cents a clean acre for choppin' cotton, an'\nfolks beggin' for the chance to chop.\"\n\"An' they ain't gone yet?\"\n\"No,\" said Muley. \"Not that I know. Las' I heard was four days ago when I seen\nyour brother Noah out shootin' jackrabbits, an' he says they're aimin' to go in about two\nweeks. John got his notice he got to get off. You jus' go on about eight miles to John's\nplace. You'll find your folks piled in John's house like gophers in a winter burrow.\"\n\"O.K.,\" said Joad. \"Now you can ride on your own way. You ain't changed a bit,\nMuley. If you want to tell about somepin off northwest, you point your nose straight\nsoutheast.\"\nMuley said truculently, \"You ain't changed neither. You was a smart-aleck kid, an'\nyou're still a smart aleck. You ain't tellin' me how to skin my life, by any chancet?\"\nJoad grinned. \"No, I ain't. If you wanta drive your head into a pile a broken glass,\nthere ain't nobody can tell you different. You know this here preacher, don't you,\nMuley? Rev. Casy.\"\n\"Why, sure, sure. Didn't look over. Remember him well.\" Casy stood up and the\ntwo shook hands. \"Glad to see you again,\" said Muley. \"You ain't been aroun' for a hell\nof a long time.\"\n\"I been off a-askin' questions,\" said Casy. \"What happened here? Why they kickin'\nfolks off the lan'?\"\nMuley's mouth snapped shut so tightly that a little parrot's beak in the middle of his\nupper lip stuck down over his under lip. He scowled. \"Them sons-a-bitches,\" he said.\n\"Them dirty sons-a-bitches. I tell ya, men, I'm stayin'. They ain't gettin' rid a me. If\nthey throw me off, I'll come back, an' if they figger I'll be quiet underground, why, I'll\ntake couple-three of the sons-a-bitches along for company.\" He patted a heavy weight\nin his side coat pocket. \"I ain't a-goin'. My pa come here fifty years ago. An' I ain't agoin'.\"\nJoad said, \"What's the idear of kickin' the folks off?\"\n\"Oh! They talked pretty about it. You know what kinda years we been havin'. Dust\ncomin' up an' spoilin' ever'thing so a man didn't get enough crop to plug up an ant's ass.\nAn' ever'body got bills at the grocery. You know how it is. Well, the folks that owns\nthe lan' says, 'We can't afford to keep no tenants.' An' they says, 'The share a tenant\ngets is jus' the margin a profit we can't afford to lose.' An' they says, 'If we put all our\nlan' in one piece we can jus' hardly make her pay.' So they tractored all the tenants off a\nthe lan'. All 'cept me, an' by God I ain't goin'. Tommy, you know me. You knowed me\nall your life.\"\n\"Damn right,\" said Joad, \"all my life.\"\n\"Well, you know I ain't a fool. I know this land ain't much good. Never was much\ngood 'cept for grazin'. Never should a broke her up. An' now she's cottoned damn near\nto death. If on'y they didn't tell me I got to get off, why, I'd prob'y be in California right\nnow a-eatin' grapes an' a-pickin' an orange when I wanted. But them sons-a-bitches\nsays I got to get off\u2014an', Jesus Christ, a man can't, when he's tol' to!\"\n\"Sure,\" said Joad. \"I wonder Pa went so easy. I wonder Grampa didn' kill nobody.\nNobody never tol' Grampa where to put his feet. An' Ma ain't nobody you can push\naroun' neither. I seen her beat the hell out of a tin peddler with a live chicken one time\n'cause he give her a argument. She had the chicken in one han', an' the ax in the other,\nabout to cut its head off. She aimed to go for that peddler with the ax, but she forgot\nwhich hand was which, an' she takes after him with the chicken. Couldn' even eat that\nchicken when she got done. They wasn't nothing but a pair a legs in her han'. Grampa\nthrowed his hip outa joint laughin'. How'd my folks go so easy?\"\n\"Well, the guy that comes aroun' talked nice as pie. 'You got to get off. It ain't my\nfault.' 'Well,' I says, 'whose fault is it? I'll go an' I'll nut the fella.' 'It's the Shawnee Lan'\nan' Cattle Company. I jus' got orders.' 'Who's the Shawnee Lan' an' Cattle Company?'\n'It ain't nobody. It's a company.' Got a fella crazy. There wasn't nobody you could lay\nfor. Lot a the folks jus' got tired out lookin' for somepin to be mad at\u2014but not me. I'm\nmad at all of it. I'm stayin'.\"\nA large red drop of sun lingered on the horizon and then dripped over and was gone,\nand the sky was brilliant over the spot where it had gone, and a torn cloud, like a\nbloody rag, hung over the spot of its going. And dusk crept over the sky from the\neastern horizon, and darkness crept over the land from the east. The evening star\nflashed and glittered in the dusk. The gray cat sneaked away toward the open barn shed\nand passed inside like a shadow.\nJoad said, \"Well, we ain't gonna walk no eight miles to Uncle John's place tonight.\nMy dogs is burned up. How's it if we go to your place, Muley? That's on'y about a\nmile.\"\n\"Won't do no good.\" Muley seemed embarrassed. \"My wife an' the kids an' her\nbrother all took an' went to California. They wasn't nothin' to eat. They wasn't as mad\nas me, so they went. They wasn't nothin' to eat here.\"\nThe preacher stirred nervously. \"You should of went too. You shouldn't of broke up\nthe fambly.\"\n\"I couldn',\" said Muley Graves. \"Somepin jus' wouldn' let me.\"\n\"Well, by God, I'm hungry,\" said Joad. \"Four solemn years I been eatin' right on the\nminute. My guts is yellin' bloody murder. What you gonna eat, Muley? How you been\ngettin' your dinner?\"\nMuley said ashamedly, \"For a while I et frogs an' squirrels an' prairie dogs\nsometimes. Had to do it. But now I got some wire nooses on the tracks in the dry\nstream brush. Get rabbits, an' sometimes a prairie chicken. Skunks get caught, an'\ncoons, too.\" He reached down, picked up his sack, and emptied it on the porch. Two\ncottontails and a jackrabbit fell out and rolled over limply, soft and furry.\n\"God Awmighty,\" said Joad, \"it's more'n four years sence I've et fresh-killed meat.\"\nCasy picked up one of the cottontails and held it in his hand. \"You sharin' with us,\nMuley Graves?\" he asked.\nMuley fidgeted in embarrassment. \"I ain't got no choice in the matter.\" He stopped\non the ungracious sound of his words. \"That ain't like I mean it. That ain't. I mean\"\u2014\nhe stumbled\u2014\"what I mean, if a fella's got somepin to eat an' another fella's hungry\u2014\nwhy, the first fella ain't got no choice. I mean, s'pose I pick up my rabbits an' go off\nsomewheres an' eat 'em. See?\"\n\"I see,\" said Casy. \"I can see that. Muley sees somepin there, Tom. Muley's got aholt of somepin, an' it's too big for him, an' it's too big for me.\"\nYoung Tom rubbed his hands together. \"Who got a knife? Le's get at these here\nmiserable rodents. Le's get at 'em.\"\nMuley reached in his pants pocket and produced a large horn-handled pocket knife.\nTom Joad took it from him, opened a blade, and smelled it. He drove the blade again\nand again into the ground and smelled it again, wiped it on his trouser leg, and felt the\nedge with his thumb.\nMuley took a quart bottle of water out of his hip pocket and set it on the porch. \"Go\neasy on that there water,\" he said. \"That's all there is. This here well's filled in.\"\nTom took up a rabbit in his hand. \"One of you go get some bale wire outa the barn.\nWe'll make a fire with some a this broken plank from the house.\" He looked at the\ndead rabbit. \"There ain't nothin' so easy to get ready as a rabbit,\" he said. He lifted the\nskin of the back, slit it, put his fingers in the hole, and tore the skin off. It slipped off\nlike a stocking, slipped off the body to the neck, and off the legs to the paws. Joad\npicked up the knife again and cut off head and feet. He laid the skin down, slit the\nrabbit along the ribs, shook out the intestines onto the skin, and then threw the mess off\ninto the cotton field. And the clean-muscled little body was ready. Joad cut off the legs\nand cut the meaty back into two pieces. He was picking up the second rabbit when\nCasy came back with a snarl of bale wire in his hand. \"Now build up a fire and put\nsome stakes up,\" said Joad. \"Jesus Christ, I'm hungry for these here creatures!\" He\ncleaned and cut the rest of the rabbits and strung them on the wire. Muley and Casy\ntore splintered boards from the wrecked house-corner and started a fire, and they drove\na stake into the ground on each side to hold the wire.\nMuley came back to Joad. \"Look out for boils on that jackrabbit,\" he said. \"I don't\nlike to eat no jackrabbit with boils.\" He took a little cloth bag from his pocket and put\nit on the porch.\nJoad said, \"The jack was clean as a whistle\u2014Jesus God, you got salt too? By any\nchance you got some plates an' a tent in your pocket?\" He poured salt in his hand and\nsprinkled it over the pieces of rabbit strung on the wire.\nThe fire leaped and threw shadows on the house, and the dry wood crackled and\nsnapped. The sky was almost dark now and the stars were out sharply. The gray cat\ncame out of the barn shed and trotted miaowing toward the fire, but, nearly there, it\nturned and went directly to one of the little piles of rabbit entrails on the ground. It\nchewed and swallowed, and the entrails hung from its mouth.\nCasy sat on the ground beside the fire, feeding it broken pieces of board, pushing\nthe long boards in as the flame ate off their ends. The evening bats flashed into the\nfirelight and out again. The cat crouched back and licked its lips and washed its face\nand whiskers.\nJoad held up his rabbit-laden wire between his two hands and walked to the fire.\n\"Here, take one end, Muley. Wrap your end around that stake. That's good, now! Let's\ntighten her up. We ought to wait till the fire's burned down, but I can't wait.\" He made\nthe wire taut, then found a stick and slipped the pieces of meat along the wire until they\nwere over the fire. And the flames licked up around the meat and hardened and glazed\nthe surfaces. Joad sat down by the fire, but with his stick he moved and turned the\nrabbit so that it would not become sealed to the wire. \"This here is a party,\" he said.\n\"Salt, Muley's got, an' water an' rabbits. I wish he got a pot of hominy in his pocket.\nThat's all I wish.\"\nMuley said over the fire, \"You fellas'd think I'm touched, the way I live.\"\n\"Touched nothin',\" said Joad. \"If you're touched, I wisht ever'body was touched.\"\nMuley continued, \"Well, sir, it's a funny thing. Somepin went an' happened to me\nwhen they tol' me I had to get off the place. Fust I was gonna go in an' kill a whole\nflock a people. Then all my folks all went away out west. An' I got wanderin' aroun'.\nJus' walkin' aroun'. Never went far. Slep' where I was. I was gonna sleep here tonight.\nThat's why I come. I'd tell myself, 'I'm lookin' after things so when all the folks come\nback it'll be all right.' But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look after.\nThe folks ain't never comin' back. I'm jus' wanderin' aroun' like a damn ol' graveyard\nghos'.\"\n\"Fella gets use' to a place, it's hard to go,\" said Casy. \"Fella gets use' to a way a\nthinkin' it's hard to leave. I ain't a preacher no more, but all the time I find I'm prayin',\nnot even thinkin' what I'm doin.\"\nJoad turned the pieces of meat over on the wire. The juice was dripping now, and\nevery drop, as it fell in the fire, shot up a spurt of flame. The smooth surface of the\nmeat was crinkling up and turning a faint brown. \"Smell her,\" said Joad. \"Jesus, look\ndown an' just smell her!\"\nMuley went on, \"Like a damn ol' graveyard ghos'. I been goin' aroun' the places\nwhere stuff happened. Like there's a place over by our forty; in a gully they's a bush.\nFust time I ever laid with a girl was there. Me fourteen an' stampin' an' jerkin' an'\nsnortin' like a buck deer, randy as a billygoat. So I went there an' I laid down on the\ngroun', an' I seen it all happen again. An' there's the place down by the barn where Pa\ngot gored to death by a bull. An' his blood is right in that groun', right now. Mus' be.\nNobody never washed it out. An' I put my han' on that groun' where my own pa's blood\nis part of it.\" He paused uneasily. \"You fellas think I'm touched?\"\nJoad turned the meat, and his eyes were inward. Casy, feet drawn up, stared into the\nfire. Fifteen feet back from the men the fed cat was sitting, the long gray tail wrapped\nneatly around the front feet. A big owl shrieked as it went overhead, and the firelight\nshowed its white underside and the spread of its wings.\n\"No,\" said Casy. \"You're lonely\u2014but you ain't touched.\"\nMuley's tight little face was rigid. \"I put my han' right on the groun' where that\nblood is still. An' I seen my pa with a hole through his ches', an' I felt him shiver up\nagainst me like he done, an' I seen him kind of settle back an' reach with his han's an'\nhis feet. An' I seen his eyes all milky with hurt, an' then he was still an' his eyes so\nclear\u2014lookin' up. An' me a little kid settin' there, not cryin' nor nothin', jus' settin'\nthere.\" He shook his head sharply. Joad turned the meat over and over. \"An' I went in\nthe room where Joe was born. Bed wasn't there, but it was the room. An' all them\nthings is true, an' they're right in the place they happened. Joe came to life right there.\nHe give a big ol' gasp an' then he let out a squawk you could hear a mile, an' his\ngranma standin' there says, 'That's a daisy, that's a daisy,' over an' over. An' her so\nproud she bust three cups that night.\"\nJoad cleared his throat. \"Think we better eat her now.\"\n\"Let her get good an' done, good an' brown, awmost black,\" said Muley irritably. \"I\nwanta talk. I ain't talked to nobody. If I'm touched, I'm touched, an' that's the end of it.\nLike a ol' graveyard ghos' goin' to neighbors' houses in the night. Peters', Jacobs',\nRance's, Joad's; an' the houses all dark, standin' like miser'ble ratty boxes, but they was\ngood parties an' dancin'. An' there was meetin's and shoutin' glory. They was weddin's,\nall in them houses. An' then I'd want to go in town an' kill folks. 'Cause what'd they\ntake when they tractored the folks off the lan'? What'd they get so their 'margin a profit'\nwas safe? They got Pa dyin' on the groun', an' Joe yellin' his first breath, an' me jerkin'\nlike a billy goat under a bush in the night. What'd they get? God knows the lan' ain't no\ngood. Nobody been able to make a crop for years. But them sons-a-bitches at their\ndesks, they jus' chopped folks in two for their margin a profit. They jus' cut 'em in two.\nPlace where folks live is them folks. They ain't whole, out lonely on the road in a\npiled-up car. They ain't alive no more. Them sons-a-bitches killed 'em.\" And he was\nsilent, his thin lips still moving, his chest still panting. He sat and looked down at his\nhands in the firelight. \"I\u2014I ain't talked to nobody for a long time,\" he apologized\nsoftly. \"I been sneakin' aroun' like a ol' graveyard ghos'.\"\nCasy pushed the long boards into the fire and the flames licked up around them and\nleaped up toward the meat again. The house cracked loudly as the cooler night air\ncontracted the wood. Casy said quietly, \"I gotta see them folks that's gone out on the\nroad. I got a feelin' I got to see them. They gonna need help no preachin' can give 'em.\nHope of heaven when their lives ain't lived? Holy Sperit when their own sperit is\ndowncast an' sad? They gonna need help. They got to live before they can afford to\ndie.\"\nJoad cried nervously, \"Jesus Christ, le's eat this meat 'fore it's smaller'n a cooked\nmouse! Look at her. Smell her.\" He leaped to his feet and slid the pieces of meat along\nthe wire until they were clear of the fire. He took Muley's knife and sawed through a\npiece of meat until it was free of the wire. \"Here's for the preacher,\" he said.\n\"I tol' you I ain't no preacher.\"\n\"Well, here's for the man, then.\" He cut off another piece. \"Here, Muley, if you ain't\ntoo goddamn upset to eat. This here's jackrabbit. Tougher'n a bull-bitch.\" He sat back\nand clamped his long teeth on the meat and tore out a great bite and chewed it. \"Jesus\nChrist! Hear her crunch!\" And he tore out another bite ravenously.\nMuley still sat regarding his meat. \"Maybe I oughtn' to a-talked like that,\" he said.\n\"Fella should maybe keep stuff like that in his head.\"\nCasy looked over, his mouth full of rabbit. He chewed, and his muscled throat\nconvulsed in swallowing. \"Yes, you should talk,\" he said. \"Sometimes a sad man can\ntalk the sadness right out through his mouth. Sometimes a killin' man can talk the\nmurder right out of his mouth an' not do no murder. You done right. Don't you kill\nnobody if you can help it.\" And he bit out another hunk of rabbit. Joad tossed the bones\nin the fire and jumped up and cut more off the wire. Muley was eating slowly now, and\nhis nervous little eyes went from one to the other of his companions. Joad ate scowling\nlike an animal, and a ring of grease formed around his mouth.\nFor a long time Muley looked at him, almost timidly. He put down the hand that\nheld the meat. \"Tommy,\" he said.\nJoad looked up and did not stop gnawing the meat. \"Yeah?\" he said, around a\nmouthful.\n\"Tommy, you ain't mad with me talkin' about killin' people? You ain't huffy, Tom?\"\n\"No,\" said Tom. \"I ain't huffy. It's just somepin that happened.\"\n\"Ever'body knowed it was no fault of yours,\" said Muley. \"Ol' man Turnbull said he\nwas gonna get you when ya come out. Says nobody can kill one a his boys. All the\nfolks hereabouts talked him outa it, though.\"\n\"We was drunk,\" Joad said softly. \"Drunk at a dance. I don' know how she started.\nAn' then I felt that knife go in me, an' that sobered me up. Fust thing I see is Herb\ncomin' for me again with his knife. They was this here shovel leanin' against the\nschoolhouse, so I grabbed it an' smacked 'im over the head. I never had nothing against\nHerb. He was a nice fella. Come a-bullin' after my sister Rosasharn when he was a\nlittle fella. No, I liked Herb.\"\n\"Well, ever'body tol' his pa that, an' finally cooled 'im down. Somebody says they's\nHatfield blood on his mother's side in ol' Turnbull, an' he's got to live up to it. I don't\nknow about that. Him an' his folks went on to California six months ago.\"\nJoad took the last of the rabbit from the wire and passed it around. He settled back\nand ate more slowly now, chewed evenly, and wiped the grease from his mouth with\nhis sleeve. And his eyes, dark and half closed, brooded as he looked into the dying fire.\n\"Ever'body's goin' west,\" he said. \"I got me a parole to keep. Can't leave the state.\"\n\"Parole?\" Muley asked. \"I heard about them. How do they work?\"\n\"Well, I got out early, three years early. They's stuff I gotta do, or they send me\nback in. Got to report ever' so often.\"\n\"How they treat ya there in McAlester? My woman's cousin was in McAlester an'\nthey give him hell.\"\n\"It ain't so bad,\" said Joad. \"Like ever'place else. They give ya hell if ya raise hell.\nYou get along O.K. les' some guard gets it in for ya. Then you catch plenty hell. I got\nalong O.K. Minded my own business, like any guy would. I learned to write nice as\nhell. Birds an' stuff like that, too; not just word writin'. My ol' man'll be sore when he\nsees me whip out a bird in one stroke. Pa's gonna be mad when he sees me do that. He\ndon't like no fancy stuff like that. He don't even like word writin'. Kinda scares 'im I\nguess. Ever' time Pa seen writin', somebody took somepin away from 'im.\"\n\"They didn't give you no beatin's or nothin' like that?\"\n\"No, I jus' tended my own affairs. 'Course you get goddamn good an' sick a-doin'\nthe same thing day after day for four years. If you done somepin you was ashamed of,\nyou might think about that. But, hell, if I seen Herb Turnbull comin' for me with a\nknife right now, I'd squash him down with a shovel again.\"\n\"Anybody would,\" said Muley. The preacher stared into the fire, and his high\nforehead was white in the settling dark. The flash of little flames picked out the cords\nof his neck. His hands, clasped about his knees, were busy pulling knuckles.\nJoad threw the last bones into the fire and licked his fingers and then wiped them on\nhis pants. He stood up and brought the bottle of water from the porch, took a sparing\ndrink, and passed the bottle before he sat down again. He went on. \"The thing that give\nme the mos' trouble was, it didn' make no sense. You don't look for no sense when\nlightnin' kills a cow, or it comes up a flood. That's jus' the way things is. But when a\nbunch of men take an' lock you up four years, it ought to have some meaning. Men is\nsupposed to think things out. Here they put me in, an' keep me an' feed me four years.\nThat ought to either make me so I won't do her again or else punish me so I'll be afraid\nto do her again\"\u2014he paused\u2014\"but if Herb or anybody else come for me, I'd do her\nagain. Do her before I could figure her out. Specially if I was drunk. That sort of\nsenselessness kind a worries a man.\"\nMuley observed, \"Judge says he give you a light sentence 'cause it wasn't all your\nfault.\"\nJoad said, \"They's a guy in McAlester\u2014lifer. He studies all the time. He's sec'etary\nof the warden\u2014writes the warden's letters an' stuff like that. Well, he's one hell of a\nbright guy an' reads law an' all stuff like that. Well, I talked to him one time about her,\n'cause he reads so much stuff. An' he says it don't do no good to read books. Says he's\nread ever'thing about prisons now, an' in the old times; an' he says she makes less sense\nto him now than she did before he starts readin'. He says it's a thing that started way to\nhell an' gone back, an' nobody seems to be able to stop her, an' nobody got sense\nenough to change her. He says for God's sake don't read about her because he says for\none thing you'll jus' get messed up worse, an' for another you won't have no respect for\nthe guys that work the gover'ments.\"\n\"I ain't got a hell of a lot of respec' for 'em now,\" said Muley. \"On'y kind a\ngover'ment we got that leans on us fellas is the 'safe margin a profit.' There's one thing\nthat got me stumped, an' that's Willy Feeley\u2014drivin' that cat', an' gonna be a straw\nboss on lan' his own folks used to farm. That worries me. I can see how a fella might\ncome from some other place an' not know no better, but Willy belongs. Worried me so\nI went up to 'im and ast 'im. Right off he got mad. 'I got two little kids,' he says. 'I got a\nwife an' my wife's mother. Them people got to eat.' Gets madder'n hell. 'Fust an' on'y\nthing I got to think about is my own folks,' he says. 'What happens to other folks is\ntheir look-out,' he says. Seems like he's 'shamed, so he gets mad.\"\nJim Casy had been staring at the dying fire, and his eyes had grown wider and his\nneck muscles stood higher. Suddenly he cried, \"I got her! If ever a man got a dose of\nthe sperit, I got her. Got her all of a flash!\" He jumped to his feet and paced back and\nforth, his head swinging. \"Had a tent one time. Drawed as much as five hundred people\never' night. That's before either you fellas seen me.\" He stopped and faced them. \"Ever\nnotice I never took no collections when I was preachin' out here to folks\u2014in barns an'\nin the open?\"\n\"By God, you never,\" said Muley. \"People around here got so use' to not givin' you\nmoney they got to bein' a little mad when some other preacher came along an' passed\nthe hat. Yes, sir!\"\n\"I took somepin to eat,\" said Casy. \"I took a pair a pants when mine was wore out,\nan' a ol' pair a shoes when I was walkin' through to the groun', but it wasn't like when I\nhad the tent. Some days there I'd take in ten or twenty dollars. Wasn't happy that-away, so I give her up, an' for a time I was happy. I think I got her now. I don't know if I\ncan say her. I guess I won't try to say her\u2014but maybe there's a place for a preacher.\nMaybe I can preach again. Folks out lonely on the road, folks with no lan', no home to\ngo to. They got to have some kind of home. Maybe\u2014\" He stood over the fire. The\nhundred muscles of his neck stood out in high relief, and the firelight went deep into\nhis eyes and ignited red embers. He stood and looked at the fire, his face tense as\nthough he were listening, and the hands that had been active to pick, to handle, to\nthrow ideas, grew quiet, and in a moment crept into his pocket. The bats flittered in\nand out of the dull firelight, and the soft watery burble of a night hawk came from\nacross the fields.\nTom reached quietly into his pocket and brought out his tobacco, and he rolled a\ncigarette slowly and looked over it at the coals while he worked. He ignored the whole\nspeech of the preacher, as though it were some private thing that should not be\ninspected. He said, \"Night after night in my bunk I figgered how she'd be when I come\nhome again. I figgered maybe Grampa and Granma'd be dead, an' maybe there'd be\nsome new kids. Maybe Pa'd not be so tough. Maybe Ma'd set back a little an' let\nRosasharn do the work. I knowed it wouldn't be the same as it was. Well, we'll sleep\nhere, I guess, an' come daylight we'll get on to Uncle John's. Leastwise I will. You\nthink you're comin' along, Casy?\"\nThe preacher still stood looking into the coals. He said slowly, \"Yeah, I'm goin' with\nyou. An' when your folks start out on the road I'm goin' with them. An' where folks are\non the road, I'm gonna be with them.\"\n\"You're welcome,\" said Joad. \"Ma always favored you. Said you was a preacher to\ntrust. Rosasharn wasn't growed up then.\" He turned his head. \"Muley, you gonna walk\non over with us?\" Muley was looking toward the road over which they had come.\n\"Think you'll come along, Muley?\" Joad repeated.\n\"Huh? No. I don't go no place, an' I don't leave no place. See that glow over there,\njerkin' up an' down? That's prob'ly the super'ntendent of this stretch a cotton.\nSomebody maybe seen our fire.\"\nTom looked. The glow of light was nearly over the hill. \"We ain't doin' no harm,\"\nhe said. \"We'll jus' set here. We ain't doin' nothin'.\"\nMuley cackled. \"Yeah! We're doin' somepin jus' bein' here. We're trespassin'. We\ncan't stay. They been tryin' to catch me for two months. Now you look. If that's a car\ncomin' we go out in the cotton an' lay down. Don't have to go far. Then by God let 'em\ntry to fin' us! Have to look up an' down ever' row. Just keep your head down.\"\nJoad demanded, \"What's come over you, Muley? You wasn't never no run-an'-hide\nfella. You was mean.\"\nMuley watched the approaching lights. \"Yeah!\" he said. \"I was mean like a wolf.\nNow I'm mean like a weasel. When you're huntin' somepin you're a hunter, an' you're\nstrong. Can't nobody beat a hunter. But when you get hunted\u2014that's different.\nSomepin happens to you. You ain't strong; maybe you're fierce, but you ain't strong. I\nbeen hunted now for a long time. I ain't a hunter no more. I'd maybe shoot a fella in the\ndark, but I don't maul nobody with a fence stake no more. It don't do no good to fool\nyou or me. That's how it is.\"\n\"Well, you go out an' hide,\" said Joad. \"Leave me an' Casy tell these bastards a few\nthings.\"\nThe beam of light was closer now, and it bounced into the sky and then disappeared,\nand then bounced up again. All three men watched.\nMuley said, \"There's one more thing about bein' hunted. You get to thinkin' about\nall the dangerous things. If you're huntin' you don't think about 'em, an' you ain't\nscared. Like you says to me, if you get in any trouble they'll sen' you back to\nMcAlester to finish your time.\"\n\"That's right,\" said Joad. \"That's what they tol' me, but settin' here restin' or sleepin'\non the groun'\u2014that ain't gettin' in no trouble. That ain't doin' nothin' wrong. That ain't\nlike gettin' drunk or raisin' hell.\"\nMuley laughed. \"You'll see. You jus' set here, an' the car'll come. Maybe it's Willy\nFeeley, an' Willy's a deputy sheriff now. 'What you doin' trespassin' here?' Willy says.\nWell, you always did know Willy was full a crap, so you says, 'What's it to you?' Willy\ngets mad an' says, 'You get off or I'll take you in.' An' you ain't gonna let no Feeley\npush you aroun' 'cause he's mad an' scared. He's made a bluff an' he got to go on with\nit, an' here's you gettin' tough an' you got to go through\u2014oh, hell, it's a lot easier to lay\nout in the cotton an' let 'em look. It's more fun, too, 'cause they're mad an' can't do\nnothin', an' you're out there a-laughin' at 'em. But you jus' talk to Willy or any boss, an'\nyou slug hell out of 'em an' they'll take you in an' run you back to McAlester for three\nyears.\"\n\"You're talkin' sense,\" said Joad. \"Ever' word you say is sense. But, Jesus, I hate to\nget pushed around! I lots rather take a sock at Willy.\"\n\"He got a gun,\" said Muley. \"He'll use it 'cause he's a deputy. Then he either got to\nkill you or you got to get his gun away an' kill him. Come on, Tommy. You can easy\ntell yourself you're foolin' them lyin' out like that. An' it all just amounts to what you\ntell yourself.\" The strong lights angled up into the sky now, and the even drone of a\nmotor could be heard. \"Come on, Tommy. Don't have to go far, jus' fourteen-fifteen\nrows over, an' we can watch what they do.\"\nTom got to his feet. \"By God, you're right!\" he said. \"I ain't got a thing in the worl'\nto win, no matter how it comes out.\"\n\"Come on, then, over this way,\" Muley moved around the house and out into the\ncotton field about fifty yards. \"This is good,\" he said. \"Now lay down. You on'y got to\npull your head down if they start the spotlight goin'. It's kinda fun.\" The three men\nstretched out at full length and propped themselves on their elbows. Muley sprang up\nand ran toward the house, and in a few moments he came back and threw a bundle of\ncoats and shoes down. \"They'd of taken 'em along just to get even,\" he said. The lights\ntopped the rise and bore down on the house.\nJoad asked, \"Won't they come out here with flashlights an' look aroun' for us? I\nwisht I had a stick.\"\nMuley giggled. \"No, they won't. I tol' you I'm mean like a weasel. Willy done that\none night an' I clipped 'im from behint with a fence stake. Knocked him colder'n a\nwedge. He tol' later how five guys come at him.\"\nThe car drew up to the house and a spotlight snapped on. \"Duck,\" said Muley. The\nbar of cold white light swung over their heads and crisscrossed the field. The hiding\nmen could not see any movement, but they heard a car door slam and they heard\nvoices. \"Scairt to get in the light,\" Muley whispered. \"Once\u2014twice I've took a shot at\nthe headlights. That keeps Willy careful. He got somebody with 'im tonight.\" They\nheard footsteps on wood, and, then from inside the house they saw the glow of a\nflashlight. \"Shall I shoot through the house?\" Muley whispered. \"They couldn't see\nwhere it come from. Give 'em somepin to think about.\"\n\"Sure, go ahead,\" said Joad.\n\"Don't do it,\" Casy whispered. \"It won't do no good. Jus' a waste. We got to get\nthinkin' about doin' stuff that means somepin.\"\nA scratching sound came from near the house. \"Puttin' out the fire,\" Muley\nwhispered. \"Kickin' dust over it.\" The car doors slammed, the headlights swung around\nand faced the road again. \"Now duck!\" said Muley. They dropped their heads and the\nspotlight swept over them and crossed and recrossed the cotton field, and then the car\nstarted and slipped away and topped the rise and disappeared.\nMuley sat up. \"Willy always tries that las' flash. He done it so often I can time 'im.\nAn' he still thinks it's cute.\"\nCasy said, \"Maybe they left some fellas at the house. They'd catch us when we\ncome back.\"\n\"Maybe. You fellas wait here. I know this game.\" He walked quietly away, and only\na slight crunching of clods could be heard from his passage. The two waiting men tried\nto hear him, but he had gone. In a moment he called from the house, \"They didn't leave\nnobody. Come on back.\" Casy and Joad struggled up and walked back toward the\nblack bulk of the house. Muley met them near the smoking dust pile which had been\ntheir fire. \"I didn't think they'd leave nobody,\" he said proudly. \"Me knockin' Willy\nover an' takin' a shot at the lights once-twice keeps 'em careful. They ain't sure who it\nis, an' I ain't gonna let 'em catch me. I don't sleep near no house. If you fellas wanta\ncome along, I'll show you where to sleep, where they ain't nobody gonna stumble over\nya.\"\n\"Lead off,\" said Joad. \"We'll folla you. I never thought I'd be hidin' out on my old\nman's place.\"\nMuley set off across the fields, and Joad and Casy followed him. They kicked the\ncotton plants as they went. \"You'll be hidin' from lots of stuff,\" said Muley. They\nmarched in single file across the fields. They came to a water-cut and slid easily down\nto the bottom of it.\n\"By God, I bet I know,\" cried Joad. \"Is it a cave in the bank?\"\n\"That's right. How'd you know?\"\n\"I dug her,\" said Joad. \"Me an' my brother Noah dug her. Lookin' for gold we says\nwe was, but we was jus' diggin' caves like kids always does.\" The walls of the water-\ncut were above their heads now. \"Ought to be pretty close,\" said Joad. \"Seems to me I\nremember her pretty close.\"\nMuley said, \"I've covered her with bresh. Nobody couldn't find her.\" The bottom of\nthe gulch leveled off, and the footing was sand.\nJoad settled himself on the clean sand. \"I ain't gonna sleep in no cave,\" he said. \"I'm\ngonna sleep right here.\" He rolled his coat and put it under his head.\nMuley pulled at the covering brush and crawled into his cave. \"I like it in here,\" he\ncalled. \"I feel like nobody can come at me.\"\nJim Casy sat down on the sand beside Joad.\n\"Get some sleep,\" said Joad. \"We'll start for Uncle John's at daybreak.\"\n\"I ain't sleepin,\" said Casy. \"I got too much to puzzle with.\" He drew up his feet and\nclasped his legs. He threw back his head and looked at the sharp stars. Joad yawned\nand brought one hand back under his head. They were silent, and gradually the\nskittering life of the ground, of holes and burrows, of the brush, began again; the\ngophers moved, and the rabbits crept to green things, the mice scampered over

Scene 1 LyricsBanquet halls are a very special place, where under one big roof so many different memories are made. From proms to weddings to baby showers, once that DJ starts to spin, there's something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with sing-along dance tunes. Top 40 hits come and go, and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening, but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time. Not only do they never go out of style, they are essential components of the perfect hoe-down in all banquet halls.\n\n1. The Chicken Dance\nThis song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can't help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding.\n\n2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios\nA major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat.\n\n3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA\nLight-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S.\n4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion\nThe words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, \"My heart will go on and OOOOOOON!\" with Celine.\n\n5. Don't Stop Believin, by Journey\nThe ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey's quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren't even born then know the words. It's a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song.\n\nThese time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they've got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones.\n\nriage, first gave sign\nUnto his contract; fire and air did shine,\nAs guilty of the match; and from the hill\nThe nymphs with shriekings do the region fill.\nHere first began their bane; this day was ground\nOf all their ills; for now, nor rumour's sound,\nNor nice respect of state, moves Dido ought;\nHer love no longer now by stealth is sought:\nShe calls this wedlock, and with that fair name\nCovers her fault. Forthwith the bruit and fame,\nThrough all the greatest Lybian towns is gone;\nFame, a fleet evil, than which is swifter none,\nThat moving grows, and flying gathers strength,\nLittle at first, and fearful; but at length\nShe dares attempt the skies, and stalking proud\nWith feet on ground, her head doth pierce a cloud!\nThis child, our parent earth, stirr'd up with spite\nOf all the gods, brought forth; and, as some write,\nShe was last sister of that giant race\nThat thought to scale Jove' s court; right swift of pace,\nAnd swifter far of wing; a monster vast,\nAnd dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed\nOn her huge corps, so many waking eyes\nStick underneath; and, which may stranger rise\nIn the report, as many tongues she bears,\nAs many mouths, as many listening ears.\nNightly, in midst of all the heaven, she flies,\nAnd through the earth's dark shadow shrieking cries,\nNor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep;\nBy day on tops of houses she doth keep,\nOr on high towers; and doth thence affright\nCities and towns of most conspicuous site:\nAs covetous she is of tales and lies,\nAs prodigal of truth: this monster\u2014\nLup.\n[within.] Come, follow me, assist me, second me!

Look to him, my party-coloured rascals; look to him.\n\nCaes.\nWhat is this, Asinius Lupus? I understand it not.\n\nLup.\nNot understand it! A libel, Caesar; a dangerous, seditious\nlibel; a libel in picture.\n\nCaes.\nA libel!\n\nLup.\nAy, I found it in this Horace his study, in Mecaenas his\nhouse, here; I challenge the penalty of the laws against them.\n\nTuc.\nAy, and remember to beg their land betimes; before some of\nthese hungry court-hounds scent it out.\n\nCaes.\nShew it to Horace: ask him if he know it.\n\nLup.\nKnow it! his hand is at it, Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nThen 'tis no libel.\n\nHor.\nIt is the imperfect body of an emblem, Caesar, I began for\nMecaenas.\n\nLup.\nAn emblem! right: that's Greek for a libel. Do but mark how\nconfident he is.\n\nHor.\nA just man cannot fear, thou foolish tribune;\nNot, though the malice of traducing tongues,\nThe open vastness of a tyrant's ear,\nThe senseless rigour of the wrested laws,\nOr the red eyes of strain'd authority,\nShould, in a point, meet all to take his life:\nHis innocence is armour 'gainst all these.\n\nLup.\nInnocence!

But impotent, they\nThought each man's vice belong'd to their whole tribe;\nAnd much good do't them! What they have done 'gainst me,\nI am not moved with: if it gave them meat,\nOr got them clothes, 'tis well; that was their end.\nOnly amongst them, I am sorry for\nSome better natures, by the rest so drawn,\nTo run in that vile line.\n\nPol.\nAnd is this all!\nWill you not answer then the libels?\n\nAut.\nNo.\n\nPol.\nNor the Untrussers?\n\nAut.\nNeither.\n\nPol.\nY'are undone then.\n\nAut.\nWith whom?\n\nPol.\nThe world.\n\nAut.\nThe bawd!\n\nPol.\nIt will be taken\nTo be stupidity or tameness in you.\n\nAut.\nBut they that have incensed me, can in soul\nAcquit me of that guilt.

They would think it strange, now,\nA man should take but colts-foot for one day,\nAnd, between whiles, spit out a better poem\nThan e'er the master of art, or giver of wit,\nTheir belly, made. Yet, this is possible,\nIf a free mind had but the patience,\nTo think so much together and so vile.\nBut that these base and beggarly conceits\nShould carry it, by the multitude of voices,\nAgainst the most abstracted work, opposed\nTo the stuff'd nostrils of the drunken rout!\nO, this would make a learn'd and liberal soul\nTo rive his stained quill up to the back,\nAnd damn his long-watch'd labours to the fire,\nThings that were born when none but the still night\nAnd his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes,\nWere not his own free merit a more crown\nUnto his travails than their reeling claps.\nThis 'tis that strikes me silent, seals my lips,\nAnd apts me rather to sleep out my time,\nThan I would waste it in contemned strifes\nWith these vile Ibides, these unclean birds,\nThat make their mouths their clysters, and still purge\nFrom their hot entrails. But I leave the monsters\nTo their own fate.

Ahh!\nWe come from the land of the ice and snow\nFrom the midnight sun where the hot springs flow\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow soft your fields so green\nCan whisper tales of gore\nOf how we calmed the tides of war\nWe are your overlords\n\n[Refrain]\nOn we sweep with threshing oar\nOur only goal will be the western shore\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo now you'd better stop\nAnd rebuild all your ruins\nFor peace and trust

This year, we\u2019re finally together again.\n\nTonight \u2014 tonight we meet as Democrats, Republicans, and independents, but, most importantly, as Americans with a duty to one another, to America, to the American people, and to the Constitution, and an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\n\nSix \u2014 thank you. Six days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined. He met the Ukrainian people.\n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination literally inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees, to teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nAnd in this struggle \u2014 President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament, \u201cLight will win over darkness.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight sitting with the First Lady. Let each of us, if you\u2019re able to stand, stand and send an unmistakable signal to the world and Ukraine. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\nShe\u2019s bright, she\u2019s strong, and she\u2019s resolved.\n\nYes. We, the United States of America, stand with the Ukrainian people.\n\nThroughout our history, we\u2019ve learned this lesson: When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos; they keep moving; and the costs, the threats to the America \u2014 and America, to the world keeps rising.\n\nThat\u2019s why the NATO Alliance was created: to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War Two.\n\nThe United States is a member, along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.\n\nPutin\u2019s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.\n\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn\u2019t respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber, in this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well.\n\nBut Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united. And that\u2019s what we did: We stayed united.\n\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. We spent months building coalitions of other freedom-loving nations in Europe and the Americas to \u2014 from America to the Asian and African continents to confront Putin.\n\nLike many of you, I spent countless hours unifying our European Allies.\n\nWe shared with the world, in advance, what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely and justify his aggression.\n\nWe countered Russia\u2019s lies with the truth. And now \u2014 now that he\u2019s acted, the free world is holding him accountable, along with 27 members of the European Union \u2014 including France, Germany, Italy \u2014 as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others. Even Switzerland are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine.\n\nPutin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been.\nTogether. Together. Together, along with our Allies, we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We\u2019re cutting off Russia\u2019s largest banks from the international financial system; preventing Russia\u2019s Central Bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin\u2019s $630 billion war fund worthless. We\u2019re choking Russia\u2019s access, we\u2019re choking Russia\u2019s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\n\nTonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who\u2019ve bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: No more.\n\nThe United States \u2014 I mean it. The United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs.\n\nWe\u2019re joining with European Allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We\u2019re coming for your ill-begotten gains.\n\nAnd, tonight, I\u2019m announcing that we will join our Allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy.\n\nHe has no idea what\u2019s coming.\n\nThe ruble has already lost 30 percent of its value, the Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended.\n\nThe Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is the one to blame.\n\nTogether with our Allies, we\u2019re providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom: military assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. We\u2019re giving more than a billion dollars in direct assistance to Ukraine. And we\u2019ll continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.\n\nBut let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in the conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\n\nFor that purpose, we have mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, ship deployments to protect NATO countries, including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve made crystal clear, the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power \u2014 every single inch.\n\nAnd we\u2019re clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks, and months will be hard on them.\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.\n\nAnd a pound of Ukrainian people \u2014 the proud, proud people \u2014 pound for pound, ready to fight with every inch of (inaudible) they have. They\u2019ve known 30 years of independence \u2014 have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\n\nTo all Americans, I\u2019ll be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised I would be. A Russian dictator infa- \u2014 invading a foreign country has costs around the world. And I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy and that we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.\n\nTonight, I can announce the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels of our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, united with our Allies.\n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. But I know news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming to all Americans. But I want you to know: We\u2019re going to be okay. We\u2019re going to be okay.\n\nWhen the history of this era is written, Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\n\nWhile it shouldn\u2019t and while it shouldn\u2019t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what\u2019s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly.\n\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe, a more unified West.\n\nWe see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world, even in Russia, to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.\n\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracies, democracies are rising to the moment and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.\n\nThis is the real test, and it\u2019s going to take time. So, let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forged a deep bond that connects our two nations: We stand with you. We stand with you.\n\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he\u2019ll never gain the hearts and souls of Ukrainian people. He\u2019ll never \u2014 he\u2019ll never extinguish their love of freedom. And he will never, never weaken the resolve of the free world.\n\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.\n\nI understand, like many of you did. My dad had to leave his home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to find work. So, like many of you, I grew up in a family when the price of food went up, it was felt throughout the family; it had an impact.\n\nThat\u2019s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan, because people were hurting. We needed to act and we did.\n\nFew pieces of legislation have done more at a critical moment in our history to lift us out of a crisis. It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief to tens of millions of Americans. It helped put food on the table. Remember those long lines of cars waiting for hours just to get a box of food put in their trunk? It cut the cost of healthcare insurance. And as my dad used to say, it gave the people \u201cjust a little bit of breathing room.\u201d\n\nAnd unlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1 percent of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people and left no one behind. And, folks \u2014 and it worked. It worked.\n\nIt worked and created jobs \u2014 lots of jobs. In fact, our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year, more jobs in one year than ever before in the history of the United States of America.\n\nThe economy grew at a rate of 5.7 last year \u2014 the strongest growth rate in 40 years and the first step in bringing fundamental change to our economy that hasn\u2019t worked for working people in this nation for too long.\n\nFor the past 40 years, we were told that tax breaks for those at the top and benefits would trickle down and everyone would \u2014 would benefit.\n\nBut that trickle-down theory led to a weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and a widening gap between the top and everyone else in the \u2014 in nearly a century.\n\nLook, Vice President Harris and I ran for office \u2014 and I realize we have fundamental disagreements on this \u2014 but ran for office with a new economic vision for America: invest in America; educate Americans; grow the workforce; build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because we know when the middle class grows \u2014 when the middle class grows, the poor go way up and the wealthy do very well.\n\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. And now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. We won\u2019t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st century if we don\u2019t fix it.\n\nThat\u2019s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And I thank my Republican friends who joined to invest and rebuild America \u2014 the single biggest investment in history.\n\nIt was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. We\u2019re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We\u2019re now talking about an infrastructure decade.\n\nAnd look, it\u2019s going to \u2014 it\u2019s going to transform America to put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st century that we face with the rest of the world, particularly China.\n\nI\u2019ve told Xi Jinping: It\u2019s never been a good bet to bet against the American people.\n\nWe\u2019ll create good jobs for millions of Americans \u2014 modernizing roads, airports, ports, waterways \u2014 all across America. And we\u2019ll do it to withstand the devastating effects of climate crisis and promote environmental justice.\n\nWe\u2019ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations; begin to replace the poisonous lead pipes, so every child, every American has clean water to drink at home and at school.\n\nWe\u2019re going to provide \u2014 provide affordable high-speed Internet for every American \u2014 rural, suburban, urban, and Tribal communities. Four thousand projects have already been announced. Many of you have announced them in your districts.\n\nAnd tonight, I\u2019m announcing that, this year, we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\n\nAnd, folks, when we use taxpayers\u2019 dollars to rebuild America, we\u2019re going to do it by buying American. Buy American products. Support American jobs.\n\nThe federal government spends about $600 billion a year to keep this country safe and secure. There\u2019s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers\u2019 dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every administration \u2014 Democrat and Republican \u2014 says they\u2019ll do it, but we\u2019re actually doing it.\n\nWe\u2019ll buy America to make sure every \u2014 everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails is made in America from beginning to end. All of it. All of it.\n\nBut, folks, to compete for the jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to pass the bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\n\nWe used to invest almost 2 percent of our GDP in research and development. We don\u2019t now. Can\u2019t \u2014 China is.\n\nLet me give you one example why it\u2019s so important to pass.\n\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you\u2019ll find a thousand empty acres of land. It won\u2019t look like much. But if you stop and look closely, you\u2019ll see a \u201cfield of dreams\u201d \u2014 the ground on which America\u2019s future will be built.\n\nThat\u2019s where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor \u201cmega site.\u201d Up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. Ten thousand new jobs. And in those factories, the average job \u2014 about $135 \u2014 $135,000 a year.\n\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and everyday lives, from smartphones, technology that \u2014 the Internet \u2014 technology that\u2019s yet to be invented.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning.\n\nIntel\u2019s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight \u2014 and I don\u2019t know where Pat is. Pat? There you go, Pat. Stand up. Pat came to see me, and he told me they\u2019re ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion.\n\nThat would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history. And all they\u2019re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.\n\nSo, let\u2019s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk, I\u2019ll sign it, and we will really take off in a big way.\n\nAnd, folks, Intel is not alone. There\u2019s something happening in America. Just look around, and you\u2019ll see an amazing story \u2014 the rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products \u201cMade in America,\u201d the revitalization of American manufacturing.\n\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here when just a few years ago, they would have gone overseas. That\u2019s what is happening.\n\nFord is investing $11 billion in electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country.\n\nGM is making the largest investment in its history \u2014 $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nAll told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were created in America last year alone.\n\nFolks, powered by people I\u2019ve met \u2014 like JoJo Burgess from generations of union steelworkers in Pittsburgh, who\u2019s here with us tonight. Where are you, JoJo? There you go. Thanks, buddy.\n\nAs Ohio \u2014 as Ohio Sherrod Brown says, \u201cIt\u2019s time to bury the label \u2018Rust Belt.'\u201d It\u2019s time to see the \u2014 the \u2014 what used to be called the Rust Belt become the \u2014 the home of a significant resurgence of manufacturing.\n\nAnd with all the bright spots in our economy \u2014 record job growth, higher wages \u2014 too many families are struggling to keep up with their bills.\n\nInflation is robbing them of gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel.\n\nI get it. That\u2019s why my top priority is getting prices under control.\n\nI get it. That\u2019s why my top priority is getting prices under control.\n\nLook, our economy roared back faster than almost anyone predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough people because of the pandemic to keep up production in their factories. So, you didn\u2019t have people making those beams that went into buildings because they were out \u2014 the factory was closed.\n\nThe pandemic also disrupted the global supply chain. Factories close. When that happens, it takes longer to make goods and get them to the warehouses, to the stores, and go \u2014 prices go up.\n\nLook at cars last year. One third of all the inflation was because of automobile sales. There weren\u2019t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy.\n\nAnd guess what? Prices of automobiles went way up, especially used vehicles as well.\n\nAnd so, we have a choice.\n\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\n\nI think I have a better idea to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages.\n\nAnd, folks, that means make more cars and semiconductors in America, more infrastructure and innovation in America, more goods moving faster and cheaper in America, more jobs where you can earn a good living in America.\n\nInstead of relying on foreign supply chains, let\u2019s make it in America.\n\nLook, economists call this increasing the productive capacity of our economy.\n\nI call it building a better America.\n\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. Seventeen Nobel laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and, I believe, most Americans support the plan.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the plan.\n\nFirst, cut the cost of prescription drugs. We pay more for the same drug produced by the same company in America than any other country in the world.\n\nJust look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy \u2014 the handsome young man standing up there, Joshua Davis. He and his dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every single day.\n\nInsulin costs about $10 a vial to make. That\u2019s what it costs the \u2014 the pharmaceutical company. But drug companies charge families like Joshua and his dad up to 30 times that amount.\n\nI spoke with Joshua\u2019s mom. Imagine what it\u2019s like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God\u2019s name you\u2019re going to be able to pay for it \u2014 what it does to your family, but what it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect yourself to be. I really mean it. Think about that. That\u2019s what I think about.\n\nYou know, yesterday \u2014 Joshua is here tonight, but yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy, by the way.\n\nFor Joshua and 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let\u2019s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it. And drug companies will do very, very well \u2014 their profit margin.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it \u2014 I know we have great disagreements on this floor with this \u2014 let\u2019s let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. They already set the price for VA drugs.\n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans to save them $2,400 a year on their health premiums. Let\u2019s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.\n\nAnd second, let\u2019s cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\n\nLet\u2019s provide an investment and tax credit to weatherize your home and your business to be energy efficient and get a tax credit for it; double America\u2019s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving another $80 a month that you\u2019ve not going to have to pay at the pump.\n\nFolks \u2014 third \u2014 the third thing we can do to change the standard of living for hardworking folks is cut the cost of childcare. Cut the cost of childcare.\n\nFolks, if you live in a major city in America, you can pay up to $14,000 a year for childcare per child.\n\nI was a single dad for five years, raising two kids. I had a lot of help, though. I had a mom, a dad, a brother, and sister that really helped.\n\nBut middle-class and working folks shouldn\u2019t have to pay more than 7 percent of their income to care for their young children.\n\nMy plan would cut the cost of childcare in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn\u2019t afford childcare to be able to get back to work, generating economic growth.\n\nBut my plan doesn\u2019t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care, more affordable housing, pre-K for three- and four-year-olds. All of these will lower costs to families.\n\nAnd under my plan, nobody \u2014 let me say this again \u2014 nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Not a single penny.\n\nI may be wrong, but my guess is, if we took a secret ballot in this floor, that we\u2019d all agree that the present tax system ain\u2019t fair. We have to fix it.\n\nI\u2019m not looking to punish anybody, but let\u2019s make corporations and wealthy Americans start paying their fair share.\n\nLook, last year \u2014 like Chris Coons and Tom Carper and my distinguished congresswoman \u2014 we come from the land of corporate America. There are more corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other state in America combined. And I still won 36 years in a row. The point is: Even they understand they should pay just a fair share.\n\nLast year, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies earned $40 billion in profit and paid zero in federal taxes.\n\nNo, look, it\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s why I proposed a 15 percent minimum tax rate for corporations.\n\nWe\u2019ve got \u2014 and that\u2019s why in the G7 and other meetings overseas we were able to put together \u2014 I was able to be somewhat helpful \u2014 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate \u2014 so companies can\u2019t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. It\u2019ll raise billions of dollars.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed closing loopholes for the very wealthy who don\u2019t pay \u2014 who pay a lower tax rate than a teacher and a firefighter.\n\nSo that\u2019s my plan. But we have \u2014 we\u2019ll go into more detail later.\n\nI\u2019m going to grow \u2014 we will grow the economy, lower the costs to families.\n\nSo, what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s get this done. We all know we\u2019ve got to make changes.\n\nFolks, and while you\u2019re at it, confirm my nominees for the Federal Reserve which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\n\nMy plan will not only lower costs and give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\n\nThe previous administration not only ballooned the deficit with those tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs \u2014 the job of those to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. Remember we had those debates about whether or not those watchdogs should be able to see, every day, how much money was being spent, where it \u2014 was it going to the right place?\n\nIn my administration, the watchdogs are back. And we\u2019re going after the criminals who stole billions of relief money meant for small business and millions of Americans.\n\nAnd tonight, I\u2019m announcing that the Justice Department will soon name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\n\nAnd, look I think we all agree \u2014 thank you \u2014 by the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office \u2014 the only President ever to cut the deficit by more than $1 trillion in a single year.\n\nLowering your costs also meant demanding more competition. I\u2019m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation. It drives up prices.\n\nWhen corporations have to compete, their profits go up and your prices go up \u2014 when they don\u2019t have to compete.\n\nSmall businesses and family farmers and ranchers \u2014 I need not tell some of my Republican friends from those states \u2014 guess what? You got four basic meatpacking facilities. That\u2019s it. You play with them or you don\u2019t get to play at all. And you pay a hell of a lot more \u2014 a hell of a lot more because there\u2019s only four.\n\nSee what\u2019s happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, about half a dozen or less foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000 percent and made record profits.\n\nTonight, I\u2019m announcing a crackdown on those companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.\n\nFolks and as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch.\n\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect, and they will look at that closely.\n\nWe\u2019re also going to cut costs to keep the economy going strong and giving workers a fair shot; provide more training and apprenticeships; hire them based on skills, not just their degrees.\n\nLet\u2019s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; and extend the Child Tax Credit so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\n\nLet\u2019s increase Pell Grants; increase our historic support for HBCUs; and invest in what Jill, our First Lady, who teaches full-time, calls America\u2019s best-kept secret: community colleges.\n\nLook, let\u2019s pass the PRO Act. When a majority of workers want to form a union, they shouldn\u2019t be able to be stopped.\n\nWhen we invest in our workers and we build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, together we can do something we haven\u2019t done in a long time: build a better America.\n\nFor more than two years, COVID has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of this nation. And I know you\u2019re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. That doesn\u2019t even count the close to a million people who sit at a dining room table or a kitchen table and look at an empty chair because they lost somebody.\n\nBut I also know this: Because of the progress we\u2019ve made, because of your resilience and the tools that we have been provided by this Congress, tonight I can say we\u2019re moving forward safely, back to a norm- \u2014 more normal routines.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19 where severe cases are down to a level not seen since July of last year.\n\nJust a few days ago, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new mask guidelines. Under the new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now go mask free.\n\nAnd based on projections \u2014 and based on projections, more of the country will reach a point across \u2014 that point across the next couple of weeks.\n\nAnd thanks to the progress we\u2019ve made in the past year, COVID-19 no longer need control our lives. I know some are talking about \u201cliving with COVID-19.\u201d But tonight, I say that we never will just accept living with COVID-19; we\u2019ll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases.\n\nAnd because this virus mutates and spreads, we have to stay on guard. And here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely, in my view:\n\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you\u2019re vaccinated and boosted, you have the highest degree of protection, and we\u2019ll never give up on vaccinating more Americans.\n\nNow, I know parents with kids under five are eager to see their vaccines authorized for their children. Scientists are working hard to get that done, and we\u2019ll be ready with plenty of vaccines if and when they do.\n\nWe\u2019re already \u2014 we are also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90 percent.\n\nI\u2019ve ordered more pills than anyone in the world has. Pfizer is working overtime to get us a million pills this month and more than double that next month.\n\nAnd now we\u2019re launching the \u201cTest to Treat\u201d initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy and, if they prove positive, receive the antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\n\nAnd folks if you\u2019re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\n\nWe\u2019re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone\u2019s needs as we move forward.\n\nOn testing, we\u2019ve made hundreds of millions of tests available, and you can order them for free to your doorstep.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve already ordered free tests. If you already ordered free tests, tonight I\u2019m announcing you can order another group of tests. COVID \u2014 go to COVIDTests.gov, starting next week, and you can get more tests\n\nSecond, we must prepare for new variants.\n\nOver the past \u2014 we\u2019ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. If necessary, we\u2019ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of maybe months or years. And if Congress provides the funds we need, we\u2019ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, pills ready if needed.\n\nI can\u2019t promise a new variant won\u2019t come, but I ca- \u2014 I can promise you we\u2019ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\n\nThird, we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.\n\nIt\u2019s time for America to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again with people. People working from home can feel safe and begin to return to their offices.\n\nWe\u2019re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\n\nOur schools are open. Let\u2019s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.\n\nWith 75 percent of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77 percent, most Americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and move forward safely.\n\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. Of course, continuing this costs money, so it will not surprise you I\u2019ll be back to see you all. And re- \u2014 I\u2019m going to soon send a request to Congress.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again \u2014 we may need them again. So I expect Congress \u2014 and I hope you\u2019ll pass that quickly.\n\nFourth, we\u2019ll continue vaccinating the world. We\u2019ve sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries \u2014 more than any nation on Earth. We won\u2019t stop, because you can\u2019t build a wall high enough to keep out a \u2014\n\nA vaccine \u2014 the vaccine can stop the spread of these diseases.\n\nYou know, we\u2019ve lost so much in COVID-19. Time with one another. The worst of all, the much loss of life.\n\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. So, stop looking at COVID as a partisan dividing line. See it for what it is: a God-awful disease.\n\nLet\u2019s stop sending \u2014 seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who we are: fellow Americans.\n\nLook we can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. That was a long time in coming. But we can change how to move forward on COVID-19 and other issues that we must face together.\n\nI recently visited New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\n\nThey were responding to a 911 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.\n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22 years old. Both Dominican Americans who grew up in the same streets that they later chose to patrol as police officers.\n\nI spoke with their families, and I told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifices and we\u2019ll carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety in every community it deserves.\n\nLike some of you that have been around for a while \u2014 I\u2019ve worked with you on these issues for a long time. I know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community policing \u2014 cops who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\n\nLet\u2019s not abandon our streets or choose between safety and equal justice. Let\u2019s come together and protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Justice Department has required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\n\nThat\u2019s why the American Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police, invest in more proven strategies like community violence interruption, trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people some hope.\n\nWe should all agree the answer is not to defund the police.\n\nIt\u2019s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with the resources and training \u2014 resources and training they need to protect our communities.\n\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home \u2014 no serial numbers, can\u2019t be traced.\n\nI ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon. Why? Why?\n\nAnd, folks, ban assault weapons with high-capacity magazines that hold up to 100 rounds. You think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests?\n\nLook, repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can\u2019t be sued \u2014 the only one. Imagine had we done that with the tobacco manufactures.\n\nThese laws don\u2019t infringe on the Second Amendment; they save lives.\n\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote and have it counted. And look, it\u2019s under assault.\n\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed not only to suppress the vote \u2014 we\u2019ve been there before \u2014 but to subvert the entire election. We can\u2019t let this happen.\n\nTonight, I call on the Senate to pass \u2014 pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Act \u2014 Voting Rights Act. And while you\u2019re at it, pass the DISCLOSE Act so Americans know who is funding our elections.\n\nLook, tonight, I\u2019d \u2014 I\u2019d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Breyer \u2014 an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Breyer, thank you for your service. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I mean it. Get up. Stand \u2014 let me see you. Thank you.\n\nAnd we all know \u2014 no matter what your ideology, we all know one of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAs I did four days ago, I\u2019ve nominated a Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\u2019s top legal minds who will continue in just Brey- \u2014 Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender from a family of public-school educators and police officers \u2014 she\u2019s a consensus builder.\n\nSince she\u2019s been nominated, she\u2019s received a broad range of support, including the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nSince she\u2019s been nominated, she\u2019s received a broad range of support, including the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nFolks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure our border and fix the immigration system.\n\nAnd as you might guess, I think we can do both. At our border, we\u2019ve installed new technology, like cutting-edge scanners, to better detect drug smuggling.\n\nWe\u2019ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\n\nWe\u2019re putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases \u2014 cases heard faster \u2014 and those who aren\u2019t legitimately here can be sent back.\n\nWe\u2019re screening \u2014 we\u2019re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\n\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led the generation of immigrants to this land \u2014 my forebearers and many of yours.\n\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers \u2014 those with temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers. To revise our laws so businesses have workers they need and families don\u2019t wait decades to reunite.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the right thing to do, it\u2019s economically smart thing to do. That\u2019s why the immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Let\u2019s get it done once and for all.\n\nFolks, advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. The constitutional right affirmed by Roe v. Wade, standing precedent for half a century, is under attack as never before.\n\nIf you want to go forward not backwards, we must protect access to healthcare; preserve a woman\u2019s right to choose \u2014 and continue to advance maternal healthcare for all Americans.\n\nAnd folks, for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let\u2019s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families \u2014 it\u2019s simply wrong.\n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I\u2019ll always have your back as your President so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\n\nFolks as I\u2019ve just demonstrated, while it often appears we do not agree and that \u2014 we \u2014 we do agree on a lot more things than we acknowledge.\n\nI signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year, from preventing government shutdowns, to protecting Asian Americans from still-too-common hate crimes, to reforming military justice. And we\u2019ll soon be strengthening the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago.\n\nAnd it\u2019s important \u2014 it\u2019s important for us to show \u2014 to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\n\nSo tonight, I\u2019m offering a \u201cUnity Agenda for the Nation\u201d: four big things we can do together, in my view.\n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. There\u2019s so much we can do: increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery; get rid of outdated rules and stop doctors and \u2014 that stop doctors from prescribing treatments; stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after the traffickers.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re suffering from addiction, you know \u2014 you should know you\u2019re not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million \u2014 23 million Americans in recovery.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s take on mental health \u2014 especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning. I urge every parent to make sure your school \u2014 your school does just that. They have the money.\n\nWe can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\n\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic: bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\n\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here tonight with us, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they\u2019re conducting on our children for profit. Folks \u2014 thank you. Thank you for the courage you showed.\n\nIt\u2019s time to strengthen privacy protections; ban targeted advertising to children; demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\n\nAnd let\u2019s get all Americans the mental health services they need \u2014 more people can turn for help and full parity between physical and mental healthcare if we treat it that way in our insurance.\n\nLook, the third piece of that agenda is support our veterans. Veterans are the backbone and the spine of this country. They\u2019re the best of us.\n\nI\u2019ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip those we send to war and care for those and their family when they come home.\n\nMy administration is providing assistance and job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt free.\n\nAnd our troops in Iraq have faced \u2014 and Afghanistan \u2014 have faced many dangers. One being stationed at bases, breathing in toxic smoke from burn pits. Many of you have been there. I\u2019ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 times. These burn pits that incinerate waste \u2014 the wastes of war, medical and hazardous material, jet fuel, and so much more.\n\nAnd they come home \u2014 many of the world\u2019s fittest and best trained warriors in the world \u2014 never the same: headaches, numbness, dizziness, a cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. I know.\n\nOne of those \u2014 one of those soldiers was my son, Major Beau Biden. I don\u2019t know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near \u2014 that his hooch was near in Iraq and, earlier than that, in Kosovo is the cause of his brain cancer and the disease of so many other troops. But I\u2019m committed to find out everything we can.\n\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio, the widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson. He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\n\nDanielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. And he loved building Legos with their daughter. But cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath\u2019s lungs and body.\n\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. He didn\u2019t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she.\n\nThrough her pain, she found purpose to demand that we do better. Tonight, Danielle, we are going to do better.\n\nThe VA \u2014 the VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to disease, already helping more veterans get benefits. And tonight, I\u2019m announcing we\u2019re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\n\nI\u2019m also calling on Congress to pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and the comprehensive healthcare they deserve.\n\nAnd fourth and last, let\u2019s end cancer as we know it. This is personal. This is personal to me and to Jill and to Kamala and so many of you. So many of you have lost someone you love \u2014 husband, wife, son, daughter, mom, dad.\n\nCancer is the number-two cause of death in America, second only to heart disease.\n\nLast month, I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.\n\nOur goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years. And I think we can do better than that: turn cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases, more support for patients and families.\n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund what I called ARPA-H: Advanced \u2014 Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. Patterned after DARPA in the Defense Department, projects that led \u2014 in DARPA \u2014 to the Internet, GPS, and so much more that make our forces more safer and be able to wage war more \u2014 with more clarity.\n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, and diabetes, and more.\n\nA Unity Agenda for the nation. We can do these things. It\u2019s within our power. And I don\u2019t see a partisan edge to any one of those four things.\n\nMy fellow Americans \u2014 tonight we\u2019ve gathered in a sacred space: the citadel of democracy. In this Capitol, generation after generation of Americans have debated great questions amid great strife and have done great things.\n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. We built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.\n\nNow is the hour: our moment of responsibility, our test of resolve and conscience of history itself. It is in this moment that our character of this generation is formed, our purpose is found, our future is forged.\n\nWell, I know this nation. We\u2019ll meet the test, protect freedom and liberty, expand fairness and opportunity. And we will save democracy.\n\nAs hard as those times have been, I\u2019m more optimistic about America today than I\u2019ve been my whole life because I see the future that\u2019s within our grasp, because I know there is simply nothing beyond our camas- \u2014 our capacity.\n\nWe\u2019re the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we\u2019ve faced into an opportunity, the only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.\n\nSo, on this night, on our 245th year as a nation, I\u2019ve come to report on the state of the nation \u2014 the state of the union. And my report is this: The State of the Union is strong because you, the American people, are strong.\n\nWe are stronger today \u2014 we are stronger today than we were a year ago. And we\u2019ll be stronger a year from now than we are today.\n\nThis is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. And we will, as one people, one America \u2014 the United States of America.\n\nGod bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.

AUGH!!\"\n\nI caught his nose.. then I caught his eyes.. and he caught mine...\nI looked at my crew, all frozen white in terror, and then myself, suddenly frozen too.\nLike them, I was, suddenly white\nLike them, I was, suddenly small\nOf the same stuff, were we, my crew and I\nEach of us human,\nEach of us helpless\nIn an instant we were made equal, together we had become in that moment, a speck of white dust, disappearing into the black mouth of eternal night.\nStripped of illusion, we were now transparent, like the great beast itself, in who's acid breathing belly we were to lay for a snug eternity or two!\n\nNow, I am here. In the belly of the monster's belly, with my idiot son.\nWho must be fed raw fish parts, or else he cries in his sleep,\nand keeps both heaven and hell, awake with his dreams.\nI don't have time now, to remember, or to care, or to think about tomorrow.\nI am behind in my chores, and will never catch up.\nWe sail on in this foul stink, in search of wayward sons,\nOther offspring of unruly angels, who dare to challenge the great ship giver\nTransparent leader of illusion, mother of great and deadly dreams.\n\nThey will find peace in their madness, just as I have in mine.Embed"}, {"_type":

man I used to be\nOh Ruby, I still need some company\nIt's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed\nAnd the wants and needs of a woman your age Ruby, I realize\nBut it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around\nOh Ruby, don't take your love to town\n\nShe's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door\nThe way I know I heard its slams one hundred times before\nAnd if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground\nOh Ruby, don't take your love to town\n\nOh Ruby, for God's sake, turn around\n\n{Outro}You might also like1Embed"}, {"_type":

Father Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThere's a man at my house, he's so big and strong\nHe goes to work each day, and he stays all day long\nHe comes home each night looking tired and beat\nHe sits down at the dinner table and has a bite to eat\n\nNever a frown, always a smile\nWhen he says to me: \"How's my child?\"\nI said that I've been studying hard all day in school\nTryin' very hard to understand the golden rule\n[Chorus]\nI think I'll color this man father (Color him father)\nI think I'll color him love (Color him love)\nSaid I'm gonna color him father (Color him father)\nI think I'll color the man love, yes I will (Color him faaa~)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe says education is the thing if you want to compete\nBecause without it son, life ain't very sweet\nI love this man and I don't know why\nExcept I'll need his strength until the day that I die\n\nMy mother loves him and I can tell\nBy the way she looks at him when he holds my little sister Nell\nI heard her say just the other day\nThat if it hadn't of been for him she couldn't have found her way\n\n[Chorus]\nI think I'll color him father (Color him father)\nI'm gonna color him love (Color him love)\nI've got to color him father (Color him father)\nI think I'll color this man love (Color him faaa~)\n\n[Verse 3]\nOur real old man, he got killed in the war\nAnd she knows she and seven kids couldn't of gotten very far\nShe said she thought that she could never love again\nAnd then there he stood with that big wide grin\nHe married my mother and he took us in\nAnd now we belong to the man with that big wide grin\nYou might also

own\nYou'll be on your own\nCan you take good care of Jenny\nCan you take her to school everyday\nCan you teach her how to play\nAll the games that little girls play\nHear what I say\nCan you teach her how to roll up her hair\nCan you make sure each night that she says her prayers\nWell if you can do all these things\nThen maybe she won't miss me\nMaybe she won't miss me\nAnd tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed\nAnd you look at that pillow\nWhere I laid my head\nWith your heart on fire\nWill you have no desire\nTo kiss me\nOr to hold me\nAnd if you can forget\nThe good times we had\nIf you don't think\nThey out weigh the bad\nWell then go ahead\nSign your name\nAnd I'll be\nOn my way\nI'll be on my wayYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

(Spoken)]\nThe continent of Atlantis was an island\nWhich lay before the great flood\nIn the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean\nSo great an area of land\nThat from her western shores\nThose beautiful sailors journeyed\nTo the South and the North Americas with ease\nIn their ships with painted sails\n\nTo the east, Africa was her neighbor\nAcross a short strait of sea miles\nThe great Egyptian age is but a remnant\nOf the Atlantean culture\nThe antediluvian kings colonized the world\nAll the Gods who play in the mythological dramas\nIn all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis\nKnowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships\nTo all corners of the Earth\nOn board were the twelve\nThe Poet, the Physician, the Farmer\nThe Scientist, the Magician\nAnd the other so-called Gods of our legends\nThough Gods they were\n\nAnd as the elders of our time choose to remain blind\nLet us rejoice and let us sing\nAnd dance and ring in the new\nHail, Atlantis!\n[Chorus 1]\nWay down below the ocean\nWhere I wanna be, she may be\nWay down below the ocean\nWhere I wanna be, she may be\nWay down below the ocean\nWhere I wanna be, she may be\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\nYou might also

eyes out 'cause the woman that you love is gone\nOh, there's gonna be, there's gonna be a whole lot of trouble in your life\nOh, so listen to me get up off your knees\n'Cause only the strong survive\nThat's what she said\n[Chorus]\n\"Only the strong survive\nOnly the strong survive\"\nHey, you've got to be strong, you'd better hold on\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't go all around with your head hung down\nWell I wouldn't let that little girl\nNo, I wouldn't let her know that she made me feel like a clown\nThere's a whole lot a girls lookin' for a good man like you\nOh but you'll never meet 'em if

Oh why\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere must be peace and understanding sometime\nStrong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear\nIf I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on

strength to dream\nHe can redeem his soul and fly (He can fly)\n\n[Verse 3]\nDeep in my heart, there's a trembling question\nStill, I am sure that the answer's... answer's gonna come somehow\nOut there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah\nAnd while I can think, while I can talk, while I can stand, while I can walk\nWhile I can dream, oh, please let my dream come true, oh, right
