(Chap. 1.61) LyricsThe Commonwealth\n\n1653.\nOLIVER CROMWELL, in whose hands the dissolution of the parliament had left the whole power, civil and military, of three kingdoms, was born at Huntingdon, the last year of the former century, of a good family; though he himself, being the son of a second brother, inherited but a small estate from his father. In the course of his education, he had been sent to the university; but his genius was found little fitted for the calm and elegant occupations of learning; and he made small proficiency in his studies. He even threw himself into a dissolute and disorderly course of life; and he consumed, in gaming, drinking, debauchery, and country riots, the more early years of his youth, and dissipated part of his patrimony. All of a sudden, the spirit of reformation seized him; he married, affected a grave and composed behavior entered into all the zeal and rigor of the Puritanical party, and offered to restore to every one whatever sums he had formerly gained by gaming. The same vehemence of temper which had transported him into the extremes of pleasure, now distinguished his religious habits. His house was the resort of all the zealous clergy of the party; and his hospitality, as well as his liberalities to the silenced and deprived ministers, proved as chargeable as his former debaucheries. Though he had acquired a tolerable fortune by a maternal uncle, he found his affairs so injured by his expenses, that he was obliged to take a farm at St. Ives, and apply himself for some years to agriculture as a profession. But this expedient served rather to involve him in further debts and difficulties. The long prayers which he said to his family in the morning, and again in the afternoon, consumed his own time and that of his ploughmen; and he reserved no leisure for the care of his temporal affairs. His active mind, superior to the low occupations to which he was condemned, preyed upon itself; and he indulged his imagination in visions, illuminations, revelations; the great nourishment of that hypochondriacal temper to which he was ever subject. Urged by his wants and his piety, he had made a party with Hambden, his near kinsman, who was pressed only by the latter motive, to transport himself into New England, now become the retreat of the more zealous among the Puritanical party; and it was an order of council which obliged them to disembark and remain in England. The earl of Bedford, who possessed a large estate in the fen country near the Isle of Ely, having undertaken to drain these morasses, was obliged to apply to the king; and by the powers of the prerogative, he got commissioners appointed, who conducted that work, and divided the new-acquired land among the several proprietors. He met with opposition from many, among whom Cromwell distinguished himself; and this was the first public opportunity which he had met with, of discovering the factious zeal and obstinacy of his character.\n\nFrom accident and intrigue he was chosen by the town of Cambridge member of the long parliament. His domestic affairs were then in greater disorder; and he seemed not to possess any talents which could qualify him to rise in that public sphere into which he was now at last entered. His person was ungraceful, his dress slovenly, his voice untonable, his elocution homely, tedious, obscure, and embarrassed. The fervor of his spirit frequently prompted him to rise in the house; but he was not heard with attention: his name, for above two years, is not to be found oftener than twice in any committee; and those committees into which he was admitted, were chosen for affairs which would more interest the zealots than the men of business. In comparison of the eloquent speakers and fine gentlemen of the house, he was entirely overlooked; and his friend Hambden alone was acquainted with the depth of his genius, and foretold that, if a civil war should ensue, he would soon rise to eminence and distinction.\n\nCromwell himself seems to have been conscious where his strength lay; and partly from that motive, partly from the uncontrollable fury of his zeal, he always joined that party which pushed every thing to extremities against the king. He was active in promoting the famous remonstrance, which was the signal for all the ensuing commotions; and when, after a long debate, it was carried by a small majority, he told Lord Falkland, that if the question had been lost, he was resolved next day to have converted into ready money the remains of his fortune, and immediately to have left the kingdom. Nor was this resolution, he said, peculiar to himself: many others of his party he knew to be equally determined.\n\nHe was no less than forty-three years of age when he first embraced the military profession; and by force of genius, without any master, he soon became an excellent officer; though perhaps he never reached the fame of a consummate commander. He raised a troop of horse; fixed his quarters in Cambridge; exerted great severity towards that university which zealously adhered to the royal party; and showed himself a man who would go all lengths in favor of that cause which he had espoused. He would not allow his soldiers to perplex their heads with those subtleties of fighting by the king's authority against his person, and of obeying his majesty's commands signified by both houses of parliament: he plainly told them, that if he met the king in battle, he would fire a pistol in his face as readily as against any other man. His troop of horse he soon augmented to a regiment; and he first instituted that discipline, and inspired that spirit, which rendered the parliamentary armies in the end victorious. \"Your troops,\" said he to Hambden, according to his own account,[*] \"are most of them old, decayed serving men and tapsters, and such kind of fellows; the king's forces are composed of gentlemen's younger sons and persons of good quality. And do you think that the mean spirits of such base and low fellows as ours will ever be able to encounter gentlemen, that have honor, and courage, and resolution in them? You must get men of spirit; and take it not ill that I say, of a spirit that is likely to go as far as gentlemen will go, or else I am sure you will still be beaten, as you have hitherto been, in every encounter.\"\n* Conference held at Whitehall.\n\nHe did as he proposed. He enlisted the sons of freeholders and farmers. He carefully invited into his regiment all the zealous fanatics throughout England. When they were collected in a body, their enthusiastic spirit still rose to a higher pitch. Their colonel, from his own natural character, as well as from policy, was sufficiently inclined to increase the flame. He preached, he prayed, he fought, he punished, he rewarded. The wild enthusiasm, together with valor and discipline, still propagated itself; and all men cast their eyes on so pious and so successful a leader. From low commands, he rose with great rapidity to be really the first, though in appearance only the second, in the army. By fraud and violence, he soon rendered himself the first in the state. In proportion to the increase of his authority, his talents always seemed to expand themselves; and he displayed every day new abilities, which had lain dormant till the very emergence by which they were called forth into action. All Europe stood astonished to see a nation, so turbulent and unruly, who, for some doubtful encroachments on their privileges, had dethroned and murdered an excellent prince, descended from a long line of monarchs, now at last subdued and reduced to slavery by one who, a few years before, was no better than a private gentleman, whose name was not known in the nation, and who was little regarded even in that low sphere to which he had always been confined.\n\nThe indignation entertained by the people against an authority founded on such manifest usurpation, was not so violent as might naturally be expected. Congratulatory addresses, the first of the kind, were made to Cromwell by the fleet, by the army, even by many of the chief corporations and counties of England; but especially by the several congregations of saints dispersed throughout the kingdom.[*]\n* See Milton's State Papers.\n\nThe royalists, though they could not love the man who had imbrued his hands in the blood of their sovereign, expected more lenity from him than from the jealous and imperious republicans, who had hitherto governed. The Presbyterians were pleased to see those men by whom they had been outwitted and expelled, now in their turn expelled and outwitted by their own servant; and they applauded him for this last act of violence upon the parliament. These two parties composed the bulk of the nation, and kept the people in some tolerable temper. All men, likewise, harassed with wars and factions, were glad to see any prospect of settlement. And they deemed it less ignominious to submit to a person of such admirable talents and capacity, than to a few ignoble, enthusiastic hypocrites, who, under the name of a republic, had reduced them to a cruel subjection.\n\nThe republicans, being dethroned by Cromwell, were the party whose resentment he had the greatest reason to apprehend. That party, besides the Independents, contained two sets of men who are seemingly of the most opposite principles, but who were then united by a similitude of genius and of character. The first and most numerous were the Millenarians, or Fifth Monarchy men, who insisted that, dominion being founded in grace, all distinction in magistracy must be abolished, except what arose from piety and holiness; who expected suddenly the second coming of Christ upon earth; and who pretended, that the saints in the mean while, that is, themselves, were alone entitled to govern. The second were the Deists, who had no other object than political liberty, who denied entirely the truth of revelation, and insinuated, that all the various sects, so heated against each other, were alike founded in folly and in error. Men of such daring geniuses were not contented with the ancient and legal forms of civil government; but challenged a degree of freedom beyond what they expected ever to enjoy under any monarchy. Martin, Challoner, Harrington, Sidney, Wildman, Nevil, were esteemed the heads of this small division.\n\nThe Deists were perfectly hated by Cromwell, because he had no hold of enthusiasm by which he could govern or overreach them; he therefore treated them with great rigor and disdain, and usually denominated them the heathens. As the Millenarians had a great interest in the army, it was much more important for him to gain their confidence; and their size of understanding afforded him great facility in deceiving them. Of late years, it had been so usual a topic of conversation to discourse of parliaments, and councils, and senates, and the soldiers themselves had been so much accustomed to enter into that spirit, that Cromwell thought it requisite to establish something which might bear the face of a commonwealth. He supposed that God, in his providence, had thrown the whole right, as well as power, of government into his hands; and without any more ceremony, by the advice of his council of officers, he sent summons to a hundred and twenty-eight persons of different towns and counties of England, to five of Scotland, to six of Ireland. He pretended by his sole act and deed, to devolve upon these the whole authority of the state. This legislative power they were to exercise during fifteen months; and they were afterwards to choose the same number of persons, who might succeed them in that high and important office.\n\nThere were great numbers at that time who made it a principle always to adhere to any power which was uppermost, and to support the established government. This maxim is not peculiar to the people of that age; but what may be esteemed peculiar to them is, that there prevailed a hypocritical phrase for expressing so prudential a conduct: it was called a waiting upon providence. When providence, therefore, was so kind as to bestow on these men, now assembled together, the supreme authority, they must have been very ungrateful, if, in their turn, they had been wanting in complaisance towards it. They immediately voted themselves a parliament; and having their own consent, as well as that of Oliver Cromwell, for their legislative authority, they now proceeded very gravely to the exercise of it.\n\nIn this notable assembly were some persons of the rank of gentlemen; but the far greater part were low mechanics; Fifth Monarchy men, Anabaptists, Antinomians, Independents; the very dregs of the fanatics. They began with seeking God by prayer: this office was performed by eight or ten gifted men of the assembly; and with so much success, that, according to the confession of all, they had never before, in any of their devotional exercises, enjoyed so much of the Holy Spirit as was then communicated to them.[*] Their hearts were, no doubt, dilated when they considered the high dignity to which they supposed themselves exalted. They had been told by Cromwell, in his first discourse, that he never looked to see such a day, when Christ should be so owned.[**]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Parl.

God manifests it to be the day of the power of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Christ, having through so much blood and so much trial as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has been upon this nation, he makes this one of the greatest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mercies, next to his own Son, to have his people called to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the supreme authority. God hath owned his Son, and hath\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0owned you, and hath made you to own him. I confess I never\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0looked to have seen such a day: I did not.\" I suppose at\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0this passage he cried; for he was very much given to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0weeping, and could at any time shed abundance of tears. The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rest of the speech may be seen among Milton's State Papers,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0p. 106. It is very curious, and full of the same obscurity,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0confusion, embarrassment, and absurdity, which appear in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0almost all Oliver's productions.\nThey thought it, therefore, their duty to proceed to a thorough reformation, and to pave the way for the reign of the Redeemer, and for that great work which, it was expected, the Lord was to bring forth among them. All fanatics, being consecrated by their own fond imaginations, naturally hear an antipathy to the ecclesiastics, who claim a peculiar sanctity, derived merely from their office and priestly character. This parliament took into consideration the abolition of the clerical function, as savoring of Popery; and the taking away of tithes, which they called a relic of Judaism. Learning also and the universities were deemed heathenish and unnecessary: the common law was denominated a badge of the conquest and of Norman slavery; and they threatened the lawyers with a total abrogation of their profession. Some steps were even taken towards an abolition of the chancery,[*] the highest court of judicature in the kingdom; and the Mosaical law was intended to be established as the sole system of English jurisprudence.[**]\nOf all the extraordinary schemes adopted by these legislators, they had not leisure to finish any, except that which established the legal solemnization of marriage by the civil magistrate alone, without the interposition of the clergy. They found themselves exposed to the derision of the public. Among the fanatics of the house, there was an active member much noted for his long prayers, sermons, and harangues. He was a leather-seller in London, his name Praise-God Barebone. This ridiculous name, which seems to have been chosen by some poet or allegorist to suit so ridiculous a personage struck the fancy of the people; and they commonly affixed to this assembly the appellation of Barebone's parliament.[***]\n\n* Whitlocke, p. 543, 548.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Conference held at Whitehall.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * It was usual for the pretended saints at that time to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0change their names from Henry, Edward, Anthony, William,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0which they regarded as heathenish, into others more\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sanctified and godly: even the New Testament names, James,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Andrew, John, Peter, were not held in such regard as those\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0which were borrowed from the Old Testament, Hezekiah\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Habakkuk, Joshua, Zerobabel.

The Hollanders were regarded as worldly-minded men, intent only on commerce and industry; whom it was fitting the saints should first extirpate, ere they undertook that great work, to which they believed themselves destined by Providence, of subduing Antichrist, the man of sin, and extending to the uttermost bounds of the earth the kingdom of the Redeemer.[*] The ambassadors, finding themselves proscribed, not as enemies of England but of Christ, remained in astonishment, and knew not which was most to be admired, the implacable spirit or egregious folly of these pretended saints.\n\nCromwell began to be ashamed of his legislature. If he ever had any design in summoning so preposterous an assembly beyond amusing the populace and the army, he had intended to alarm the clergy and lawyers; and he had so far succeeded as to make them desire any other government, which might secure their professions, now brought in danger by these desperate fanatics. Cromwell himself was dissatisfied, that the parliament, though they had derived all their authority from him, began to pretend power from the Lord,[**] and to insist already on their divine commission. He had been careful to summon in his writs several persons entirely devoted to him.\n\n* Thurloe, vol. i. p. 273, 591. Also Stubbe, p. 91, 92.\n\n** Thurloe, vol. i. p 393\nBy concert, these met early; and it was mentioned by some among them, that the sitting of this parliament any longer would be of no service to the nation. They hastened, therefore, to Cromwell, along with Rouse, their speaker; and, by a formal deed or assignment, restored into his hands that supreme authority which they had so lately received from him. General Harrison and about twenty more remained in the house; and that they might prevent the reign of the saints from coming to an untimely end, they placed one Moyer in the chair, and began to draw up protests. They were soon interrupted by Colonel White, with a party of soldiers. He asked them what they did there. \"We are seeking the Lord,\" said they. \"Then you may go elsewhere,\" replied he; \"for to my certain knowledge, he has not been here these many years.\"\nThe military being now, in appearance, as well as in reality the sole power which prevailed in the nation, Cromwell though fit to indulge a new fancy; for he seems not to have had any deliberate plan in all these alterations. Lambert, his creature, who, under the appearance of obsequiousness to him, indulged in unbounded ambition, proposed, in a council of officers, to adopt another scheme of government, and to temper the liberty of a commonwealth by the authority of a single person, who should be known by the appellation of protector. Without delay, he prepared what was called \"the instrument of government,\" containing the plan of this new legislature; and as it was supposed to be agreeable to the general, it was immediately voted by the council of officers. Cromwell was declared protector; and with great solemnity installed in that high office.\n\nSo little were these men endowed with the spirit of legislation, that they confessed, or rather boasted, that they had employed only four days in drawing this instrument, by which the whole government of three kingdoms was pretended to be regulated and adjusted to all succeeding generations. There appears no difficulty in believing them, when it is considered how crude and undigested a system of civil polity they endeavored to establish. The chief articles of the instrument are these: A council was appointed, which was not to exceed twenty-one, nor be less than thirteen persons. These were to enjoy their office during life or good behavior; and in case of a vacancy, the remaining members named three, of whom the protector chose one. The protector was appointed supreme magistrate of the commonwealth: in his name was all justice to be administered; from him were all magistracy and honors derived; he had the power of pardoning all crimes, excepting murder and treason; to him the benefit of all forfeitures devolved. The right of peace, war, and alliance, rested in him but in these particulars he was to act by the advice and with the consent of his council. The power of the sword was vested in the protector jointly with the parliament, while it was sitting, or with the council of state in the intervals. He was obliged to summon a parliament every three years, and allow them to sit five months, without adjournment, prorogation, or dissolution. The bills which they passed were to be presented to the protector for his assent; but if within twenty days it were not obtained, they were to become laws by the authority alone of parliament. A standing army for Great Britain and Ireland was established, of twenty thousand foot and ten thousand horse; and funds were assigned for their support. These were not to be diminished without *consent of the protector; and in this article alone he assumed a negative, During the intervals of parliament, the protector and council had the power of enacting laws, which were to be valid till the next meeting of parliament. The chancellor, treasurer, admiral, chief governors of Ireland and Scotland, and the chief justices of both the benches, must be chosen with the approbation of parliament; and in the intervals, with the approbation of the council, to be afterwards ratified by parliament. The protector was to enjoy his office during life; and on his death, the place was immediately to be supplied by the council. This was the instrument of government enacted by the council of officers, and solemnly sworn to by Oliver Cromwell. The council of state named by the instrument, were fifteen; men entirely devoted to the protector, and by reason of the opposition among themselves in party and principles, not likely ever to combine against him.\nCromwell said, that he accepted the dignity of protector, merely that he might exert the duty of a constable, and preserve peace in the nation. Affairs indeed were brought to that pass, by the furious animosities of the several factions, that the extensive authority and even arbitrary power of some first magistrate was become a necessary evil, in order to keep the people from relapsing into blood and confusion. The Independents were too small a party ever to establish a popular government, or intrust the nation, where they had so little interest, with the free choice of its representatives. The Presbyterians had adopted the violent maxims of persecution; incompatible at all times with the peace of society, much more with the wild zeal of those numerous sects which prevailed among the people. The royalists were so much enraged by the injuries which they had suffered, that the other prevailing parties would never submit to them, who, they knew, were enabled, merely by the execution of the ancient laws, to take severe vengeance upon them. Had Cromwell been guilty of no crime but this temporary usurpation, the plea of necessity and public good, which he alleged, might be allowed, in every view, a reasonable excuse for his conduct.\n\nDuring the variety of ridiculous and distracted scenes which the civil government exhibited in England, the military force was exerted with vigor, conduct, and unanimity; and never did the kingdom appear more formidable to all foreign nations. The English fleet, consisting of a hundred sail, and commanded by Monk and Dean, and under them by Pen and Lauson, met near the coast of Flanders with the Dutch fleet equally numerous, and commanded by Tromp. The two republics were not inflamed by any national antipathy, and their interests very little interfered: yet few battles have been disputed with more fierce and obstinate courage, than were those many naval combats which were fought during this short but violent war. The desire of remaining sole lords of the ocean animated these states to an honorable emulation against each other. After a battle of two days, in the first of which Dean was killed, the Dutch, inferior in the size of their ships, were obliged, with great loss, to retire into their harbors. Blake, towards the end of the fight, joined his countrymen with eighteen sail. The English fleet lay off the coast of Holland, and totally interrupted the commerce of that republic.\n\nENLARGE\n1-734-blake.jpg Admiral Blake\n\nThe ambassadors whom the Dutch had sent over to England, gave them hopes of peace. But as they could obtain no cessation of hostilities, the states, unwilling to suffer any longer the loss and dishonor of being blockaded by the enemy, made the utmost efforts to recover their injured honor. Never, on any occasion, did the power and vigor of that republic appear in a more conspicuous light. In a few weeks, they had repaired and manned their fleet; and they equipped some Ships of a larger size than any which they had hitherto sent to sea. Tromp issued out, determined again to fight the victors, and to die rather than to yield the contest. He met with the enemy, commanded by Monk; and both sides immediately rushed into the combat. Tromp, gallantly animating his men, with his sword drawn, was shot through the heart with a musket ball. This event alone decided the battle in favor of the English. Though near thirty ships of the Dutch were sunk and taken, they little regarded this loss compared with that of their brave admiral.\n\nMeanwhile the negotiations of peace were continually advancing. The states, overwhelmed with the expense of the war, terrified by their losses, and mortified by their defeats, were extremely desirous of an accommodation with an enemy whom they found by experience too powerful for them. The king having shown an inclination to serve on board their fleet, though they expressed their sense of the honor intended them, they declined an offer which might inflame the quarrel with the English commonwealth. The great obstacle to the peace was found, not to be any animosity on the part of the English, but, on the contrary, a desire too earnest of union and confederacy. Cromwell had revived the chimerical scheme of a coalition with the United Provinces; a total conjunction of government, privileges, interests, and councils.\n1654.\n\nThis project appeared so wild to the states, that they wondered any man of sense could ever entertain it; and they refused to enter into conferences with regard to a proposal which could serve only to delay any practicable scheme of accommodation. The peace was at last signed by Cromwell now invested with the dignity of protector, and it proves sufficiently, that the war had been impolitic, since, after the most signal victories, no terms more advantageous could be obtained. A defensive league was made between the two republics. They agreed, each of them, to banish the enemies of the other: those who had been concerned in the massacre of Amboyna were to be punished, if any remained alive; the honor of the flag was yielded to the English: eighty-five thousand pounds were stipulated to be paid by the Dutch East India Company for losses which the English Company had sustained; and the Island of Polerone, in the East Indies was promised to be ceded to the latter.\nCromwell, jealous of the connections between the royal family and that of Orange, insisted on a separate article; that neither the young prince nor any of his family should ever be invested with the dignity of stadtholder. The province of Holland, strongly prejudiced against that office, which they esteemed dangerous to liberty, secretly ratified this article. The protector, knowing that the other provinces would not be induced to make such a concession, was satisfied with this security.\n\nThe Dutch war, being successful, and the peace reasonable brought credit to Cromwell's administration. An act of justice, which he exercised at home, gave likewise satisfaction to the people: though the regularity of it may perhaps appear somewhat doubtful. Don Pantaleon, brother to the Portuguese ambassador, and joined with him in the same commission,[*] fancying himself to be insulted, came upon the exchange, armed and attended by several servants. By mistake, he fell on a gentleman whom he took for the person that had given him the offence; and having butchered him with many wounds, he and all his attendants took shelter in the house of the Portuguese ambassador, who had connived at this base enterprise.[**] The populace surrounded the house, and threatened to set fire to it. Cromwell sent a guard, who seized all the criminals. They were brought to trial; and notwithstanding the opposition of the ambassador, who pleaded the privileges of his office, Don Pantaleon was executed on Tower Hill. The laws of nations were here plainly violated; but the crime committed by the Portuguese gentleman was to the last degree atrocious; and the vigorous chastisement of it, suiting so well the undaunted character of Cromwell, was universally approved of at home, and admired among foreign nations. The situation of Portugal obliged that court to acquiesce; and the ambassador soon after signed, with the protector, a treaty of peace and alliance, which was very advantageous to the English commerce.\n\n* Thurloe, vol. ii. p. 429.\n\n** Thurloe, vol. i. p. 616.\n\nAnother act of severity, but necessary in his situation, was, at the very same time, exercised by the protector, in the capital punishment of Gerard and Vowel, two royalists, who were accused of conspiring against his life. He had erected a high court of justice for their trial; an infringement of the ancient laws which at this time was become familiar, but one to which no custom or precedent could reconcile the nation. Juries were found altogether unmanageable. The restless Lilburn, for new offences, had been brought to a new trial; and had been acquitted with new triumph and exultation. If no other method of conviction had been devised during this illegal and unpopular government, all its enemies were assured of entire impunity.\n\nThe protector had occasion to observe the prejudices entertained against his government, by the disposition of the parliament, which he summoned on the third of September, that day of the year on which he gained his two great victories of Dunbar and Worcester, and which he always regarded as fortunate for him. It must be confessed that, if we are left to gather Cromwell's intentions from his instrument of government, it is such a motley piece, that we cannot easily conjecture whether he seriously meant to establish a tyranny or a republic. On one hand, a first magistrate in so extensive a government seemed necessary both for the dignity and tranquillity of the state; and the authority which he assumed as protector was, in some respects, inferior to the prerogatives which the laws intrusted and still intrust to the king. On the other hand, the legislative power which he reserved to himself and council, together with so great an army, independent of the parliament, were bad prognostics of his intention to submit to a civil and legal constitution. But if this were not his intention, the method in which he distributed and conducted the elections, being so favorable to liberty, form an inconsistency which is not easily accounted for. He deprived of their right of election all the small boroughs, places the most exposed to influence and corruption. Of four hundred members which represented England, two hundred and seventy were chosen by the counties. The rest were elected by London, and the more considerable corporations. The lower populace too, so easily guided or deceived, were excluded from the elections: an estate of two hundred pounds' value was necessary to entitle any one to a vote. The elections of this parliament were conducted with perfect freedom; and, excepting that such of the royalists as had borne arms against the parliament and all their sons were excluded, a more fair representation of the people could not be desired or expected. Thirty members were returned from Scotland; as many from Ireland.\n\nThe protector seems to have been disappointed, when he found that all these precautions, which were probably nothing but covers to his ambition, had not procured him the confidence of the public. Though Cromwell's administration was less odious to every party than that of any other party, yet was it entirely acceptable to none. The royalists had been instructed by the king to remain quiet, and to cover themselves under the appearance of republicans; and they found in this latter faction such inveterate hatred against the protector, that they could not wish for more zealous adversaries to his authority. It was maintained by them, that the pretence of liberty and a popular election was but a new artifice of this great deceiver, in order to lay asleep the deluded nation, and give himself leisure * rivet their chains more securely upon them: that in the instrument of government he openly declared his intention of still retaining the same mercenary army, by whose assistance he had subdued the ancient established government, and who would with less scruple obey him in overturning, whenever he should please to order them, that new system which he himself had been pleased to model: that being sensible of the danger and uncertainty of all military government, he endeavored to intermix some appearance, and but an appearance, of civil administration, and to balance the army by a seeming consent of the people: that the absurd trial which he had made of a parliament, elected by himself, appointed perpetually to elect their successors, plainly proved, that he aimed at nothing but temporary expedients, was totally averse to a free republican government, and possessed not that mature and deliberate reflection which could qualify him to act the part of a legislator: that his imperious character, which had betrayed itself in so many incidents, could never seriously submit to legal limitations; nor would the very image of popular government be longer upheld than while conformable to his arbitrary will and pleasure: and that the best policy was to oblige him to take off the mask at once; and either submit entirely to that parliament which he had summoned, or, by totally rejecting its authority, leave himself no resource but in his seditious and enthusiastic army.\n\nIn prosecution of these views, the parliament, having heard the protector's speech, three hours long,[*] and having chosen Lenthal for their speaker, immediately entered into a discussion of the pretended instrument of government, and of that authority which Cromwell, by the title of protector, had assumed over the nation.\n\n* Thurloe, vol. ii. p. 588.\n\nThe greatest liberty was used in arraigning this new dignity; and even the personal character and conduct of Cromwell escaped not without censure. The utmost that could be obtained by the officers and by the court party,\u2014-for so they were called,\u2014was to protract the debate by arguments and long speeches, and prevent the decision of a question which, they were sensible, would be carried against them by a great majority. The protector, surprised and enraged at this refractory spirit in the parliament, which, however, he had so much reason to expect, sent for them to the painted chamber, and with an air of great authority inveighed against their conduct. He told them, that nothing could be more absurd than for them to dispute his title; since the same instrument of government which made them a parliament, had invested him with the protectorship: that some points in the new constitution were supposed to be fundamentals, and were not, on any pretence, to be altered or disputed: that among these were the government of the nation by a single person and a parliament, their joint authority over the army and militia, the succession of new parliaments, and liberty of conscience: and that, with regard to these particulars, there was reserved to him a negative voice; to which, in the other circumstances of government, he confessed himself nowise entitled.\n\nThe protector now found the necessity of exacting a security, which, had he foreseen the spirit of the house, he would with better grace have required at their first meeting.[*]\n\n* Thurloe, vol ii. p. 620.\n\nHe obliged the members to sign a recognition of his authority, and an engagement not to propose or consent to any alteration in the government, as it was settled in a single person and a parliament; and he placed guards at the door of the house, who allowed none but subscribers to enter. Most of the members, after some hesitation, submitted to this condition; but retained the same refractory spirit which they had discovered in their first debates. The instrument of government was taken in pieces, and examined, article by article, with the most scrupulous accuracy: very free topics were advanced with the general approbation of the house: and during the whole course of their proceedings, they neither sent up one bill to the protector, nor took any notice of him. Being informed that conspiracies were entered into between the members and some malecontent officers, he hastened to the dissolution of so dangerous an assembly. By the instrument of government, to which he had sworn, no parliament could be dissolved till it had sitten five months; but Cromwell pretended, that a month contained only twenty-eight days, according to the method of computation practised in paying the fleet and army. The full time, therefore, according to this reckoning, being elapsed, the parliament was ordered to attend the protector, who made them a tedious, confused, angry harangue, and dismissed them.\n\n1655.\nWere we to judge of Cromwell's capacity by this, and indeed by all his other compositions, we should be apt to entertain no very favorable idea of it. But in the great variety of human geniuses, there are some which, though they see their object clearly and distinctly in general, yet, when they come to unfold its parts by discourse or writing, lose that luminous conception which they had before attained. All accounts agree in ascribing to Cromwell a tiresome, dark, unintelligible elocution, even when he had no intention to disguise his meaning: yet no man's actions were ever, in such a variety of difficult incidents, more decisive and judicious.\n\nThe electing of a discontented parliament is a proof of a discontented nation: the angry and abrupt dissolution of that parliament is always sure to increase the general discontent. The members of this assembly, returning to their counties, propagated that spirit of mutiny which they had exerted in the house. Sir Harry Vane and the old republicans, who maintained the indissoluble authority of the long parliament, encouraged the murmurs against the present usurpation; though they acted so cautiously as to give the protector no handle against them. Wildman and some others of that party carried still further their conspiracies against the protector's authority. The royalists, observing this general ill will towards the establishment, could no longer be retained in subjection; but fancied that every one who was dissatisfied like them, had also embraced the same views and inclinations. They did not consider, that the old parliamentary party, though many of them were displeased with Cromwell, who had dispossessed them of their power, were still more apprehensive of any success to the royal cause; whence, besides a certain prospect of the same consequence, they had so much reason to dread the severest vengeance for their past transgressions.\n\nIn concert with the king, a conspiracy was entered into by the royalists throughout England, and a day of general rising appointed. Information of this design was conveyed to Cromwell. The protector's administration was extremely vigilant. Thurloe, his secretary, had spies every where. Manning, who had access to the king's family, kept a regular correspondence with him; and it was not difficult to obtain intelligence of a confederacy so generally diffused, among a party who valued themselves more on zeal and courage, than on secrecy and sobriety Many of the royalists were thrown into prison. Others, on the approach of the day, were terrified with the danger of the undertaking, and remained at home. In one place alone the conspiracy broke into action. Penruddoc, Groves, Jones, and other gentlemen of the west, entered Salisbury with about two hundred horse, at the very time when the sheriff and judges were holding the assizes. These they made prisoners; and they proclaimed the king. Contrary to their expectations, they received no accession of force; so prevalent was the terror of the established government. Having in vain wandered about for some time, they were totally discouraged; and one troop of horse was able at last to suppress them. The leaders of the conspiracy, being taken prisoners, were capitally punished. The rest were sold for slaves, and transported to Barbadoes.\n\nThe easy subduing of this insurrection, which, by the boldness of the undertaking, struck at first a great terror into the nation, was a singular felicity to the protector; who could not, without danger, have brought together any considerable body of his mutinous army in order to suppress it. The very insurrection itself he regarded as a fortunate event; since it proved the reality of those conspiracies which his enemies on every occasion represented as mere fictions, invented to color his tyrannical severities. He resolved to keep no longer any terms with the royalists, who, though they were not perhaps the most implacable of his enemies, were those whom he could oppress under the most plausible pretences, and who met with least countenance and protection from his adherents. He issued an edict, with the consent of his council, for exacting the tenth penny from that whole party; in order, as he pretended, to make them pay the expenses to which their mutinous disposition continually exposed the public. Without regard to compositions, articles of capitulation, or acts of indemnity, all the royalists, however harassed with former oppressions, were obliged anew to redeem themselves by great sums of money; and many of them were reduced by these multiplied disasters to extreme poverty. Whoever was known to be disaffected, or even lay under any suspicion, though no guilt could be proved against him, was exposed to the new exaction.\n\nIn order to raise this imposition, which commonly passed by the name of decimation, the protector instituted twelve major-generals; and divided the whole kingdom of England into so many military jurisdictions.[*]\n* Parl. Hist. vol. xx. p. 433.\n\nThese men, assisted by commissioners, had power to subject whom they pleased to decimation, to levy all the taxes imposed by the protector and his council, and to imprison any person who should be exposed to their jealousy or suspicion; nor was there any appeal from them but to the protector himself and his council. Under color of these powers, which were sufficiently exorbitant, the major-generals exercised an authority still more arbitrary, and acted as if absolute masters of the property and person of every subject. All reasonable men now concluded, that the very mask of liberty was thrown aside, and that the nation was forever subjected to military and despotic government, exercised not in the legal manner of European nations, but according to the maxims of Eastern tyranny. Not only the supreme magistrate owed his authority to illegal force and usurpation; he had parcelled out the people into so many subdivisions of slavery, and had delegated to his inferior ministers the same unlimited authority which he himself had so violently assumed.\nA government totally military and despotic, is almost sure, after some time, to fall into impotence and languor: but when it immediately succeeds a legal constitution, it may, at first, to foreign nations appear very vigorous and active, and may exert with more unanimity that power, spirit, and riches, which had been acquired under a better form. It seems now proper, after so long an interval, to look abroad to the general state of Europe, and to consider the measures which England at this time embraced in its negotiations with the neighboring princes. The moderate temper and unwarlike genius of the two last princes, the extreme difficulties under which they labored at home, and the great security which they enjoyed from foreign enemies, had rendered them negligent of the transactions on the continent; and England, during their reigns, had been, in a manner, overlooked in the general system of Europe. The bold and restless genius of the protector led him to extend his alliances and enterprises to every part of Christendom; and partly from the ascendant of his magnanimous spirit, partly from the situation of foreign kingdoms, the weight of England, even under its most legal and bravest princes, was never more sensibly felt than during this unjust and violent usurpation.\n\nA war of thirty years, the most signal and most destructive that had appeared in modern annals, was at last finished in Germany,[*] and by the treaty of Westphalia, were composed those fatal quarrels which had been excited by the palatine's precipitate acceptance of the crown of Bohemia. The young palatine was restored to part of his dignities and of his dominions.[**] The rights, privileges, and authority of the several members of the Germanic body were fixed and ascertained: sovereign princes and free states were in some degree reduced to obedience under laws: and by the valor of the heroic Gustavus, the enterprises of the active Richelieu, the intrigues of the artful Mazarine, was in part effected, after an infinite expense of blood and treasure, which had been fondly expected and loudly demanded from the feeble efforts of the pacific James, seconded by the scanty supplies of his jealous parliaments.\n\n* In 1648.\n\n** This prince, during the civil wars, had much neglected\nhis uncle, and paid court to the parliament; he accepted of\na pension of eight thousand pounds a year from them, and\ntook a place in their assembly of divines.\n\nSweden, which had acquired by conquest large dominions in the north of Germany, was engaged in enterprises which promised her, from her success and valor, still more extensive acquisitions on the side both of Poland and of Denmark. Charles X., who had mounted the throne of that kingdom after the voluntary resignation of Christina, being stimulated by the fame of Gustavus, as well as by his own martial disposition, carried his conquering arms to the south of the Baltic, and gained the celebrated battle of Warsaw, which had been obstinately disputed during the space of three days. The protector, at the time his alliance was courted by every power in Europe, anxiously courted the alliance of Sweden; and he was fond of forming a confederacy with a Protestant power of such renown, even though it threatened the whole north with conquest and subjection.\n\nThe transactions of the parliament and protector with France had been various and complicated. The emissaries of Richelieu had furnished fuel to the flame of rebellion, when it first broke out in Scotland; but after the conflagration had diffused itself, the French court, observing the materials to be of themselves sufficiently combustible, found it unnecessary any longer to animate the British malecontents to an opposition of their sovereign. On the contrary, they offered their mediation for composing these intestine disorders; and their ambassadors, from decency, pretended to act in concert with the court of England, and to receive directions from a prince with whom their master was connected by so near an affinity. Meanwhile Richelieu died, and soon after him the French king, Louis XIII., leaving his son, an infant four years old, and his widow, Anne of Austria, regent of the kingdom. Cardinal Mazarine succeeded Richelieu in the ministry; and the same general plan of policy, though by men of such opposite characters, was still continued in the French councils. The establishment of royal authority, the reduction of the Austrian family, were pursued with ardor and success; and every year brought an accession of force and grandeur to the French monarchy. Not only battles were won, towns and fortresses taken; the genius too of the nation seemed gradually to improve, and to compose itself to the spirit of dutiful obedience and of steady enterprise. A Cond\u00e9, a Turenne were formed; and the troops, animated by their valor, and guided by their discipline, acquired every day a greater ascendant over the Spaniards. All of a sudden, from some intrigues of the court, and some discontents in the courts of judicature, intestine commotions were excited, and every thing relapsed into confusion. But these rebellions of the French, neither ennobled by the spirit of liberty, nor disgraced by the fanatical extravagancies which distinguished the British civil wars, were conducted with little bloodshed, and made but a small impression on the minds of the people. Though seconded by the force of Spain, and conducted by the prince of Cond\u00e9, the malecontents in a little time were either expelled or subdued; and the French monarchy, having lost a few of its conquests, returned with fresh vigor to the acquisition of new dominion.\n\nThe queen of England and her son Charles, during these commotions, passed most of their time at Paris; and notwithstanding their near connection of blood, received but few civilities, and still less support, from the French court. Had the queen regent been ever so much inclined to assist the English prince, the disorders of her own affairs would, for a long time, have rendered such intentions impracticable. The banished queen had a moderate pension assigned her; but it was so ill paid, and her credit ran so low, that, one morning, when the cardinal De Retz waited on her, she informed him that her daughter, the princess Henrietta, was obliged to lie abed for want of a fire to warm her. To such a condition was reduced, in the midst of Paris, a queen of England, and daughter of Henry IV. of France.\n\nThe English parliament, however, having assumed the sovereignty of the state, resented the countenance, cold as it was, which the French court gave to the unfortunate monarch. On pretence of injuries of which the English merchants complained, they issued letters of reprisal upon the French; and Blake went so far as to attack and seize a whole squadron of ships which were carrying supplies to Dunkirk, then closely besieged by the Spaniards. That town, disappointed of these supplies, fell into the hands of the enemy. The French ministers soon found it necessary to change their measures. They treated Charles with such affected indifference, that he thought it more decent to withdraw, and prevent the indignity of being desired to leave the kingdom. He went first to Spaw, thence he retired to Cologne; where he lived two years, on a small pension, about six thousand pounds a year, paid him by the court of France, and on some contributions sent him by his friends in England. In the management of his family he discovered a disposition to order and economy; and his temper, cheerful, careless, and sociable, was more than a sufficient compensation for that empire of which his enemies had bereaved him. Sir Edward Hyde, created lord chancellor, and the marquis of Ormond, were his chief friends and confidants.\n\nIf the French ministry had thought it prudent to bend under the English parliament, they deemed it still more necessary to pay deference to the protector, when he assumed the reins of government. Cardinal Mazarine, by whom all the counsels of France were directed, was artful and vigilant, supple and patient, false and intriguing; desirous rather to prevail by dexterity than violence, and placing his honor more in the final success of his measures, than in the splendor and magnanimity of the means which he employed. Cromwell, by his imperious character, rather than by the advantage of his situation, acquired an ascendant over this man; and every proposal made by the protector, however unreasonable in itself, and urged with whatever insolence, met with a ready compliance from the politic and timid cardinal. Bourdeaux was sent over to England as minister; and all circumstances of respect were paid to the daring usurper, who had imbrued his hands in the blood of his sovereign, a prince so nearly related to the royal family of France. With indefatigable patience did Bourdeaux conduct this negotiation, which Cromwell seemed entirely to neglect; and though privateers with English commission committed daily depredations on the French commerce, Mazarine was content, in hopes of a fortunate issue, still to submit to these indignities.[*]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Thurloe, vol. iii. p. 103, 619, 653. In the treaty, which\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0was signed after long negotiation, the protector's name was\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0inserted before the French king's in that copy which\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0remained in England.

Don Alonzo de Cardenas, the Spanish envoy, was the first public minister who recognized the authority of the new republic; and in return for this civility, Ascham was sent envoy into Spain by the parliament. No sooner had this minister arrived in Madrid, than some of the banished royalists, inflamed by that inveterate hatred which animated the English factions, broke into his chamber, and murdered him together with his secretary. Immediately they took sanctuary in the churches; and, assisted by the general favor which every where attended the royal cause, were enabled, most of them, to make their escape. Only one of the criminals suffered death; and the parliament seemed to rest satisfied with this atonement.\nSpain, at this time, assailed every where by vigorous enemies from without, and laboring under many internal disorders, retained nothing of her former grandeur, except the haughty pride of her counsels, and the hatred and jealousy of her neighbors. Portugal had rebelled, and established her monarchy in the house of Braganza: Catalonia, complaining of violated privileges, had revolted to France: Naples was shaken with popular convulsions: the Low Countries were invaded with superior forces, and seemed ready to change their master: the Spanish infantry, anciently so formidable, had been annihilated by Cond\u00e9 in the fields of Rocroy: and though the same prince, banished France, sustained by his activity and valor the falling fortunes of Spain, he could only hope to protract, not prevent, the ruin with which that monarchy was visibly threatened.\n\nHad Cromwell understood and regarded the interests of his country, he would have supported the declining condition of Spain against the dangerous ambition of France, and preserved that balance of power on which the greatness and security of England so much depend. Had he studied only his own interests, he would have maintained an exact neutrality between those great monarchies; nor would he have hazarded his ill-acquired and unsettled power by provoking foreign enemies who might lend assistance to domestic faction, and overturn his tottering throne. But his magnanimity undervalued danger; his active disposition and avidity of extensive glory made him incapable of repose: and as the policy of men is continually warped by their temper, no sooner was peace made with Holland, than he began to deliberate what new enemy he should invade with his victorious arms.\n\nThe extensive empire and yet extreme weakness of Spain in the West Indies, the vigorous courage and great naval power of England, were circumstances which, when compared, excited the ambition of the enterprising protector, and made him hope that he might, by some gainful conquest, render forever illustrious that dominion which he had assumed over his country. Should he fail of these durable acquisitions, the Indian treasures, which must every year cross the ocean to reach Spain, were, he thought, a sure prey to the English navy, and would support his military force without his laying new burdens on the discontented people. From France a vigorous resistance must be expected: no plunder, no conquests could be hoped for: the progress of his arms, even if attended with success, must there be slow and gradual; and the advantages acquired, however real, would be less striking to the multitude, whom it was his interest to allure. The royal family, so closely connected with the French monarch, might receive great assistance from that neighboring kingdom; and an army of French Protestants landed in England would be able, he dreaded, to unite the most opposite factions against the present usurpation.[*]\n\nThese motives of policy were probably seconded by his bigoted prejudices; as no human mind ever contained so strange a mixture of sagacity and absurdity as that of this extraordinary personage. The Swedish alliance, though much contrary to the interests of England, he had contracted merely from his zeal for Protestantism;[**] and Sweden being closely connected with France, he could not hope to maintain that confederacy, in which he so much prided himself, should a rupture ensue between England and this latter kingdom.[***]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* See the account of the negotiations with France and Spain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 by Thurloe, vol. i. p. 759.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0** He proposed to Sweden a general league and confederacy of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all the Protestants.

One of these squadrons, consisting of thirty capital ships, was sent into the Mediterranean under Blake, whose fame was now spread over Europe. No English fleet, except during the crusades, had ever before sailed in those seas; and from one extremity to the other there was no naval force, Christian or Mahometan, able to resist them. The Roman pontiff, whose weakness and whose pride equally provoked attacks, dreaded invasion from a power which professed the most inveterate enmity against him, and which so little regulated its movements by the usual motives of interest and prudence. Blake, casting anchor before Leghorn, demanded and obtained from the duke of Tuscany reparation for some losses which the English commerce had formerly sustained from him. He next sailed to Algiers, and compelled the dey to make peace, and to restrain his piratical subjects from further violences on the English. He presented himself before Tunis; and having there made the same demands, the dey of that republic bade him look to the castles of Porto-Farino and Goletta, and do his utmost. Blake needed not to be roused by such a bravado: he drew his ships close up to the castles, and tore them in pieces with his artillery. He sent a numerous detachment of sailors in their long boats into the harbor, and burned every ship which lay there. This bold action, which its very temerity perhaps rendered safe, was executed with little loss, and filled all that part of the world with the renown of English valor.\n\nThe other squadron was not equally successful. It was commanded by Pen, and carried on board four thousand men under the command of Venables. About five thousand more joined them from Barbadoes and St. Christopher's. Both these officers were inclined to the king's service;[*] and it is pretended that Cromwell was obliged to hurry the soldiers on board, in order to prevent the execution of a conspiracy which had been formed among them in favor of the exiled family.[**] The ill success of this enterprise may justly be ascribed as much to the injudicious schemes of the protector who planned it, as to the bad execution of the officers by whom it was conducted. The soldiers were the refuse of the whole army: the forces enlisted in the West Indies were the most profligate of mankind: Pen and Venables were of incompatible tempers: the troops were not furnished with arms fit for such an expedition: their provisions were defective both in quantity and quality: all hopes of pillage, the best incentive to valor among such men, were refused the soldiers and seamen: no directions or intelligence were given to conduct the officers in then enterprise: and at the same time they were tied down to follow the advice of commissioners, who disconcerted them in all their projects.[***]\n\n* Clarendon.\n\n* Vita de Berwici, p. 124\n\n** Burchet's Naval History. See also Carte's Collection,\nvol. ii. p. 46, 47. Thurloe, vol. iii. p. 505.\n\nIt was agreed by the admiral and general to attempt St. Domingo, the only place of strength in the Island of Hispaniola. On the approach of the English, the Spaniards in a fright deserted their houses, and fled into the woods. Contrary to the opinion of Venables, the soldiers were disembarked without guides ten leagues distant from the town. They wandered four days through the woods without provisions, and was still more intolerable in that sultry climate, without water. The Spaniards recovered spirit, and attacked them. The English, discouraged with the bad conduct of their officers and scarcely alive from hunger, thirst, and fatigue, were unable to resist. An inconsiderable number of the enemy put the whole army to rout, killed six hundred of them, and chased the rest on board their vessels.\n\nThe English commanders, in order to atone as much as possible for this unprosperous attempt, bent their course to Jamaica, which was surrendered to them without a blow. Pen and Venables returned to England, and were both of them sent to the Tower by the protector, who, though commonly master of his fiery temper, was thrown into a violent passion at this disappointment. He had made a conquest of greater importance than he was himself at that time aware of; yet was it much inferior to the vast projects which he had formed. He gave orders, however, to support it by men and money; and that island has ever since remained in the hands of the English; the chief acquisition which they owe to the enterprising spirit of Cromwell.\n\n1656.\nAs soon as the news of this expedition, which was an unwarrantable violation of treaty, arrived in Europe, the Spaniards declared war against England, and seized all the ships and goods of English merchants, of which they could make themselves masters. The commerce with Spain, so profitable to the English, was cut off; and near fifteen hundred vessels, it is computed,[*] fell in a few years into the hands of the enemy. Blake, to whom Montague was now joined in command, after receiving new orders, prepared himself for hostilities against the Spaniards.\nSeveral sea officers, having entertained scruples of conscience with regard to the justice of the Spanish war, threw up their commissions, and retired.[**]\n\n* Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 135. World's Mistake in Oliver\nCromwell in the Harl. Miscel. vol. i.\n\n** Thurloe. vol. iv. p. 670, 688.\n\nNo commands, they thought, of their superiors could justify a war which was contrary to the principles of natural equity, and which the civil magistrate had no right to order. Individuals, they maintained, in resigning to the public their natural liberty, could bestow on it only what they themselves were possessed of, a right of performing lawful actions, and could invest it with no authority of commanding what is contrary to the decrees of Heaven. Such maxims, though they seem reasonable, are perhaps too perfect for human nature; and must be regarded as one effect, though of the most innocent and even honorable kind, of that spirit, partly fanatical, partly republican, which predominated in England.\n\nBlake lay some time off Cadiz, in expectation of intercepting the Plate fleet, but was at last obliged, for want of water, to make sail towards Portugal. Captain Stayner, whom he had left on the coast with a squadron of seven vessels, came in sight of the galleons, and immediately set sail to pursue them. The Spanish admiral ran his ship ashore: two others followed his example: the English took two ships, valued at near two millions of pieces of eight. Two galleons were set on fire; and the marquis of Badajox, viceroy of Peru, with his wife, and his daughter, betrothed to the young duke of Medina Celi, were destroyed in them. The marquis himself might have escaped; but seeing these unfortunate women, astonished with the danger, fall in a swoon, and perish in the flames, he rather chose to die with them, than drag out a life imbittered with the remembrance of such dismal scenes.[*] When the treasures gained by this enterprise arrived at Portsmouth, the protector, from a spirit of ostentation, ordered them to be transported by land to London.\n\n* Thurloe, vol. v. p. 433.\n\nThe next action against the Spaniards was more honorable, though less profitable, to the nation. Blake, having heard that a Spanish fleet of sixteen ships, much richer than the former, had taken shelter in the Canaries, immediately made sail towards them. He found them in the Bay of Santa Cruz, disposed in a formidable posture. The bay was secured with a strong castle, well provided with cannon, besides seven forts in several parts of it, all united by a line of communication, manned with musketeers. Don Diego Diagues, the Spanish admiral, ordered all his smaller vessels to moor close to the shore, and posted the larger galleons farther off, at anchor, with their broadsides to the sea.\nBlake was rather animated than daunted with this appearance. The wind seconded his courage, and blowing full into the bay, in a moment brought him among the thickest of his enemies. After a resistance of four hours, the Spaniards yielded to English valor, and abandoned their ships, which were set on fire, and consumed with all their treasure. The greatest danger still remained to the English. They lay under the fire of the castle and all the forts, which must in a little time have torn them in pieces. But the wind, suddenly shifting, carried them out of the bay; where they left the Spaniards in astonishment at the happy temerity of their audacious victors.\n\nThis was the last and greatest action of the gallant Blake. He was consumed with a dropsy and scurvy, and hastened home, that he might yield up his breath in his native country, which he had so much adorned by his valor. As he came within sight of land, he expired.[*]\n* 20th of April, 1657.\n\nNever man, so zealous for a faction, was so much respected and esteemed even by the opposite factions. He was by principle an inflexible republican; and the late usurpations, amidst all the trust and caresses which he received from the ruling powers, were thought to be very little grateful to him. \"It is still our duty,\" he said to the seamen, \"to fight for our country, into what hands soever the government may fall.\" Disinterested, generous, liberal; ambitious only of true glory, dreadful only to his avowed enemies; he forms one of the most perfect characters of the age, and the least stained with those errors and violences which were then so predominant. The protector ordered him a pompous funeral at the public charge: but the tears of his countrymen were the most honorable panegyric on his memory.\n\nThe conduct of the protector in foreign affairs, though imprudent and impolitic, was full of vigor and enterprise, and drew a consideration to his country, which, since the reign of Elizabeth, it seemed to have totally lost. The great mind of this successful usurper was intent on spreading the renown of the English nation; and while he struck mankind with astonishment at his extraordinary fortune, he seemed to ennoble instead of debasing, that people whom he had reduced to subjection. It was his boast, that he would render the name of an Englishman as much feared and revered as ever was that of a Roman; and as his countrymen found some reality in these pretensions, their national vanity, being gratified, made them bear with more patience all the indignities and calamities under which they labored.\n\nIt must also be acknowledged, that the protector, in his civil and domestic administration, displayed as great regard both to justice and clemency, as his usurped authority, derived from no law, and founded only on the sword, could possibly permit. All the chief offices in the courts of judicature were filled with men of integrity: amidst the virulence of faction, the decrees of the judges were upright and impartial; and to every man but himself, and to himself, except where necessity required the contrary, the law was the great rule of conduct and behavior. Vane and Lilburn, whose credit with the republicans and levellers he dreaded, were indeed for some time confined to prison: Cony, who refused to pay illegal taxes, was obliged by menaces to depart from his obstinacy: high courts of justice were erected to try those who had engaged in conspiracies and insurrections against the protector's authority, and whom he could not safely commit to the verdict of juries. But these irregularities were deemed inevitable consequences of his illegal authority. And though often urged by his officers, as is pretended,[*] to attempt a general massacre of the royalists, he always with horror rejected such sanguinary counsels.\n\n* Clarendon, Life of Lord Berwick, etc.\n\nIn the army was laid the sole basis of the protector's power; and in managing it consisted the chief art and delicacy of his government. The soldiers were held in exact discipline; a policy which both accustomed them to obedience, and made them less hateful and burdensome to the people. He augmented their pay; though the public necessities sometimes obliged him to run in arrears to them. Their interests, they were sensible, were closely connected with those of their general and protector. And he entirely commanded their affectionate regard, by his abilities and success in almost every enterprise which he had hitherto undertaken. But all military government is precarious; much more where it stands in opposition to civil establishments; and still more where it encounters religious prejudices. By the wild fanaticism which he had nourished in the soldiers, he had seduced them into measures, for which, if openly proposed to them, they would have entertained the utmost aversion. But this same spirit rendered them more difficult to be governed, and made their caprices terrible even to that hand which directed their movements. So often taught, that the office of king was a usurpation upon Christ, they were apt to suspect a protector not to be altogether compatible with that divine authority. Harrison, though raised to the highest dignity, and possessed of Cromwell's confidence, became his most inveterate enemy as soon as the authority of a single person was established, against which that usurper had always made such violent protestations. Overton, Rich, Okey, officers of rank in the army, were actuated with like principles, and Cromwell was obliged to deprive them of their commissions. Their influence, which was before thought unbounded among the troops, seemed from that moment to be totally annihilated.\n\nThe more effectually to curb the enthusiastic and seditious spirit of the troops, Cromwell established a kind of militia in the several counties. Companies of infantry and cavalry were enlisted under proper officers, regular pay distributed among them, and a resource by that means provided both against the insurrections of the royalists and mutiny of the army.\n\nReligion can never be deemed a point of small consequence in civil government: but during this period, it may be regarded as the great spring of men's actions and determinations. Though transported himself with the most frantic whimseys, Cromwell had adopted a scheme for regulating this principle in others, which was sagacious and political. Being resolved to maintain a national church, yet determined neither to admit Episcopacy nor Presbytery, he established a number of commissioners, under the name of tryers, partly laymen, partly ecclesiastics, some Presbyterians, some Independents. These presented to all livings which were formerly in the gift of the crown; they examined and admitted such persons as received holy orders; and they inspected the lives, doctrine, and behavior of the clergy. Instead of supporting that union between learning and theology, which has so long been attempted in Europe, these tryers embraced the latter principle in its full purity, and made it the sole object of their examination. The candidates were no more perplexed with questions concerning their progress in Greek and Roman erudition; concerning their talent for profane arts and sciences: the chief object of scrutiny regarded their advances in grace, and fixing the critical moment of their conversion.\n\nWith the pretended saints of all denominations Cromwell was familiar and easy. Laying aside the state of protector, which on other occasions he well knew how to maintain, he insinuated to them, that nothing but necessity could ever oblige him to invest himself with it. He talked spiritually to *them; he sighed he wept, he canted, he prayed. He even entered with them into an emulation of ghostly gifts, and these men, instead of grieving to be outdone in their own way, were proud that his highness, by his princely example, had dignified those practices in which they themselves were daily occupied.[*]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Cromwell followed, though but in part, the advice which he\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0received from General Harrison, at the time when the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0intimacy and endearment most strongly subsisted betwixt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0them. \"Let the waiting upon Jehovah,\" said that military\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0saint, \"be the greatest and most considerable business you\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0have every day: reckon it so, more than to eat, sleep, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0counsel together.

The Presbyterian clergy, also saved from the ravages of the Anabaptists and Millenarians, and enjoying their establishments and tithes, were not averse to his government; though he still entertained a great jealousy of that ambitious and restless spirit by which they were actuated. He granted an unbounded liberty of conscience to all but Catholics and Prelatists; and by that means he both attached the wild sectaries to his person, and employed them in curbing the domineering spirit of the Presbyterians. \"I am the only man,\" he was often heard to say, \"who has known how to subdue that insolent sect, which can suffer none but itself.\"\n\nThe Protestant zeal which possessed the Presbyterians and Independents, was highly gratified by the haughty manner in which the protector so successfully supported the persecuted Protestants throughout all Europe. Even the duke of Savoy, so remote a power, and so little exposed to the naval force of England, was obliged, by the authority of France, to comply with his mediation, and to tolerate the Protestants of the valleys, against whom that prince had commenced a furious persecution. France itself was constrained to bear, not only with the religion, but even, in some instances, with the seditious insolence of the Hugonots; and when the French court applied for a reciprocal toleration of the Catholic religion in England, the protector, who arrogated in every thing the superiority, would hearken to no such proposal. He had entertained a project of instituting a college, in imitation of that at Rome, for the propagation of the faith; and his apostles, in zeal, though not in unanimity, had certainly been a full match for the Catholics.\n\nCromwell retained the church of England in constraint though he permitted its clergy a little more liberty than the Republican parliament had formerly allowed. He was pleased that the superior lenity of his administration should in every thing be remarked. He bridled the royalists, both by the army which he retained, and by those secret spies which he found means to intermix in all their counsels. Manning being detected, and punished with death, he corrupted Sir Richard Willis, who was much trusted by Chancellor Hyde and all the royalists; and by means of this man he was let into every design and conspiracy of the party. He could disconcert any project, by confining the persons who were to be the actors in it; and as he restored them afterwards to liberty, his severity passed only for the result of general jealousy and suspicion, The secret source of his intelligence remained still unknown and unsuspected.\n\nConspiracies for an assassination he was chiefly afraid of; these being designs which no prudence or vigilance could evade. Colonel Titus, under the name of Allen, had written a spirited discourse, exhorting every one to embrace this method of vengeance; and Cromwell knew, that the inflamed minds of the royal party were sufficiently disposed to put the doctrine in practice against him. He openly told them, that assassinations were base and odious, and he never would commence hostilities by so shameful an expedient; but if the first attempt or provocation came from them, he would retaliate to the uttermost. He had instruments, he said, whom he could employ; and he never would desist till he had totally exterminated the royal family. This menace, more than all his guards, contributed to the security of his person.[*] 26\n* See note Z at the end of the volume.\n\nThere was no point about which the protector was more solicitous than to procure intelligence. This article alone, it is said, cost him sixty thousand pounds a year. Postmasters, both at home and abroad, were in his pay: carriers were searched or bribed: secretaries and clerks were corrupted the greatest zealots in all parties were often these who conveyed private information to him: and nothing could escape his vigilant inquiry. Such at least is the representation made by historians of Cromwell's administration: but it must be confessed, that, if we may judge by those volumes of Thurloe's papers which have been lately published, this affair, like many others, has been greatly magnified. We scarcely find by that collection, that any secret counsels of foreign states, except those of Holland, which are not expected to be concealed, were known to the protector.\n\nThe general behavior and deportment of this man, who had been raised from a very private station, who had passed most of his youth in the country, and who was still constrained so much to frequent bad company, was such as might befit the greatest monarch. He maintained a dignity without either affectation or ostentation; and supported with all strangers that high idea with which his great exploits and prodigious fortune had impressed them. Among his ancient friends, he could relax himself; and by trifling and amusement, jesting and making verses, he feared not exposing himself to their most familiar approaches.[*] With others he sometimes pushed matters to the length of rustic buffoonery; and he would amuse himself by putting burning coals into the boots and hose of the officers who attended him.[**] Before the king's trial, a meeting was agreed on between the chiefs of the republican party and the general officers, in order to concert the model of that free government which they were to substitute in the room of the monarchical constitution now totally subverted. After debates on this subject, the most important that could fall under the discussion of human creatures, Ludlow tells us that Cromwell, by way of frolic, threw a cushion at his head; and when Ludlow took up another cushion, in order to return the compliment, the general ran down stairs, and had almost fallen in the hurry. When the high court of justice was signing the warrant for the execution of the king, a matter, if possible, still more serious, Cromwell, taking the pen in his hand, before he subscribed his name, bedaubed with ink the face of Martin, who sat next him. And the pen being delivered to Martin, he practised the same frolic upon Cromwell.[***]\n\n* Whitlocke, p. 647.\n\n** Bates.\n\n*** Trial of the Regicides.\n\nHe frequently gave feasts to his inferior officers; and when the meat was set upon the table, a signal was given; the soldiers rushed in upon, them; and with much noise, tumult, and confusion, ran away with all the dishes, and disappointed the guests of their expected meal.[*]\n* Bates.\n\nThat vein of frolic and pleasantry which made a part, however inconsistent, of Cromwell's character, was apt sometimes to betray him into other inconsistencies, and to discover itself even where religion might seem to be a little concerned. It is a tradition, that one day, sitting at table, the protector had a bottle of wine brought him, of a kind which he valued so highly, that he must needs open the bottle himself; but in attempting it, the corkscrew dropped from his hand. Immediately his courtiers and generals flung themselves on the floor to recover it. Cromwell burst out a laughing. \"Should any fool,\" said he, \"put in his head at the door, he would fancy, from your posture, that you were seeking the Lord; and you are only seeking a corkscrew.\"\n\nAmidst all the unguarded play and buffoonery of this singular personage, he took the opportunity of remarking the characters, designs, and weaknesses of men; and he would sometimes push them, by an indulgence in wine, to open to him the most secret recesses of their bosom. Great regularity, however, and even austerity of manners, were always maintained in his court; and he was careful never by any liberties to give offence to the most rigid of the godly. Some state was upheld; but with little expense, and without any splendor. The nobility, though courted by him, kept at a distance, and disdained to intermix with those mean persons who were the instruments of his government. Without departing from economy, he was generous to those who served him; and he knew how to find out and engage in his interests every man possessed of those talents which any particular employment demanded. His generals, his admirals, his judges, his ambassadors, were persons who contributed, all of them, in their several spheres, to the security of the protector, and to the honor and interest of the nation.\n\nUnder pretence of uniting Scotland and Ireland in one commonwealth with England, Cromwell had reduced those kingdoms to a total subjection; and he treated them entirely as conquered provinces. The civil administration of Scotland was placed in a council, consisting mostly of English, of which Lord Broghile was president. Justice was administered by seven judges, four of whom were English. In order to cure the tyrannical nobility, he both abolished all vassalage,[*] and revived the office of justice of peace, which King James had introduced, but was not able to support.[**] A long line of forts and garrisons was maintained throughout the kingdom. An army of ten thousand men[***] kept everything in peace and obedience; and neither the banditti of the mountains nor the bigots of the Low Countries could indulge their inclination to turbulence and disorder. He courted the Presbyterian clergy though he nourished that intestine enmity which prevailed between the resolutioners and protesters; and he found that very little policy was requisite to foment quarrels among theologians. He permitted no church assemblies; being sensible that from thence had proceeded many of the past disorders. And in the main, the Scots were obliged to acknowledge, that never before, while they enjoyed their irregular, factious liberty, had they attained so much happiness as at present, when reduced to subjection under a foreign nation.\n\n* Whitlocke, p. 570.\n\n** Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 57.\n\n*** Thurloe, vol. vi. p. 557.\n\nThe protector's administration of Ireland was more severe and violent. The government of that island was first intrusted to Fleetwood, a notorious fanatic, who had married Ireton's widow; then to Henry Cromwell, second son of the protector, a young man of an amiable, mild disposition, and not destitute of vigor and capacity. Above five millions of acres, forfeited either by the Popish rebels or by the adherents of the king, were divided, partly among the adventurers, who had advanced money to the parliament, partly among the English soldiers, who had arrears due to them. Examples of a more sudden and violent change of property are scarcely to be found in any history. An order was even issued to confine all the native Irish to the province of Connaught, where they would be shut up by rivers, lakes, and mountains, and could not, it was hoped, be any longer dangerous to the English government: but this barbarous and absurd policy, which, from an impatience of attaining immediate security, *must have depopulated all the other provinces, and rendered the English estates of no value, was soon abandoned as impracticable.\n\nCromwell began to hope that, by his administration, attended with so much lustre and success abroad, so much order and tranquillity at home, he had now acquired such authority as would enable him to meet the representatives of the nation, and would assure him of their dutiful compliance with his government. He summoned a parliament; but not trusting altogether to the good will of the people, he used every art which his new model of representation allowed him to employ, in order to influence the elections, and fill the house with his own creatures. Ireland, being entirely in the hands of the army, chose few but such officers as were most acceptable to him. Scotland showed a like compliance; and as the nobility and gentry of that kingdom regarded their attendance on English parliaments as an ignominious badge of slavery, it was on that account more easy for the officers to prevail in the elections. Notwithstanding all these precautions, the protector still found that the majority would not be favorable to him. He set guards, therefore, on the door, who permitted none to enter but such as produced a warrant from his council; and the council rejected about a hundred, who either refused a recognition of the protector's government, or were on other accounts obnoxious to him. These protested against so egregious a violence, subversive of all liberty; but every application for redress was neglected both by the council and the parliament.\n\nThe majority of the parliament, by means of these arts and violences, was now at last either friendly to the protector, or resolved, by their compliance, to adjust, if possible, this military government to their laws and liberties. They voted a renunciation of all title in Charles Stuart, or any of his family; and this was the first act, dignified with the appearance of national consent, which had ever had that tendency. Colonel Jephson, in order to sound the inclinations of the house, ventured to move, that the parliament should bestow the crown on Cromwell; and no surprise or reluctance was discovered on the occasion. When Cromwell afterwards asked Jephson what induced him to make such a motion, \"As long,\" said Jephson, \"as I have the honor to sit in parliament, I must follow the dictates of my own conscience, whatever offence I may be so unfortunate as to give you.\" \"Get thee gone,\" said Cromwell, giving him a gentle blow on the shoulder; \"get thee gone, for a mad fellow as thou art.\"\n\nIn order to pave the way to this advancement, for which he so ardently longed, Cromwell resolved to sacrifice his major-generals, whom he knew to be extremely odious to the nation That measure was also become necessary for his own security. All government, purely military, fluctuates perpetually between a despotic monarchy and a despotic aristocracy, according as the authority of the chief commander prevails, or that of the officers next him in rank and dignity. The major-generals, being possessed of so much distinct jurisdiction, began to establish a separate title to power, and had rendered themselves formidable to the protector himself; and for this inconvenience, though he had not foreseen it, he well knew, before it was too late, to provide a proper remedy. Claypole, his son-in-law, who possessed his confidence, abandoned them to the pleasure of the house; and though the name was still retained, it was agreed to abridge, or rather entirely annihilate, the power of the major-generals.\n\nAt length, a motion in form was made by Alderman Pack, one of the city members, for investing the protector with the dignity of king. This motion at first excited great disorder, and divided the whole house into parties. The chief opposition came from the usual adherents of the protector, the major-generals, and such officers as depended on them. Lambert a man of deep intrigue, and of great interest in the army, had long entertained the ambition of succeeding Cromwell in the protectorship; and he foresaw, that if the monarchy were restored, hereditary right would also be established, and the crown be transmitted to the posterity of the prince first elected. He pleaded, therefore, conscience; and rousing all those civil and religious jealousies against kingly government, which had been so industriously encouraged among the soldiers, and which served them as a pretence for so many violences, he raised a numerous, and still more formidable party, against the motion.\nOn the other hand, the motion was supported by every one who was more particularly devoted to the protector, and who hoped, by so acceptable a measure, to pay court to the prevailing authority. Many persons also, attached to their country, despaired of ever being able to subvert the present illegal establishment; and were desirous, by fixing it on ancient foundations, to induce the protector, from views of his own safety, to pay a regard to the ancient laws and liberties of the kingdom. Even the royalists imprudently joined in the measure; and hoped that, when the question regarded only persons, not forms of government, no one would any longer balance between the ancient royal family and an ignoble usurper, who, by blood, treason, and perfidy, had made his way to the throne.\n\n1657.\nThe bill was voted by a considerable majority; and a committee was appointed to reason with the protector, and to overcome those scruples which he pretended against accepting so liberal an offer.\n\nThe conference lasted for several days. The committee urged, that all the statutes and customs of England were founded on the supposition of regal authority, and could not, without extreme violence, be adjusted to any other form of government: that a protector, except during the minority of a king, was a name utterly unknown to the laws; and no man was acquainted with the extent or limits of his authority; that if it were attempted to define every part of his jurisdiction, many years, if not ages, would be required for the execution of so complicated a work; if the whole power of the king were at once transferred to him, the question was plainly about a name, and the preference was indisputably due to the ancient title: that the English constitution was more anxious concerning the form of government, than concerning the birthright of the first magistrate; and had provided, by an express law of Henry VII., for the security of those who act in defence of the king in being, by whatever means he might have acquired possession: that it was extremely the interest of all his highness's friends to seek the shelter of this statute; and even the people in general were desirous of such a settlement, and in all juries were with great difficulty induced to give their verdict in favor of a protector: that the great source of all the late commotions had been the jealousy of liberty: and that a republic, together with a protector, had been established in order to provide further securities for the freedom of the constitution; but that by experience the remedy had been found insufficient, even dangerous and pernicious; since every indeterminate power, such as that of a protector, must be arbitrary; and the more arbitrary, as it was contrary to the genius and inclination of the people.\nThe difficulty consisted not in persuading Cromwell. He was sufficiently convinced of the solidity of these reasons; and his inclination, as well as judgment, was entirely on the side of the committee. But how to bring over the soldiers to the same way of thinking, was the question. The office of king had been painted to them in such horrible colors, that there were no hopes of reconciling them suddenly to it, even though bestowed upon their general, to whom they were so much devoted. A contradiction, open and direct, to all past professions, would make them pass, in the eyes of the whole nation, for the most shameless hypocrites, enlisted, by no other than mercenary motives, in the cause of the most perfidious traitor. Principles, such as they were, had been encouraged in them by every consideration, human and divine; and though it was easy, where interest concurred, to deceive them by the thinnest disguises, it might be found dangerous at once to pull off the mask, and to show them in a full light the whole crime and deformity of their conduct. Suspended between these fears and his own most ardent desires, Cromwell protracted the time, and seemed still to oppose the reasonings of the committee; in hopes that by artifice he might be able to reconcile the refractory minds of the soldiers to his new dignity.\n\nWhile the protector argued so much in contradiction both to his judgment and inclination, it is no wonder that his elocution, always confused, embarrassed, and unintelligible, should be involved in tenfold darkness, and discover no glimmering of common sense or reason. An exact account of this conference remains, and may be regarded as a great curiosity. The members of the committee in their reasonings discover judgment, knowledge, elocution: Lord Broghill in particular exerts himself on this memorable occasion. But what a contrast when we pass to the protector's replies! After so singular a manner does nature distribute her talents, that, in a nation abounding with sense and learning, a man who, by superior personal merit alone, had made his way to supreme dignity, and had even obliged the parliament to make him a tender of the crown, was yet incapable of expressing himself on this occasion, but in a manner which a peasant of the most ordinary capacity would justly be ashamed of.[*]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* We shall produce any passage at random; for his discourse\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is all of a piece. \"I confess, for it behoves me to deal\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0plainly with you, I must confess, I would say, I hope I may\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0be understood in this; for indeed I must be tender what I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0say to such an audience as this; I say, I would be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0understood, that in this argument I do not make parallel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 betwixt men of a different mind, and a parliament, which\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0shall have their desires.

Fleetwood had married his daughter; Desborow his sister; yet these men, actuated by principle alone, could by no persuasion, artifice, or entreaty be induced to consent that their friend and patron should be invested with regal dignity. They told him, that if he accepted of the crown, they would instantly throw up their commissions, and never afterwards should have it in their power to serve him.[*]\n\n* Thurloe, vol. vi. p. 261.\n\nColonel Pride procured a petition against the office of king, signed by a majority of the officers who were in London and the neighborhood. Several persons, it is said, had entered into an engagement to murder the protector within a few hours after he should have accepted the offer of the parliament. Some sudden mutiny in the army was justly dreaded. And upon the whole, Cromwell, after the agony and perplexity of long doubt, was at last obliged to refuse that crown which the representatives of the nation, in the most solemn manner, had tendered to him. Most historians are inclined to blame his choice; but he must be allowed the best judge of his own situation. And in such complicated subjects, the alteration of a very minute circumstance, unknown to the spectator, will often be sufficient to cast the balance, and render a determination, which in itself may be uneligible, very prudent, or even absolutely necessary to the actor.\n\nA dream or prophecy, Lord Clarendon mentions, which, he affirms, (and he must have known the truth,) was universally talked of almost from the beginning of the civil wars, and long before Cromwell was so considerable a person as to bestow upon it any degree of probability. In this prophecy, it was foretold that Cromwell should be the greatest man in England, and would nearly, but never would fully, mount the throne. Such a prepossession probably arose from the heated imagination either of himself or of his followers; and as it might be one cause of the great progress which he had already made, it is not an unlikely reason which may be assigned for his refusing at this time any further elevation.\nThe parliament, when the regal dignity was rejected by Cromwell, found themselves obliged to retain the name of a commonwealth and protector; and as the government was hitherto a manifest usurpation, it was thought proper to sanctify it by a seeming choice of the people and their representatives. Instead of the \"instrument of government,\" which was the work of the general officers alone, \"an humble petition and advice\" was framed, and offered to the protector, by the parliament. This was represented as the great basis cf the republican establishment, regulating and limiting the powers of each member of the constitution, and securing the liberty of the people to the most remote posterity. By this deed, the authority of protector was in some particulars enlarged; in others, it was considerably diminished. He had the power of nominating his successor; he had a perpetual revenue assigned him, a million a year for the pay of the fleet and army, three hundred thousand pounds for the support of civil government; and he had authority to name another house, who should enjoy their seats during life, and exercise some functions of the former house of peers. But he abandoned the power, assumed in the intervals of parliament, of framing laws with the consent of his council; and he agreed, that no members of either house should be excluded but by the consent of that house of which they were members. The other articles were in the main the same as in the instrument of government. The instrument of government Cromwell had formerly extolled as the most perfect work of human invention: he now represented it as a rotten plank, upon which no man could trust himself without sinking. Even the humble petition and advice, which he extolled in its turn, appeared so lame and imperfect, that it was found requisite, this very session, to mend it by a supplement; and after all, it may be regarded as a crude and undigested model of government. It was, however, accepted for the voluntary deed of the whole people in the three united nations; and Cromwell, as if his power had just commenced from this popular consent, was anew inaugurated in Westminster Hall, after the most solemn and most pompous manner.\n\nThe parliament having adjourned itself, the protector deprived Lambert of all his commissions; but still allowed him a considerable pension of two thousand pounds a year, as a bribe for his future peaceable deportment. Lambert's authority in the army, to the surprise of every body, was found immediately to expire with the loss of his commission. Packet and some other officers, whom Cromwell suspected, were also displaced.\nRichard, eldest son of the protector, was brought to court, introduced into public business, and thenceforth regarded by many as his heir in the protectorship; though Cromwell sometimes employed the gross artifice of flattering others with hopes of the succession. Richard was a person possessed of the most peaceable, inoffensive, unambitious character; and had hitherto lived contentedly in the country, on a small estate which his wife had brought him. All the activity which he discovered, and which never was great, was, however, exerted to beneficent purposes: at the time of the king's trial, he had fallen on his knees before his father, and had conjured him, by every tie of duty and humanity, to spare the life of that monarch. Cromwell had two daughters unmarried; one of them he now gave in marriage to the grandson and heir of his great friend the earl of Warwick, with whom he had, in every fortune, preserved an uninterrupted intimacy and good correspondence. The other he married to the viscount Fauconberg of a family formerly devoted to the royal party. He was ambitious of forming connections with the nobility; and it was one chief motive for his desiring the title of king, that he might replace every thing in its natural order, and restore to the ancient families the trust and honor of which he now found himself obliged, for his own safety, to deprive them.\n1658.\n\nThe parliament was again assembled; consisting, as in the times of monarchy, of two houses, the commons and the other house. Cromwell, during the interval, had sent writs to his house of peers, which consisted of sixty members. They were composed of five or six ancient peers, of several gentlemen of fortune and distinction, and of some officers who had risen from the meanest stations. None of the ancient peers, however, though summoned by writ, would deign to accept of a seat which they must share with such companions as were assigned them. The protector endeavored at first to maintain the appearance of a legal magistrate. He placed no guard at the door of either house; but soon found how incompatible liberty is with military usurpations. By bringing so great a number of his friends and adherents into the other house he had lost the majority among the national representatives. In consequence of a clause in the humble petition and advice the commons assumed a power of readmitting those members whom the council had formerly excluded. Sir Arthur Hazelrig and some others, whom Cromwell had created lords, rather chose to take their seat with the commons. An incontestable majority now declared themselves against the protector; and they refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of that other house which he had established. Even the validity of the humble petition and advice was questioned, as being voted by a parliament which lay under force, and which was deprived by military violence of a considerable number of its members. The protector, dreading combinations between the parliament and the malecontents in the army, resolved to allow no leisure for forming any conspiracy against him; and, with expressions of great displeasure, he dissolved the parliament. When urged by Fleetwood and others of his friends not to precipitate himself into this rash measure, he swore by the living God that they should not sit a moment longer.\n\nThese distractions at home were not able to take off the protector's attention from foreign affairs; and in all his measures, he proceeded with the same vigor and enterprise, as if secure of the duty and attachment of the three kingdoms. His alliance with Sweden he still supported; and he endeavored to assist that crown in its successful enterprises for reducing all its neighbors to subjection, and rendering itself absolute master of the Baltic. As soon as Spain declared war against him, he concluded a peace and an alliance with France, and united himself in all his counsels with that potent and ambitious kingdom. Spain, having long courted in vain the friendship of the successful usurper, was reduced at last to apply to the unfortunate prince. Charles formed a league with Philip, removed his small court to Bruges in the Low Countries, and raised four regiments of his own subjects, whom he employed in the Spanish service. The duke of York, who had with applause served some campaigns in the French army, and who had merited the particular esteem of Marshal Turenne, now joined his brother, and continued to seek military experience under Don John of Austria, and the prince of Cond\u00e9.\n\nThe scheme of foreign politics adopted by the protector was highly imprudent, but was suitable to that magnanimity and enterprise with which he was so signally endowed. He was particularly desirous of conquest and dominion on the continent;[*] and he sent over into Flanders six thousand men under Reynolds, who joined the French army commanded by Turenne. In the former campaign, Mardyke was taken, and put into the hands of the English. Early this campaign, siege was laid to Dunkirk; and when the Spanish army advanced to relieve it, the combined armies of France and England marched out of their trenches, and fought the battle of the Dunes, where the Spaniards were totally defeated.[**]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* He aspired to get possession of Elsinore and the passage\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of the Sound.

Dunkirk, being soon after surrendered, was by agreement delivered to Cromwell. He committed the government of that important place to Lockhart, a Scotchman of abilities, who had married his niece, and was his ambassador at the court of France.\n\nThis acquisition was regarded by the protector as the means only of obtaining further advantages. He was resolved to concert measures with the French court for the final conquest and partition of the Low Countries.[*] Had he lived much longer, and maintained his authority in England, so chimerical, or rather so dangerous, a project would certainly have been carried into execution. And this first and principal step towards more extensive conquest, which France during a whole century has never yet been able, by an infinite expense of blood and treasure, fully to attain, had at once been accomplished by the enterprising, though unskilful politics of Cromwell.\n\nDuring these transactions, great demonstrations of mutual friendship and regard passed between the French king and the protector. Lord Fauconberg, Cromwell's son-in-law, was despatched to Louis, then in the camp before Dunkirk; and was received with the regard usually paid to foreign princes by the French court.[**] Mazarine sent to London his nephew Mancini, along with the duke of Crequi; and expressed his regret that his urgent affairs should deprive him of the honor which he had long wished for, of paying in person his respects to the greatest man in the world.[***]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Thurloe, vol. i. p. 762.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0** Thurloe, vol. vii. p. 151, 158.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *** In reality, the cardinal had not entertained so high an\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 idea of Cromwell.

His administration, so expensive both by military enterprises and secret intelligence, had exhausted his revenue, and involved him in a considerable debt. The royalists, he heard, had renewed their conspiracies for a general insurrection; and Ormond was secretly come over with a view of concerting measures for the execution of this project. Lord Fairfax, Sir William Waller, and many heads of the Presbyterians, had secretly entered into the engagement. Even the army was infected with the general spirit of discontent; and some sudden and dangerous eruption was every moment to be dreaded from it. No hopes remained, after his violent breach with the last parliament, that he should ever be able to establish, with general consent, a legal settlement, or temper the military with any mixture of civil authority. All his arts and policy were exhausted; and having so often, by fraud and false pretences, deceived every party, and almost every individual, he could no longer hope, by repeating the same professions, to meet with equal confidence and regard.\n\nHowever zealous the royalists, their conspiracy took not effect: Willis discovered the whole to the protector. Ormond was obliged to fly, and he deemed himself fortunate to have escaped so vigilant an administration. Great numbers were thrown into prison. A high court of justice was anew erected for the trial of those criminals whose guilt was most apparent. Notwithstanding the recognition of his authority by the last parliament, the protector could not as yet trust to an unbiased jury. Sir Henry Slingsby and Dr. Huet were condemned and beheaded. Mordaunt, brother to the earl of Peterborough, narrowly escaped. The numbers for his condemnation and his acquittal were equal; and just as the sentence was pronounced in his favor. Colonel Pride, who was resolved to condemn him, came into court. Ashton, Storey, and Bestley were hanged in different streets of the city.\n\nThe conspiracy of the Millenarians in the army struck Cromwell with still greater apprehensions. Harrison and the other discarded officers of that party could not remain at rest. Stimulated equally by revenge, by ambition, and by conscience, they still harbored in their breast some desperate project; and there wanted not officers in the army who, from like motives, were disposed to second all their undertakings. The levellers and agitators had been encouraged by Cromwell to interpose with their advice in all political deliberations; and he had even pretended to honor many of them with his intimate friendship, while he conducted his daring enterprises against the king and the parliament. It was a usual practice with him, in order to familiarize himself the more with the agitators, who were commonly corporals or sergeants, to take them to bed with him, and there, after prayers and exhortations, to discuss together their projects and principles, political as well as religious. Having assumed the dignity of protector, he excluded them from all his councils, and had neither leisure nor inclination to indulge them any further in their wonted familiarities. Among those who were enraged at this treatment was Sexby, an active agitator, who now employed against him all that restless industry which had formerly been exerted in his favor. He even went so far as to enter into a correspondence with Spain, and Cromwell, who knew the distempers of the army, was justly afraid of some mutiny, to which a day, an hour, an instant, might provide leaders.\n\nOf assassinations, likewise, he was apprehensive, from the zealous spirit which actuated the soldiers. Sindercome had undertaken to murder him; and by the most unaccountable accidents, had often been prevented from executing his bloody purpose. His design was discovered; but the protector could never find the bottom of the enterprise, nor detect any of his accomplices. He was tried by a jury; and, notwithstanding the general odium attending that crime, notwithstanding the clear and full proof of his guilt, so little conviction prevailed of the protector's right to the supreme government, it was with the utmost difficulty[*] that this conspirator was condemned. When every thing was prepared for his execution, he was found dead; from poison, as is supposed, which he had voluntarily taken.\n\n* Thurloe, voL vi. p. 53.\n\nThe protector might better have supported those fears and apprehensions which the public distempers occasioned, had he enjoyed any domestic satisfaction, or possessed any cordial friend of his own family, in whose bosom he could safely have unloaded his anxious and corroding cares. But Fleetwood, his son-in-law, actuated by the wildest zeal, began to estrange himself from him; and was enraged to discover, that Cromwell, in all his enterprises, had entertained views of promoting his own grandeur, more than of encouraging piety and religion, of which he made such fervent professions. His eldest daughter, married to Fleetwood, had adopted republican principles so vehement, that she could not with patience behold power lodged in a single person, even in her indulgent father. His other daughters were no less prejudiced in favor of the royal cause, and regretted the violences and iniquities into which, they thought, their family had so unhappily been transported. Above all, the sickness of Mrs. Claypole, his peculiar favorite, a lady endued with many humane virtues and amiable accomplishments, depressed his anxious mind, and poisoned all his enjoyments. She had entertained a high regard for Dr. Huet, lately executed; and being refused his pardon, the melancholy of her temper, increased by her distempered body, had prompted her to lament to her father all his sanguinary measures, and urge him to compunction for those heinous crimes into which his fatal ambition had betrayed him. Her death, which followed soon after, gave new edge to every word which she had uttered.\n\nAll composure of mind was now forever fled from the protector: he felt that the grandeur which he had attained with so much guilt and courage, could not insure him that tranquillity which it belongs to virtue alone, and moderation, fully to ascertain. Overwhelmed with the load of public affairs, dreading perpetually some fatal accident in his distempered government, seeing nothing around him but treacherous friends or enraged enemies, possessing the confidence of no party, resting his title on no principle, civil or religious, he found his power to depend on so delicate a poise of factions and interests, as the smallest event was able, without any preparation, in a moment to overturn. Death, too, which with such signal intrepidity he had braved in the field, being incessantly threatened by the poniards of fanatical or interested assassins, was ever present to his terrified apprehension, and haunted him in every scene of business or repose. Each action of his life betrayed the terrors under which he labored. The aspect of strangers was uneasy to him: with a piercing and anxious eye he surveyed every face to which he was not daily accustomed. He never moved a step without strong guards attending him: he wore armor under his clothes, and further secured himself by offensive weapons, a sword, falchion, and pistols, which he always carried about him. He returned from no place by the direct road, or by the same way which he went. Every journey he performed with hurry and precipitation. Seldom he slept above three nights together in the same chamber; and he never let it be known beforehand what chamber he intended to choose, nor intrusted himself in any which was not provided with back doors, at which sentinels were carefully placed. Society terrified him, while he reflected on his numerous, unknown, and implacable enemies: solitude astonished him, by withdrawing that protection which he found so necessary for his security.\nHis body, also, from the contagion of his anxious mind, began to be affected, and his health seemed sensibly to decline. He was seized with a slow fever, which changed into a tertian ague. For the space of a week, no dangerous symptoms appeared: and in the intervals of the fits he was able to walk abroad. At length the fever increased, and he himself began to entertain some thoughts of death, and to cast his eye towards that future existence, whose idea had once been intimately present to him; though since, in the hurry of affairs, and the shock of wars and factions, it had, no doubt, been considerably obliterated. He asked Goodwin, one of his preachers, if the doctrine were true, that the elect could never fall, or suffer a final reprobation. \"Nothing more certain,\" replied the preacher. \"Then I am safe,\" said the protector; \"for I am sure that once I was in a state of grace.\"\n\nHis physicians were sensible of the perilous condition to which his distemper had reduced him; but his chaplains, by their prayers, visions, and revelations, so buoyed up his hopes, that he began to believe his life out of all danger. A favorable answer, it was pretended, had been returned by Heaven to the petitions of all the godly: and he relied on their asseverations much more than on the opinion of the most experienced physicians. \"I tell you,\" he cried with confidence to the latter, \"I tell you, I shall not die of this distemper: I am well assured of my recovery. It is promised by the Lord, not only to my supplications, but to those of men who hold a stricter commerce and more intimate correspondence with him. Ye may have skill in your profession; but nature can do more than all the physicians in the world, and God is far above nature.\"(*) Nay, to such a degree of madness did their enthusiastic assurances mount, that, upon a fast day, which was observed on his account both at Hampton Court and at Whitehall, they did not so much pray for his health, as give thanks for the undoubted pledges which they had received of his recovery. He himself was overheard offering up his addresses to Heaven; and so far had the illusions of fanaticism prevailed over the plainest dictates of natural morality, that he assumed more the character of a mediator, in interceding for his people, than that of a criminal, whose atrocious violation of social duty had, from every tribunal, human and divine, merited the severest vengeance.\n\n* Bates. See also Ihurloe, vol. vii. p. 356, 416.\n\nMeanwhile, all the symptoms began to wear a more fatal aspect; and the physicians were obliged to break silence, and to declare that the protector could not survive the next fit with which he was threatened. The council was alarmed. A deputation was sent to know his will with regard to his successor His senses were gone, and he could not now express his intentions. They asked him whether he did not mean that his eldest son, Richard, should succeed him in the protectorship. A simple affirmative was, or seemed to be, extorted from him. Soon after, on the third of September, that very day which he had always considered as the most fortunate for him, he expired, A violent tempest, which immediately succeeded his death, served as a subject of discourse to the vulgar. His partisans, as well as his enemies, were fond of remarking this event; and each of them endeavored, by forced inferences, to interpret it as a confirmation of their particular prejudices.\nThe writers attached to the memory of this wonderful person, make his character, with regard to abilities, bear the air of the most extravagant panegyric: his enemies form such a representation of his moral qualities as resembles the most virulent invective. Both of them, it must be confessed, are supported by such striking circumstances in his conduct and fortune, as bestow on their representation a great air of probability. \"What can be more extraordinary,\" it is said,[*] \"than that a person of private birth and education, no fortune, no eminent qualities of body, which have sometimes, nor shining talents of mind, which have often, raised men to the highest dignities, should have the courage to attempt, and the abilities to execute, so great a design as the subverting one of the most ancient and best established monarchies in the world? That he should have the power and boldness to put his prince and master to an open and infamous death? Should banish that numerous and strongly allied family? Cover all these temerities under a seeming obedience to a parliament, in whose service he pretended to be retained? Trample, too, upon that parliament in their turn, and scornfully expel them as soon as they gave him ground of dissatisfaction? Erect in their place the dominion of the saints, and give reality to the most visionary idea which the heated imagination of any fanatic was ever able to entertain? Suppress again that monster in its infancy, and openly set up himself above all things that ever were called sovereign in England? Overcome first all his enemies by arms, and all his friends afterwards by artifice? Serve all parties patiently for a while, and command them victoriously at last? Overrun each corner of the three nations, and subdue, with equal facility, both the riches of the south and the poverty of the north? Be feared and courted by all foreign princes, and be adopted a brother to the gods of the earth? Call together parliaments with a word of his pen, and scatter them again with the breath of his mouth? Reduce to subjection a warlike and discontented nation, by means of a mutinous army? Command a mutinous army by means of seditious and factious officers? Be humbly and daily petitioned, that he would be pleased, at the rate of millions a year, to be hired as master of those who had hired him before to be their servant? Have the estates and lives of three nations as much at his disposal as was once the little inheritance of his father, and be as noble and liberal in the spending of them? And lastly, (for there is no end of enumerating every particular of his glory,) with one word bequeath all this power and splendor to his posterity? He possessed of peace at home and triumph abroad? Be buried among kings, and with more than regal solemnity; and leave a name behind him not to be extinguished but with the whole world; which as it was too little for his praise, so might it have been for his conquests, if the short line of his mortal life could have stretched out to the extent of his immortal designs?\"\n\n* Cowley's Discourses. This passage is altered in some\n\nparticulars from the original.\n\nMy intention is not to disfigure this picture, drawn by so masterly a hand: I shall only endeavor to remove from it somewhat of the marvellous; a circumstance which, on all occasions, gives much ground for doubt and suspicion. It seems to me, that the circumstance of Cromwell's life in which his abilities are principally discovered, is his rising from a private station, in opposition to so many rivals, so much advanced before him, to a high command and authority, in the army. His great courage, his signal military talents, his eminent dexterity and address, were all requisite for this important acquisition. Yet will not this promotion appear the effect of supernatural abilities, when we consider, that Fairfax himself, a private gentleman, who had not the advantage of a seat in parliament, had, through the same steps, attained even a superior rank, and, if endued with common capacity and penetration, had been able to retain it. To incite such an army to rebellion against the parliament, required no uncommon art or industry: to have kept them in obedience had been the more difficult enterprise. When the breach was once formed between the military and civil powers, a supreme and absolute authority, from that moment, is devolved on the general; and if he be afterwards pleased to employ artifice or policy, it may be regarded, on most occasions, as great condescension, if not as superfluous caution. That Cromwell was ever able really to blind or overreach either the king or the republicans, does not appear: as they possessed no means of resisting the force under his command, they were glad to temporize with him, and, by seeming to be deceived, wait for opportunities of freeing themselves from his dominion. If he seduced the military fanatics, it is to be considered, that their interests and his evidently concurred; that their ignorance and low education exposed them to the grossest imposition; and that he himself was at bottom as frantic an enthusiast as the worst of them; and, in order to obtain their confidence, needed but to display those vulgar and ridiculous habits which he had early acquired, and on which he set so high a value. An army is so forcible, and at the same time so coarse a weapon, that any hand which wields it, may, without much dexterity, perform any operation, and attain any ascendant, in human society.\n\nThe domestic administration of Cromwell, though it discovers great abilities, was conducted without any plan either of liberty or arbitrary power: perhaps his difficult situation admitted of neither. His foreign enterprises, though full of intrepidity, were pernicious to national interest, and seem more the result of impetuous fury or narrow prejudices, than of cool foresight and deliberation. An eminent personage, however, he was in many respects, and even a superior genius; but unequal and irregular in his operations. And though not defective in any talent, except that of elocution, the abilities which in him were most admirable, and which most contributed to his marvellous success, were the magnanimous resolution of his enterprises, and his peculiar dexterity in discovering the characters, and practising on the weaknesses, of mankind.\n\nIf we survey the moral character of Cromwell with that indulgence which is due to the blindness and infirmities of the human species, we shall not be inclined to load his memory with such violent reproaches as those which his enemies usually throw upon it. Amidst the passions and prejudices of that period, that he should prefer the parliamentary to the royal cause, will not appear extraordinary; since, even at present, some men of sense and knowledge are disposed to think, that the question, with regard to the justice of the quar* *rel, may be regarded as doubtful and uncertain. The murder of the king, the most atrocious of all his actions, was to him covered under a mighty cloud of republican and fanatical illusions; and it is not impossible, but he might believe it, as many others did, the most meritorious action that he could perform. His subsequent usurpation was the effect of necessity, as well as of ambition; nor is it easy to see how the various factions could at that time have been restrained, without a mixture of military and arbitrary authority. The private deportment of Cromwell, as a son, a husband, a father, a friend, is exposed to no considerable censure, if it does not rather merit praise. And, upon the whole, his character does not appear more extraordinary and unusual by the mixture of so much absurdity with so much penetration, than by his tempering such violent ambition and such enraged fanaticism with so much regard to justice and humanity.\n\nCromwell was in the fifty-ninth year of his age when he died. He was of a robust frame of body, and of a manly, though not of an agreeable aspect. He left only two sons, Richard and Henry; and three daughters; one married to General Fleetwood, another to Lord Fauconberg, a third to Lord Rich. His father died when he was very young. His mother lived till after he was protector; and, contrary to her orders, he buried her with great pomp in Westminster Abbey. She could not be persuaded that his power or person was ever in safety. At every noise which she heard, she exclaimed that her son was murdered; and was never satisfied that he was alive, if she did not receive frequent visits from him. She was a decent woman; and by her frugality and industry had raised and educated a numerous family upon a small fortune. She had even been obliged to set up a brewery at Huntingdon, which she managed to good advantage. Hence Cromwell, in the invectives of that age, is often stigmatized with the name of the brewer. Ludlow, by way of insult, mentions the great accession which he would receive to his royal revenues upon his mother's death, who possessed a jointure of sixty pounds a year upon his estate. She was of a good family, of the name of Stuart; remotely allied, as is by some supposed, to the royal family.\n\nFootnotes\n\n26 [ NOTE Z, p. 468. About this time an accident had almost robbed the protector of his life, and saved his enemies the trouble of all their machinations. Having got six fine Friesland coach horses, as a present from the count of Oldenburgh, he undertook for his amusement to drive them about Hyde Park, his secretary, Thurloe, being in the coach. The horses were startled and ran away. He was unable to command them or keep the box. He fell upon the pole, was dragged upon the ground for some time. A pistol, which he carried in his pocket, went off and by that singular good fortune which ever attended him, he was taken up without any considerable hurt or bruise.]Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

Remember this is my opinion and preference.\n\n50- Kano- Made In ManorGrime, weather to categorize it as a genre on its own, or a sub genre in hip hop, has become a scene that is constantly growing, and 2016 once again was a massive year for the UK acts.\n\nKano, hailed as one of the finding fathers of grime exerted his influence once again by delivering a strong release in March of 2016. Kano has proved to be consistent through his many years in the grime scene and this album does not disappoint. This album carries you on a journey through every corner of England, with the energy on tracks such as \u2018Flow Of The Year & \u2018\u2019New Banger\u2019\u2019 but Kano also varies his style with more introspective records such as \u2018Deep Blues\u2019\u2019.  One of three grime albums to make this list, it deserves its place with great validity.\n\nFavorite track: Flow of the Year featuring JME.\n49: Abz- Kosher AbzIn the era of the turn up, it is much harder to find an artist that a regular adolescent can relate to. It\u2019s even harder to find an artist that appreciates the older generation in terms of sonically implementing them into their own sound.\nAlthough this release has a consistent laid-back style nearly all the way through, it seems to get better track-by-track.  Abz is able to flow over jazzy and soulful instrumentals in a way that sounds almost effortless. Lyrically this project requires your full attention to fully appreciate Abz rapping through chapters in his story.\n\nFavorite track: 86\n\nFind the tape here: https://kosherabz.bandcamp.com/album/kshr\n\n\n48- Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein-Stranger Things Official Soundtrack (Vol 1)If you were a fan of this phenomenal Netflix TV show, listening to this soundtrack will increase your love for the show in another variable, not that you needed any more. It\u2019s special how music, through the ears, can make you relive those moments you observe, through the eyes, when binge watching the mystery of Will Byers.\n\nThe scorers Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein rightly ensure that the soundtrack is heavily 80s influenced in terms of production, just like the TV show itself.  A year that was not exactly blessed with plenty of quality soundtrack material, gladly, this helped shed a better light in that department.\n\nFavorite track: Kids\n47- PNL \u2013Dans le legendeNot much is known of this French duo, but their popularity is growing smoothly like a healthy child. Their mysterious nature is captivating audiences to get to know more about them, but their music is doing a lot of speaking currently.\n\nTheir melodies are something that will catch your attention as soon as you press play, combined with their melancholic song writing, PNL are making a exceptional track record for themselves in the French and international scene. Their first album set them up nicely as it made them breakthrough to the French audience, with radio hits such as \u2018DA\u2019 on this album, they have now made the top of charts theirs in France.\n\nFavorite track: Tu Sais Pas.\n46-Norah Jones- Day breaksIn times filled with technology taking over originality, Norah Jones is blessed with a wonderful natural voice that no technology could enhance any better. She has afforded herself the luxury to to dib and dab across genres in her career and she never allows herself to be boxed in or stagnant to one sound.\n\nThis freedom mentality carries on to her wonderful latest release. Day Breaks may not be an album filled with loud instrumentations or obnoxious production but the jazzy feel all over is strong enough to give this album so much life. Norah Jones as she almost always seems to do, does justice to the classical songs she covers and at the same time bring her own style in perfectly.  Topic wise, this album is not all about the romance life and one of the standout tracks \u2018\u2019Flipside\u2019\u2019 actually offers great commentary on social issues\n\nFavorite track: Don\u2019t Be Denied\n\n45-Noname- TelefoneIt may be quite surprising that the only new Chiraq rapper that has made this list isn\u2019t a rapper that totes the glock on the daily, well at least, not that we know off.  Slowly chopping away with quality features after features on other Chicago rappers such as Chance The Rapper and Vic Mensa, it was time Noname attempted to make a name for herself on the main stage.\n\nHer awkward, soft and intimate mixtape that is spread with jazz influence has definitely position Noname in a positive light as she progresses as an artist.\n\n\nFavorite track: Diddy Bop featuring Raury & Cam O\u2019bi\n44- Kery James- Mouhammed AlixIn case you didn\u2019t know, French rap is winning currently and with Kery James, we have the people\u2019s leader. The name of this album should be self-explanatory as to an indication of what\u2019s to come. Hard-hitting, rebellious and relentless are just a few words that you can use to summarize Kery James\u2019s seventh studio album, just like the late great boxer himself. For those unfamiliar with this name Kery James has stayed true to his powerful, politically & socially charged views from the start of his career. A man never afraid to speak his mind of every social issue he has encountered or he is witnessing (Check out Kery James x Bene- L\u2019Impasse) is a trait that continuous on this album. The major themes of this album are smartly balanced as Kery James opens up about his split personality, one that is the peaceful one, the other being the aggressive violent one.\n\n\u2018\u2019FDT\u2019\u2019 by YG 4hunnid may be the hottest politically charged record this year, but Kery James\u2019s sturdy \u2018\u2019Musique Negre\u2019\u2019 cannot go unmentioned in that conversation. This record is aimed at to a French politician who vowed to not allow Hip Hop music or black music to be played in the country if he gained the power, seeming to be not far from the seeds of Donald Trump. What makes this album even better is that Kery James just does not believe that rebelling and violence is the answer but on \u2018\u2019 Vivre ou Mourir Ensemble\u2019\u2019 over a calming beautifully laid production, he urges people to unite and work together to improve the way society and the higher powers treat certain races. Powerful album.\n\nFavorite track: Mohammed Alix\n43- Maren Morris- HeroThis record is deemed as a country record, but once you listen to it, you will be telling yourself its much more than just another country record.\n\nAs a fan of both Hip Hop & R&B, the influences and references appealed to my ears and this is groundbreaking for a country artist, let alone a female one. The production on records like \u2018\u2019Rich\u2019\u2019 which got a lot of radio play, may indicate that Maren Morris can be the pole stabbed into the country scene to direct everyone to the path country music is going to take from here on.  Morris already seems to have the audience on her side; the success of her singles proves that more people are accepting of this change as country music evolves.\n\nFavorite track: 80\u2019s Mercedes\n42- Aesop Rock- The Impossible KidNo not A$AP Rocky, Aesop Rock is a Caucasian rapper. One for the acquired taste, Aesop Rock is never going to be the majority\u2019s favorite rapper. No one would know this more than the man himself who is arguably the most abstract rapper around. The Impossible Kid is an album that makes my list for the same reason I rate Aesop Rock so high.\nFirstly, Rock\u2019s ability to play on words is constantly fascinating and listening to him can be compared to putting together a very challenging puzzle. By having so many projects out with this same tone, it was refreshing to see Aesop Rock tone it down   bit more on this release and instead he decides to open up personally more than ever. Once you get all the pieces of the puzzle together for the Impossible Kid, you will find Aesop telling you stories from his brother to his brand new cat \u2018\u2019Kirby\u2019\u2019.  His never-ending vocabulary enables him to draw you fictional pictures as you listen through and this is one of my favorite assets than an artist can posses, Aesop Rock has this in abundance.  It\u2019s easy to forget with what seems like so much hard work with words that Aesop Rock produces most of his tracks and those carry similar complexity to his world play.\n\nFavorite track: Lotta Years.\n\n41-$uicideBoys \u2013Radical Suicide (EP)Grimey, tough and eerie production is a full whenever this New Orleans act gets on the microphone, or jungle. This particular style and sound of music seems to be growing and gaining a pocket of hardcore fan base, along with Bones, these two acts give you a dark, drug filled feel but its very unlikely that there is anything more to them than that. The breath control and flow technics of this duo certainly is something to be applauded and get hyped about and this is an well put together exhibition EP of their skill set that I really found a liking towards this year.\n\nFavorite track: Goosebumps\n40: Weezer- Weezer (The White Album)One of the older alternative rock bands still active in 2016 definitely produced one of my favorite alternative rock albums of the year. Having previously left me underwhelmed in recent years with the quality of their albums, The White Album stands tall and proud above their previous efforts in the at least the last 6 years.\n\nThis album impressed me in many different aspects, notably, it seemed that the band have found the blessings in disguise of no longer having to compete with a larger pool of relevant alternative rock bands that aims to please a certain demographic and the mainstream radio ears. This has allowed the band to come out with a more likeable and intimate album for every true Weezer fan. Although a track like \u2018\u2019California Kids\u2019\u2019 displays sunny vibes like the California sun, most of the album features more heart felt revealing songs about the lead singer\u2019s personal life that is not usually associated with Weezer\u2019s catalogue.\n\nFavorite track: L.A. Girlz\n39-Vince Staples- Prima Donna EPFollowing Summer Time 06, NORF SIDE LONG BEACH rapper Vince Staples has risen a lot on everyone\u2019s radar.\n\nWith this EP, Vince Staples doesn\u2019t shy away from his creative beat selection and production. This very energetic project may get rather exhausting or hard to take everything in at first, but this is perhaps what Vince Staples was aiming for as he stretches his sound and experimentation. As soon as you hear the Andre 3000 sample in the early days of this record it\u2019s hard to stop head bopping throughout as \u2018War Ready\u2019 sets you up perfectly for that mood.\n\nFavorite track: Pimp Hand\n38- Mitski \u2013 Puberty 2Emotions are galore as Mitski takes us for a fascinating walk in her shoes.  The maturity and different dimensions in the voice of this 26-year-old indie rock singer is so phenomenal that you\u2019re left with little or no option but to gravitate to her.\n\nOnce you watch the music video to her award worthy track \u2018\u2019Your Best American Girl\u2019\u2019 you can see that Mitski has a very conceptual mind that reflects in the deepness of this album. One for the deeper meaning, this track is heavily influenced by her personal view that makes her even more endearing. If you\u2019re an individual that is suffering or has suffered from racial identity, this should be your go to album.\n\nFavorite track \u2018\u2019 Your Best American Girl\u2019\u2019\n37- Lil Yachty \u2013Lil BoatOn the subject of story telling, short story, Early this past summer, my guy Nnamdi got into my car and played a bunch of cartoon noises that I questioned if this was some sort of troll. A few weeks go by and there I was singing along to this bunch of noise that is titled \u2018\u2019Minnesota\u2019\u2019\n\nLil Yachty\u2019s whole make up is asking for you to hate on him, from his attention grabbing red hair to his mumbling auto tuned lullaby voice. This polarizing view puts Lil Boat in a unique stance, as there was nothing quite like this project in 2016.  We all enjoy turning up to Chief Keef and his off springs boasting about catching bodies and carrying glocks over trap and drill beats, but this year, we were introduced to the opposite. Yachty is unashamedly appearing rather innocent and softer as he mourns over his broken heart over more sophisticated trap beats. This project came at the perfect came as hip hop is slowly moving towards a more accepting nature when it comes to a way an artist chooses to express themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, a project like this will fall well short technically compared to the other projects on this list (E.g. Lil Boat reveled it took him less than ten minutes to finish the loving ballad \u2018\u2019One night\u2019\u2019) and this may work against him in the future. For now, its unpredictable how far Lil Yachty and his sound will stay around for but with features such as Broccoli, there are glimmers he could be the birth of the new sound, or he could just be another Fetty Wap and this time next year Lil Boat won\u2019t be on the sailing team.\nFavorite track: Good day featuring Skippa Da Flippa.\n36- Kevin Gates \u2013 IslahWhen Kevin Gates\u2019s Islah debut album went platinum, (barely any features by the way), many eyebrows were raised. Numbers don\u2019t lie though. Helped by the success of  \u2018\u2019Really Really\u2019\u2019 & \u2018\u2019 2 Phones\u2019\u2019 it seemed like Kevin Gates had finally found the recipe for radio and cross over success. Certainly took him long enough because Gates has been around for some time now without releasing a studio album.\n\nIslah, named after his daughter, makes for a very entertaining listen weather you were a Kevin Gates listener prior or a new listener.  You will enjoy the thuggish & savage rhyming along with the catchy melodic hooks that Kevin Gates has a skill for. He will never fail to make you laugh on social media or in interviews hence him being one of my favorite characters in the rap scene, but it was pleasing to see him back his talking with music that ended up being very successful. Free Kevin Gates!\nFavorite track: Pride\n35- 2 Chainz- ColleGrove.It\u2019s credit to 2 Chainz that he may have been well worthy of having at least two projects that he released in 2016 in this list. As ColleGrove was the only project officially released as an album, it\u2019s the more suitable pick.\n\nThe always-working TittyBoy with the help of a hungry Lil Wayne, were able to come up with viral tunes such as \u2018\u2019Watch Out\u2019\u2019 but with variety, as songs like \u2018\u2019Dedication\u2019\u2019 was more revealing than anything. This duo seems to have a very good chemistry between them as they trade witty, savage & hype bars over bumping trap beats. With production from the likes of Metro Booming, Zaytoven, Lil C & London on da Track, you should know what to expect.\n\nFavorite track: Not Invited.\n34- The Avalanches \u2013 WildflowerIt\u2019s been more than a decade since The Avalanches has giving the patient people a full-length project. So when the group finally teased the people with the release of \u2018\u2019Frankie Sinatra\u2019\u2019 and it stated that MF DOOM and Danny Brown were involved you already know my hip-hop senses were vibrantly tingling and my anticipation for what this neo psychedelic group would provide this time round when it came to a full album.\n\nNot many have better quality ears for music than The Avalanches, evidently this album is heavily sample based and not many are able to incorporate samples into their music as fitting and creatively as this group. This is guaranteed to be one of the more smoother albums released in 2016 that will give you a divine listen. Previously, this group has released much more rough and louder funk sounds but with this album, which has been in the works since 2005, was beautifully crafted for your ears.\n\n\nFavorite track: Because I\u2019m Me\n\n\n\n\n33: Maxwell:blackSUMMERS\u2019nightThis continuous installment of the Black Summer night is a household favorite already. Maxwell does not constrain himself in the R&B realm as he touches corners of Jazz and Soul with his fantastic vocal ranges. As one of the pioneers of Neo Soul, which he certainly does not get enough credit for, the neo soul and funk implementations into the production gives for such a exhilarating listening session.\n\nIf you were to just play the instrumentals of this album throughout you would satisfied let alone adding Maxwell\u2019s poet like song writing. His ability to flow and ride the different types of instrumentations on this album makes him one of, if not the best in his lane. There are not too many albums released in 2016 with better vocal performances than this very one.\n\nFavorite track: Lake by the Ocean.\n32- Ro James- El DoradoRo James was not on everyone\u2019s radar before the release of his debut album ElDorado, but the album by the \u2018\u2019bad boy of R&B\u2019\u2019 became a big statement in the R&B scene in 2016. Covered with quality material from start to finish, this easily became my favorite Male R&B record of the year.\n\nFollowing the release of his radio friendly song \u2018\u2019Permission\u2019\u2019, a song influenced by artists like Miguel and Prince with the extreme use of electric guitar, it proved to be a taste of what this album would offer. Ro James does not sound like every other upcoming R&B artist, which is to his benefit as he is able to create his own sound with hints of gospel, rock and soul.  This album is filled with catchy lines that are not easy to forget as Ro James shows off his songwriting abilities making him have a very successful year with potential for many more years to follow.\n\n\n31:  Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds- Skeleton TreeNick Cave\u2019s name is synonymies with topics of tragedies and other depressive symptoms, so it should serve as no surprise if an entire album is in that same lane.\n\nAlthough this may not be very appealing, its a fair warning that once you experience this album, you could be left in a very depressive & confused state, especially when you consider that Nick Cave went through an unfortunate passing of his son in 2015 and that is reflected in the material this band produces with Skeleton Tree.  You can almost feel the mourning in Nick\u2019s voice as he translates this into a number of tracks. In some weird fashion, It\u2019s amazing how we can still find beauty in such a gloomy and dark album as this.\n\nFavorite track: Skelton Tree\n30: K Roosevelt-Neon HazeContinuing on the very spacey vibe following Nick Cave, this album is on the other end of the spacey spectrum.  K Roosevelt is able to be more colorful and lively as he unfolds his emotions out on contrasting production.\n\nThere is no doubting of K. Roosevelt\u2019s ability to sing (Do Me Now has become one of my favorite songs over the past years), but he seems to have taken more time on perfecting his production and sound on this project this time around. Previously, Roosevelt would have just thrown the simple generic R&B production to sing over but the dedication was of much more abundance in Neon haze. The production is very electrically charged that throws you up on a euphoric experience accompanied by the smooth, moving vocals by K.\nFavorite song: Hello.\n\n\n29: A Boogie & Don Q- Highbridge the Label: The Takeover Vol. 1There has been a steady shift in powers for the past decade or so over the demographic face of hip-hop.  Well documented, It was held by the East and West for the majority of the 90s until the South finally stood up and grabbed hip hop by the scuffs and they have not let go since.  Although the East and West still influence and are producing the big names such as Kendrick and the A$AP & Flatbush movement, every other person in Atlanta may as well claim to be a rapper nowadays as they are the frontrunners and the tastemakers for what the hip hop culture pushes.\n\nAtlanta has had another great year providing us with newer trending names like Lil Yachty and 21 Savage while Migos and their off springs (E.g. Rich the kid) all continue to make new trends, weather it\u2019s a dance your Childs fourth grade teacher attempts (dab), or the flow everyone gets \u2018\u2019lit\u2019\u2019 to. It reached to the point that even one the hottest songs of 2016 (Panda) could have been performed by an Atlanta rapper and no one would question its origins. Since then of course, we\u2019ve all learnt that Desiigner hails from the streets of Brooklyn, no fault of his, but as a teenager all he is influenced by is Southern movement so unsurprisingly, his sound is going to be of that same root.\n\nBobby Shmurda and his shooters put New York back on the map for a brief period but that didn\u2019t prove long lasting. Recently with the emergence of Young M.A with \u2018\u2019Ooouh\u2019\u2019 and nation wide hit records like \u2018\u2019Don\u2019t Run\u2019\u2019 by Casanova, its safe to say that New York is making a much louder noise than it has in the past few years, deadass. The duo of A Boogie and Don Q is exactly what you\u2019d want modern day hip-hop duo to come equip with. A Boogie on the one hand carries the catchy melodic tunes that you want to hear in the club, and on the other hand Don Q, much more familiar to the past New York scene is filled with bars in his arsenal.\n\nEventually these two will go in their own paths once they have gained enough popularity and leg space in the hip hop game but their collaborative effort is something I hope to see more often in the future. New New York!\n\nFavorite song: Not a Regular Person\n28: Joe Budden- Rage & The MachineJoe Budden is character you either hate dearly or love. To say he had a troublesome 2016 would be an understatement. It was a year filled with controversies, from his critique of Drake\u2019s Views to his awkward \u2018\u2019beef\u2019\u2019 with Hot 97. Although his fan base thoroughly enjoys Joe Budden\u2019s love lost tales of all the women that have done him wrong, it was time for something different, something more than just \u2018break up\u2019 music.\n\nYou could sometimes forget that Joe has phenomenal ink game, but if he was lacking in that he would never be part of the machine that is Slaughterhouse. Clever lines like \u2018\u2019If Fetty (Wap) is the face of New Jerz, then you see how badly we needed I\u2019\u2019 on the opening track of his latest album reminds you that he can wash up any of his peer when it comes to wordplay. With one of my favorite beat makers by his side, Araab Muzik, this was bound to be Joe\u2019s most aggressive album yet. It proved to be that indeed but the Rage that Joe fueled for this album does fortunately not end up coming out forced but rather measured and assured. Taking the stance of one of the older statesmen in the game, Joey comes across more mature than ever but that edginess and hardness does not fade away either.\n\nFavorite track: I Gotta Ask.\n27: Little Simz- Stillness in WonderlandEven though this album came out pretty late in the calendar year, it still plastered itself on this list quite easily. There had to be something special to Little Simz that the likes of Stormzy, Kendrick Lamar and the mogul himself Jay-Z rate the London rapper so very highly. Little Simz\u2019s qualities as an artist are undeniably and her latest effort will only propel her to higher and bigger heights.\n\nThis album consists of Simz\u2019s roots of grime, R&B and a recurring role and jazz and soul. At only the tender age of 22, Little Simz has show great creativity in her music and she has the potential to grow into one of the most sought after artists in the industry. She can\u2019t only rap her ass off over a variety of beats \u2018\u2019Low Tides\u2019\u2019 but she also has singing abilities in a unique sound that she can claim to be her own style \u2018\u2019Doorways\u2019\u2019. She is definitely one to watch.\n\nFavorite track: King Of Hearts featuring Chip & Ghetts\n26: Nav- The Introduction.All you auto tune-dreaded codeine sipping trap soul impressionists better step up because you\u2019ve got company. The 6ix have thrown up a lot of different big names in the last few years and next up is the mysterious vibe prince Nav.\n\nFollowing the release of Birds In The Trap by Travis Scott, one of the better songs on the album was titlted \u2018\u2019Beibs In The Trap\u2019\u2019 and a lot of the plaudit has to go to Nav. Not many have heard of Nav before this feature, perhaps because he was mainly just another beat maker, but it\u2019s a definite that many were rushing to check out his Soundcloud account following that.\n\nAfter the success of a number of tracks he released on Soundcloud he had to do the growing audience some justice and provide some sort of a release, this came in the form of The Introduction, which was filled with stand out moments, namely the Metro Boomin produced track \u2018\u2019Up\u2019\u2019. It seems like Young Metro certainly trusts him as the success of Up has the most sought out trap producer right now announcing him and Nav have a project dropping soon. This could be the breakthrough moment for young Nav, if not, it would not be surprising to see Nav on a chorus of a big name record in 2017. Career wise, weather Nav decides to follow the footsteps of many before him by joining the higher powers of Toronto in the shape of the OVO or even The Weeknd\u2019s XO, or he decides to do his own thing, he certainly has the potential to have a big 2017\n\nFavorite track: Ten Toes Down\n25- DJ Khaled- Major KeyDJ Khaled was someone you could not avoid in 2016 and just like the character himself, his music releases is also something you cannot avoid, as he seems to run your social media. Mogul talk aside, every once in a while DJ Khaled will provide you with a song filled with star names you admire that you end up liking or at least finding decent. Major Key is DJ Khaled\u2019s best effort by far and that is obviously down to the artists he put together around this time.\n\nA DJ Khaled album can be compared to the NBA all-star games, star studded and entertaining for the highlight reel but with not much at stake. The first five songs on this album have great replay value, Jay-Z and Future start it right with the energy you expect the rest of the album to follow with \u2018\u2018I Got The Keys\u2019\u2019 followed by \u2018\u2019For Free\u2019\u2019 by Drake, it\u2019s a safe bet to predict that these records were going to blow which they did. One of the finest moments of this album comes in the shape of Nas delivering \u2018\u2019Nas Album Done\u2019\u2019, over a gorgeous broken down Fugees sample Nas does his best effort to preview his new material hopefully coming in the near future. Followed by Big Sean and Kendrick snapping in a Control part two in a lyrical onslaught, the album seemed to be heading into unbeatable territory, but of course, from that track onwards, the album losses its way and goes on a downward dip with many mediocre pieces. Overall, the first halve of the record is what allows this album to make this list.\n\nFavorite track: Nas Album Done\n\n24: Meek Mill- DC42015 was a tough year for Meek Mill to say the least and the early days of 2016 seemed to be going in the same directions, it was countless Ls after Ls. People wondered if it was over for the Philly trapper, but Meek Mill stayed in there showed some signs of life, noticeably on his 4/4 Part 2 EP \u2018\u2019War Pain\u2019\u2019 record. Although that record came way too late to repair any damage to his career it helped set Meek up to start a new chapter. I\n\nIt took Meek Mill three whole years to finally give the streets the fourth installment of the Dreamchasers tape. Instagram snippet after another, the people were getting impatient with the delays, It was just time to drop it, but at the same time it had to contain material that was worth the wait as Meek Mill had no ground for error.\n\nOnce you press play on the first offering \u2018\u2019On The Regular\u2019\u2019 and you hear the sadistic O Fourtuna intro and the gunshots, (hopefully not aimed at Beanie Sigel), you could tell Meek Milly was back on his bully, we could all rest easy again. On the feature list, Meek Mill is clearly keeping in tune with the new names in the scene by working with 21 Savage, Don Q and Desiigner adlibs for instance. The ingredients that make up Meek Mill don\u2019t go missing on this project, as he was full of up tempo energy, high-toned rapping, Wraith and Rolex talk. DC4 definitely continued the theme of the Dreamchasers series.\n\nFavorite track: Litty featuring Tory Lanez\n23: James Blake: The Colour In AnythingWhen Beyonc\u00e9 made the world stop by dropping \u2018\u2019Lemonade\u2019\u2019 and the track list listing featured James Blake, I couldn\u2019t have been the only one hoping for a Blake album in 2016.  The three-year gap was sufficient as the previous teaser album made his listeners wanting more.\n\nAfter a number of listens to the 17 track album, though you will appreciate James\u2019s intimacy and darkness, you\u2019re left feeling that many of the songs feel unfinished and at the same time rather lost, which could be the goal James Blake is aiming for, after all Blake does seem lost in the artwork.  Blake could be challenging the listener by leaving it to the imagination and the listeners\u2019 own interpretation of his story (Ironically what I happen to be doing now) Overall this album makes for a beautiful listen and Blake\u2019s ideology of not being simple make this piece of art worthy of a mention.\n\nFavorite Track: I Need a Forest Fire featuring Bon Iver\n22- Kweku Collins- Nat LoveIt would be interesting to see how many people have heard of this artist before reading this list. Credit should go to me if you decide to check him out.\n\nThis will be your project if you\u2019re a fan of unorthodox, intimate hip-hop. Full of melancholic vibes that Kweku Collins pockets himself to, Kweku is able to provide you with the way he sees the world in an interesting manner and perhaps in a way you never saw things before. His voice compliments the instrumentation that he usually produces himself and his flows come across rather drowsy but pleasantly, this project actually more live and bouncy than you would think, with elements of Neo Soul, Trap and Funk this young artist should be gaining way more attention than he has currently attracted.\n\nFavorite track: Nat\u2019s Intro\n\n\n21: Kamaiyah- A Good Night In The GhettoIf YG is a contender for the MVP of the west coast right now in the terms in the male category, Kamaiyah is equivalent in the female front. This was one of the projects of 2016 that many went into expecting little or nothing. Firstly because Kamaiyah was not a name people were familiar with. You could be quick to presume judging from the cover art and the title of the tape of expecting another female rapper talking about killing and violence wanting to be the female Ice Cube. If you did then you judged the wrong book by its cover. Instead what you get from Kamaiyah is her giving you fun and happy vibes over old G funk beats as she gave us one of the most fun going releases of the year. Don\u2019t get it twisted though as Kamaiyah still lets you know very clearly she isn\u2019t one to play with from time to time.\n\nHer contribution to YG\u2019s \u2018\u2019Why You Always Hatin\u2019\u2019 banger just added to her Ws collection this year and this is the album to go to if you are in need to get into the party mood. Kamiayah carefree attitudes will make her very likeable as she continues to grow as an artist.  IT\u2019S KAMAIYAHHHHH.\n\nFavorite Track: How Does It Feel\n20- Travis Scott- Birds In The Trap Sing McKnightTravis Scott may have taken his time in finding and committing to his own sound, but the long titled peculiar Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight can be the final evidence needed to show that he has finally reached that stage of his career. An album that continues to grow on you, songs like \u2018\u2019Beibs in the Trap\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019Through The Late Night\u2019\u2019,  \u2018\u2019Pick Up The Phone\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Goosebumps\u2019\u2019 were constantly prominent soundtracks for most group of youth friends, weather the setting was a party atmosphere or a chilled night.\nAs if this album needed any more reassurance in its merit to be on this list, Travis\u2019s Rodeo experience on stage performance should kick any doubters out of the picture, or stage. This was a show I was lucky to experience in 2016 and rejuvenated my love for the project.\nSide note: I weighed this album up against Kanye West\u2019s Life Of Pablo as I considered which of these two should make the final list, although the latter is not one of the worst albums of the year, it\u2019s a great accomplishment to Travis that he outclassed one of his biggest influences at least in my ears.\nFavorite track: Through The Late Night featuring Kid Cudi\n19-  Kayatranda- 99.9%This Montreal producer has been making steady groundwork to serve us with 99.9%. Kayatranda seems to be aiming to try everything out in this project and this may not make for a very cohesive listen but the stand out tracks make this project very worthwhile.\n\nThe blend between the dance electronic vibe and hip-hop influence channels Kayatranda musical taste and he is able to combine the two rather well into his producing output. This isn\u2019t the most captivating project of 2016, but after all, Kayatrnda is a producer that does not require you to use every single bit of your attention to still be able to enjoy his work.\n\nFavorite track: Glowed Up featuring Anderson Paak\n18: Royce Da 5\u20199\u2019\u2019- LayersIf you claim to be a fan of \u2018\u2019hip hop\u2019\u2019, do yourself a favour and listen to \u2018\u2019Tabernacle\u2019\u2019. This has instantly become one of my favorite hip hop songs in history that it goes up there Slick Rick\u2019s Children Story and Immortal Technique\u2019s Dance with the Devil in terms of story telling rap songs. Royce da 5\u20199\u2019\u2019 seems to be getting greater by age and he will most probably go down in history without getting the credit he deserves. He caters to his followers and his followers appreciate his abilities, and this album is up there with his best yet.\n\nLayers will position you to a point in life where you have the best perspective on the major things in your life, from money, family (he goes into detail about his son that suffers from autism and how he deals with that) and society. Beforehand, a younger Nickel would have solely provided you with clever punch lines after clever punchlines, even though you will be impressed, its even more impressive that he now carries the full package and the different layers, pun intended, of making a good quality song.\n\nWe can all agree that hip hop is in its most eccentric state, with all the melodic and exuberant tunes at the forefront, which is not a criticism or a negative factor because at the end of the day there is a time and place for every type of hip hop expression. Layers though, is an album that you sit down with and if you were lucky enough to grow up listening to conscience hip hop music you will find this experience the most valuable of them all. The importance of a superb pen game cannot be underestimated and Layers by Royce Da 5\u20199 is what made many of us fall in love with this genre in the first place.\n\nFavorite track: Tabernacle\n\n\n17- De La Soul- And The Anonymous Nobody\u2026Many most have thought they were dreaming when they heard that De La Soul were producing a brand new album in 2016. Filled with uncertainty weather the group would attempt to force their old sound in a much more evolved times, De La Soul were able to fusion the old and new together beautifully as they reminded everyone why they will always be one of the best music makers period. De La Soul were known to be different and more vibrant even in their heydays. Surrounded with violent Hip Hop groups like Wu Tang and NWA previously, De La Soul always decided to be themselves, even though they expected backlash and being often seen as softer or \u2018\u2019weird\u2019\u2019 in the 90s.\n\nThis album is excellently put as De La Soul keep some of their roots and old school vibe but they don\u2019t ignore the possibility of incorporating the newer sound into their production and live instrumentation. \u2018\u2019Whoudeeni\u2019, featuring 2 Chainz (who would have ever thought) is a perfect example of the overview of the album, with 2 Chainz rhyming on his usual topics over production he would not normally be accustomed to. Fair warning, this is not an album you can rush through but it requires active listening to understand the complete concept and for you to appreciate the complete package. De La Soul have made a huge impact on people\u2019s lives when they were in the forefront of hip hop and those same people still\n\nFavorite track: Memory Of\u2026(US) featuring Estelle & Pete Rock\n16- Giggs- LandlordIf Danny Brown has a distinctive voice, Giggs is in the same bracket. One of the most respected names in the grime scene, Giggs flexes and delivers one of the best grime albums of the year.  \u2018\u2019Lock Doh\u2019\u2019 became a hit record with Giggs flowing over at the simplest of flows and lyrics, but this banger, aided with his unique raspy voice, will get everyone around you hype. The lead single is the accurate representation of the album, banger after banger and material to play at full volume.\n\nFavorite track: Whippin Excursion\n\n\n15. Ab Soul- Do What Thou Wilt (DWTW)The consensus agrees that Beyonc\u00e9 carried the women empowering music in 2016 which should come as no surprise, but what is rather surprising is that an alternative Hip Hop version of women empowering album would come from none other than the TDE\u2019S black lip pastor Ab-Soul.\n\nAfter going dark for what seemed a while, people started questioning Soulo\u2019s place amongst his TDE peers. Even though he may be the wildcard of TDE, no one would question Ab-Soul\u2019s potential to produce an excellent album, so when he finally came out of the woods with \u2018\u2019Huey Knew\u2019\u2019 you knew something that was worth the wait was on its way.\n\nThis is a very abstract album, it makes you dissect everything starting with the title of the album for starter and his countless manipulation of words.\nThe album deserves loud credits as Soul may have only a small number of talking points, mainly women, religion and drugs but he manages to find a new way to be creative and not allow the listener to get bored. Soul\u2019s does tend to be confusing as he can be conscience and ignorant in the space of two songs, but this album comes out much more balanced than his previous releases.\n\nFavorite track: God\u2019s A Girl\n14-1975- I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of ItManchester is known to be one the most talented cities musically and this it continues to provide artists, bands especially, that go down in history as the greatest.\n\nAlthough that\u2019s a lot of pressure for the 1975 to live up to, if they continue to produce fantastic funky pop album like their 2016 release, they will create their own lane. With Matthew Healy\u2019s awkwardly beautiful voice accompanied with electrifying instrumentations this is one of the finest pop albums of the year.\n\nFavorite track: Somebody Else\n13: Lil Uzi Vert- Lil Uzi Vs The WorldLil Uzi is really the modern day charismatic rockstar in every sense. His first project Luv is Rage is not the easiest pill to swallow, but once the pills do kick in, you cannot get enough of his squeaky, high-pitched melodic voice.\n\nLil Uzi vs The world is not the most groundbreaking or creative project released in 2016, in fact it is very simple, it still makes for a much more enjoyable listen than the rest of Lil Uzi\u2019s \u2018\u2019mumble rap\u2019\u2019 peer\u2019s releases.  The production, by Maaly Raw, Don Cannon and Metro Boomin is as colorful as the artwork for the tape, with cuts like P & Qs sounding like the theme song for the next Cartoon Network show. This is nowhere near the hardest put together project this year but the lightness and the smooth transitions from track to track makes this a favorite of mine.\n\nFavorite track: You Was Right\n12: The Get Down- Official Soundtrack- Various artistsA TV show like The Get Down where music is the vocal point and theme desperately needed some sort of a soundtrack, and it got one that did justice.\n\nThe Get Down for those living under a rock is a show focused on the roots of hip-hop and the emergence of this art form, and although many attempts of this have fell short previously, this is by far one of the best attempts. For one, it actually takes you back and you almost forget you\u2019re not an Afro kid from the Bronx as you get invested in the show. The soundtrack itself features a mix of throwback songs like \u2018\u2019Bad Girls\u2019\u2019 by Donna Summer and a bunch of original well-crafted records. This is the same composer that worked on the fantastic Great Gatsby soundtrack therefore Baz Luhrmann\u2019s pedigree is well documented and he can definitely hold this soundtrack high amongst his collection. With wise heads like Nas by his side Baz was able to deliver one of the best soundtracks of the year.\n\nFavorite track: Zeke\u2019s Poem (I Am the One)\n\n\n11- Mac Miller-Divine FemineYou may play this Mac Miller\u2019s Divine Feminine and not realize that there is a change of track as the album follows the same theme in terms of production and topic wise all the way through. Oddly, this doesn\u2019t come across too terrible or underwhelming. This has a lot to do with how honest and perhaps vulnerable Mac Miller comes across on this album. Mac expresses his thoughts on relationships that are helped to come to live sonically with the pretty stunning jazz influence throughout. No better example than the lead single \u2018\u2019Dang\u2019\u2019 featuring Anderson. Paak\n\nJazz is seemingly the major production influence in current hip-hop albums, with Chance The Rapper, Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Paak carrying heavily jazz influenced projects to name a few. This is a pleasing pattern that the culture is pushing. The Divine Feminine could be categorized as one of the few love hip hop albums made and although this won\u2019t be an album to always play, when the time is right, this will get you in that cuffing season vibe.\n\nFavorite track: God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty featuring Kendrick Lamar\n10- Kendrick Lamar-Untitled Unmastered.PIMP PIMP, HOORAY! When your jam sessions make it into the album of the year discussion, you know you\u2019re in the elite. Kendrick\u2019s ear for music gives him the edge over his peers in my opinion. His jazz and funk influence seems to be getting greater by each year that it has almost become a trademark of his.\n\nUntitled Unmasetered came as a pleasant surprise. The always-kicking knowledge Kendrick continues to offer the people jewels and is grateful enough to allow us a peek of his vision of the world and its issues. There is no other project quite like it in this list and following To Pimp a Butterfly, this can be pinned in perfectly as either a tease for what\u2019s to come or an end to this sound for Kendrick as he continue to grow as a person and artist.\n\nFavorite track: Untitled 07 (2014-2016)\n9- Skepta- KonnichiwaWith a very strategic BBK team behind him, Skepta seems to be very detailed and strategic with every move he makes as an artist, perhaps due to him currently holding the baton for the grime culture, but his moves have helped him crossover internationally as he continues to do big shows across the world and be acquainted with the likes of Kanye West and Drake.  After a number of delays, Skepta finally gave us Konnichiwa this year.\n\nThis only negative critique this album may carry is that a number of the cuts such as \u2018\u2019Shutdown\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019That\u2019s Not Me\u2019\u2019 and a few more singles have been out for a year or even more so the quantity seemed lacking as the album only contained 12 tracks. Apart from that, everything else about the album is really well done. The grime influence is as heavy as it should, with aggression throughout on tracks like \u2018\u2019It Aint Safe\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019 Man (Gang)\u2019\u2019. Not one for the most complex of lyrics, Skepta is always able to spray simple bars with his signature delivery and flow over complex production. This makes for a beautiful sounding combination.\n\nSkepta is definitely the leader of grime now and his every move is in the microscope but where Skepta can go from here can be groundbreaking for the UK.\n\nSidenote: Seeing Skepta perform this album live made me appreciate the material even more and this moved the album higher in my ranks than initially.\nFavorite track: It Ain\u2019t Safe Featuring Young Lord\n8- Run The Jewels \u2013 RTJ 3Better late than never. It seemed like the year would close and EL-P and Killer Mike had decided that their third installment of the Run the Jewels frenzy would come out in 2017, but just a few days before the end of the year, out of the blue, it was made for digital download right in the mist of the festive period. There is not a better project to close 2016 off than this fantastic piece of work.\n\nFollowing 2016\u2019s frantic year in terms of racial divide and many other political and social issues, you needed the wise heads of this duo to provide some sense and guidance to everything on current affairs through sounds. It\u2019s hard to bring up a better duo in the hip-hop demography that have consistently dropped three back-to-back projects that have been this well received. It\u2019s big credit to the chemistry and understanding the two MCs have off each other. Their timing when it comes to rhyming as to when they trade bars or fill each other\u2019s spaces never seems congested or force, it rather comes out well timed and coordinated as the two rappers feed off each other\u2019s energy phenomenally. This is the closest album that represents the state of the political state of America and EL-P and Killer Mike\u2019s views are perspectives everyone can take something valuable from. In terms of production, this album is on another level, its safe to say Run The Jewels now have their own sound and that sound is generated by their high tempo nature and their energetic production and rapping. This would be the suitable candidate for riot music, but its also important to observe the finer details in terms of their artistry, the duo can leave you amazed at their abilities.\n\nI have only had a handful of days to sit down with this album and you may question weather it came too late to make it to this list, but I\u2019ll have to disagree and stand firmly that this album is one of the standout albums of the year.\n\nFavorite track: A Report To The Shareholder Kill Your Masters\n7 -Danny Brown- Atrocity ExhibitionAfter hating his high-pitched repetitive voice after the first listen, XXX may be in my top 5 favorite albums in the past 6 years and that immediately made Danny Brown a household name in my playlist.  The Pharcyde aside it was hard to compare Danny Brown close to anyone else, this made him really unique. Old was a rather disappointing follow up project to such but his continuous experimentation of his sound will always lead to some hits and misses.\n\nAfter going quite for a while Danny Brown provided us with \u2018\u2019Pneumonia\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Really Doe\u2019\u2019 as teasers of what to expect, extraordinary music. This is the most complex hip-hop album of 2016 along with Death Grips in terms of production. It ranges from harsh & tight progressions and percussions in the production to raw, weird but exciting pitched flows provided by Danny Brown.  His explosive delivery throughout gives for the most thrilling listens that will exhaust you at the end, anchored by material that is so compelling. Danny Brown does exceptionally well to put everything together into an album that comes across in some way cohesive.\n\nFavorite track: Golddust\n\n6:Death Grips- Bottomless PitIs this a bunch of noise or geniuses at work? That\u2019s the priceless question around Death Grips. Experimental hip hop finds it hard to state a claim in the hip hop genre and it seems like Death Grips are the most successful of the bunch currently. Everything about Death Grips is odd but that oddness is their biggest attraction and they seem to be trying to stretch oddness to its full width.  With Death Grips, you\u2019re never going to get the same project back to back so you almost have to come into the project with zero expectations, after all they are always experimenting.\n\nThey mixed up all the right potions this time around with the release of Bottomless Pit, which starts off with even heavier production than usual, even for Death Grips, which should be a feat that is pretty deafening aye. \u2018\u2019The Money Store\u2019\u2019 was ground breaking as it introduced Death Grips, but this project is even more ground breaking in terms of experimenting with all versions and dimensions of sound and how challenging the trio decided to push. It\u2019s impossible to miss the alienated production of eerie guitar strings to the extremely powerful bass and drums. In terms of experience, the fifth track on this album \u2018\u2019EH\u2019\u2019 allows for a breather as it\u2019s toned down ever so slightly but that doesn\u2019t last long as the following track flips you totally upside down into the Bottomless Pit, true definition of a roller coaster experience.\n\nOverall this is a very excellent project that has little faults and those faults should be allowed because of the risk Death Grips take in terms of experimenting with sound. Side note, I wonder what state a person would be after playing this album followed by Danny Brown\u2019s Atrocity Exhibition.\n\nFavorite track: Eh\n\n\n\n5- Denzel Curry-ImperialPutting water bottle flip challenges aside for a moment, Miami powerhouse Denzel Curry is now one of the more popular up and coming new artists. Imperial is one the albums that captivates you from the first play, as soon as Denzel Curry\u2019s energetic alien like rapping starts off, he immediately gravitates to you, but he is able to add hooks full of hype that will fill you with energy.  Although he may get pretty repetitive and it would be difficult to listen to the same loud, sophisticated flow over a full-length album it was tolerably as this was the first project many outside his ever growing fan base have heard from Curry.  He does even tone it down on \u2018\u2019\u2019Story No Title\u2019\u2019 & \u2018\u2019Pure Enough\u2019\u2019 where Curry is being introspective which is something that will be interesting to see more off, as he carries a lot of compelling stories about his life.\n\nThis is an impressive effort by Denzel Curry and it would be interesting to see if Curry can diverse some more. He certainly carries sensational flow when rapping that gives him an edge over his peers in that department. In fact, its almost sounds inhumane how relentless Denzel Curry flows and at the same time his delivery is consistent throughout. A machine.\nFavorite track: Knotty Head featuring Rick Ross\n4- Schoolboy Q- Blank Face LPBetter and better. This should be the synonymous with Q\u2019s discography and Blank Face continues the growing upwards curve as Q gave us one of the better hip hop albums of 2016.\n\nApart from Q\u2019s and Miguel attempt to emulate the hit groovy record \u2018\u2019Studio\u2019\u2019 from Q\u2019s first studio album Oxymoron, every other record on this album is a favorite of many. Gang banging and drug dealing is not something we all relate to but this album makes you feel like you\u2019re walking down the Figg Side streets with 40 of your hood comrades. Sonically, the psychedelic production throughout this album makes for a quite enjoyable trippy listen aided by the grimey vocals by Q. Content wise, it was wise that Q did not decided to tell us the same stories as Oxymoron, but instead he offers refreshing tales of his whole life, from a child born into the street life to becoming one of the most prominent hip hop names is present time.\n\nFavorite track: By Any Means\n\n\n3- Childish Gambino- Awaken, My LoveIn the sports world of cricket, an all rounder is one of the most coveted assets to posses. Having quality further helps this versatility to be valuable to the team. A cricket expert would throw you the names of Imran Khan or Andrew Flintoff as examples. In the world of art, the name Childish Gambino or Donald Glover would be a fair enough comparison. With the success of his new show, Atlanta, Donald was already receiving rave reviews for work he did on the new hit show. Music was put aside and not many were predicting any music for a while, especially with him hinting of retiring as a rapper. Childish Gambino decided to show case his versatility by giving the people the most diverse album in his catalogue. With the success of Grammy Nominated Because Of The Internet, it was always interesting to see how Gambino would follow up. With Awaken, My Love, he followed up brilliantly, but in a whole different road. Because Of The Internet, despite it being a concept album, would still be in the Hip Hop category, but Gambino\u2019s latest album can be anything but hip hop. With heavy funk and soul production by his long time friend Ludwig, Gambino has made one of the best modern day funk album. With outstanding vocals, which was always present in his previous albums, Donald Glover sounds much more mature and enlightening than talking about being the awkward rich kid. The production on this album is something that should carry the biggest praise about this album and this is another moment that Donald is able to prove that his talents range across many many areas of entertainment\n\nFavorite track: Redbone\n2:Solange: A Seat at The TableIf this is your favorite album of the year, there hardly any reason to argue with that preference. The impact this album alone had speaks volumes of phenomenal piece of art Solange was able to deliver. Along with her sister, A Seat at The Table was the talk of the towns for a long duration of 2016.\n\nIt will be easy to compare Lemonade and A Seat at the Table for obvious reasons, but the latter detailed the Black American culture in a much more gorgeous and understandable fashion. Solange\u2019s angel like innocent voice accompanied by the neo soul, R&B production sound makes for the most soothing of listens. Solange is able to come across laid back while she touches on heavy political and personal topics from police brutality to racial issues. This is outstanding and works wonders as her message and words come across very powerful, loud  & clear.  With Master P helping narrate and put the pieces of the album together, songs like \u2018\u2019Cranes in The Sky\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Don\u2019t Touch My Hair\u2019\u2019 are one of the best records that have been made in years. This album is even more sensational as at the start of the year, no one would have predicted Solange to have the stand out year that she ended up having. Fully deserved.\n\nFavorite track: Don\u2019t You Wait\n\n\n1: A Tribe Called Quest- We Got It From Here... Thank You 4 Your ServiceWith rumors of members not getting alone and the unfortunate passing of Phife Dawg, the world was left thinking that was the last nail to the Tribe Called Quest album coffin cabinet, in the sense that we would never live to see another project by A Tribe Called Quest. So when murmurs of the group releasing a brand new album emerged, it was suddenly one of the best news the year would witness. Similarly to De La Soul and their hiatus, it was impossible to predict what a Tribe album would sound like in 2016. Was it going to be forced? Was it going to sound outdated? What\u2019s a Tribe album without Phife? These were many of the keen questions surrounding this album.\n\nThe answer to all those questions were simply answered by \u2018We Got It From Here\u2026 Thank You 4 Your Service\u2019\u2019. This album wastes no time in making a first impression, with the opening track \u2018\u2019The Space Program\u2019\u2019, as soon as the voices of Q Tip and Phife Dawg emerges with \u2018\u2019It\u2019s time to go left and not right\u2019\u2019 and that booming production comes through, you\u2019re just left in awe followed quickly by the nostalgic feels of the old Tribe. Not only does Tribe easily have mine and many others favorite album of the year, they take my favorite song of the year too with \u2018\u2019We The People\u2019\u2019 the drums in the production hit you so hard, combined with the trios views on the current state of America with race tensions. This could not have been more perfectly timed. Its exceptional that Tribe managed to reinvent themselves many years later but they still manage to give you the Tribe Called Quest feeling of the 90s.\n\nThis album is very special, there are so many layers to the sound and the message that Tribe are providing that the listener will continue to catch on new things after every listen. With actual Phife verses, it\u2019s very hard to find a detail on this album to criticize.\nEvery feature on the project did not seem out of place. Tribe take us on a time travelling trip, from the 90s dungeon dragon Busta Rhymes to Andre 3000 and Q Tip trading bars like it\u2019s a heaven match. And if Tribe were to feature one of the newer school rappers, it had to be Kendrick Lamar. This is an album that will become timeless.\n\nFavorite track: We The People\n\nWorthy mentions that missed out\nKanye West- Life of Pablo\nYG- Still Brazy\nKid Cudi- Passion, Pain & Demon

one day in the Rockies\nWhere the night air tasted like wine\nThe winter was hard and had me starving\nWhen the two of them found me in time\n\nThen one night I crashed north of Reno\nI'd been on the road too long\nThen I woke to the warmth of her fire\nAnd the sweet welcome home of his song\n\nIt was the California Kid and Remo\nLending me a helping hand\nIt was the California Kid and Remo\nTeaching me to love\nAnd teaching me to live off the land\nI thanked them and headed for Oregon\nThe trees were the walls of my home\nBut the rain soaked my bones every morning\nAnd the chill made me feel more alone\n\nAnd just when I thought I should end it\nThe world didn't need men like me\nMy mind heard the song of my two friends\nAnd the sun started shining on meYou might also

on the beat box goin' that\nFlash was on the beat box goin' that\nFlash was on the beat box goin'\nAnd, and, and, and\nSha-na-na\n\n[Verse 1]\nItalian, Caucasian, Japanese\nSpanish, Indian, Negro, Vietnamese\nMC's, disc jockeys\nTo all the fly kids and the young ladies\nIntroducing the crew ya got to see to believe\nWe're one, two, three, four, five MC's\nI'm Melle Mel and I rock it so well\nAnd I'm Mr. Ness because I rocks the best\nI'm Rahiem in all the ladies' dreams\nAnd I'm Cowboy to make ya jump for joy\nI'm Creole, solid gold\nThe Kidd Creole playing the role\nDig this, we're the Furious Five plus Grandmaster Flash\nGiving you a blast of sho'nuff class\nSo to prove to ya all, we're second to none\nWe're gonna make five MC's sound like one\nYa gotta dip dip dive, so-so-socialize\nClean out your ears and then open your eyes\nAnd then pay at the door as a donation\nTo hear the best sounds in creation\nHe's a disco dream of a mean machine\nAnd when it comes to size, ya see what we mean\nYa see his name is not found in the hall of fame\nBut he'll shock and amaze and make ya feel shame\nHe takes a lime from a lemon\nA-from a lemon to a lime\nHe cuts the beat in half the time\nAnd as sure is three times two is six\nYou'll say Flash is the king of the quick mix\nWe're five MC's and we're on our own\nAnd we're the most well known on the microphone\nAnd we throw down hard and we aim to please\nWith finesse to impress all the young ladies\nWe got rhymes galore and that's a fact\nAnd the satisfaction guaranteed to cause a heart attack\nWe are the best as you can see\nSo eliminate the possibility\nThat to be an E-M-C-E-E\nIs not a threat to society\nSay step by step, stride by stride\nI know the fly young lady would like to ride\nIn my Mercedes, young ladies\nMy Mercedes, young ladies\nIf my Mercedes break down and dog my grill\nI will-a drive up in a new Seville\nIf my Seville break down, I'll take it on back\nI will-a dog my grill in a new Cadillac\nMy Cadillac break down, I'm just too much\nI will-a shock your mind in a new Star Stutz\nAnd if a Stutz break down, I'll make another choice\nI will-a dog my grill in a new Rolls Royce\nAnd if my Royce break down, I'll be out in the rain\nAnd then forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it\nForget it, huh, take the train\nTake the train, take the train\n[Interlude]\nCan't, won't, don't stop, rockin' to the rhythm\n'Cause I, I get down, 'cause I, I get down, 'cause I, I get down\n\n[Verse 2: Kidd Creole]\nLadies who don't know my name\nAnd you fellas who don't know my game\nYes, I'm called the prince of soul\nBut others call me The Kidd Creole\nThe MC delight, young ladies bite\nWhen I'm on the mic, I rock the house right\nI'm the dedicated prince, heart of solid gold\nRockin' to the rhythm while I'm playing the role\nA cool calm customer, the master plan\nIt takes a sucker's man to try to jump my hand\nAnd the things I do and what I say\nAffect a lot of people in the strangest way\nMakes them clap their hands and say \"Alright\"\nIt's Creole to the broad daylight\nMr. Ness, my mellow, what it look like\nWhen ya on the mic?\n\n[Verse 3: Mr. Ness]\nLet's a rock y'all, a let's a rock the house\nBecause the Furious Five are gonna turn it out\nSo young ladies, if you think ya heard\nYou heard the best rap, you heard the best word\nYes, it's true that we got the fuss\nBecause it can't be the best unless it came from us\nThere's five of us and we take no stuff\nWe coming through the city, we coming through rough\nWe number one ain't nothin' you can do\nAnd if you wanna get down, we'll rock you too\nSo free-formin y'all, you don't stop\nCome on, come on and let me see-a rock rock\nCowboy, they say you're from the Bronx\nSo why don't you rock the beat and add a little spunk?\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Cowboy]\nYes yes, y'all, ya don't stop\nA-come on fly girls, I wanna hit the top\nI am the C-O-W-B-O-Y\nWhy the man so bad that ya can't deny?\nYou better watch your woman 'cause I'll tell you why\n'Cause I'm Cowboy, I might give her a try\nThey call me Keith-Keith the young ladies' relief\nKnow as the man of romance and make you dance\nCan any of you ladies stand a chance?\nI'm Cowboy and I'm shockin' the house, you see?\nYa say one, two, one more is three\nA-Melle Mel, come on, now what ya got for me?\n\n[Verse 5: Melle Mel]\nTo the hip hop, a hip hop, a-don't stop\nA-don't stop that body rock\nA-just get up out your seat and get ready to clap\nBecause-a Melle Mel is starting to rap\nAnd ever since I talked at my very first party\nI felt I could make myself somebody\nIt was something in my heart from the very start\nI could see myself at the top of the chart\nRapping on the mic, making cold, cold cash\nWith a jockey spinnin' for me called DJ Flash\nSigning autographs for the the young and old\nWearing big time silver and solid gold\nMy name on the radio and in the magazine\nMy picture on the TV screen\nIt's ain't like that yet, but, huh, you'll see\nI got potential and you will agree\nI'm coming up and I got a step above the rest\n'Cause I'm using that ladder they call success\nYou say a-one, two, three, four, five,

of a gun with the hell of a fire\nFly girls that mess around, I'll take ya all higher\nMy clientele climbed a great big boost\nI'm to give it up and turn it loose, huh\nAll you fly girls that don't know my game\nCome up and talk to me and we'll tell you all the same\nWhen ya wake up in the night in a hell of a dream\nYou know ya been possessed by the voice of Rahiem\nIn all the ladies' dreams\n\n[Verse 7: Melle Mel]\nAnd makin' more currency than any MC\nAnd the dream will turn to reality\nAnd Melle Mel'll be makin' money\nMr. Ness, make-makin' money\nRahiem, makin' money\nCowboy, make-makin' money\nA-Creole, makin' money\nDJ Flash, make-makin' money\nHit it\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Verse 8]\nTake the time and you will agree\nThat Black Door got good security\nSo when you walk through the door, just do me a favor\nBe sure to be on your best behavior\nYoung man, what do you wanna do\nWhen the party is through\nAnd a young lady wanna go home with you?\nYou search your pocket, ya soon aware\nThat you don't have enough for cab fare\nThen you say to yourself what a mistake ya made\nYour heart start pumpin' that ol' Kool-Aid\nWhen she walks to you and she starts to say\n\"Call One-Double-O, he's down with O.J.\"\nAnd you pay the way\n\n[Verse 9: Kidd Creole]\nYoung ladies a-like, young ladies galore\nYoung ladies we do adore\nFrom the way they move and the way they smile\nIt makes me admire their grace and style\nThere is not room for disbelief\nThat's the only way that The Kidd Creole can relieve\n\n[Verse 10: Mr. Ness]\nOr rock the house\nI'm a Scorpio and I will not flow\nI need ten fly girls before I go\nNow when the night is done\nYou come and get some\nThen you meet Mr. Ness and you have some fun\n'Til you walk up real soon\nAnd you head for my place and when you get in my room\nYou touch my face and then you start to chase\nAnd then you grab em' by the waist\nAnd then I lay you right back, I'm on a steady pace\n\n[Verse 11: Cowboy]\nI'm the only go of the rodeo\nYa say I ride in the rain 'til it's time to go\nI'm the buckaroo of the boogaloo\nAll the young ladies roll when he pass through\nI got two jazzy ladies in deep, deep check\nBoth ladies in the discotheque\nI got one in the front and one behind\nI'm in the middle 'cause they're both mine\n\n[Verse 12: Melle Mel]\nA-yes, yes, y'all, you don't stop that body rock\nFrom the shores of California to the streets of New York\nAin't nothing sweeter than ya walk except the way you front\nYou got hair everywhere, skin so fair\nA dynamic personality, a lot of flair\nWith your flashy clothes and your photogenic pose\nYou're as sharp as a thorn on the stem of a rose\nSo petite and elite you're, huh, too sweet\nSo great I'm amazed that you can't be beat\nThe way you swerve your curves, it really wrecks my nerves\nYou're everything that a man deserves\nSo women of the world, amen to thee\nBecause women like you make men like me\n\n[Verse 13: Raheem]\nYes, yes, y'all, you don't stop\nCome on, come on, huh, I wanna hit the top\nYoung ladies out there I won't be surprised\nIf I catch you watchin' or starin' in my eyes\nCome a little closer and you're sure to find\nThat I'm a hell of a fella and I'm one of a kind\nIf you happen to stare for just about a hour\nYou sweet young thing, you'll be in my power\nDon't fight the feelin', it's nothin' you could do\nExcept watch your back (Huh), 'cause I'm gonna pursue\nIf you think that you can't contain yourself\nWell, put all the silly games right up on the shelf\nCome here, ya sexy figure, tell ya what I'm gonna do\nI got a hell of a proposition just for you\nGonna stick the lovin' to ya, baby, later for a kiss\nIf you pass the chance up, you know you just missed\nBeyond the shadow of a doubt, or anything you can believe\nIf you so deep in the forest that you can't see the trees\nCreole, my mellow\nIt's on you so what you gonna do?\n\n[Verse 14: Kidd Creole]\nYou say I rock the house, make other MC's run\nPlace a bet with this devil, cheat 'em for a hun'\nCon any con man with bat or bowl\nI go by the name of The Kidd Creole\nI'm the king of finesse, I'm here to rock the rest\nAll the young ladies I wanna impress\nWhen I rap on the mic, I guarantee\nA certain amount of consistency\nLike Flash we'll cut the record to the bone\nCreole will rock on the microphone\nMr. Ness, my mellow\nCome and get some 'cause we're number one\n\n[Verse 15: Mr. Ness]\nDon't stop y'all, a-let me see ya rock\nWe gonna rock to the sounds around the clock\nWe gonna move to the beat, but don't you dare stop\nCome on everybody, stop playin' around\nBecause you got to get up so we can get down\nUnless you too hot to trot and not ready to rock\nCome on-on and dance and give me what you got\nBecause you know by now you got to give me something\n'Cause after all, you sweeter than honey\nGet down on your behalf\nBecause you gotta do it do for your calfs\nA-Cowboy, they say you from the Bronx\nSo won't you rock and add a little spunk?\n\n[Verse 16: Cowboy]\nYes, yes, y'all, you don't stop\nA-come on girl, let's hit the top\nLike a .357 pointed towards your head\nCowboy just about ready for the bed\nSo pull back the covers and take down your pants\n'Cause Cowboy will make you Patty Duke dance\nA side to side and you pat ya foot\nGet up out ya seat, then you shake your butt\nYou say one, two, one more is three\nA-Melle Mel, come on, what you got for me\n\n[Verse 17: Melle Mel]\nYou don't stop that body rock\nThey say a child is born with no state of mind\nHe's blind to the ways of mankind\nGod is smilin' on you, but he's frownin', too\nBecause only God knows what you'll go through\nYou'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate\nYour eyes will sing a song of deep hate\nThe places you play and where you stay\nA-looks like one great big alleyway\nYou'll admire all the number-book takers\nThugs, pimps, and pushers, they're the big money makers\nDrivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens\nAnd you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh\nSmugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers\nPickpocket, peddlers, even panhandlers\nYou say, \"I'm cool,\" huh, \"I'm no fool\"\nBut you'll wind up droppin' outta high school\nNow you're unemployed, all non void\nWalkin' around like you're Pretty Boy Floyd\nTurned stick-up kid, and look what you done did\nGot sent up for an eight year bid\nNow your manhood is took, you're a Maytag\nSpend the next two years as a undercover fag\nBein' used and abused, served like hell\n'Til one day you was found hung dead in a cell\nIt was plain to see that your life was lost\nYou was cold and your body swung back and forth\nBut now your eyes sing the sad, sad, song\nOf how you lived so fast and died so young\nSayin', one, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nRap like hell and make it sound like heaven\nSeven, six, five, four, three, two, one\nNow come on Raheem, a-come and get some\n\n[Verse 18: Raheem]\nYes, yes, y'all, you don't stop\nC'mon, c'mon, c'mon and let me see you rock\nI'm only five-foot-nine, you think I care?\nI can pull a girl from anywhere\n'Cause I'm bubblin' 'round, just the talk of the town\nWhen they talk about me, they don't dare frown\n'Cause I'm too hot to trot, to cold to walk, uh\nTo all the fly girls, I'm aimin' to talk\nTo all the fly girls, you got to beware\n'Cause Raheim, huh, will be in yo' hair\nJust come on to the roast and listen to me\nBecause everybody knows Raheem is what it be\n\n[Outro]\nMelle Mel (Bang), rock the house (Pow)\nCome on, help me turn it

And God made them go like...\nBeautiful titties, all shapes, sizes and women running they are going...\nAnd then they hit a breeze and chicken's done!\nYeah, baby!\nThese are not like the tits in Vegas,\nwhere even God goes: \"I didn't make those!\"\nFake tits are like Nazis.\nThey don't laugh, they don't dance, they're just...\nI'm walking here!\nI've seen a woman turn and the tits stayed there.\nIt's like they don't have any teeth because they knock them out.\nI've seen tits that are really bad\nwith the nipples on the top.

Do it for your daddy man.\nAnd you say: \"OK, daddy man!\"\nThan I want you to get your balls done for me, OK ?\nI want you to get those big old basket balls.\nSo when you do the Baywatch thingy, it's like...\nNothing drives a woman crazy like a big old Easter basket on her bunny.\nYou go to the doctor...\nGirls...\nPayback's a bitch !

We're working our way through.\nAll over the country we've got weird things.\nIn Houston they got Enron field.\nWe're gonna call it  fifth Amendment for you.\nWe can't call it: \"We're fucked for you!\"\nArthur Anderson put in the chairs that spin both ways.\nAnd now Martha Stuart may become somebody's bitch.\nNo!\nSay it ain't so!\nI like to consider it more like \"severed companion\".\nIf you only have one room, and I like to call it my \"private space,\"\nuse the light well. You have vertical bars, don't use horizontal blinds.\nAlso, think of your ankle bracelet as an accessory.\nThe first time she has lunch going: \"You call this quash?\"\nShut up, bitch!

They won't pitch to him\nand when they do it, they're trying to kill him.\nHe's like Yasser Arafat of baseball.\nFor Jerusalem I have an interesting plan.\nIt's called a timeshare, like Miami, let's try that.\nJews will get Hanukkah and Passover,\nChristians will get Christmas and Easter\nand Muslims will have Ramadan and the other holiday, Kaboom.\nObviously, the people of HBO are going \"Oh, fuck off.\nWhat are you doing, you asshole.\"\nI'm very excited because this is my time\nwhen I was watching World Cup Soccer, my man.\nI saw world cup, baby.\nThere's a few soccer fans, the rest of you are going:\n\"Uh, that's like football without pads, right?\"\nFor the rest of the world, it's football.\nFor us, it's \"A strange sport, played by damaged people.\"\nWe made it in the World Cup. Everyone plays it.\nNot like the World Series, 'cause the French don't have a baseball team.\nIf they did, they would only have left field and no one would be safe.\nYou know what I'm saying?\nWhat can you do, huh? It is Bastille day, alore.\nThe day that Marie Antoinette gave the ultimate head. Look out!\nWe are French. Fuck you, Americans, I don't care!\nMy friend Lance Armstrong is racing right now in The Tour du France.\nAnd every year the French go, \"He is on chemicals.\"\n\"It's chemotherapy, you little toad suckers.\"\nOkay, he has one testicle, he's aerodynamic.\nEveryone, cut off your balls.

I got a ball. I kick the ball!\nUnlike the Brazilians. When they play is like...\nAnd the fans...\nBrazilians are going: \"Look, I'm playing soccer...\nLook, I'm scoring!\nAnd now I'm kicking the ball.\"\nSoccer is kinda mellow, you know. Is a little passive aggressive though.\nI didn't do anything... What are you looking at?\nIt's not like hockey, when someone comes up with a stick and goes:\n\"Bang, mother fucker!\"\nThat's why there are no Spanish hockey players.\nWhen a white guy takes a stick and goes...\n\"Motherfucker, I'm going to cut you off now!\"\nAnd you, Freddie Krugger bitch, take off the mask, mother fucker!\nComing in there! Katami!\nSometimes guys do this weird thing... They fall down and pretend like...\nI've been killed... I've been blinded...\nThere's nobody near me, huh? OK, I'm kidding!\nAnd the referee comes over: \"Yellow card!\"\nTwo yellow cards. \"Red card!\"\nThree cards. \"Green card!\"\nAnd the referee is so sweet, too.\n\"What's your name? Turn around.\nWhy didn't you call me after the Mexico game ?\nNot like football referees: \"Too much commercial time\"\nMad white man dancing on the field.\nMoving away. Moving away.\nIn the World Cup they always claim there's bad refereeing,\nsomeone may have been paid off.\nOh, shit, say it ain't so!\nYou're telling me that the Oscars are also political?

That's the Clinton money!\"\nNext is gonna be Joey Butafuoco fighting John Wayne Bobbit.\nThere will be no hitting bellow the belt there, my friend.\nFuck, man, give it back! My balls are in the front row.\nWhat's next? The Nixon's daughters belt for the library money.\nBe there as my bitches go at it.\nAt this point, even Caligula is going:\n\"What the fuck are you people doing?\"\nWhy don't you have Hannibal Lector and Iron chef\njust kick out the jams?\n'Cause you got the chamber, the chair, fear factor.\nPeople in Texas are going \"We got those shows.\nWe just don't film them.\"\nTwo weeks ago, Supreme Court banned the execution of retarded people.\nPeople in Texas are going, \"Shit, where's the fun in that?\"\n'Cause they were zapping retarded people every other week.\nIt was like, \"Go sit on Santa's lap, Timmy.\"\nAnd I know the definition of \"retarded\" in Texas is pretty wide.\nIt's crazy!\nEven a Taliban is going: \"You are crazy mother fuckers!\"\nThere was a guy with one leg. They wouldn't gonna give him a wooden leg.\nHe's gonna be dead man hopping.\nThere's a moment of compassion. Before the lethal injection,\nthey do an alcohol swab. Which is so nice!\nWhat the fuck are you doing?\nWe don't want you to get that last second infection!\nIt's all safe now.\nYou remember the Winter Olympics. They had them in Utah. Great place!\nWhat, was Amish country booked, what happened?\nCommon down to Salt Lake! We're gonna party like it's\n.\nBring your wives. Oops!

They're only a couple in Arkansas.\nIf you're going to Georgia, Ted Turner and Jane Fonda broke up.\nJane found God and Ted found out it wasn't him.\nAbout the Olympics once again,\nwe're talking about the figure skating.\nI find the figure skating to be kinda sexy.\nNot ice dancing, which is polka on Valium. That's not good.\nThat's that pair figure skating. There's one very special lift.\nWhere the male skater goes...\nRight here!\nWhere even a gynecologist would go: \"Put on a glove, man!\"\nWho's your daddy? Who's your daddy?\nAnd I'm going: \"Let's cut the foreplay,\nlet's have ice fucking, come on!\"\nNipples aroused...\nAnd she holds on without her hands!\nEven the French judge would go: \"I like it!\"\n\"I don't care. I'm giving them the medal. Fuck the Canadians!\"\n\"So fabulous!\"\nThere's other kinda sexual thing in the Olympics: the luge,\nabout which I have only one question:\nwhat drunken, German gynecologist invented this sport?\nWhat guy went, \"I want to dress like a sperm,\nshove an ice skate in my ass,\nand go balls first down an ice chute.\nYa. That would be fun.\"\nNo! This is for pussies!\n- How will you stir? - I will do Kegels!\nI will flex my ass and go down the aisle.\nAnd do not talk to me about two men luge.\nI'm saying \"Boys, get a room!\"\nMake that turn, you bastard, make it.\nHard right, you fucker, hard right!\nPour guy gets to the end of the run: \"I got wood, man, I'm sorry!\"\nYou cost us the race!\nYour penis going brr was\nof a second winds resistance!\nWe could've won if you weren't going brrring!\nDolphin boy!\nThere's always some horrible drug scandal.\nThis year was a Spanish cross-country skilor...\nSkilor, which is like a skier.\n- Are you a skilor? - Yes!\nThey accused him of taking some performance enhancing drug.\nLike an elephant growth hormone.\nAre you on some sort of drug?\nAre you taking an animal tranquilizer?\nAnd they didn't bother drug-testing the snowboarders.\nGo, go my little boys, have fun!\nI guess they realized the word \"half pipe\" meant something.\nRemember the kid who won the gold medal?\nHe was in freestyle.\n- You wanna be on a box of Wheaties? - No. Count Dracula.\nAha, a clue, Sherlock!\nThe poor Canadian snowboarder, in\nOlympics,\nthey took away his medal because he tested positive for marijuana,\nwhich is kinda redundant number one.\nNumber two, they said that marijuana was a \"performance-enhancing drug\".\nMarijuana enhances many things, colors, tastes, sensations,\nbut you are certainly not fucking empowered.\nWhen you're stoned, you're lucky if you can find your own goddamn feet.\nThe only way it's a performance-enhancing drug is\nif there's a big fucking Hershey bar at the end of the run.\nThen you'll be like...\nThen you'll be like a Swiss ski jumper going, \"I'm there!\"\nPour Canadian snowboarder. They asked for his medal back\nand he couldn't find it.

First was your president, who's a cretin\".\nQuebec is going to break away from Canada, but still keep the currency.\nIt's like a kid moving out of the house,\n\"but I still would like to get money\". Fuck off you!\nCanadian money is also called \"the Looney\".\nHow can you take an economic crisis seriously?\n- The Looney is down! - Oh, how sad for you!\nWhat are you saying, eh?\nEveryone was so happy that at the Olympics the security was so tight.\nSecurity was amazing at the Olympics.\nYou chose the whitest fucking State in the Union!\nAn Arab in Utah is like an albino at the Apollo. You would notice!\n- I found one! - It's just Ted. Everybody out!\nThe problem was that there was basically white powder everywhere.\nAll the dogs looking for Anthrax were going:\n\"You go, man, you go!\"\nPour dogs they looked for Anthrax and cocaine.\nIn the cage at the end of the day they're going:\n\"I can't taste my ass, I don't know why?\"\n\"It's my tail!\"\nMeanwhile your cat sits over there going:\n\"You're still an asshole, you know that\".\nIs it me, or are cat's drag queens?\nThe way they kinda go: 'Who loves Kitty?'\n\"Are these your shoes?\"\nWho loves Kitty?

Mine now!\"\n- What are you doing? - Just shopping!\nThe whole Anthrax thing had people going...\nThey said: \"Don't open your mail!\"\n- Why? - There's white powder in envelopes.\nReally?!\nYour mother and I used to look for white powder in envelopes.\nWe weren't on-line. We did lines, my friend.\nAnd there were ninjas on the fucking line, trying to kill us.\nAnd now, there are people trying to kill us.\nAnd that's why I bought a gas mask.\nI can't even get a condom on when I want to!\n\"Hey, baby. Yeah, I got a love glove. Hold on.\"\n\"I'll be right with you, honey.\"\n\"Don't go away on me now.\"\nYou're playing \"Beat the cock\".\n\"I got it, I got it!\"\nThere's your penis like a midget in a diving suit...\n\"I don't think we're going in today, Pete.\nWe didn't make the deadline.\"\nRemember when they sent Anthrax to Tom Daschle's office?\nAnd they cleared that fucking place out.\nEverybody out, come on! Helmets, suits, they're all leaving.\nAnd when the Congressman walked out they go:\n\"But the rest of you, go about your lives.\"\n\"Everything is perfectly OK.\"\n\"We'll be miles away.\"\nIt's like when you go to the dentist and he puts a shit over your balls.\nHe walks behind concrete, going: \"You'll be fine!\"\nHow can you tell if Congress was sick?\nIt's night of the living dead anyway.\nAll those old senators going:\n\"The confederate flag is just the symbol of states' rights.\"\nYeah, and the swastika is just a good luck charm.\nWhen did Ted Kennedy become Jabba the Hutt?\nHe's huge!\nYou're a Kennedy, not a Maisy's day float, come on!\nBring him down. We're voting!\nStep away, boy. I said \"no\" to the Crispy Cream.\nCongress recently approved the covert plan\nto assassinate Saddam Hussein.\nSo what they've done, is PUBLICLY approve\nthe secret plan to assassinate Hussein.\nI wonder if he knows?\nI know there's a cure for bio terrorism or whatever it is.\nAnd it lies within Keith Richards, I know that.\nHe is the only man on the planet\nwho can go: \"Anthrax? All right...\"\nDoesn't go with my E. cola, but fuck...!\nKeith is the only man who can make the Osbornes look fucking Amish.\nI've seen him going to a drug dealer who said: \"I'm out, man!\"\n\"I have nothing left.\"\nSupposedly he goes to Switzerland and changes his blood.\nNot like one pike, but like a fucking Chevrolette, all of it.\nI just wanna know who gets his blood?\nSome old Swiss man going:\n\"You've gotta go on tour, bitch!\"\n\"We gotta pay for mixed babies.\"\nWe may all be dead and gone,\nKeith will still be there with five cockroaches.\nHe'll be going, \"I smoked your uncle, did you know that?\nFucking crazy...\"\nEvery so often, Rumsfeld comes out and goes,\n\"I don't know where. I don't know when.\nBut something awful's going to happen.\nThank you, that's all for today, no further questions.\"\nExcuse me, can you give me a clue?\nWhat is it, the Central \"Intuitive\" Agency now?\nAre you working with Miss Cleo?\nI don't know where, I don't know when,\nbut sometin' awful's gonna happen!\nAnd definitely don't marry that fat man.\nHe only wants you for your money, girl!\nPeople are suing Miss Cleo for fraud. I went: \"Fucking da!\"\nWhat do you want? A blind tarot card before you go, \"Ah ha!\"\nIf she's a psychic, why does she need a fuckin' phone number?\nNumber two, that fake Jamaican accent?\nIf she was a real psychic,\nshe'd be one of those Louisiana psychics, like, \"You gonna die!\"\nThey have to puck your ass up\nand have a place for your bike, come on now!\nIt's like buying hair care products from Cher.\nShe's wearing a wig, you idiot!\nTake that abdominal thing helping you lose weight\nwhile it shocks your fat ass sitting watching TV.\nI'm getting six-pack-abs by knocking my testicles around!\nYou strap that to your head.\nAnd say, \"I will not buy stupid shit for no reason!\"\nNow we are in troubled times.\nWhen it happened, I thought the Statue of Liberty would change.\nInstead of \"Give me your tired and your poor,\"\nit would be her with a baseball bat going \"You want a piece of me.\"\nThere was hardcore security. In NY stopping people in the tunnel..\nIn Washington they had F-  s flying, air cover everywhere.\nIn San Francisco, not so hardcore security.\nAt Golden Gate Bridge there's a Hummer and I'm talking about the car.\nOne Hummer here, two Guardsmen, same at the other end of the bridge.\nThe problem is that the Hummer and the Guardsmen\nare in jungle camouflage.\nFor those who never been to SF, the bridge is bright orange.\nSo I feel like going: \"Be vewy, vewy quiet.\nWe're wooking for tewwowists.\"\nAirport security, before all this happened it was:\n\"Beep, OK, get on the plane, come on.\"\n\"What's that? Oh, that's a gun. OK, get on the plane.\"\nYou could carry a four inch blade, that's about that long.\nNow, you can't even take a nail-clipper on a plane.\nWhat, are they afraid you're gonna go \"All right!\nGive me the plane or the bitch loses a cuticle.\nI have a nail file.

You go through the metal detector\nand if you are heavily pierced, like some of my friends:\n\"Take out your keys, sir.\"\n\"Tip of the iceberg.\"\nFor those playing the home game, this is called a Prince Albert.\nI'm sure that was his last wish.\nI'm sure Albert said, \"Victoria, I'm dying.\nI want you to name a museum, a performance hall\nand a bolt through the cock after me.\"\n\"That will be Victoria's Secret. Go, my darling.\"\n\"Say a little song to people that have little anal floss.\"\nAnd I'm talking heavily pierced.\nNot like Britney Spears: \"I'm a virgin!\"\nYeah and Michael Jackson is the father. Move on!\nI'm talking like a hoop through your nipple.\nYou know, lady.. I'm guessing!\nJust the kind when your clothes are going...\nWhen you have a big hoop, what you're gonna do? Tie up a pony?

People going:\n\"I got water.\nAnd if you want it cold, I got ice, mother fucker.\"\nGoing on the planes now, a sweet little Southern stewardess going:\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, before we board flight five,\nwe're just gonna do a few random bag checks.\"\n\"These are totally random.\"\n\"I'm just gonna read of a few names:\"\n\"Has'N'T'Been' Seen,\nAkeem Been'Laid,\nHave'N'T'Been Fucked,\nJudy Smith?\narabs and a blonde?\nAnd every black and Hispanic man in the room is going: \"Thank you, God!\"\n\"Oh, yes, we're off the list, mother fucker, yeah!\"\n\"They're gonna be fucking with you now, Habib.\"\n\"You better learn to go orderly.\"\nThey take the knitting needles from the eighty-year-old lady,\n'Why, cause I'm gonna knit an Afghan?'

And she's right there. Tell her again.\"\nEpiscopal is basically Church of England which was Henry the  -th\nbreaking away from the Catholic Church: \"I'm the fucking Pope now!\"\nThan people broke away from that church,\nthe Calvinists found him to be too loose.\nThan the Puritans broke away from the Calvinists, our ancestors,\npeople so uptight, the English kicked them out.\nHow anal do you have to be for the English to go: \"Get the fuck out!\"\n\"Take your pimp shoes and go!\"\nAnd they land here in America going: \"Hello!\"\n\"We bring you guilt, syphilis and alcohol.\"\n\"Here chief, try this and once you drunk it,\nkeep moving towards your feathers flow.

Come on!\"\nPeople like Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell say:\n\"This was brought upon us by our sinful ways.\"\nI wanna put them on a plane, take them to the ayatollah\nand have world wide fundamentalist wrestling.\nOne time only. A life after death match for all of our souls.\nLet's get ready to humble.\nHere's the drill. Fundamentalists take it to be \"the word\".\nNot translatable, not metaphorical: \"the word\".\nIn the Genesis, \"Let it be light!\" could be a metaphor for the Big Bang?\nNo. God just went click.\nWe are all descendants from Adam and Eve. So we are all cousins.\nThat's right.\nThere are miracles in the Bible.\nLike when Moses, and I'm not talking Guns'N'Moses, no!\nNot Charlton Heston going:\n\"Let the Jews go or pharaoh gets two in the head. No!\nCharlton Heston, who said:\n\"Guns don't kill people... Apes with guns kill people.\"\nNo, Chucky! The second amendment\nstarted from people going like this...\nAnd that still continues. That's OK!\nWhen Moses said to pharaoh: \"Let my people go\".\nAnd pharaoh went: \"In your dreams!\"\nAnd Moses called the God: \"God, I need some help!\"\nAnd frogs fell from the sky.\nOr maybe there were Jews with catapults going: \"Now!\".\nThank God it wasn't the French, 'cause they would go: \"Lunch!\"\n\"You're great caterers, I can't let you go, you crazy people!\"\nFrogs fell from the sky. I would be going: \"Get your shit and out!\"\nI said wait a minute! That's what we should drop on Afghanistan.\nNot bombs, not food... Fucking frogs!\nFrogs, lizards, hamsters, shit the Heaven seen.\nIf you wanna get people out of caves, a shit load of NY rats.\nNY rats would be going: \"Hey, come on, raid!\"\n\"I eat pussy literately. Bring it on!\"\nEven then pharaoh was not impressed: \"Please, David Copperfield, no!\"\nAnd then boils and then first born dies.\n\"That's it! Hebrews get out!\"\nAnd everybody...\nLet's not wait for the bread to rise.\nJust get the crackers and the skin off your penis. We're leaving.\nExcuse me! Why the skin off the penis?\nWe're traveling, people. You don't want sand in there.\nAnd this is so pass\u00e9! The dicky thing, forget it. Let's move!\nWe're going to the desert. Then they get the    commandments,\nthat would be adjusted later by certain presidents.\nAnd they get to the Red Sea.\nAnd they go: \"What now, Mr Magic, what do we do now?\"\nWe're gonna walk on the \"fregs bocks\", the \"frogs bucks...\nFrogs backs!\nThank you for watching me this far.\nObviously, I did inhale.\n\"What do we do now, Mr BigShot?\"\nAnd he calls to God again and the sea parts.\nAnd even the most doubting Jew is going: \"You're good!\"\nLet's move, don't eat the shellfish. I'll tell you why later.\nWhere are we going?\nTo Jerusalem to start years of struggling,\nand later to Miami to fuck up an election.\nAnd then the pharaoh comes, the sea closes and he calls his cat-like God\nbut the cat-like God can't do shit, 'cause it's afraid of water.\nAnd then there's another miracle.\nThe night that Mary said to Joe: \"Joe, I'm pregnant.\"\nJoe went: \"Holly Mother of God!\" She went: \"You're right!\"\n- Oh, Jesus Christ! - What a great name, Joe!\nThat is so much better than Shmul. Way to go!\n- I love you, Joe! - Hold on a minute, Mary.\n- So I'm the step father? - Yeah.\nI can't discipline him, I can't tell him he's wrong,\n'cause he'll look to me saying: \"You're not my real dad.\"\n- How did it happen? - It's immaculate, Joe.\nIt better be, Mary! It better be immaculate!\nI'm sorry I'm transforming Joe into Ralph Cramdon.\nUp to that point, all the names in the Bible are very Jewish.\nYou have Noah, Moses, Zebedee and then you get Mary and Joe.\nWe're just a hyphenate away from Mary-Jean and Joe-Bob.\nWe could've had Jim Bob, the son of God.\nPraise to him, Jim-Bob\nHe, who finds the stuff And gets me a job, Jim-Bob\nJesus was an only child. Thank God!\nWho would want to be Jerry, the brother of Christ?\nThat's a tough gig.\n\"Come on, Jerry, we're going to the beach.\"\nJesus's gonna walk on the water, feed everybody, heal them\nand get a whole bunch of disciples.\nI'll sat there with a rash and sand in my ass. Great day for me!\nHe ends up in a bar at the age of    going: \"Yeah, I'm Jerry Christ.\nYeah, I healed somebody. Come here Spot, heel! Look at that!\"\nJesus is a carpenter, I'm a plumber. You do the math!\nAnd people say to me Jesus wasn't Jewish... of course he was Jewish!\nThirty years old, single, living at home with his parents, come on.\nWorking in his father's business,\nhis mother thought he was God's gift, he's Jewish! Give it up!\nIt's an old tradition!\nAnd if he was Jewish, and many of his Disciples were Jewish,\nfor the Last Supper, would they not have gone out for Chinese?\n'Welcome to Yahweh. Hold on one minute; no service, no sandals.\nOkay, you come in now.\nYou're twelve. All I got is two tables of six. They're not together.\nI also have a table by the window, but you all have to face this way.\nYou are glowing, so I guess we don't need that lamp, that's very nice!\nYou've just turned a Szechwan chicken into a live chicken, you very good!'\nIt's said that night, he turned to his disciples,\nand said: \"One of you shall betray me.\"\nPeter said, \"Is it me, Jesus?\" Jesus said, \"It is not you Peter.\"\nSimon said, \"Is it me, Jesus?\" Jesus said, \"It is not you Simon.\"\nAnd Judas said: \"Is it me, Jesus?\"\nJesus turned to him: \"Is it me, Jesus?\"\nThus you see two traditions beginning:\nJewish sarcasm and Gentile humor. Together born!\nThe next day the miracle occurred: Crucifixion, Resurrection\nand he rose again from the dead and if he sees his shadow\nanother\nyears of guilt. Yes!\nFor me, the one big question is: how do you get Crucifixion, Resurrection\nand then chocolate bunnies, colored eggs?\nHow do you do that one?\nEven kids are going: \"Rabbits don't lay eggs. What is this?\"\nAnd you don't want a kid biting the head off a chocolate Jesus.\nYou don't want a cream filled cross going...\nYou don't wanna put raspberry jam in the grass going:\n\"We're looking for Jesus, kids, come one!\"\nWhat are we trying to do? You're trying to keep them involved.\nThat's why we have all the saints that did all those amazing things.\nThey're all there to keep your action up.\nAnd then we're starting to loose them.\nLike Saint Christopher:\n\"Chris, sorry, babe. Dashboard sales are down.\"\n\"The medals aren't selling well.\nDrop the kid off your back, pick up your stuff, you're outta here.\"\nWe're gonna have Saint Prada, all ladies accessories.\nBut I want a saint like Mother Teresa.\nShe said: \"You can do only small things with great love.\"\nAnd Pat Robinson said: \"She's not a real Christian!\"\n\"Why? 'Cause she doesn't have tag shelter and a university?\"\nMother Teresa never had a line of products, her own perfume:\n\"Compassion\" by Mother Teresa.\n\"I smell, because I care. Compassion!\"\nGandhi never had 'Gandhi Jeans',\nwhether you're simply not eating and tell the English to get the fuck out.\nThey come in size one and below.\nGandhi was an amazing man.\nThey asked him: \"What do you think about Western civilization?\"\nHe said: \"I think it would be a wonderful idea.\"\nAs beatific as Gandhi was, there was somebody in a Bombay bar going:\n\"I know Gandhi. He was a prick.\"\n\"I saw him sucking on a pork hot-dog, hitting on Mother Teresa.\"\n\"He kept saying: Who's your diaper daddy?\"\n\"I saw that with my eyes.\nIf you don't believe me, I'll bitch slap you like Shiva.\"\n\"Don't press this. Don't fucking do that!\"\nDon't go ding-dong, you asshole!\n'Cause India has the atomic bomb, my friend.\nThey could turn this place into Chicken tika.\nIndia has the bomb. Pakistan has the bomb.\nAnd we're preparing to fight over Kashmir.\nAnd your president probably thought it was a sweater.

They still need their bombs.\nWhere did they do the underground test?\nIn the Sahara, in the total waste land?\nNo, fuck off! In Tahiti! In paradise.\nWhy? \"Because we're French.\"\n\"Look a Green Peace boat coming to protest.\nFuck off, I sink you.\"\n\"I'm the badest mother fucker, am I not?\"\n\"Look, I'm giving a cigarette to a baby.\"\n\"Suck on the cigarette. Life is shit. Get to know this.\"\n\"You, Americans. Fuck all of you Americans!\"\n\"Americans, you politically correct. You cultureless crass Americans.\"\n\"We hate all of you. Fuck off!\"\n\"The Germans are here. Hello, Americans!\"\n\"I love you! Come on, Americans.\"\n\"Welcome back, Americans.\"\n\"You can build the Disneyland near Paris.\"\n\"We won't go, but build it.\"\n\"I will have a Minnie mouse with armpit hair. It will be great!\"\nSmoking a Garwoise, going: \"I never loved Mickey\".\n\"He has three fingers. What am I, a bowling ball?

The Geneva Convention.\nIf there's ever a nuclear war, they will be the only people going:\n\"Vhat was that noise?\"\nIn their big hollowed up country,\nwith their chocolate and their watches. Ya!\nThe nice Germans. Ya!\nOr, as they like to say, \"the other white race.\"\nI have only one question:\nHow can you trust an army, that has a wine opener on it's knife?\nMany of you, men, have never open a Chardonnay under fire.\nYou take out the wine bottle, put out the cock and throw.\nY:i I don't know, but I've been told, Chardonnay must be self-cold\nMy God! Where did all this Impressionistic art come from?\nAnd all these jewelry from\nto\n?\nFairies must've brought it during the night.\nI have to do the vault Heimlich and cough up an account number.\nI know this one thing...\nI know there's one country that's not developing a weapon of destruction.\nThat does not have a secret weapons' lab up in the mountains.\nJamaica!\nHowdy, man!\nJamaica would never make an atomic bomb.\nThey may make an atomic bong.\nWhen the atomic bomb goes off,\nthere's devastation and radiation.\nWhen the atomic bong goes off, there's celebration!\nSmoke a split for the communion.\nIf you don't see Jesus than, you never will.\nI know only one thing.\nI never met me an angry pot smoker.\nI never met a man who said: \"Hey, you fucking prick!\"\n\"Oh, fuck!\nWhat was I gonna do?!\"\n\"Hold me, you piece of shit.

Chapter 5 LyricsCHAPTER V\n\nTHE VAMPIRE IN LITERATURE\n\nA consideration of the Vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic, if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal. Any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. It is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. Accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the Vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this Chapter will serve once for all. In such a story, for example, as Dr. M. R. James' Count Magnus[1] is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? The writer has left the point ambiguous. It is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. It will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in Sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in Vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain Count Magnus de la Gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrg\u00e5rd. Even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. Reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. Two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. They are warned: \"No, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. They should be resting, not walking.\" The two men laughed and cried: \"The Count is dead; we do not care for him.\" But in the night the villagers \"hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him.\" Then they hear a hideous laugh, \"it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all.\" In the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. \"He was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones.\" The other man is standing with his back against a tree, \"pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.\"\n\nThere was some vague gossip that the Count had been \"on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him.\" During his investigation of the papers the English traveller, Mr. Wraxall, found a Liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the Count had once journeyed to the city of Chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. In careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, Mr. Wraxall exclaims: \"Ah, Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly like to see you.\" He is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. In a state of frenzied fear he sets out for England the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. Upon landing at Harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. He finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. He is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how \"the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.\"\n\nThis story may, I think, certainly be considered as Vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural I have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. It is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. No ghost story should be of any length. The horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. The ghost is malevolent and odious. In fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. The authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. Nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.\n\nTo review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.\nSince some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the Vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in German Universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. Thus among the poems of Heinrich August Ossenfelder[2] we have a short piece entitled Der Vampir, which is as follows:\n\nMein liebes M\u00e4gdchen glaubet\nBest\u00e4ndig steif und feste,\nAn die gegebnen Lehren\nDer immer frommen Mutter\nAls V\u00f6lker an der Theyse\nAn t\u00f6dtliche Vampiere\nHeyduckisch feste glauben,\nNun warte nur Christianchen,\nDu willst mich gar nich lieben;\nIch will mich an dir r\u00e4chen,\nUnd heute in Tockayer\nZu einem Vampir trinken.\nUnd wenn du sanfte schlummerst,\nVon deinen sch\u00f6nen Wangen\nDen frischen Purpur saugen.\nAlsdenn wirst du erschrecken,\nWenn ich dich werde k\u00fcssen\nUnd als ein Vampir k\u00fcssen:\nWann du dann recht erzitterst\nUnd matt in meine Arme,\nGleich einer Todten sinkest\nAlsdenn will ich dich fragen,\nSind meine Lehren besser,\nAls deiner guten Mutter?\nThe poet Wieland[3] has a passing reference to the Vampire\n\nDer J\u00fcngling aus den Wolken\nHerab gefallen, stumm und bleich,\nAls h\u00e4tt' ein Vampyr ihm die Adern ausgemolken,\nSteht ganz vernichtet von dem Streich.[4]\n\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that the Vampire entered German literature with Goethe's famous ballad Die Braut von Korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from Phlegon of Tralles. The young Athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the Vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:\n\nAus dem Grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,\nNoch zu suchen das vermifste Gut,\nNoch den schon verlornen Mann zu lieben Und zu saugen seines Herzens Blut.\nIst's um den geschehn,\nMuss nach andern gehn,\nUnd das junge Volk erliegt der Wut.[6]\n\nEven more famous are the charnel horrors of B\u00fcrger's Lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the Gottinger Musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof Brandl gives an ample list[6] has remained a household word.\n\nIn spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary England for German romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of Lenore was published here until 1796, when William Taylor of Norwich printed in the Monthly Review of March his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. He had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790,[7] and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in Norwich literary circles. We know that Mrs. Barbauld who visited Edinburgh \"about the summer of 1793 or 1794\"[8] read aloud Taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. This event was described to Sir Walter Scott by Miss Cranstoun, afterwards Countess Purgstall,[9] although Scott himself mentions that his curiosity \"was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard Lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence,[10] had remained impressed on his memory.\"[11] This gentleman Was Mr. Cranstoun, the brother of Countess Purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as Scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. It was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that Scott made his own rendering of the ballad. The account of Taylor's version, Ellenore, which \"electrified\" the assembled company at Dugald Stewart's house when read by the famous Anna Letitia Barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. Just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of B\u00fcrger's works was conveyed to him from Hamburg. He immediately devoured the German ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about Englishing it. \"I well recollect\" he writes, \"that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning.\"[12] Scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,\" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. In 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from B\u00fcrger by Taylor and by Scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of W. R. Spencer, H. J. Pye and J. T. Stanley. The translation by the last named author was given to the public in an \u00e9dition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown.[14] In 1797, a pasquil followed, Miss Kitty: a Parody on Lenora, a Ballad, \"Translated from the German, by several Hands,\" whilst in the following year, Mrs. Taylor turned the popular poem into Italian as a \"Novella Morale.\"[15] Probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the Rev. J. Beresford which was published in 1800.\n\nIt was in 1797 that Coleridge wrote the first part of Christabel, and German critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of Lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. For example, if the narrative of Geraldine be carefully read[16] it must be evident that the following judgment of Professor Brandl is without foundation. This critic writes: \"Ihre Vorgeschichte (of Geraldine) sch\u00f6pfte er grossentheils aus B\u00fcrgers 'Lenore' in Taylors Uebersetzung: die Dame ist, wenigstens ihrer Erz\u00e4hlung nach, auf einem windschnellen Ross entf\u00fchrt und halbtodt vor Furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen Leichenzuges, der Lenoren auf ihrem Ritt durch die Mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den Schatten der Nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte Blatt neben ihr wie aus Herzenangst.\"[17]\n\nAs we might expect, the young Shelley was enchanted by Lenore, and Medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand.\"[18] Dowden tells the story how one Christmas Eve Shelley dramatically related the B\u00fcrger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture \"working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest \"that the company fully expected to see Wilhelm stalk into the parlour.\" In his study of Shelley, Charles Middleton has remarked: \"It is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the Leonora of B\u00fcrgher first awakened his poetic faculty. A tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself.\"[20] To suggest, as Zeiger would have it,[21] that Lenore influenced the poem which in the romance St. Irvyne[22] Megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:\n\nGhosts of the dead! have I not heard your yelling\nRise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .\nis the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from \"Lachin y Gair\" in Byron's Hours of Idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.[23]\n\nAs I have elsewhere shown in some detail, Shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya: or The Moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares \"quite enraptured\" him.[24] It is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as Die Braut von Korinth and Lenore the novelists of the Gothic school, soaked though they were in German literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the Vampire. It is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as Monk Lewis, \"Apollo's sexton,\" who would fain \"make Parnassus a churchyard\";[25] and Charles Robert Maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions,[26] et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. In the Gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: \"Surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders.\" We have such titles as the famous Horrid Mysteries; The Midnight Groan; The Abbot of Montserrat, or, The Pool of Blood; The Demon of Venice; The Convent Spectre; The Hag of the Mountains;[27] and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to Polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as I am aware, do we meet with the Vampire in the realm of Gothic fancy. So vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that I hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. There may be some romance which I have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case I am at least prepared to say that the Vampire was not generally known to Gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school I think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. Inevitably one of the band, T. J. Horseley Carties, Francis Lathom, William Herbert, Edward Montague, Mrs. Roche, Eliza Parsons, Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Helme, Mrs. Meeke, Isabella Kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the Vampire in some funereal episode.\n\nOne might even have supposed that the notes to Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer,[28] must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in Book VIII could not have passed unnoticed:\n\nA night of darkness and of storms!\nInto the Chamber of the Tomb\nThalaba led the Old Man,\nTo roof him from the rain.\nA night of storms! the wind\nSwept through the moonless sky,\nAnd moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;\nAnd in the pauses if its sweep\nThey heard the heavy rain\nBeat on the monument above.\nIn silence on Oneiza's grave\nHer father and her husband sate.\nThe Cryer from the Minaret\nProclaim'd the midnight hour.\n\"Now, now!\" cried Thalaba;\nAnd o'er the chamber of the tomb\nThere spread a lurid gleam,\nLike the reflection of a sulphur fire\nAnd in that hideous light\nOneiza stood before them. It was She . . .\nHer very lineaments. . . . and such as death\nHad changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;\nBut in her eye there dwelt\nBrightness more terrible\nThan all the loathsomeness of death.\n\"Still art thou living, wretch? \"\nIn hollow tones she cried to Thalaba;\n\"And must I nightly leave my grave\nTo tell thee, still in vain,\nGod hath abandoned thee?\n\n\"This is not she!\" the Old Man exclaim'd;\n\"A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!\"\nAnd to the youth he held his lance;\n\"Strike and deliver thyself!\"\n\"Strike HER!\" cried Thalaba,\nAnd palsied of all power,\nGazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.\n\"Yea, strike her!\" cried a voice, whose tones\nFlow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,\nAs when the desert shower\nFrom death deliver'd him;\nBut obedient to that well-known voice,\nHis eye was seeking it,\nWhen Moath, firm of heart,\nPerform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse\nHe thrust his lance; it fell,\nAnd howling with the wound,\nIts fiendish tenant fled.\nA sapphire light fell on them,\nAnd garmented with glory, in their sight\nOneiza's spirit stood.\n\nIt is important to remark that in his notes[29] upon this passage Southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the Lettres Juives, the Vampires of Gradisch, also the history of Arnold Paul, and the very ample account given by Tournefort. He further says: \"The Turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. If any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he [i.e., the body] is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. The merchants (at Constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a Janisary with them. Passing by the burying place of the Jews, it happened that an old Jew sat by a sepulchre. The Janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--Roger North's Life of Sir Dudley North.\"[30]\n\nIt might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the Marquis de Sade Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu and Juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. In the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as La Nouvelle Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu, suivie de l'Histoire de Juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which Justine occupies four and Juliette six) Justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. In Justine we have the episodes in the house of Monsieur Rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the Comte de Gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster Roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. Many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in Juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the Muscovite giant Minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and Cordelli, the necrophilist of Ancona.\n\nIn The New Monthly Magazine,[31] 1 April, 1819, was published The Vampyre: a Tale by Lord Byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in Le Fanu and M. R. James--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the Continent than in England. It was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of Lord Byron, but had been written by Dr. John William Polidori, physician-companion to the poet. Byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in Galignani's edition of his works. A first printed, The Vampyre forms a part of extracts from \"A letter from Geneva, with Anecdotes of Lord Byron.\" Here is to be read that \"among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord Byron, Mr. p. B. Shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of Godwin and Dr. Polidori) before alluded to after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana[32] began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. It was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord Byron, the physician, and Miss M. Godwin. My friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the \u00e9bauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence.\" Upon this the Editor has the following note: \"We have in our possession the Tale of Dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of Miss Godwin. The latter has already appeared under the title of 'Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.\"\n\nThe Vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. This preamble commences: \"The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\"\n\nThe Editor then recounts the famous instance of Arnold Paul, and continues: \"We have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. This supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'Giaour.'[32]\n\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,\nThy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\nThen ghastly haunt thy native place,\nAnd suck the blood of all thy race;\nThere from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283\nAt midnight drain the stream of life;\nYet loathe the banquet, which perforce\nMust feed thy livid living corse,\nThy victims, ere they yet expire,\nShall know the demon for their sire;\nAs cursing thee, thou cursing them,\nThy flowers are withered on the stem.\nBut one that for thy crime must fall,\nThe youngest, best beloved of all,\nShall bless thee with a father's name--\nThat word shall wrap thy heart in flame!\nYet thou must end thy task and mark\nHer check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,\nAnd the last glassy glance must view\nWhich freezes o'er its lifeless blue;\nThen with unhallowed hand shall tear\nThe tresses of her yellow hair,\nOf which, in life a lock when shorn\nAffection's fondest pledge was worn--\nBut now is borne away by thee\nMemorial o thine agony!\nYet with thine own best blood shall drip\nThy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;\nThen stalking to thy sullen grave\nGo--and with Ghouls and Afrits rave,\nTill these in horror shrink away\nFrom spectre more accursed than they.\"\n\nAfter an allusion to Southey's Thalaba, Tournefort's Travels, and Dom Calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: \"We could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\"\n\nThe story tells how at the height of a London season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass.\" This original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets \"a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey\" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood.\" Aubrey is greatly fascinated by Lord Ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the Continent he mentions this intention to my Lord, and is \"surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\"\n\nAs they travelled from town to town, Aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. However the recipients of this charity \"inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery.\" Eventually the travellers arrive at Rome, and here Aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from London the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. At Rome Aubrey is able to foil Lord Ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he \"directed his steps towards Greece, and, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens.\" Here he lodges in the house of a Greek, whose daughter Ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. As he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with Greek legend and tradition, and \"often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\"\n\nBefore long it becomes evident that Aubrey is in love with Ianthe, \"and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him.\" He endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. When Ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, \"as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\"\n\nHaving given his promise to Ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. The exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. The steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of a solitary wood. \"As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stiffled exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound.\" With a terrific effort Aubrey burst open the door and rushing into the darkness \"found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized, when a voice cried \"again baffled,\" to which a loud laugh succeeded, and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled but it was in vain; he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hand upon his throat, when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him--he instantly rose and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood was not longer heard.\" Several peasants now hastened into the hut bearing flambeaus which illuminate the scene, and to the horror of all there is discovered hard by, the lifeless body of Ianthe. A curious dagger lies near, but her death was not the result of a blow from this weapon. \"There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:--upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:--to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, 'a Vampyre, a Vampyre!'\" It appears that Ianthe had followed the traveller to watch over his safety. Aubrey is carried back to the city in a raging fever, and the parents of the unfortunate girl die brokenhearted owing to so terrible a loss.\n\nWhilst Aubrey lies ill Lord Ruthven arrives in Athens and establishing himself in the same house nurses the invalid with such care that past differences are forgotten, since Aubrey not only becomes reconciled to his presence but even seeks his company. Together they travel into the wildest interior of Greece, and here in some mountain pass they are attacked by brigands, from whose guns Lord Ruthven receives a shot in the shoulder. His strength strangely decreasing, a couple of days later it is plain to all that he is at the point of death. He now exacts a terrific oath that his companion shall conceal all that is known of him and that the news of his death shall not be allowed to reach England. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see.\" Aubrey binds himself most solemnly by the prescribed oath, and in a paroxysm of hideous laughter Ruthven expires.\n\nAccording to a promise which has been obtained from the robbers by a heavy bribe the body was conveyed to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death. Aubrey insists that it shall be interred in the ordinary way, but when he is conducted to the place it is found that the body has disappeared, and in spite of the protestations of the band he is convinced that they have buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes. One circumstance, however, gives Aubrey much food for thought. Among the effects of the deceased he discovered a sheath of most curious pattern and make which exactly fits the dagger that had been found in the deserted hut upon the occasion of Ianthe's death.\n\nReturning to England, as he retraces his journey through Rome to his horror Aubrey discovers that in spite of the precautions he had so carefully taken, Lord Ruthven succeeded only too well in his bad designs and now there is bitter sorrow and distress where once reigned peace and happiness. The lady had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship, and Aubrey instinctively divines that she has \"fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe.\"\n\nUpon his arrival in London the traveller is greeted by his sister, whose presentation into society had been delayed until her brother's return from the Continent, when he might be her protector. \"It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the busy scene.\" Upon this gay occasion the crowd was excessive, and as Aubrey heedless and distracted is watching the gay throng a voice which he recognizes only too well, whispers in this ear: \"Remember\n\np. 288\n\nyour oath.\" Turning he sees Lord Ruthven standing near him. A few nights later at the assembly of a near relation among the crowd of admirers by whom his sister is surrounded--the most prominent of the throng--he again perceives the mysterious and horrible figure. Hurrying forward he seizes his sister's arm and requests her immediately to accompany him home. However, before they have had time to retire again does the voice whisper close to him: \"Remember your oath!\"\n\nAubrey now becomes almost distracted. He sees no remedy against a monster who has already once mocked at death. Even if he were to declare all that he knew it is probable that he would hardly be believed. Whenever he attends a social gathering his looks as he scans the company become so suspicious and strange that he soon acquires a reputation for great eccentricity. As the months go on his loathing and his fears drive him well-nigh to madness, so that eventually a physician is engaged to reside in the house and take charge of him. He is a little consoled by the thought that when the year and the day have passed he will at least be able to unburden his mind and be at any rate freed from his terrible oath. It so happens that he overhears a conversation between the doctor and one of his guardians who enlarges upon the melancholy circumstance of her brother being in so critical a state when Miss Aubrey is to be married on the following day. He instantly demands the name of the bridegroom and is told the Earl of Marsden. He requests to see his sister and in an hour or two she visits him. As they are conversing she opens a locket and shows him a miniature of the man who has won her affections. To his horror he perceives that it is a portrait of Lord Ruthven and falling into convulsions of rage he tramples it under foot. In twenty-four hours the period of his oath will have expired, and he implores them to delay the wedding at least for that time. Since there seems no good reason for doing this the request is disregarded, upon which Aubrey falls into so sad a state of utter depression succeeded by an outburst of fury that the physician concludes him to be not far removed from lunacy and doubles the restraint. During the night the busy preparations for the nuptial are ceaselessly continued. It appears that upon the pretext of being her brother's dearest friend and travelling\n\np. 289\n\ncompanion Lord Ruthven had visited the house to inquire after Aubrey during his supposed derangement, and from the character of a visitor gradually insinuated himself into that of an accepted suitor. When the bridal party has assembled Aubrey, neglected by the servants, contrives to make his way into the public apartments which are decorated for the nuptials. Ere he can utter a cry, he is, however, at once perceived by Lord Ruthven who with more than human strength thrusts him, speechless with rage, from the room, at the same time whispering in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to-day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" The attendants at once secure the unhappy man, but he can no longer support his distress. In his agonies a blood vessel breaks and he is incontinently conveyed to bed. This sad accident is kept from his sister; the marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\n\n\"Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused--he died immediately after.\n\n\"The guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a Vampyre!\"\n\nIt were not easy to overestimate the astounding sensation which was caused by this story, and the narrative is certainly not without considerable merit, for in places the eerie atmosphere is well conveyed, Nor is it difficult to understand the extraordinary influence of the tale, since it introduced a tradition which had been long forgotten and which promised infinite possibilities in the way of that sensation and melodramatic calentures which the period craved. The first separate edition of The Vampyre appeared in 1819, and was published by Sherwood. The first issue of this, which is now very rare, contains a certain amount of preliminary matter concerning the Shelleys, Byron and Godwin. This was omitted in later issues, and accordingly one often finds that copies of The Vampyre are described as First Edition, which is strictly quite correct, although they are the Second Issue,\n\np. 290\n\nand naturally of far less value in a bibliographer's eyes. A large number of reprints increased with amazing rapidity and in the same year the novel was translated into French by Henri Faber, Le Vampire, nouvelle traduite de l'anglais de Lord Byron, Paris, 1819. In February, 1820, there followed under the aegis of Charles Nodier a very obvious imitation, or rather continuation by Cyprien B\u00e9rard, Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires. \"Roman de C. B. Publi\u00e9 par l'auteur de Jean Sbogar et de Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Aubert.[34] Paris, 1820.\" In 1825, a new translation of Polidori's story was given by Eus\u00e8be de Salles. Nor was Germany behind hand, for The Vampyre was first translated in 1819: Der Vampyr. Eine Erzahlung aus dem Englischen des Lord Byron. Nebst einer Schilderung seines Aufenthaltes in Mytilene. Leipzig, 1819. In the following year there appeared at Frankfort a version by J. V. Adrian of Byron's poems and prose, wherein was included Der Blutsuger. In a collection of Byron's work the first volume of which was published at Zwickau in 1821, The Vampyre again found a place in volume V (1821), translated by Christian Karl Meifsner as Der Vampyr. The tale has also been included in various other continental collections and translations of Byron's work even until a recent date.\n\nYet it was well-known all the while that Polidori was the author of the story, but as Byron's was by far the greater name, so this sensational novella must be attributed to the cavaliero whose romantic adventures and the scandal of whose amours were thrilling the whole of Europe. Writing in the same Year as the great poet's death Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Pichot of the University of Marseilles in his Essai sur le g\u00e9nie et le caract\u00e8re de Lord Byron[35] declared that this spurious issue \"a autant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre le nom de lord Byron en France, que ses po\u00ebmes les plus estim\u00e9s.\" Publishers insisted upon Le Vampire, \"nouvelle,\" being included among Byron's works, and it is said that Ladvocat was furious when it was represented to him that since it was openly acknowledged that Polidori had written The Vampire, the translation should properly be no longer given among the poet's work nor put forth under his name.\n\nAs might have been expected it was not long before the Vampire appeared upon the stage, and the first play of this kind would seem to be the famous melodrama by Charles\n\np. 291\n\nNodier (with Achille Jouffroy and Carmouche) which with music by Alexandre Piccini and scenery by Ciceri, was produced in Paris on 13th June, 1820, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin, whose directors were the popular M. M. Croznier and Merle. The r\u00f4le of Lord Rutwen was taken by M. Philippe; the celebrated Madame Dorval was Malvina;[36] and the new play had an extraordinary success.\n\nIt was immediately published as Le Vampire, m\u00e9lodrame en trois actes avec un prologue, Par M. M. . . .; Musique, de M. Alexandre Piccini; Decors de M. Ciceri. This might be purchased at 1 fr. 25cs. \"au magasin g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de pi\u00e8ces de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Chez J.-N. Barba, Libraire, Palais Royal, derri\u00e8re le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, No. 51. \"The characters in the Prologue are Ituriel, ange de la Lune, Mlle. Descotte; Oscar, g\u00e9nie des Mariages, M. Mo\u00ebssard; and Un Vampire, M. Philippe. The scene opens in \"une grotte basaltique,\" the Caledonian caves of Staffa. Oscar and Ituriel discourse of Vampires, and the latter asks: \"Serait-il vrai que d'horribles fant\u00f4mes viennent quelquefois, sous l'apparence des droits de l'hymen, \u00e9gorger une vierge timide, et s'abreuver de son sang?\" This is indeed the case, and it is significant that on the morrow Malvina (Miss Aubray) is to wed \"le comte de Marsden.\" A vision of the sleeping Malvina appears when \"Un spectre v\u00eatu d'un linceuil s'\u00e9chappe de la plus apparente de ces tombes\" and rushes upon her. He is swiftly repulsed by Oscar, the good genius and the curtain falls. The characters in the play are: Lord Rutwen, M. Philippe; Sir Aubray, M. Perrin ou Th\u00e9ringy; Malvina, Mad. Dorval; Brigitte, Mad. St. Amand; Edgar, M. Edmon; Scop, M. Pierson; Petterson, M. Dugy; Lovette, Mlle. J. Vertpr\u00e9; Oscar, M. Mo\u00ebssard; with attendances of Domestiques and Villageois. The drama to a certain extent adroitly follows the lines of the Polidori novel, but with notable changes, which are well contrived and introduced. Lord Rutwen and Aubray have been fellow travellers, but the latter has no suspicion of Rutwen's real nature. In fact he holds him in the dearest affection since once he was saved from death by his friend who, whilst shielding him from a brigand's attack, fell by a chance shot. When Lord Rutwen arrives to claim Malvina's hand it is with delight Aubray hails his preserver on whom he supposed killed by the bandit's gun. It is cleverly explained how\n\np. 292\n\nthe wound did not after all prove fatal, whereupon \"Rutwen, mes desirs sont remplis\" cries Aubray, \"nous allons \u00eatre fr\u00e8res\" (Ils s'embrassent). Lovette a farmer's daughter of the Marsden estate is to wed Edgar, and Rutwen graciously presents himself at the marriage feast. As Lord of the Manor he is received with every respect and homage, but he immediately proceeds to attempt Lovette's virtue. Oscar \"un viellard dont la t\u00eate v\u00e9n\u00e9rable inspire le respect. Sa d\u00e9marche a quelque chose d'imposant et de myst\u00e9rieux,\" has already warned the maiden, and she coldly avoids such ardent importunities. Whilst Rutwen is actually pursuing the coy lass who shuns his embrace, Edgar in a fury fires a pistol at the seducer and he falls crying, \"Je meurs.\" Aubray hastening to the spot is barely in time to receive him in his arms, and with dying lips Rutwen adjures him to swear the following oath. \"Promets-moi que Malvina ne saura point ce qui m'est arriv\u00e9; que tu ne feras rien pour venger ma mort avant que la premi\u00e8re heure de la nuit n'ait sonn\u00e9. Jure-moi le secret sur ce coeur expirant.\" Aubray much moved cries, \"Je to le jure,\" and as Rutwen expires they lay the body gently on the ground. \"A`ce moment on voit la lune planer enti\u00e8rement sur le corps de Rutwen, et \u00e9clairer les gla\u00e7ons de la montagne. La toile tombe.\"\n\nAct III. \"repr\u00e9sente un grand vestibule gothique, la porte de la chapelle se voit au fond.\" Oscar solemnly utters words of warning to Brigitte, who is already full of fears which are not unnoticed by Malvina. When Aubray meets his sister she speaks joyfully of her marriage but as he is about to tell her of the fatal happening suddenly Rutwen appears and seizing his arm \"lui dit d'une voix sombre: 'Songe \u00e0 ton serment'!\" Aubray now realizes that there is some horrid secret and displays violent emotion crying out in broken tones: \"Eloigne-toi fant\u00f4me! . . ma soeur . . . d\u00e9robe-toi, aux poursuites de ce monstre . . . il te dira qu'il est ton \u00e9poux . . . refuse ton serment . . . cet hymen est un crime\" At length he is carried off by the servants who fear that he has lost his senses, an idea Rutwen encourages. In spite of this disorder the bridegroom now hotly presses on the nuptials; the great doors are opened \"et laisse voir la chapelle \u00e9clair\u00e9e,\" Rutwen and Malvina approach the altar. With a wild cry Aubray rushes in to intercept the ceremony,\n\np. 293\n\nupon which the monster drawing his dagger is about to plunge it deep into Malvina's heart when one o'clock strikes,--his power is gone.\" Il laisse tomber son poignard et cherche & s'enfuir, des ombres sortent de la terre et l'entra\u00eenent avec elles; l'Ange exterminateur para\u00eet dans un nuage, la foudre \u00e9clate et les Ombres s'engloutissent avec Rutwen. Pluie de feu. TABLEAU G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL.\"\n\nThe dialogue of this melodrama is spirited, the situations striking and well managed, and even in reading the play, one can clearly visualize that upon the stage it must have been extraordinarily effective, especially when set off with all the attractions of the scene painter's glowing perspectives, the magic craft of the subtle machinist, and the richest adornment of romantic costume.[37] Even before he had introduced the Vampire on to the boards Nodier had prophesied that this macabre monster would win a veritable triumph, and his prediction was amply fulfilled. \"Le Vampire \u00e9pouvantera, de son horrible amour, les songes de toutes les femmes, et bient\u00f4t sans doute, ce monstre encore exhum\u00e9 pr\u00eatera son masque immobile, sa voix s\u00e9pulcrale, son oeil d'un gris mort, . . . tout cet attirail de m\u00e9lodrame \u00e0 la Melpom\u00e8ne des boulevards; et quel succ\u00e8s alors ne lui est pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9!\"[38] On 1st July, 1819, writing in the Drapeau Blanc he was far more serious and far more emphatic: \"La fable du vampire est peut-\u00eatre la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . Elle a partout l'autorit\u00e9 de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de celle de la th\u00e9ologie ni do celle de la, m\u00e9dicine. La philosophie m\u00eame en a parl\u00e9.\"\n\nAll Paris flocked to see Le Vampire, and nightly the Porte-Saint-Martin was packed to the doors. Philippe and Madame Dorval were applauded to the echo by enthusiastic audiences who recalled them again and again after the final tableau. Even the book of the play had an immense circulation and every morning Barba's counter was freshly stocked with huge piles of the duodecimo, which rapidly diminished during the day.\n\nNot a few critics, however, adopted a very uncompromising attitude, and were unsparing in their condemnation of so popular a melodrama. In Les Lettres Normandes, 1820, (tome XI, p. 93) Le Vampire was thus noticed: \"Le m\u00e9lodrame du Vampire dans lequel on voit para\u00eetre un monstre\n\np. 294\n\nqui suce le sang des petites filles et qui offre des Tableaux qu'une honn\u00eate femme ne pout voir sans rougir, est l'ouvrage de MM. Ch. Nodier, r\u00e9dacteur du Drapeau Blanc; Achille Jouffroy, r\u00e9dacteur de La Gazette et auteur des Festes de l'anarchie; et Carmouche autre r\u00e9dacteur du Drapeau Blanc.\" This censure is, however, wholly inspired by political feeling which thus inveighed against the royalist Nodier, and which not unmingled with green jealousy we also find prominent in the Conservateur litt\u00e9raire of April, 1820 (Tome II, p. 245) where we had: \"Pour balancer le succ\u00e8s du Vampire m\u00e9lodrame d\u00e9go\u00fbtant et si monstreux que les auteurs MM. Ch. Nodier et Carmouche m'ont pas os\u00e9 se faire conna\u00eetre, le th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter la traduction litt\u00e9rale, en prose, de la Marie Stuart de Schiller.\"\n\nYet another critic is even more trenchant and severe: \"Le Vampire Ruthwen veut violer ou sucer dans les coulisses une jeune fianc\u00e9e qui fuit devant lui sur le th\u00e9\u00e2tre: cette situation est-elle morale? . . . Toute la pi\u00e8ce repr\u00e9sente indirectement Dieu comme un \u00eatre faible ou odieux qui abandonne le monde aux g\u00e9nies de l'enfer.\"[39]\n\nYet all these attacks served but to enhance the attraction, and it is remarkable for how many years this continued undiminished. In 1823 a revival of Le Vampire with Philippe and Madame Dorval again thronged the Porte-Saint-Martin to excess. Alexandre Dumas, who was present at this production has recorded how vast was his delight, how ineffable his thrills during the sombre scenes of this sepulchral melodrame. How the theatre applauded the lean livid mask of the Vampire, how it shuddered at his stealthy steps! There are, perhaps, to be found throughout the whole of the many works of Alexandre, Dumas few pages more entertaining than those chapters in his Memoires which relate with rarest humour and not a few flashes of brilliant wit his adventures at a performance of Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1823. It would be difficult to find a livelier, and yet at the same time entirely serious and even critical, account of a theatrical performance. Unfortunately it is too long to give in full. In the edition of Mes M\u00e9moires, Troisi\u00e8me S\u00e9rie, Michel L\u00e9vy, Paris, 1863, it occupies no less than five chapters, LXXIII-LXXVII, and these are none of the shortest, (pp. 136-193). One is tempted to quote some delicious passages, but the\n\np. 295\n\naccount might lose thereby; it must be read as a delightful whole. Yet there is one extract which May certainly be made without impertinence, the story of the Vampire which was related to Dumas by his neighbour \"le monsieur poli qui lisait un Elz\u00e9vir.\" They have discussed the tradition at some length, and incidentally the good bibliophile refers his young acquaintance to the work of Dom Calmet, from whom he gives ample citations. He further remarks that he has resided in Illyria for three years, and he very sharply animadverts upon certain details on Nodier's melodrama which are foreign to the vampire tradition. \"You speak of vampires as though they really existed,\" remarks Dumas. \"Of course they exist,\" said his neighbour dryly. \"Have you ever seen one then?\" \"Most certainly I have.\" \"That was whilst you were in Illyria?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Et vous y avez vu des vampires?\"\n\n\"Vous savez que c'est la, terre claissique des vampires, l'Illyrie, comme la Hongrie, la Servie, la Pologne.\n\n\"Non, je no sais pas . . . je ne sais rien. O\u00f9 \u00e9taient ces vampires que vous avez vus?\n\n\"A Spalatro. Je logeais chez un bonhomme de soixante-deux ans. Il mourut. Trois jours apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 enterr\u00e9, il apparut la nuit \u00e0 son fils et lui demanda \u00e0 manger; son fils le servit selon des desirs; il mangea et disparut. Le lendemain, le fils me raconta ce qui lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, me disant que bien certainement son p\u00e8re ne reviendrait pas pour une fois, et m'invitant a me mettre, la nuit suivante, \u00e0 une fen\u00eatre pour le voir entrer et sortir. J'\u00e9tais curieux de voir un vampire. Je me mis \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre; mais, cette nuit-la, il ne vint pas. Le fils me dit, alors, do ne pas me d\u00e9courager, qu'il viendrait probablement la nuit suivante.--La nuit suivante, je me remis donc \u00e0 ma fen\u00eatre, et, en effet, vers minuit, je reconnus parfaitement le vieillard. Il venait du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de cimeti\u00e8re; il marchait d'un bon pas; mais son pas ne faisait aucun bruit. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte, il frappa,; je comptai trois coups; les coups r\u00e9sonn\u00e8rent secs sur le ch\u00eane, comme si l'on eut frapp\u00e9 avec un os, et non avec un doigt. Le fils, vint ouvrir la porte, et le vieillard entra. . . .\n\n\"J'\u00e9coutais ce r\u00e9cit avec la plus grande attention, et je commen\u00e7ais \u00e0 pref\u00e8rer les entr'actes au m\u00e9lodrame.\n\n\"Ma curiosit\u00e9 \u00e9tait trop vivement excit\u00e9e, reprit men voisin,\n\np. 296\n\npour que je quittasse ma fen\u00eatre; j'y demeurai donc. Une demi-heure apr\u00e8s, le vieillard sortit; il retournait d'o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait venu, c'est-a-dire du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du cimetiere. A l'angle d'une muraille, il disparut. Presque au m\u00eame instant, ma porte s'ouvrit. Je me retournai vivement, c'\u00e9tait son fils. It \u00e9tait fort p\u00e2le. 'Et bien, lui dis-je, votre p\u00e8re est venu?--Oui . . . L'avez-vous vu entrer? Entrer et sortir. . . Qu'a-t-il fait aujourd'hui? Il m'a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 boire et \u00e0 manger, comme l'autre jour. Et il a bu et mang\u00e9? Il a bu et mang\u00e9 . . . Mais ce n'est pas le tout. . . voici ce qui m'inqui\u00e8te. . . Il m'a dit . . . Ah! il vous a parl\u00e9 pour autre chose que pour vous demander \u00e0, boire et a manger? . . . Oui, il m'a dit: 'Voici deux fois que je viens manger chez toi. C'est \u00e0 ton tour maintenant de venir manger chez moi.' Diable! . . . Je l'attends apr\u00e8s demain \u00e0 la m\u00eame heure. Diable! Diable! Eh! oui, justement, voil\u00e0 ce qui me tracasse.' Le surlendemain, on le trouva mort dans son lit! Ce m\u00eame jour, deux ou trois autres, personnes du m\u00eame village qui avaient vu aussi le vieillard, et qui lui avaient parl\u00e9, tomb\u00e8rent malades et moururent \u00e0 leur tour. Il fut donc reconnu que le vieillard \u00e9tait vampire. On s'informa aupr\u00e8s de moi; je racontai ce que favais vu et entendu. La justice se transporta au cimeti\u00e8re. On ouvrit les tombeaux de tous ceux qui \u00e9taient morts depuis six semaines; tous ces, cadavres \u00e9taient en d\u00e9composition. Mais, quand on en vint au tombeau de Kisilova,--c'\u00e9tait le nom du vieillard,--on le trouva les yeux ouverts, la bouche vermeille, respirant \u00e0 pleins poumons, et cependant immobile, comme mort. On lui enfon\u00e7a un pieu dans le coeur; il jeta un grand cri, et rendit le sang par le bouche; puis on le mit sur un b\u00fbcher, on le r\u00e9duisit en cendre, et l'on jeta la cendre au vent. . . . Quelque temps apr\u00e8s, je quittai le pays de sorte que je ne pus savoir si son fils \u00e9tait devenu vampire comme lui.\n\n\"Pourquoi serait-il devenu vampire comme lui? demandai-je.\n\n\"Ah! parce que c'est l'habitude, que les personnes qui meurent du vampirisme deviennent vampires.\n\n\"En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, vous dites cela comme si c'\u00e9tait un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n\"Mais c'est qu'aussi c'est un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9, connu, enregistr\u00e9!\"\n\nIt will readily be remembered that in Monte-Cristo when\n\np. 297\n\nduring the performance of Parisina at the Teatro Argentino, Rome, the Count and Haid\u00e9e enter their box, the Countess G------ directing her opera-glass in that direction asks Franz d'Epinay who they may be remarking that as for herself, \"All I can say is that the gentleman whose history I am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up; be looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!\" \"Oh, he is always as colourless as you now see him,\" said Franz. \"Then you know him?\" almost screamed the countess. \"Oh! pray do, for Heaven's sake, tell us all about--is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse, or what?\" A few moments later when the lady has carefully studied the loge of their mysterious vis-\u00e0-vis, Franz demands: \"Well, what do you think of our mysterious neighbour?\" \"Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living frame,\" was the reply. This fresh allusion to Byron drew a smile to Franz's countenance; although he could not but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him . . . . . Is it possible,\" whispered Franz, \"that you entertain any fear?\" \"I'll tell you,\" answered the countess. \"Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me he had seen some. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us. Oh! it is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect. The coal-black hair, large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems burning,-the same ghastly paleness!\"[40]\n\nNearly thirty years after Dumas in collaboration with Maquet utilized the theme of Le Vampire for his own drama of the same name which was given at the Ambigu-Comique, 20th December, 1851, and which may conveniently be considered here.\n\nLe Vampire is described as a \"Drame Fantastique en Cinq Actes, en Dix Tableaux\" and there are very many characters in this remarkable play. The principal parts were taken as follows: Lord Ruthwen, M. Arnault; Gilbert de Tiffauges, M. Goujet; Juan Rozo, a Spanish inn-keeper, M. Coquet;\n\np. 298\n\nBotaro, his son-in-law, M. Curcy; Lazare, M. Laurent; Lahenn\u00e9e, M. Thierry; Jarwick, M. Lavergne; the Ghoul, Mme. Lucie Mabire; H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Tiffauges, Mile. Jane Essler; Juana, Mile. Marie Clarisse; Antonia, Mlle. Daroux; Petra, Rozo's daughter, Mile. Helo\u00efse; and the mystic fairy M\u00e9lusine, Mlle. Isabelle Constant. Lazare is a capital character, but the intrusion from Oriental legend of the ghoul cannot be considered happy. On the other hand the appearance of M\u00e9lusine, whose legend was collected about the end of the fourteenth century by Jean d'Arras, is certainly effective and entirely in keeping with the history, since according to Paracelsus she was an occult power, and in folk lore she is often represented as protecting ancient houses--in Belgium she is the guardian of the old family de Gavre,--whilst one of her four sons became King of Brittany.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to do more than give the very briefest outline of the story as Dumas tells it. The play opens with a crowded scene of merrymakers in the patio of Juan Rozo's inn. They are celebrating the nuptials of his daughter with young Botaro, and every room is occupied by his friends. and acquaintance in festive mood. Juana, who is staying at the hostlery seeks for a guide to the castle of Tormenar, which lies at some little distance, for there she is to meet Don Luis de Figuerroa, whom she will wed upon the following day. She has secretly left the convent of Annunciades, where she was a boarder, since her father has other designs for her hand, and accordingly it is necessary that she should meet her betrothed in some lonely spot. But nobody, not even the good-natured Lazare, the servant of the inn, will conduct her to the haunted castle, \"un ch\u00e2teau qui est en ruine, un ch\u00e2teau qui ne loge que des reptiles, et qui n'h\u00e9berge que des fant\u00f4mes.\" However, a numerous company, amongst whom is Gilbert de Tiffauges, arrives at the inn, and these travellers on being told that they cannot be accommodated in spite of the fact that night is falling, incontinently resolve to take up their quarters in Tormenar, so in spite of the warnings about ghosts and goblins, having once well stocked themselves with wine and food they merrily set forth, Gilbert taking charge of Juana who has confided to him her story. However, a mysterious figure, a lady, apparently of rank, who has been staying at the inn watches them as they take\n\np. 299\n\ntheir departure and mutters to herself as she fixes her gaze upon Juana: \"Il te faut deux heures pour aller retrouver ton beau fianc\u00e9. . . . Je l'aurai joint dans trois minutes!\" She is in fact the ghoul, a female vampire, and with the speed of lightning she has gone to destroy the unfortunate Don Luis.\n\nIn the second Act we see the huge Gothic hall of the old castle. A door opens and from an inner chamber the ghoul rushes out exclaiming: \"Il \u00e9tait jeune! Il \u00e9tait beau! . . . Me voil\u00e0, redevenue jeune et belle!\" The voice of Gilbert is now heard, and with the cry, \"\u00c0 l'an prochain, Gilbert.\" she disappears from sight. It will be remarked that in his treatment of the vampire tradition Dumas has adopted the legend that the vampire must year by year rejuvenate his waning forces by absorbing the life of another and sucking from another's veins fresh blood, a detail which although it may recommend itself to, and legitimately be used by, the dramatist and the writer of romances is actually inexact and but rarely to be met with, and only then in folk-lore not of the first value. The travellers, no small party, spread their provisions upon the huge tables in the old hall and laughing at the stories of ghosts and apparitions are soon in convivial mood. The conversation, however, eventually turns on the supernatural and Gilbert tells of his old home in Brittany, where one room in the castle is hung with the tapestry of the Fairy M\u00e9lusine, representing this lady and all her attendants. The story goes that if any of the family sleeps in that room she will descend from the tapestry and reveal his fortune, warning him of danger should such threaten. Another companion who has sojourned in Epirus speaks of the vampires, the women who will attack men and leave them dead and sapless; the men who will attack women to drink their blood. Just as the words are uttered Lord Ruthwen enters and announces himself as a belated traveller, who, finding no room at Rozo's inn down in the village has made his way thither,-he has even taken Lazare into his service. Presently the company disperse to their several rooms to make themselves as comfortable as may be for the night in such difficult circumstances. To his horror Gilbert discovers in the chamber he is to occupy the body of a young man, strangely pale, with a slight wound in the throat. By a letter he finds near upon the body it is plain that this can be none other\n\np. 300\n\nthan the unfortunate Don Luis. At the same moment a piercing cry is heard, and Juana ghostly pale and dying totters from her room. Gilbert rushes to her assistance just in time to see Lord Ruthwen dart out after her as she falls dead at his feet. In a moment he has drawn his sword and strikes Ruthwen to the heart, before he recognizes who it may be. In faltering accents Ruthwen explains that hearing a cry he has gone to the assistance of the lady, and with his last breath he implores Gilbert, who is well-nigh distracted at the unhappy accident, to bear his body to the hillside, where it may be bathed in the earliest rays of the new moon. This Gilbert promises, and in the final tableau we see the body of Lord Ruthwen laid upon the mountain. The moon slowly issues from the clouds, and as its silver light falls upon the corpse it seems as though the eyes opened and the mouth smiled. A moment more and the Vampire leaps to his feet re-vitalized and with fresh energy for some new demoniac enterprise.\n\nIn Act III. we find ourselves in Brittany, about a year later, at the ch\u00e2teau de Tiffauges where H\u00e9l\u00e8ne awaits her brother's return. After an affectionate greeting he confides to her the secret of his love for Antonia a lady of Spalatro in Dalmatia, and she in her turn informs him that she is about to give her hand to the Baron de Marsden. This latter proves to be none other than Lord Ruthwen, who informs Gilbert that he was sore wounded indeed at Tormenar, but that certain kindly shepherds finding him on the mountain side nursed him back to life. Moreover, he explains his change of name by informing them that his elder brother having recently died, he has succeeded to the title and estates. Visiting Tiffauges in the hope of meeting Gilbert once more, he has fallen a victim to the charms of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. The explanation is cleverly contrived, but at the same time Gilbert is hardly convinced; he feels that there is some mysterious and terrible secret lurking in the background. A happy idea strikes him. He will sleep that night in the tapestry chamber of the lady M\u00e9lusine. The scene that follows must have been extraordinarily effective upon the stage. Gilbert is slumbering, and from their places in the tapestry step forth M\u00e9lusine and her court to warn the scion of her house that danger is near. From the framed canvas and the panels descend with stately stride\n\np. 301\n\nthe old barons to tell their descendant of the horror that encompasses him, M\u00e9lusine reveals the secret.\n\n\"Prions, pour qu' \u00e0 Gilbert Dieu tout-puissant inspire Un g\u00e9n\u00e9reux effort.\nRuthwen est un d\u00e9mon, Ruthwen est un vampire; Son amour, c'est la mort!\"\n\n(One cannot but recall the famous scene in Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore with its subtle admixture of beauty, fantasy and humour.)\n\nIn Act IV of Le Vampire we are shown the accomplishment of Ruthwen's designs against H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Gilbert's frenzied warnings and denunciations are heard with alarm but with unbelief. They whisper that he is a lunatic, and when Ruthwen relates a cunning story of a mischance in Spain which temporarily unsettled Gilbert's reason, a story that seems borne out in every detail by the unhappy brother's horror and despair, the attendants for his own safety seek to restrain their young master. Ruthwen triumphs. But now the ghoul appears and bids him take heed how he seeks Gilbert's life for that is hers, and she will not likely relinquish her prey. Ruthwen defies her and the two vampires part in horrid enmity. Lazare cautions H\u00e9l\u00e8ne that her brother's story is no figment, but it is too late, the vampire seizes his victim and as midnight strikes, he destroys his hapless bride and quaffs his fill from her veins. Too late Gilbert succeeds in forcing an entrance. There is a terrific struggle, and Ruthwen is hurled from the window into the depths of a tremendous valley.\n\nIn the last act we find that in order to escape the pursuit of Ruthwen, who has extricated himself unhurt but filled with designs of even more malignant vengeance, Gilbert has transported Antonia to Circassia. Here, however, we meet the ghoul who, disguising herself under the name of Ziska, obtained admittance to the castle in the quality of an attendant upon Antonia. She informs Gilbert that she alone can save his betrothed from the vampire, and at that moment the ghastly face of Ruthwen is actually seen peering through the window. She demands that he shall relinquish Antonia's hand, and accept her love though it be to death. He refuses to betray Antonia, and at length by a supreme act of renunciation she divulges the secret whereby the Vampire may be annihilated, although this revelation must put an end to her own\n\np. 302\n\nexistence. Ziska explains how Gilbert's sword is to be blessed by a priest with a certain occult formula and if the weapon thus consecrated be driven through the Vampire's heart it will once and for all rid the world of this infernal pest. Yet as she speaks she seems to vanish in flames and they hear her last sad sigh; \"Adieu pour ce monde! Adieu pour l'autre! Adieu pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9\"!\n\nThe final scene is a deserted cemetery. \"Tombes, cypr\u00e8s. Fond sombre et fantastique; neige sur la terre; lune rouge au ciel.\" The Vampire lies half in and half out of his grave, grinning hideously. Gilbert is standing near. \"Pour la derni\u00e8re fois, adore Dieu!\" he adjures. \"Non,\" yells the monster. \"Alors, desesp\u00e8re et meurs\"! cries Gilbert and plunges the hallowed sword into the monster's heart. The Vampire falls back into the grave, howling fearfully, and a heavy stone closing him in fast seals him there in the womb of the earth for ever and ever. \"Au nom du Seigneur, Ruthwen, je to scelle dans cette tombe pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9\", et Gilbert trace sur la pierre une croix que devient lumineuse. A great aureola fills the sky and. multitudes of rejoicing angels are seen. Among them are H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Juana, smiling in happiest benison, whilst there rises from the earth the body of Ziska, radiant and beautiful, to join the glorious throng among whose immortal ranks she is enrolled by the merits of her great act of renunciation and unselfish love.\n\nThis drama of Dumas is infinitely more elaborate than the play of Nodier, but I am not altogether certain whether it is in some respects so good a work. The first two acts attain a high level; the scene in the tapestry chamber would be most picturesque upon the stage; there are several other telling situations and effective speeches, but as a whole it is too prolix, and we feel that the episode of Antonia in particular is an anti-climax. Nor, as I have remarked before, although material use is made of the character, can one consider the figure of the ghoul entirely in keeping with the rest. Had the level of the opening scenes been maintained we should possess an excellent piece of work. But without concentration and compression that was hardly possible, and here we have the secret of Nodier's success. Although he has an occasional crudity, it may be, which Dumas might not have tolerated, so swift is his action, as is essential to\n\np. 303\n\nmelodrama, so cleverly does he engage the interest of his audience, that we have no time to criticize a roughness here and there, but are rather intent to follow the next turn of the tale.\n\nImmediately upon the furore created by Nodier's Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1819 vampire plays of every kind from the most luridly sensational to the most farcically ridiculous pressed on to the boards. A contemporary critic cries: \"There is not a theatre in Paris without its Vampire! At the Porte-Saint-Martin we have le Vampire; at the Vaudeville le Vampire again; at the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s les trois Vampires ou le clair de la lune.\"\n\nJean Larat[41] further mentions a play by Paul F\u00e9val, Le fils Vampire. The version by John Wilson Ross of The Loves of Paris, a romance, published by G. Vickers, 3, Catherine Street, Strand, 1846, is said to be \"Translated from the French of Paul F\u00e9val, author of 'The Vampire,' 'The Loves of the Palais-Royal,' 'The Receipt at Midnight,' 'Stella,' 'The Son of the Devil,' etc., etc.\", but it does not appear whether \"The Vampire\" mentioned here is a play or a romance. Probably it is the latter but no such translation is known.\n\nLe Vampire which was produced at the Vaudeville, 15 June, 1820,[42] is a com\u00e9dic-vaudeville in one act by Scribe and M\u00e9lesville. The scene is laid Hungary, \"une salle d'un chateau gothique,\" and the characters are as follows: Le Comte de Valberg, feld-mar\u00e9chal, M. Guillemin; Adolphe de Valberg, son n\u00e9veu, M. Isambert; le Baron do Lourdorff, M. Fontenay; Saussmann, concierge du chateau, M. Hippolyte; Charles, valet du comte, M. Fichet; un Notaire, M. Justin; Hermance de Mansfred, Madame Rivi\u00e8re; Nancy, sa soeur, Madame Lucie; P\u00e9ters, filleul de Saussmann, Madame Minette; with attendance of domestics and wedding guests. This elegant little piece opens with nuptials of Hermance de Mansfred at the castle of the Baron de Lourdorff, to whom she is betrothed. It appears that she has something trifled with the affections of Adolphe de Valberg, now supposed dead. Her sister, Nancy, acknowledges that she loved Adolphe, but kept silence owing to his courtship of Hermance. Adolphe's uncle, the Count de Valberg, who knows nothing of the two ladies, fearing his nephew is unworthily entangled has had him held in military detention at Temesvar, whence\n\np. 304\n\nhowever he has disappeared. The intrigue of the seventeen scenes, although clearly unravelled in the play, is a little complicated, and it must suffice to relate by an accident Adolphe appears at the castle. Upon being asked his name he answers: \"Lord Ruthwen. An Englishman,\" whereupon he is immediately taken to be a Vampire and the servants are thrown into a state of panic. Eventually he is reconciled to his uncle who recognizes him as the brave young hero by whom his life was saved on a recent battlefield; Nancy's fidelity is rewarded with the hand of the man she loves, and who now realizes that Hermance's heart was never his; so that the curtain falls upon a double wedding.\n\nSeveral Pretty lyrics are interwoven with the dialogue and Nancy's first song, to the air \"De sommeiller, encor ma ch\u00e8re from Fanchon la vielleuse, is as follows:\n\nOui, ces paysans respectables\nNous rapellent le bon vieux temps:\nChez eux on croit encore au diable,\nAux vampires, au revenants;\nOn croit \u00e0 toutes les magies,\nAux amours, aux soins assidus,\nAux grands sorciers, aux grands genies . . .\nBref \u00e0 tout ce qu'on ne voit plus!\n\nLes Trois Vampires, ou le clair de, la lune[43] which was being played at the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s is a thoroughly amusing farce in one act by Brazier, Gabriel, and Armand. It shows the adventures of a bon bourgeois, M. Gobetout, who has so distracted his brain by reading stories of Vampires and ghosts that when one night he sees in his garden three shadowy figures he is well nigh beside himself with terror as he supposes they can be no other than three vampires infesting his house. A little later he catches sight of his two daughters and their abigail who appear actually to be eating with the mysterious strangers. \"Les vampires qui soupent avec mes filles!\" he groans in accents of despair. However it proves that the supper is very material, cold chicken and a glass of good wine, whilst the rendezvous is of an amorous nature, since the visitors are two young sparks and their valet. So the play ends with a triple marriage. One remark of the worthy M. Gobetout was, it is said, nightly greeted with a hurricane of applause. He was wont to murmur in pensive accents: \"Les vampires\n\np. 305\n\nil nous viennent d'Angleterre . . . C'est encore une gentilesse de ces Messieurs . . . ils nous font de jolis cadeaux!\"\n\nAnother farce, Encore un Vampire, which when produced in 1820 at Paris, met with considerable success, was published as by Emile B. L., and yet another vampire burlesque was contributed by A. Rousseau. Les Etrennes d'un Vampire at a minor theatre was billed as from a manuscript \"trouv\u00e9 au cimiti\u00e8re de P\u00e8re-Lachaise.\"\n\nMore amusing is the work of D\u00e9saugiers who in August, 1820, gave Cadet Buteux, vampire, avec relation v\u00e9ridique du prologue et des trois actes de cet \u00e9pouvantable m\u00e9lodrame \u00e9crit sous la dict\u00e9e de ce passeux du Gros Caillou, par son secretaire, D\u00e9saugiers. When published by Rosa, 1820, this libretto bore the motto: \"Vivent les morts!\"\n\nYet another burlesque published by Martinet, 1820, is Le Vampire, m\u00e9lodrame en trois actes, paroles de Pierre de la Fosse de la rue des Morts.[44] A few verses from this vaudeville may be interesting to quote, particularly as showing the long continued popularity of Nodier's melodrama.\n\nLisant pour un sou d'politique\nPlac' Royale, sur un banc,\nJ'tombe, le tour est diabolique,\nA' point nomm\u00e9, sur l'Drapeau blanc.\n\nJ'prends un billet, non pas pour le parterre,\nCes places sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux amis,\nSans l'secours de l'abb\u00e9 Saint-Pierre,\nAvec treiz sous' j'monte au paradis.\n\nAu dernier bane, paix, qu'chacun s'taise\nA' bas la gueule on crie du premier rang,\nL'rideau s'l\u00e8ve et quoique tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l'aise,\nLe croirez-vous, j'vois le P\u00e8re Lachaise,\nDu dernier bane.\n\nThe Vampire is described as \"d'\u00e9chapp\u00e9 de corbillard,\" One sees everywhere\n\nDes fant\u00f4ms, des revenans,\nMettant la t\u00e9te a la fen\u00eatre,\nAfin d'regarder les passans.\n\nThere was even a Polichinel Vampire which when performed at the Circus Maurice in 1822 attracted all who had a mind\n\np. 306\n\nfor a hearty laugh, and a contemporary visitor[45] to Paris merrily wrote that \"Polichinel is the very jolliest fellow in the world.\"[46]\n\nA comic operetta in one act, Le Vampire by Martin Joseph Mengals which was produced at Ghent, 1 March, 1826, deserves no more than passing mention.\n\nJames Robinson Planch\u00e9 speedily adapted Nodier's Le Vampire as The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles, and his version with music by Joseph Binns Hart[47] was brought out at the English Opera House, 9th August, 1820, with T. P. Cooke[48] as Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire. Owing to his fine acting in the part, and perhaps a little to the scenic effects--the scene is laid in the Caverns of Staffa--the play was given nightly to packed houses. It is interesting to remark that for this piece the celebrated vampire trap was invented. Of this I quote the following simple description: \"A vampire trap consists of two or more flaps, usually india-rubber, through which the sprite can disappear almost instantly, where he falls into a blanket fixed to the under surface of the stage. As with the star trap, this trap is secured against accidents by placing another piece or slide, fitting close beneath when not required, and removed when the prompter's bell gives the signal to make ready.\"\n\nThe following account of the production of The Vampire is given by Planch\u00e9 in his Recollections and Reflections, Chapter III.[49] Having just spoken of an Easter piece with which he had furnished Drury Lane, Abudah, or, The Talisman of Oromanes,[50] founded upon one of the Tales of the Genii[51] and which although it had a run of nine nights Planch\u00e9 calls a very poor piece, \"miserably put on the stage,\" he continues to speak of a subsequent success, and tells us: \"A more fortunate melodrama of mine, \"The Vampire, or The Bride of the Isles,\" was produced at the Lyceum, or English Opera House, as it was then called, 9th August, 1820. Mr. Samuel James Arnold, the proprietor and manager, had placed in my hands, for adaptation, a French melodrama, entitled \"Le Vampire,\" the scene of which was laid, with the usual recklessness of French dramatists, in Scotland, where the superstition never existed. I vainly endeavoured to induce Mr. Arnold to let me change it to some place in the East of Europe. He had set his heart on Scotch music and dresses--\n\np. 307\n\nthe latter, by the way, were in stock--laughed at my scruples, assured me that the public would neither know nor care--and in those days they certainly did not--and therefore there was nothing left for me but to do my best with it. The result was most satisfactory to the management. The situations were novel and effective; the music lively and popular; the cast strong, comprising T. P. Cooke, who made a great hit in the principal character, Harley, Bartley, Pearman, Mrs. Chatterley and Miss Love. The trap now so well known as \"the Vampire trap\" was invented for this piece, and the final disappearance of the Vampire caused quite a sensation. The melodrama had a long run, was often revived, and is to this day a stock piece in the country. I had an opportunity many years afterwards, however, to treat the same subject in a manner much more satisfactory to myself, and, as it happened, in the same theatre, under the same management; but of that anon.\"\n\nThe full cast of The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles was originally as follows: \"In the Introductory Vision\"; Unda, Spirit of the Flood, Miss Love; Ariel, Spirit of the Air, Miss Worgman; The Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Lady Margaret, Mrs. Chatterly. \"In the Drama \": Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Ronald, Baron of the Isles, Mr. Bartley; Robert, an English Attendant on the Baron, Mr. Pearman; M'Swill, the Baron's Henchman, Mr. Harley; Andrew, Steward to Ruthven, Mr. Minton; Father Francis, Mr. Shaw; Lady Margaret, Daughter of Ronald, Mrs. Chatterly; Effie, Daughter of Andrew, Miss Carew; Bridget Lord Ronald's Housekeeper, Mrs. Grove. With regard to the costumes of which Planch\u00e9 speaks it is interesting to remark that the principal characters Ruthven and Lady Margaret are described as follows: Ruthven, Silver breast plate, studded with steel buttons; plaid kilt; philibeg; flesh arms and leggings; sandals; Scotch hat and feathers; sword and dagger. Lady Margaret, white satin dress, trimmed with plaid and silver; plaid silk sash; Scotch hat and feather. This is in the true transpontine tradition of Ossianic attire. The play is timed to take one hour and thirty minutes in representation-and Planch\u00e9 has done his work of adaptation very well, although I doubt whether his few slight departures from the original are improvements. Nevertheless he has\n\np. 308\n\ngiven the dialogue a native turn and an ease which were at this period too often lacking in similar versions from the French.\n\nIn 1825, T. P. Cooke visited Paris and appeared as Le Monstre at the Porte-Saint-Martin in Planch\u00e9's melodrama which proved a remarkable success, running for no less than eighty nights.\n\nThe Vampire or The Bride of the Isles has its place among the repertory of Hodgson's \"Juvenile Drama,\" and this in itself is an indication of no small popularity.\n\nIn The Second Maiden's Tragedy,[52] a Globe play of 1611, licensed for the stage by Sir George Buc on 31st October of that year, a macabre drama now generally attributed to Tourneur,[53] there are some remarkable scenes which culminate in something very like necrophilia, and a perverse ill-omened melancholy pervades the whole action. In Act IV the Tyrant, a usurper, ordering soldiers to attend him with \"Lanthornes and a pickax\" makes his way at midnight to the Cathedral, crying:\n\nDeath nor the marble prison my love sleeps in\nShall keep her body lockt up from mine arms.\nI must not be so cozened.\n\nA little later: \"Enter the Tirant agen at a farder dore, which opened, bringes hym to the Toombe wher the Lady lies buried; The Toombe here discouered ritchly set forthe.\" He adjures the sepulchre:\n\nThe house of silence and the Calms of rest\nAfter tempestuous life, I claim of thee\nA mistress one of the most beauteous sleepers\nThat ever lay so cold.\n\nThe vault is forced, whilst the lover soliloquizes:\n\nO the moon rises; what reflection\nIs thrown about the sanctified building,\nE'en in a twinkling, how the monuments glisten\nAs if Death's palaces were all massy silver\nAnd scorned the name of marble. Art thou cold?\nI have no faith in't, yet I believe none.\nMadam; 'tis I, sweet lady, pry'thee speak\n'Tis thy love calls on thee; thy king, thy servant.\nNo! not a word, all prisoners to pale silence\nI'll prove a kiss.\n\np. 309\n\nFirst Soldier:\n\nHere's chill venery!\n'Twould make a pandar's heels ache. I'll be sworn\nAll my teeth chatter in my head to see't.\n\nTyrant:\n\nBy th' mass, thou'rt cold indeed. Beshrew thee for't,\nUnkind to thine own blood? Hard hearted lady,\nWhat injury hast thou offered to the youth\nAnd pleasure of thy days: refuse the Court\nAnd steal to this hard lodging, was that wisdom\n.      .      .      .      Since thy life has left me\nI'll clasp the body for the spirit that dwelt in't,\nAnd love the house still for the mistress' sake.\nThou art mine now spite of destruction\nAnd Govianus; and I will possess thee.\nI once read of a Herod whose affection.\nPursued a virgin's love as I did thine,\nWho for the hate she owed him killed herself\n(As thou too rashly didst), without all pity;\nYet he preserved her body dead in honey,\nAnd kept her long after her funeral:\nBut I'll unlock the treasure house of art\nWith keys of gold and bestow all on thee\nHere slaves receive her humbly from our arms,\n.      .      .      .      So reverently\nBear her before us gently to our palace.\nPlace you the stone again where we first found it.\n\nAfter a while the scene is in the palace: \"They bringe the Body in a Chaire drest up in black veluet which setts out the pailenes of the handes and face, And a faire Chayne of pearle crosse her brest and the Crucyfex aboue it; He standes silent awhile letting the Musique play, beeknyng the soldiers that bringe her in to make obeisaunce to her, and he hym self makes a lowe honour to the body and kisses the hande. A song within in Voyces.\n\nSong:\n\nO what is Beauty that's so much adored\nA flattring glass that cozens her beholders.\nThe Night of Death makes it look pale and horrid\nThe Daynty preseru'd flesh how soone it molders\nTo loue it lyuinge it bewitchett manye\nBut after life is seldom heard of any.\"\n\nTyrant:\n\nHow pleasing art thou to us even in death\nI love thee yet, above all women living\nAnd shall do seven years hence. p. 310\nI can see nothing to be mended in thee\nBut the too constant paleness of thy cheek.\nI'd give the kingdom, but to purchase there\nThe breadth of a red Rose, in natural colour,\nAnd think it the best bargain that ever king made yet,\nBut Fate's my hinderer,\nAnd I must only rest content with Art,\nAnd that I'll have in spite on't.\n\nAccordingly an artist in painting and perfumery is summoned to adorn the face of the corpse and give it a fresh lively red colour. However this merchant of cosmetics is none other than Govianus, the rightful heir, disguised, and he fucuses the dead cheeks and lips with a peter which is confected with a strong poison, so that when the Tyrant lustfully kisses the cold flesh, he is blasted with the venom and falls in the agonies of death. The incident is extremely powerful, if extremely horrible. As the Tyrant expires Govianus taunts him thus\n\nO thou sacrilegious villain,\nThou thief of rest, robber of monuments,\nCannot the body after funeral\nSleep in the grave for thee? Must it be raised?\nOnly to please the wickedness of thine eye?\nDoes all things end with death and not thy lust?\nHast thou devised a new way to damnation,\nMore dreadful than the soul of any sin\nDid ever pass yet between earth and hell?\n\nA very large number of plays are founded upon what may be termed the \"Romeo and Juliet\" motive, the awakening, or the restoration to life in some sort, of a loved one supposed dead, arousing from a trance, it may be, or a coma, a theme admitting almost innumerable variants. In the Italian, French and German theatres alone--nor does this rough list pretend to be exhaustive--we have Sforza d' Oddi's Imorti vivi (1576); Pagnini's Imorti vivi (1600); Rota's La morta viva (1674); Douville's Les morts vivans (1654); Quinault's Le fant\u00f4me amoureux (1659); Boursault's Le Mort vivant (1662); Sedaine's Der Tote ein Freyer (1778); Kurl\u00e4nder's Der tote Neffe; Friedrich Rambach's Der Scheintote; Leopold Huber's Der Scheintote; Theodore Friedrich's Die Scheintoten; F. L. W. Meyer's Der Verstorbene; G. Lebrun's Die Verstorbenen; Tenelli's Der Verstorbene; Holbein's \"romantisches Gem\u00e4lde\" Der Verstorbene; Paers' opera Die lebenden Toten; and a ballet\n\np. 311\n\n(1803) Der lebendige Tote; cum multis aliis quae nunc perscribere longum est.\n\nIt may be convenient here briefly to review the progress of the Vampire in the theatre, at least in his most important appearances.\n\nAn Italian opera, I vampiri, the work of the much applauded Neapolitian composer Silvestro di Palma, which was performed at the Teatro San Carlo[54] in 1800 did not of course take anything from the novel by Polidori which indeed, it preceded by nearly twenty years. but was rather inspired by the famous treatise of Guiseppe Davanzati: Dissertazione sopra i Vampiri di Gioseppe Davanzati Patrizio Fiorentino e Tranese, Cavaliere Gerosolimitano, Arcivescovo di Trani, e Patriarca d'Alessandria. (Seconda edizione.) Nalopi. M.D.CC.LXXXIX. Presso Filippo Raimondi. Con licenzi de' Superiori.\n\nOn 28th March, 1828,[65] at Leipzig, was produced an opera, \"Grosse romantische Oper,\" Der Vampyr, founded on the original French melodrama, the scene being changed from Scotland to Hungary. The libretto is by Wilhelm August Wohlbr\u00fcck and the music by his yet more famous brother-in-law Heinrich August Marschner. Der Vampyr was an enormous success. A free adaptation of this being made by J. R. Planch\u00e9, and produced at the Lyceum, 25th August, 1829, it ran for sixty nights. In his Recollections and Reflections which have before been quoted, Planch\u00e9 commences Chapter X by some account of this. \"In the summer of 1829 I had the opportunity of treating the subject of 'The Vampire' in accordance with my own ideas of propriety. The French melodrama had been converted into an opera for the German stage, and the music composed by Marschner.\n\n\"Mr. Hawes, who had obtained a score of it, having induced Mr. Arnold to produce it at the Lyceum, I was engaged to write the libretto, and consequently laid the scene of action in Hungary, where the superstition exists to this day, substituted for a Scotch chieftain a Wallachian Boyard, and in many other respects improved upon my earlier version. The opera was extremely well sung, and the costumes novel as well as correct, thanks to the kindness of Dr. Walsh, the traveller,[66] who gave me some valuable information respecting the national dresses of the Magyars and the Wallachians.\n\np. 312\n\n\"I am surprised that Marschner's most dramatic and melodious works, 'Der Vampyr,' 'Die Judin,' &c., have not been introduced to our more advanced musical audiences at one or other of our great operatic establishments.\n\n\"The production of 'Der Vampyr' was followed by that of 'The Brigand' at Drury Lane.\"\n\nPolidori's tale formed the basis of a romantic opera in three acts, the libretto of which was from the pen of C. M. Heigel, and the music by p. von Lindpaintner. This was seen at Stuttgart on 2 Ist September, 1828, and it proved a remarkable success. It was announced as being from \"Byron's famous tale,\" although at this date such an attribution can hardly have deceived any.\n\nOn 25th May, 1857, there was produced in Berlin a \"Komischen Zauber-Ballet Morgano\" by Paul Taglioni with music by J. Hertzel. The scene is laid in Hungary during the seventeenth century, and in the sixth tableau Elsa dances an infernal lavolta with the vampires in their haunted castle, but she is rescued by her lover, Retzka, who slays the vampire Morgano with a consecrated poniard. In 1861 at Milan appeared a ballet by Rotta, Il vampiro, with music by Paolo Giorza. Guten Abend Herr Fischer! oder, Der Vampyr is a light vaudeville in one act by G. Belly and G. L\u00f6ffler, with music by W. Telle, which had some success in its day. Ein Vampyr by Ulrich Franks (Ulla Wolf) given at Vienna in 1877 is a farce taken from Scribe.\n\nIn England Dion Boucicault's[57] The Vampire, in three acts was produced at the Princess's Theatre, London, 19th June, 1852, when the author made his first appearance before a metropolitan audience. Of this drama the following criticism, if criticism it may be called, was given by Henry Morley in his \"Journal of a London Playgoer.\" It must be remembered that Morley continually shows himself extremely prejudiced and his censure must not be taken any more seriously than we regard the ill-word of many critics to-day, for example, the shrill petulant piping and the childish miffs of St. John Ervine in the sullens. Under 19th June Morley writes: \"If there be any truth in the old adage, that 'when things are at the worst they must mend,' the bettering of Spectral Melodrama is not distant; for it has reached the extreme point of inanity in the new piece which was produced on\n\np. 313\n\nMonday at the Princess's Theatre, under the attractive title of The Vampire.\n\n\"Its plot is chiefly copied from a piece which some years ago turned the Lyceum into a Chamber of Horrors; but it has been spun out into three parts, facetiously described as 'Three Dramas': the little period of a century has been interposed between each part; and, in order that the outrage on the possible shall be complete, the third part is projected forward into the year that will be 1860! By this ingenious arrangement, the resuscitation of the original Vampire has been enabled to supply the lovers of the revolting at the Princess's with three acts of murder--that is, two consumated, and one attempted; but, as the delicate process of vampirical killing is exactly after the same pattern in each case, the horror is quite worn out before the career of the creature terminates. Nothing but tedious trash remains.\n\n\"To 'an honest ghost' one has no objection; but an animated corpse which goes about in Christian attire, and although never known to eat, or drink, or shake hands, is allowed to sit at good men's feasts; which renews its odious life every hundred years by sucking a young lady's blood, after fascinating her by motions which resemble mesmerism burlesqued; and which, notwithstanding its well-purchased longevity, is capable of being killed during its term in order that it may be revived by moonbeams--such a ghost as this passes all bounds of toleration.\n\n\"The monster of absurdity was personated by its reviver Mr. Boucicault, with due paleness of visage, stealthiness of pace, and solemnity of tone; the scenery, especially a moonlit ridge amidst the heights of Snowdon, was beautiful, and the costumes were prettily diversified; but the dreary repetition of fantastical horror almost exhausted even the patience which a benefit enjoins. Unfortunately, the mischief of such a piece, produced at a respectable theatre, does not end with the weariness of the spectators, who come to shudder and remain to yawn; for it is not only 'beside the purpose of playing,' but directly contravenes it; and though it may be too dull to pervert the tastes of those who witness its vapid extravagances, it has power to bring discredit on the most genial of arts.\"\n\nIt may be pointed out that this account, probably through ignorance, possibly of intent, is deliberately inaccurate. p. 314 Although confessedly a poorer play than Planch\u00e9's The Vampire Dion Boucicault's drama is not derived from the earlier piece, but both are taken from the same source, Polidori's romance. Seeing that Henry Morley was Emeritus Professor of English Literature in University College, London, it were reasonable to suppose that he should have been acquainted with Polidori's novella. Or perhaps I rather ought to say that therefor it was not to be expected he should have known of this famous work.\n\nBoucicault afterwards revived The Vampire as The Phantom, and this was given in London with good applause. The American cast of the characters of The Phantom, \"As Produced at Wallack's Theatre, New York City,\" is as follows: In Act I (1645), The Phantom, Dion Boucicault; Lord Albert Clavering, Mr. J. B. Howe; Sir Hugh Neville of Graystock, Mr. Ralton; Sir Guy Musgrave, Mr. Etynge; Ralph Gwynne, Mr. Levere; Davy, Mr. T. B. Johnstone; Lucy Peveryl, Miss Agnes Robertson; Ellen, Miss Alleyne; Maud, Miss Ada Clare; Janet, Mrs. H. P. Grattan. In Act II (1750), Alan Raby, Dion Boucicault; Colonel Raby, Mr. Ralton; Edgar, his nephew, Mr. J. B. Howe; Dr. Rees, Mr. Burnett; Curate, Mr. Paul; Corporal Stump, Mr. Peters; Ada Raby, Miss Agnes Robertson; Jenny, Mrs. L. H. Allen.\n\nSubsequently, I presume when The Phantom was given in London, some modifications were made which seem to me most decidedly to be improvements. The first act was placed in the latter part of the reign of Charles II, and two hundred years were supposed to elapse between the first and the second acts. This necessitated trifling changes in the dialogue at certain points; and naturally a complete alteration of costume to a modern style for Act II. In fact the script of the play which is printed in Dicks' Standard Plays, No. 697, (c. 1887) under \"Costume\" gives the following direction\": \"The costumes in the First Act are of the period of the latter part of the reign of Charles the Second. In the Second Art the respective characters are dressed in the provincial costume of Wales at the middle of the present century, The following description of Alan Raby's costume for each act will show the necessity of a complete change in the style of dress which this drama requires.\n\nAlan Raby.--First Act: A Puritan's suit of black serge, bound with black velvet---cloak and breeches to match-black\n\np. 315\n\nbelt and buckle-black gauntlets---shirt collar thrown back so as to show the throat bare-black stockings-black velvet shoes with strap across the instep--black sugar-loaf hat and broad riband and steel buckle--phosphoric livid countenance--slightly bald head--long black lank hair combed behind the ears--bushy black eyebrows and heavy black moustache. 2nd dress: Black dress coat and overcoat of the same colour--black trousers--black waistcoat--black kid gloves, white wristbands over them--white cravat and black German hat--all modern, and such as would be worn by a gentleman at the present time.\" In the theatre such a contrast would have proved very effective.\n\nI notice that Boucicault has in certain scenes borrowed his situations pretty freely from Le Vampire of Dumas, and occasionally he has even conveyed actual dialogue from the French play.\n\nAt the commencement of The Phantom we are shown a room in a Welsh inn, and it appears that Davy and Janet the hostess have just been married. A sudden storm sends Lucy Peveryl thither for shelter, and she confides to Janet that she is on her way to meet at sundown her cousin Roland Peveryl, who is a fugitive and proscribed. On this account he dare not openly seek her hand, but the lovers are secretly betrothed. He has promised to meet her, in order to bid her farewell for a time, in the most unfrequented spot, the ruins of Raby Castle. No sooner does Janet hear that name than she cries out with horror, and speaks of a fearful story connected with the place. They are interrupted by the arrival of Lord Clavering with a party of guests, amongst whom are friends of Lucy. She frankly informs them of her rendezvous, and they decide to accompany her, more especially as the inn has not sufficient accommodation for the travellers, who resolve to take provisions and wine and spend the night in the deserted chambers of the old castle. Davy endeavours to prevent them, nor are his efforts altogether selfish. He tells them: \"No one ever sought a night's shelter in the ruins of Raby Castle, that ever lived to see the morning. . . . Within the ruins of Raby dwells some terrible thing--man or fiend! . . . No traveller that knows the road will ever venture near that spot after nightfall; but strange wayfarers, benighted in the storm have wandered to this place of shelter, and the next morning they are found--dead--each with a wound in his throat in the right side, from which they\n\np. 316\n\nhave evidently bled to death;--but no blood is spilt around, the face is white and fixed, as if it had died of horror.\" \"And he, my betrothed,\" cries Lucy, \"Roland is there.\" Nevertheless the company laugh at these old stories and determine to make their way to the old castle. This they actually find in far better state than they have been led to expect, and their servants who have insisted upon Davy showing them the way soon get a very fair supper from the provisions they have purchased at his inn. Roland Peveryl is not to be found, but whilst they are eating a stranger enters, a Puritan, and announces himself as Gervase Rookwood, a traveller who has lost his way in the mountains. Davy, however, almost collapses with terror. He recollects that many years before the castle belonged to Sir Owen Raby, a noble cavalier, while Alan Raby, his younger brother had joined the forces of Cromwell. Taking advantage of this difference the traitor one midnight with a band of Puritan soldiers surprises the castle, and butchers the sleeping garrison, killing his brother with his own hand. About a year later, however, the tables are turned, the Royalists recapture the place, Alan Raby is seized, and in their rage they hurl the fratricide from a window which hung shudderingly over a fearful precipice. Curiously enough no trace of the body could ever be recovered. But Davy recognizes that Gervase Rookwood is none other than Alan Raby. Here we have the old belief that a man guilty of some, monstrous crime, in this case rebellion against the King and the murder of a brother, is compelled to return as a vampire. When the company disperse to their various apartments for the night Lord Clavering is horrified to discover in his room the dead body of young Roland Peveryl, \"a wound deep in his throat, but bloodless.\" At the same moment a piercing scream is heard and Lucy Peveryl rushing from her chamber with her hands wildly clasping her neck falls dead in Lord Clavering's arms. Seeing as he thinks a shadowy form that steals from her room he draws a pistol and fires. When the company hurry in with lights they discover Alan Raby has been shot. In faltering accents the dying man explains that hearing a cry for help he hastened to the lady's assistance. He will only forgive Lord Clavering on one condition. \"When I have breathed my last, let my body be conveyed amongst the peaks of Snowdon, and there exposed to the first rays of the rising\n\np. 317\n\nmoon which touch the earth.\" This is done, and the first act concludes with a tableau of the peaks of Snowdon, whilst from behind the clouds there sails high in the heaven a silver sickle that strikes the corpse with her argent shaft of mystic light. The vampire wakes, and leaps to his feet crying in exultant tones: \"Fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. Death! I defy thee!\"\n\nIt cannot escape notice that in this act there are many parallels with Le Vampire of Dumas. Raby Castle is the Castle of Tormenar; Lucy Peveryl is Juana; Roland Peveryl, Don Luis de Figuerroa; Lord Clavering, Gilbert de Tiffauges; and Davy the gracioso Lazare.\n\nTwo centuries have flown. Raby Castle is now inhabited in possession of Colonel Raby, whose daughter is betrothed to her cousin Edgar. It has been falsely reported that this latter fell in battle, but the scene opens with his return. When the sad news first arrived Ada Raby was stricken almost to death, and, as they believed, actually died; but she was recalled to life by a mysterious stranger, since which hour she seems to, have fallen completely under his influence and in some extraordinary way only to respond to his power. This is none other than Gervase Rookwood, who now appears and informs Colonel Raby that he and none other is the lawful lord of Raby Castle. The Colonel's claim lies in the fact that when years before the last of the old Raby family, Sir Alan Raby died, or rather was killed, and no will could be found, the estate reverted to a distant branch of the Rabys, now represented by the Colonel. However, a document is produced in the handwriting of Alan Raby, his will, wherein he bequeaths the estate to Gervase Rookwood and the Rookwood successors. It seemed as though such a title cannot be resisted, but Doctor Rees, a scholar of occultism, is filled with the gravest suspicions of the stranger. In a \"Dictionary of Necromancy, a rare work by Dr. Dee,\" he has read of vampires, and he divines the demoniac nature of the pretended Rookwood. In a trancelike state Ada Raby has rejected Edgar and is to be given to the stranger, when Dr. Rees examining the documents discovers that the will of Sir Alan Raby, which must be some two hundred years old, although the hand is doubtless that of Raby as the archives prove, is written upon paper which has a watermark of 1850, \"scarcely five years old.\" The vampire who\n\np. 318\n\nendeavours to assassinate Edgar, is killed by a charmed bullet. Whilst his limbs relax in death the hypnotic spell vanishes from Ada's mind and she is united to her lover. But to their horror they notice that as the moonlight touches the body of Alan Raby where he has fallen, his members begin to twitch anew with life. Dr. Rees seizes the vampire and hurls the body into the darkest chasm of the mountain side, where no beam nor ray can ever penetrate or find the smallest chink of entrance.\n\nThe Phantom is, of course, somewhat old-fashioned and a little stilted, as was the mode, in its diction. No doubt some of the situations could be revised and far more neatly turned, yet on the whole I conceive that it should prove of its kind excellent fare in the theatre, and some scenes, at least, in capable hands were not without emotional appeal, I had almost said a certain impressiveness. Far worse dramas have (not undeservedly) earned their meed of approbation and applause.\n\nOn 15th August, 1872, was advertised: \"Royal Strand Theatre. Production of a Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, entitled 'The Vampire,' written by R. Reece.\" There was indeed a bounteous bill of fare. At seven was given a farce, The Married Bachelor; at 7.30 Byron's Not Such a Fool as He Looks; \"At Half Past Nine the new and original Burlesque, a little Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, called The Vampire, written by R. Reece. The new Music by John Fitzgerald, the New Scenery Painted by H. P. Hall; Dresses by May, Mrs. Richardson and Assistants; Machinery by Wood; Properties by Ball. The Piece produced under the direction of Mrs. Swanborough, Mr. J. Wallace, and Mr. Reece.\" The house, says the Era, 18th August, 1872, was crowded for this \"satirical burlesque.\" His play, the author wrote, was founded upon \"a German legend, Lord Byron's story, and a Boucicaultian drama.\" The Vampire, according to Reece, is a plagiarist who lives on other people's brains. The title r\u00f4le was acted by Edward Terry who kept the audience in roars of laughter. \"Mr. Terry's make-up as the Vampire was something extraordinary, and he worked with unflagging energy to add 'go' to the novelty.\" During a picnic in the ruins of Raby Castle the Vampire endeavours to steal the note books of Ada Raby (Miss Emily Pitt) and Lady Audley Moonstone (Mrs. Raymond) two lady novelists, so that he may utilize their efforts for his weekly instalment of the \"penny dreadful\" and other fiction.\n\np. 319\n\nHe is attacked by the two lovers of the ladies, Lord Albert Clavering (Miss Bella Goodall) and Edgar (Miss Topsy Venn), and a good deal of broadest farce follows. \"The author was cordially greeted upon his appearance before the curtain, and the latest Strand burlesque may be noted as an undoubted success.\" The Illustrated London News, 24th August, 1872, although very justly doubting the propriety of the subject as a theme for travesty highly praised Edward. Terry \"as the Hibernian plagiarist with the broadest of brogues and the most ghastly of faces.\" As Allan Raby he haunts the ruins of Raby Castle, Raby Hall, and the Peak of Snowdon, seeking to filch the notebooks of tourists, \"from which he may gather materials for a three-volume novel which he has been engaged by a publisher to compose.\"\n\nOn Monday, 27th September, 1909, at the Paragon Theatre was produced The Vampire, a \"two-scene sketch,\" adapted by Mr. Jos\u00e9 G. Levy from the French of Mme. C. le Vylars and Pierre Souvestre. \"It is a capitally written little piece conceived. in the grand Guignol vein;\" The Stage, 30th September, 1909. The first scene is Harry le Strang's smoking-room. Harry has been infatuated with a demi-mondaine named Sonia, who shot herself in a fit of remorse. The despairing lover is in communication with a Hindoo spiritualist Seratsih, who has evoked the spirit of the dead woman, now become a vampire and preying upon Harry's vitality and reason. An old friend, Jack Harlinger, in order as he thinks to save the situation persuades his own fianc\u00e9e, Olga Kay, to personate the ghost of Sonia. The result is swift tragedy, for the maddened Harry le Strang shoots her dead destroying the vampire, whilst he himself falls at the revolver of Jack Harlingen Harry le Strang was played by Charles Hanbury; Jack Harlinger, Lauderdale Maitland; Seratsih, Clinton Barrett; and Olga Kay, Janet Alexander. The piece was very well received.\n\nThe Vampire, a Tragedy in Five Acts, by St. John Dorset (the Rev. Hugo John Belfour), Second Edition, 1821,[60] does not appear to have been acted. It was dedicated to W. G. Macready, Esq., whose kindness the author acknowledges in most grateful terms. The story is Oriental, the same being laid in Alexandria, and it is a \"moral\" vampire that is shown by the poet. In his \"advertisement\" he quotes a passage\n\np. 320\n\nfrom the Examiner, when noticing Planch\u00e9's melodrama wrote: \"There are Vampires who waste the heart and happiness of those they are connected with, Vampires of avarice, Vampires of spleen, Vampires of debauchery, Vampires in all the shapes of selfishness and domestic tyranny.\" This is his theme, and although his pages have considerable merit I do not conceive that his scenes would have been entirely successful on the stage, since they are poetical and reflective rather than dramatic,\n\nIn Germany sensational fiction was long largely influenced by Polidori, and we have such romances as Zschokke's Der tote Gast, Spindler's Der Vampyr und seine Braut, Theodor Hildebrand's Der Vampyr, oder die Totenbraut. Edwin Bauer's roman \u00e0 clef the clever Der Baron Vampyr,\" which was published at Leipzig in 1846, hardly concerns as here, whilst Ewald August K\u00f6nig's sensational Ein moderner Vampyr,[62] which appeared in 1883, or Franz Hirsch's Moderne Vampyr,[63] 1873, productions which only use in their titles the word \"Vampire\" to attract,--one might say, to ensnare attention, are in this connexion no more deserving of consideration than mere chap-books and pedlar's penny-ware such as Morelli's Der Vampyr, and Dr. Seltzam's pornographic Die Vampyre der Residenz.\n\nUndoubtedly the vampire tradition has never been treated with such consummate skill as by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier in his exquisite prose poem La Morte Amoureuse, which first appeared in the Chronique de Paris on 23rd and 26th June, 1836, when the young author was not quite twenty-five. Although the theme is not original yet perhaps nowhere beside has it been so ingeniously moulded with such delicacy of style, with such rich and vivid colouring, with such emotion and such repression. The darker shadows of the tradition are suggested rather than portrayed, yet none can deny that there is an atmosphere of sombre mystery, even a touch of morbid horror which with complete artistry the writer allows us to suspect rather than to comprehend. The very vagueness of the relation adds to the illusion. We hardly know whether Romuald is the young country priest occupied in prayer and good works, or whether he is the Renaissance seignior living a life of passion and hot extravagance. As he himself cries: \"Sometimes I thought I was a priest who dreamed every night that be was a nobleman, sometimes that I was a nobleman who dreamed that he was a\n\np. 321\n\npriest. I could no longer distinguish dreams from real life; I did not know where reality began and illusion ended. The dissolute, supercilious young lord jeered at the priest, and the priest abhorred the dissipations of the young lord.\" But were he humble priest, or were he profligate patrician, one emotion remained eternally the same, his love for Clarimonde. At length the Abb\u00e9 Serapion dissolves the glamour. Sternly he bids young Romuald accompany him to the deserted cemetery where Clarimonde lies buried; he exhumes the body, and as he sprinkles it with holy water it crumbles into dust. Then also has the lord Romuald gone for ever. There only remains the poor priest of God broken and alone, who grows old in an obscure parish in the depths of a wood, and who well-nigh half a century after scarcely dares to stir the ashes of that memory.\n\nThere are in English not a few stories which deal with the vampire tradition, and many of these are well imagined and cleverly contrived; the morbid horror of the thing has often been conveyed with considerable power, but yet it will, I think, be universally allowed that no author has written pages comparable to this story of Gautier. It is hardly to be disputed that the best of the English vampire stories is Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla, which the authorities upon the bibliography of this author[64] have not traced further back than its appearance in the collection entitled In A Glass Darkly, 1872,[65] Carmilla which is a story of some length, containing sixteen chapters, is exceedingly well told and it certainly exhibits that note of haunting dread which is peculiar to Le Fanu's work. The castle in Styria and the family who inhabit it are excellently done, nor will the arrival of Carmilla and the mysterious coach wherein sat \"a hideous black woman, with a sort of coloured turban on her head, who was gazing all the time from the carriage window, nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury,\" easily be forgotten.\n\nIt must suffice to mention very briefly but a few short stories in English where the vampire element is present. E. F. Benson has evoked real horror in his The Boom in the Tower and the horrible creature tangled in her rotting shroud all foul with mould and damp who returns from her accursed grave is loathly to the last degree.\n\np. 322\n\nThe Flowering of the Strange Orchid, by H. G. Wells, introduces a botanical vampire. An orchid collector is found dead in a jungle in the Andaman Islands, with a strange bulb lying near him. This is brought to England and carefully tended by a botanist until it comes to flower. But when at last the blossoms burst open great tendrils suddenly reach out to grasp the man sucking his blood with hideous gusts. The unfortunate wretch has to be violently torn away from the plant which drips with blood scare e in time to save his life.\n\nThis idea closely resembles Fred M. White's story, The Purple Terror, which appeared in the Strand Magazine, September, 1899, Vol. xviii, No. 105. Here Lieutenant Will Scarlett, an American officer and a number of his men have to make their way across a certain tract of Cuban Territory. Spending the night in a country posada they are attracted by a pretty dancing girl who is wearing twined round her shoulders a garland of purple orchids larger than any known variety. The blossoms which a blood-red centre exhale a strange exotic perfume. Scarlett is fired with the enthusiasm of giving a new orchid to the horticultural world, and on the following morning a native, named Tito, undertakes to guide him to the spot. He learns that the natives call them \"the devil's poppies\" and that the flowers grow in the high trees where their blossoms cling to long green tendrils. As night falls the little company arrives at a plateau ringed by tall trees whose branches are crowned with great wreaths of the purple flower nestling amid coils of long green ropery. To their alarm they note that the ground is covered with bleaching bones, the skeletons of men, animals, and birds alike. Yet perforce they must camp there rather than risk the miasma of the lower valley. Scarlett keeps watch. In the darkness there is a rustling sound and suddenly a long green tendril furnished at the end with a sucker armed with sharp spines like teeth descends and snatches one of the men from the ground. As it is about to withdraw Scarlett with inconceivable swiftness slashes it through with his knife. But the man's clothing has even in that moment been cut through by the razor spines and his body is marked by a number of punctures where his blood is oozing in great drops. Immediately half-a-dozen and more lithe living cords with fanged mouths fall groping for their prey. The men are hurriedly awakened and with\n\np. 323\n\ndifficulty they extricate themselves by sending their whingers, ripping and tearing in every direction. It appears that the vampire poppies at night send down these tendrils to gather moisture. Anything which the fearful suckers can catch they drain dry, be it man or beast or bird. Lieutenant Scarlett and his men have been deliberately led into this trap by Tito, who is madly jealous of their compliments to Zara, the dancing-girl. They hold him prisoner and threaten him with condign punishment at headquarters.\n\nAlgernon Blackwood brings together two types of vampires in his story The Transfer. One is a human being, the psychic sponge, who absorbs and seems to live upon the vitality of others. He is thus described by the governess: \"I watched his hard, bleak face; I noticed how thin he was, and the curious oily brightness of his steady eyes. And everything he said or did announced what I may dare to call the suction of his presence.\" There is also a yet more horrible monster, if one may term it so, the Forbidden Corner, an arid barren spot in the midst of the rose garden, naked and bald amid luxuriant growth. A child who knows its evil secret says: \"It's bad. It's hungry. It's dying because it can't get the food it wants. But I know what would make it feel right.\" When the human vampire ventures near this spot it exerts its secret strength and draws him to itself. He falls into the middle of the patch and it drinks his energy. He lives on, but he seems to be nothing more than a physical husk or shell without vitality. As for the Forbidden Corner \"it lay untouched, full of great, luscious, driving weeds and creepers, very strong, full fed and bursting thick with life.\"\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle in his little story, The Parasite, has depicted a human vampire or psychic sponge in the person of Miss Penelosa, who is described as being a small frail creature, \"with a pale peaky face, an insignificant presence and retiring manner.\" Nevertheless she is able to obsess Professor Gilroy who says: \"She has a parasite soul, yes, she is a parasite; a monster parasite. She creeps into my form as the hermit crab creeps into the whelk's shell.\" To his horror he realizes that under her influence his will becomes weaker and weaker and he is bound to seek her presence. He resists for a while, but the force becomes so overmastering that he is compelled to yield, loathing himself as he does so. When he visits her,\n\np. 324\n\nwith a terrific effort he breaks the spell and denounces her unhallowed fascination in burning words. However, his victory is short indeed. She persecutes him most bitterly, and when he unburdens his troubles to his college professor the only result is a prescription of chloral and bromide, which promptly goes into the gutter. With devilish craft the vampire destroys his reputation as a scholar, and brings about ill-natured gossip and comment. She is able to confuse his brain during his lectures, so that he talks unintelligible nonsense and his classes become the laughing-stock of the university, until at length the authorities are obliged to suspend him from his position. Almost in despair he cries: \"And the most dreadful part of it all is my loneliness. Here I sit in a commonplace English bow-window looking out upon a common-place English street, with its garish buses and its lounging policemen, and behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age and place. In the home of knowledge I am weighed down and tortured by a power of which science knows nothing. No magistrate would listen to me. No paper would discuss my case. No doctor would believe my symptoms. My own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a sign of brain derangement. I am out of all touch with my kind.\"\n\nThe unfortunate victim is driven even deeper still by this unhallowed influence, which causes him to rob a bank, violently assault a friend, and finally to come within an ace of mutilating the features of his betrothed. At length the persecution ceases with the sudden death of the vampire, Miss Penelosa.\n\nThe True Story of a Vampire is a pathetic little story, very exquisitely told, in Studies of Death, by Stanislaus Eric, Count Stenbock, who wrote some verses of extraordinary charm in Love, Sleep, and Dreams; Myrtle, Rue, and Cypress; The Shadow of Death; and who at least once in The Other Side told a macabre legend with most powerful and haunting effect. A mysterious Count Vardaleh visits the remote styrian castle of old Baron Wronski, and before long attains an occult influence over the boy heir, Gabriel. The lad wastes away, and Count Vardaleh is heard to murmur: \"My darling, I fain would spare thee; but thy life is my life, and I must live, I who would rather die. Will God not have any mercy on me? Oh, oh! life; oh, the torture of life! . . . O Gabriel, my beloved! My life, yes, life--oh, my life? I am sure this is\n\np. 325\n\nbut a little I demand of thee. Surely the superabundance of life can spare a little to one who is already dead.\" As the boy lies wan and ill, the Count enters the room and presses a long feverish kiss upon his lips. Vardaleh rushes forth, and can never be traced again. Gabriel has expired in the agony of that embrace.\n\nIn a novel, The Vampire, by Reginald Hodder, a woman who is the leader of an occult society is forced to exercise her powers as a vampire to prevent the ebbing of her vitality. Here her ravages are psychic rather than physical, albeit in fact the two so closely commingled that they are not to be separated. A curious feature in the tale is that this woman is represented as putting forth her energies through the medium of a metallic talisman, and various struggles to gain possession of the object form the theme of the story. It falls into the hands of persons who would employ it for evil purposes, when it constitutes a very formidable menace, but at the last after a number of extraordinary happenings it is happily recovered.\n\nThe traditional, but yet more horrible vampire is presented to us by F. Marion Crawford in For the Blood Is the Life. Here a young man, who has been loved by a girl whose affection he was unable to return, is after her death vampirised by her, and when his friends suspect the truth they determine to rescue him. They find him upon her grave, a thin stream of blood trickling from his throat. \"And the flickering light of the lantern played upon another face that looked up from the feast,--upon two deep, dead eyes that saw in spite of death--upon parted lips redder than life itself--upon gleaming teeth on which glistened a rosy drop.\" The situation is effectively dealt with according to the good old tradition. A hawthorn stake is driven through the heart of the vampire who emits a quantity of blood and with a despairing shriek dies the last death.\n\nAlmost equally vivid in its details must be accounted the tale, Four Wooden Stakes, by Victor Roman. The ghastly events in the lonely old house with its little grey crypt, some ten miles from the small town of Charing, a place of not more than fifteen hundred souls, are most vividly described. There lived the Holroyds, the grandfather, the father, and three brothers. Whilst in South America the grandfather \"was\n\np. 326\n\nattacked while asleep by one of those huge bats. Next morning he was so weak be couldn't walk. That awful thing had sucked his life blood away. He arrived here, but was sickly until his death, a few weeks later.\" So says Remson Holroyd, who is left the sole survivor of the family, and who has summoned his old college friend to help him solve the secret of the hideous doom which is taking toll one by one. The grandfather was not buried in the usual way; but, as his will directed, his remains were interred in the vault built near the house. Remson Holroyd continues: \"Then my dad began failing and just pined away until he died. What puzzled the doctors was the fact that right up until the end he consumed enough food to sustain three men, yet he was so weak he lacked the strength to drag his legs over the floor. He was buried, or rather interred with grand-dad. The same symptoms were in evidence in the cases of George and Fred. They are both lying in the vault. And now, Jack, I'm going, too, for of late my appetite has increased to alarming proportions, yet I am as weak as a kitten.\" The next morning the visitor finds himself so weak that he is hardly able to rise and he feels a slight pain in the neck. \"I rushed to examine it in the mirror. Two tiny dots rimmed with blood--my blood--and on my neck! No longer did I chuckle at Remson's fears, for it, the thing, had attacked me--as I slept.\" The host himself is in a state of utter exhaustion. That night watch is kept by the friend, and as from his concealment he is gazing into Remson's room he notices \"a faint reddish glow outside one of the windows. It apparently emanated from nowhere. Hundreds of little specks danced and whirled in the spot of light, and as I watched them fascinated, they seemed to take oil the form of a human face. The features were masculine, as was also the arrangement of the hair. Then the mysterious glow disappeared.\" After a few moments there appears a vague form of which the watcher is able to distinguish the head, and to his horror he sees that the features are the same as those of a portrait of the grandfather which is hanging in the picture gallery of the house. \"But oh, the difference in expression! The lips were drawn back in a snarl, disclosing two sets of pearly white teeth, the canines over developed and remarkably sharp. The eyes, an emerald green in colour, stared in a look of consuming hate.\" The horror is revealed. The house is infested by a vampire. In the morning\n\np. 327\n\nthe two friends visit the vault. \"As if by mutual understanding, we both turned toward the coffin on our left. It belonged to the grandfather. We unplaced the lid, and there lay the old Holroyd. He appeared to be sleeping; his face was full of colour, and he had none of the stiffness of death. The hair was matted, the moustache untrimmed, and on the beard were matted stains of a dull brownish hue. But it was his eyes that attracted me. They were greenish, and they glowed with an expression of fiendish malevolence such as I had never seen before. The look of baffled rage on the face might well have adorned the features of the devil in hell.\" They drive a stake through the living corpse, which shrieks and writhes, whilst the gushing blood drenches coffins and floor spurting out in great jets over the very walls. The head is severed from the body, and as the final stroke of the knife cut the connexion a scream issued from the mouth; and the whole corpse fell away into dust, leaving nothing but a wooden stake lying in a bed of bones.\" The remaining three bodies are treated in the same way, and thus the thrall of the curse is lifted from the old house, ten miles from the little town of Charing.\n\nAlthough the genius of Charles Baudelaire, when his art required it, shrank from no extremity of physical horror, yet in his exquisite poem Le Vampire he has rather portrayed the darkness and desolation of the soul:\n\nToi qui, comme un coup de couteau,\nDans mon coeur plaintif est entr\u00e9e;\nToi qui, forte comme un troupeau\nDe d\u00e9mons, vins, folle et par\u00e9e.\n\nDe mon esprit humili\u00e9\nFaire ton lit et ton domaine\n--Inf\u00e2me a qui je suis li\u00e9\nComme le forcat a la cha\u00eene,\n\nComme au jeu le joueur t\u00eatu,\nComme \u00e0 la bouteille l'ivrogne,\nComme aux vermines la charogne,\n--Maudite, maudite sois-tu!\n\nJ'ai pri\u00e9 le glaive rapide\nDe conquerir ma libert\u00e9\nEt j'ai dit au poison perfide\nDe secourir ma l\u00e2chet\u00e9.\n\np. 328\n\nHelas! le poison et le glaive\nM'ont pris en d\u00e9dain et m'ont dit\nTu n'es pas digne qu'on t'enl\u00e8ve\nA ton esclavage maudit.\n\nImb\u00e9cile!--de son empire\nSi nos efforts te d\u00e9livraient,\nTes baisers ressusciteraient\nLe cadavre de ton vampire!\n\nIn England there is a poem--truly of a very different kind--which appears in the life of the famous scientist, James Clerk Maxwell, by Lewis Campbell and William Garnett, verses written by Maxwell in 1845 when he was fourteen Years of age. The verses should not perhaps, because of the youth of the author, be criticized too sharply, and although they show Wardour Street fustian and gimcrack, since the piece is of no great length it may pardonably be quoted here. It is not entirely without a certain feeling after the right atmosphere, and much will be forgiven on account of the precocity. It is grandiosely entitled The Vampyre: Compylt into Meeter by James Clerk Maxwell.\"\n\nThair is a knichte rydis through the wood,\nAnd a douchty knichte is hee.\nAnd sure bee is on a message sent,\nHe rydis sae hastilie.\nHe passit the aik, and hee passit the birk,\nAnd bee passit monie a tre,\nBot plesant to him was the saugh sae slim,\nFor beneath it hee did see\nThe boniest ladye that ever hee saw,\nScho was sae schyn and fair.\nAnd thair scho sat, beneath the saugh,\nKaiming hir gowden hair.\nAnd then the knichte--\"Oh ladye brichte,\nWhat chance has broucht you here?\nBut sae the word, and ye schall gang\nBack to your kindred dear,\"\nThen up and spok the ladye fair--\n\"I have nae friends or kin,\nBot in a little boat I live,\nAmidst the waves' loud din.\"\nThen answered thus the douchty knichte\"\nI'll follow you through all,\nFor gin ye bee in a littel boat,\nThe world to it seemis small.\" p. 329\nThey goed through the wood, and through the wood,\nTo the end of the wood they came:\nAnd when they came to the end of the wood\nThey saw the salt sea faem.\nAnd when they saw the wee, wee boat,\nThat daunced on the top of the wave,\nAnd first got in the ladye fair,\nAnd then the knichte sae brave.\nThey got into the wee, wee boat\nAnd rowed wi' a' their micht\nWhen the knichte sae brave, he turnit about,\nAnd lookit at the ladye bricht\nHe lookit at her bonnie cheik,\nAnd bee lookit at hir twa bricht eyne,\nBot hir rosie cheik growe ghaistly pale,\nAnd schoe seymit as scho deid had been.\nThe fause, fause knichte growe pale with frichte.\nAnd his hair rose up on end,\nFor gane-by days cam to his mynde,\nAnd his former love he kenned.\nThen spake the ladye--\"Thou, fause knichte,\nHast done to me much ill,\nFor didst forsake me long ago,\nBot I am constant still:\nFor though I ligg in the woods sae cald,\nAt rest I canna bee\nUntil I sucks the gude lyfe blude\nOf the man that gart me dee.\"\nHee saw hir lipps were wet wi' blude,\nAnd hee saw hir lufolesse eyne,\nAnd loud bee cry'd, \"get frae my syde,\nThou vampyr corps encleane!\"\nBut no, bee is in hir magic boat,\nAnd on the wyde, wyde sea;\nAnd the vampyr suckis his gude lyfe blude,\nSho suckis him till hee dee.\nSo now beware, whoe'er you are,\nThat walkis in this lone wood:\nBeware of that deceitfull spright,\nThe ghaist that suckis the blude.\n\nThe Vampire Bride, a ballad by the Hon. Henry Liddell, has considerable merit, It may be found in The Wizard of the North, The Vampire Bride, and other Poems, Blackwood, Edinburgh, and Cadell, London, 1833. These stanzas are founded upon the old tale of the knight who having placed a ring--some say his wedding-ring--around the finger of the statue of Venus whilst he is a quoiting, when he would reclaim it\n\np. 330\n\nfinds that the finger is crooked so that the jewel may not be withdrawn, whilst that night a phantom claims him as her spouse. With difficulty is he freed from the thrall of the succubus.\n\nIn 1845 there was published at the Columbian Press Weston-super-mare, a little book entitled The Last of the Vampires, by Smyth Upton. The chief, some critics might say the only, merit of this tale is its excessive rarity. The narrative is somewhat curiously divided into Epochs, the first of which takes place in 1769, the second in 1777, the third and last in 1780. Chapter I opens in an English village named Frampton, but in Chapter II \"we find ourselves upon the borders of Bohemia\" in the Castle Von Oberfels. Four chapters of no great length and somewhat disconnected in their sequence comprise the First Epoch. A little later we meet with the mysterious Lord de Montfort, and apparently he has just committed a murder, since he is one of the two men who stand in a dreary outhouse adjoining Montfort Abbey. \"Red blood, yet warm, stains their murderous hands, and is seen also in pools upon the floor; the same marks are observable, also, on their clothes.\" \"The scene is a fearful one; it is one of those of which the mere recital makes the blood run cold,\" and the writer wisely does not attempt the task. In the penultimate chapter of this extraordinary production we are introduced to \"a certain young German, the Baron Von Oberfels,\" who weds Mary Learmont, the elder daughter of \"Sir James Learmont, who being a Baronet, was, moreover, a Knight of the Bath and M.P.\" Unfortunately the Baron \"was one of that horrible class, the Vampires! He had sold his soul to the evil one, for the enjoyment of perpetual youth; being bound, besides, to what are understood to be the penalties of that wretched and accursed race. Every tenth year a female was sacrificed to his infernal master. Mary Learmont was to be the next victim; may she escape the threatened doom.\" But apparently, so far as I can gather, she is not so lucky for we are vaguely told \"The Baron and his bride departed on his wedding tour. Her father and mother never hear of her more.\" A page or two later there is \"a midnight wedding\" at the Castle Von Oberfels. Of the bride we are told nothing save that she had a \"fair presence.\" \"The Baron Von Oberfels was there, once more arrayed in the\n\np. 331\n\ngarments of a bridegroom.\" The ceremony proceeds. The grand organ peals; the heavenly voices of white-robed choristers added greatly to the beauty of the scene. \"But hark! another noise is heard; sulphureous smoke half fills the sacred building; the floor opens for an instant; and mocking shrieks are audible as the spirit of the Last of the Vampires descended into perdition.\"\n\nI am bound to acknowledge that after a somewhat careful reading of this curious and most disjointed little piece of seventy-six pages the only impression with which I am met is that Mr. Smyth Upton knew nothing whatsoever of what the word vampire connotes. The idea of the victims who are sacrificed for the sake of eternal youth is, of course fairly common and was very effectively utilized by G. W. M. Reynolds in his romance The Necromancer, which ran in Reynolds's Miscellany from Saturday, 27th December, 1851, to Saturday, 31st July, 1852.[66] Incidentally it maybe remarked as a somewhat curious fact that this prolific novelist never availed himself of the vampire tradition in his melodramatic chapters.\n\nThe Vampyre. \"By the Wife of a Medical Man,\" 1858, is a, violent teetotal tract, of twenty-seven short chapters presented in the guise of fiction. The villain of the piece is \"The Vampyre Inn,\" and the dipsomaniac hero--if it be allowable to use the term in such a context--is given to ravings such as these: \"They fly--they bite--they suck my blood--I die. That hideous 'Vampyre!' Its eyes pierce me thro'--they are red--they are bloodshot. Tear it from my pillow. I dare not lie down. It bites--I die! Give me brandy--brandy--more brandy.\"\n\nA Vampire of Souls, by H. M. P., published in 1904, is a book of little value. The hero, George Ventnor, when aged twenty, is killed in a railway accident, and the narrative consists of his after experiences which are singularly material and crude. There is, perhaps, a good touch here and there, but the thing certainly does not deserve to be rescued from oblivion.\n\nIt will have been noticed that beyond the titles these two last works have really little or nothing to do with vampires at all, but we may now consider a romance which may at least be ranked as a very serious rival to--in my opinion it is far ghostlier than--its famous successor Dracula. Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, is undoubtedly the best novel\n\np. 332\n\nof Thomas Preskett Prest, a prolific writer of the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century. It is true that his productions published by the well-known Edward Lloyd, of 231, Shoreditch,[67] may be classed as simple \"shockers,\" but none the less he has considerable power in this kind, and he had at any rate the craft of telling his story with skill and address. There is a certain quality in his work, which appeared during the years from 1839 to the earlier fifties, that is entirely lacking in the productions of his fellows. To him have been ascribed, doubtless with some exaggeration, well nigh two hundred titles, but the following list comprises, I believe, his principal romances: Ela, the Outcast, or, the Gipsy of Rosemary Dell; Angelina, or, the Mystery of S. Mark's Abbey, \"a Tale of Other Days \"; The Death Grasp, or, A Father's Curse; Ernnestine De Lacy, or, The Robbers' Foundling; Gallant Tom, or, The Perils of a Sailor Ashore and Afloat, \"an original nautical romance of deep and pathetic interest \"; Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (the most famous of Prest's novels); Newgate (which has some capital episodes); Emily Fitzormond; Mary Clifford; The Maniac Father, or, The Victim of Seduction; Gertrude of the Rock; Rosalie, or, The Vagrant's Daughter; The Miller's Maid; Jane Brightwell; Blanche, or, The Mystery of the Doomed House; The Blighted Heart, or, The Priory Ruins; Sawney Bean, the Man-eater of Midlothian; The Skeleton Clutch, or, The Goblet of Gore; The Black Monk, or, The Secret of the Grey Turret[68]; The Miller and His Men, or, The Secret Robbers of Bohemia. To Prest also has been attributed, but I conceive without foundation, Susan Hoply, an audacious piracy upon the famous novel by Mrs. Crowe, Susan Hopley.\n\nVarney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, was first published in 1847. It contains no less than CCXX chapters and runs to 868 pages. The many incidents succeed each other with such breathless rapidity that it were well-nigh impossible to attempt any conspectus of the whole romance. The very length would make this analysis a work of extreme difficulty, and incidentally we may note the amazing copiousness of Prest which must ever remain a matter for wonderment. Such a romance, for example, as Newgate runs to no less than on, hundred and forty-nine chapters comprising 772 pages. The Maniac Father has fifty-four chapters, each of considerable\n\np. 333\n\nlength, which total 604 pages, and I have not selected these on account of their exceptional volume.\n\nVarney the Vampire was among the most popular of Prest's productions, and on account of its \"unprecedented success\" it was reprinted in 1853 in penny parts. To-day the book is unprocurable and considerable sums have been for many years in vain offered to secure a copy. Indeed, it may be noted that all Prest's work is excessively scarce.\n\nIt is hardly an exaggeration to affirm that of recent years there have been few books which have been more popular than Brain Stoker's Dracula, A tale, and certainly there is no sensational romance which in modern days has achieved so universal a reputation. Since it was first published in 1897, that is to say one and twenty years ago, it has run into a great number of editions, and the name has veritably become a household word. It will prove interesting to inquire into the immediate causes which have brought this book such wide and enduring fame. It has already been remarked that it is well-nigh impossible for a story which deals with the supernatural or the horrible to be sustained to any great length. Elements which at first are almost unendurable, will lose their effect if they are continued, for the reader's mind insensibly becomes inured to fresh emotions of awe and horror, and Dracula is by no means briefly told. In the ordinary reprints (Tenth Edition, 1913) it extends to more than four hundred pages, nor does it escape the penalty of its prolixity. The first part, \"Jonathan Harker's Journal,\" which consists of four chapters is most admirably done, and could the whole story have been sustained at so high a level we should have had a complete masterpiece. But that were scarcely possible. The description of the journey through Transylvania is interesting to a degree, and even has passages which attain to something like charm. \"All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear.\" Very effective is the arrival of the English traveller at the \"vast ruined castle, from, whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose\n\np. 334\n\nbroken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.\" Very adroitly are the various incidents managed in their quick succession, those mysterious happenings which at last convince the matter-of-fact commonplace young solicitor of Exeter that he is a helpless prisoner in the power of a relentless and fearful being. The continual contrasts between business conversations, the most ordinary events of the dull listless days, and all the while the mantling of dark shadows in the background and the onrushing of some monstrous doom are in these opening chapters most excellently managed.\n\nSo tense a strain could not be preserved, and consequently when we are abruptly transported to Whitby and the rather tedious courtships of Lucy Westenra, who is a lay figure at best, we feel that a good deal of the interest has already begun to evaporate. I would hasten to add that before long it is again picked up, but it is never sustained in the same degree; and good sound sensational fare as we have set before us, fare which I have myself more than once thoroughly enjoyed, yet it is difficult not to feel that one's palate, has been a little spoiled by the nonpareil of an antipast. This is not to say that the various complications are not sufficiently thrilling, but because of their very bounty now and again they most palpably fail of effect, and it can hardly escape notice that the author begins to avail himself of those more extravagant details of vampirism which frankly have no place outside the stories told round a winter's hearth, It would have been better had he confined himself to those particulars which are known and accepted, which indeed have been officially certified and definitely proved. But to have limited himself thus would have meant the shortening of his narrative, and here we return to the point which was made above.\n\nIf we review Dracula from a purely literary point of approach it must be acknowledged that there is much careless writing and many pages could have been compressed and something revised with considerable profit. It is hardly possible to feel any great interest in the characters, they are labels rather than individuals. As I have said, there are passages of graphic beauty, passages of graphic horror, but these again almost entirely occur within the first sixty pages. There are some capital incidents, for example the method by which Lord p. 335 Godalming and his friend obtain admittance to No. 347 Piccadilly. Nor does this by any means stand alone.\n\nHowever, when we have--quite fairly, I hope--thus criticized Dracula, the fact remains that it is a book of unwonted interest and fascination. Accordingly we are bound to acknowledge that the reason for the immense popularity of this romance, the reason why, in spite of obvious faults it is read and re-read--lies in the choice of subject and for this the author deserves all praise.\n\nIt might not have seemed that Dracula would have been a very promising subject for the stage, but nevertheless it was dramatized by Hamilton Deans and produced at the Wimbledon Theatre on 9th March, 1925. This version was performed in London at the Little Theatre, 14th February, 1927. On the preceding Thursday the Daily Mirror published a photograph of the late Mr. Brain Stoker accompanied by the following paragraphs. \"Herewith, one of the very few photographs of the late Brain Stoker, who, besides being Sir Henry Irving's manager for years, was an industrious novelist. As I have already said, a dramatic version of his most famous book, 'Dracula,' is to be done at the Little on Monday, and the scene of the Grand Guignol plays is appropriate, for the new piece, I hear, is so full of gruesome thrills that, in the provinces women having been carried fainting from the auditorium. Truly we take our pleasures sadly.\n\n\"The dramatic adaptation is by Hamilton Deans, whose grandfather, Colonel Deans, and the Rev. Abraham Stoker, Bram's father, lived on adjoining estates in County Dublin. Young Bram and Hamilton Deane's mother, then a young girl, were great friends. Stoker had the book 'Dracula' in his mind, and the young people used to discuss its possibilities. Strange that it should be young Hamilton Deane who has dramatized the book and brought the play to London.\"\n\nAt the Little Theatre the cast of Dracula was as follows: Count Dracula, Raymond Huntley; Abraham van Helsing, Hamilton Deane; Dr. Seward, Stuart Lomath; Jonathan Harker, Bernard Guest; Quincey P. Morris, Frieda Hearn; Lord Godalming, Peter Jackson; R. M. Renfield, Bernard Jukes; The Warden, Jack Howarth; The Parlourmaid, Hilda Macleod; The Housemaid, Betty Murgatroyd; Mina Harker, Dora Mary Patrick.\n\np. 336\n\nBy no stretch could it be called a good play, whilst the presentation, at the best, can hardly be described as more than reasonably adequate. In one or two instances the effects, upon which so much depends and which obviously demanded the most scrupulous care, were so clumsily contrived as to excite an involuntary smile. \"It was only a step from the devilish to the ridiculous on Monday night,\" said the Era, 16th February, 1927. Very remarkable was a lady, dressed in the uniform of a hospital nurse who sat in the vestibule of the theatre, and it was bruited that her services were required by members of the audience who were overcome owing to the horrors of the drama. I can only say that I find this canard impossible to believe, quodcumque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi. As an advertisement, and it can surely have been nothing else, the attendance of a nurse was in deplorable taste. I am informed that after the first few weeks a kind of epilogue was spoken when all the characters were assembled upon the stage, and it was explained that the audience must not be distressed at what they had seen, that it was comically intended for their entertainment. So gross a lapse of good manners, not to speak of the artistic indecorum, is hardly credible.[69]\n\nConfessedly the play was extremely weak, and yet such is the fascination of this subject that it had an exceptional success, and triumphantly made its way from theatre to theatre. On 25th July, 1927, Dracula was transferred to the Duke of York's; on the 29th August, following to the Prince of Wales, on 10th October to the Garrick; and all the while it was given to thronging houses. It has also toured, and at the present moment is still touring the provincial theatres with the most marked success, the drama being given with more spirit and vigour than originally was the case at the Little, and Wilfrid Fletcher in particular playing the lunatic Renfield with a real touch of wistful pathos and uncanny horror. This is is extremely instructive, and it is curious that the vogue of the \"vampire play\" in London should be repeated almost exactly after the interval of a century. On 5th November, 1927, a new version of Dracula by Charles Morrel was presented at the Court Theatre, Warrington.\n\nIn America the dramatization of Dracula was produced at the Shubert, New Haven, 19th September, 1927. This was given at the Fulton, New York, upon the following 5th October.\n\np. 337\n\nJonathan Harker was acted by Terence Neil; Abraham Van Helsing by Edward Van Sloan; Renfield by Bernard Jukes; and Count Dracula by Bela Lugoni .\n\nAs I have before remarked, the striking fact that an indifferent play should prove so successful can, I think, only be attributed to the fascination of the theme. Consciously or unconsciously it is realized that the vampire tradition contains far more truth than the ordinary individual cares to appreciate and acknowledge. \"La fable du vampire est peut-\u00eatre, la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . . Elle a partout l'autorit\u00e9 de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de cello de la philosophic ni de celle de la m\u00e9dicine. La th\u00e9ologie m\u00eame en a parl\u00e9.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5676756", "artist_names": "Tommy James", "full_title": "Adrienne

"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Susan-sontag"}, "artist": "Susan Sontag", "lyrics": "Notes On Camp LyricsMany things in the world have not been named; and many things, even if they have been named, have never been described. One of these is the sensibility -- unmistakably modern, a variant of sophistication but hardly identical with it -- that goes by the cult name of \"Camp.\"\n\nA sensibility (as distinct from an idea) is one of the hardest things to talk about; but there are special reasons why Camp, in particular, has never been discussed. It is not a natural mode of sensibility, if there be any such. Indeed the essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration. And Camp is esoteric -- something of a private code, a badge of identity even, among small urban cliques. Apart from a lazy two-page sketch in Christopher Isherwood's novel The World in the Evening (1954), it has hardly broken into print. To talk about Camp is therefore to betray it. If the betrayal can be defended, it will be for the edification it provides, or the dignity of the conflict it resolves. For myself, I plead the goal of self-edification, and the goad of a sharp conflict in my own sensibility. I am strongly drawn to Camp, and almost as strongly offended by it. That is why I want to talk about it, and why I can. For no one who wholeheartedly shares in a given sensibility can analyze it; he can only, whatever his intention, exhibit it. To name a sensibility, to draw its contours and to recount its history, requires a deep sympathy modified by revulsion.\n\nThough I am speaking about sensibility only -- and about a sensibility that, among other things, converts the serious into the frivolous -- these are grave matters. Most people think of sensibility or taste as the realm of purely subjective preferences, those mysterious attractions, mainly sensual, that have not been brought under the sovereignty of reason. They allow that considerations of taste play a part in their reactions to people and to works of art. But this attitude is na\u00efve. And even worse. To patronize the faculty of taste is to patronize oneself. For taste governs every free -- as opposed to rote -- human response. Nothing is more decisive. There is taste in people, visual taste, taste in emotion - and there is taste in acts, taste in morality. Intelligence, as well, is really a kind of taste: taste in ideas. (One of the facts to be reckoned with is that taste tends to develop very unevenly. It\u2019s rare that the same person has good visual taste and good taste in people and taste in ideas.)\n\nTaste has no system and no proofs. But there is something like a logic of taste: the consistent sensibility which underlies and gives rise to a certain taste. A sensibility is almost, but not quite, ineffable. Any sensibility which can be crammed into the mold of a system, or handled with the rough tools of proof, is no longer a sensibility at all. It has hardened into an idea . . .\n\nTo snare a sensibility in words, especially one that is alive and powerful,1 one must be tentative and nimble. The form of jottings, rather than an essay (with its claim to a linear, consecutive argument), seemed more appropriate for getting down something of this particular fugitive sensibility. It's embarrassing to be solemn and treatise-like about Camp. One runs the risk of having, oneself, produced a very inferior piece of Camp.\n\nThese notes are for Oscar Wilde.\n\"One should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art.\"\n- Phrases & Philosophies for the Use of the Young\n\n1. To start very generally: Camp is a certain mode of aestheticism. It is one way of seeing the world as an aesthetic phenomenon. That way, the way of Camp, is not in terms of beauty, but in terms of the degree of artifice, of stylization.\n\n2. To emphasize style is to slight content, or to introduce an attitude which is neutral with respect to content. It goes without saying that the Camp sensibility is disengaged, depoliticized -- or at least apolitical.\n\n3. Not only is there a Camp vision, a Camp way of looking at things. Camp is as well a quality discoverable in objects and the behavior of persons. There are \"campy\" movies, clothes, furniture, popular songs, novels, people, buildings. . . . This distinction is important. True, the Camp eye has the power to transform experience. But not everything can be seen as Camp. It's not all in the eye of the beholder.\n\n4. Random examples of items which are part of the canon of Camp:\n\nZuleika Dobson\nTiffany lamps\nScopitone films\nThe Brown Derby restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in LA\nThe Enquirer, headlines and stories\nAubrey Beardsley drawings\nSwan Lake\nBellini\u2019s operas\nVisconti's direction of Salome and 'Tis Pity She's a Whore\ncertain turn-of-the-century picture postcards\nSchoedsack's King Kong\nthe Cuban pop singer La Lupe\nLynn Ward's novel in woodcuts, God's Man\nthe old Flash Gordon comics\nwomen's clothes of the twenties (feather boas, fringed and beaded dresses, etc.)\nthe novels of Ronald Firbank and Ivy Compton-Burnett\nstag movies seen without lust\n5. Camp taste has an affinity for certain arts rather than others. Clothes, furniture, all the elements of visual d\u00e9cor, for instance, make up a large part of Camp. For Camp art is often decorative art, emphasizing texture, sensuous surface, and style at the expense of content. Concert music, though, because it is contentless, is rarely Camp. It offers no opportunity, say, for a contrast between silly or extravagant content and rich form. . . . Sometimes whole art forms become saturated with Camp. Classical ballet, opera, movies have seemed so for a long time. In the last two years, popular music (post rock-\u2019n\u2019-roll, what the French call y\u00e9 y\u00e9) has been annexed. And movie criticism (like lists of \"The 10 Best Bad Movies I Have Seen\") is probably the greatest popularizer of Camp taste today, because most people still go to the movies in a high-spirited and unpretentious way.\n\n6. There is a sense in which it is correct to say: \"It's too good to be Camp.\" Or \"too important,\" not marginal enough. (More on this later.) Thus, the personality and many of the works of Jean Cocteau are Camp, but not those of Andr\u00e9 Gide; the operas of Richard Strauss, but not those of Wagner; concoctions of Tin Pan Alley and Liverpool, but not jazz. Many examples of Camp are things which, from a \"serious\" point of view, are either bad art or kitsch. Not all, though. Not only is Camp not necessarily bad art, but some art which can be approached as Camp (example: the major films of Louis Feuillade) merits the most serious admiration and study.\n\n\"The more we study Art, the less we care for Nature.\"\n- The Decay of Lying\n\n7. All Camp objects, and persons, contain a large element of artifice. Nothing in nature can be campy . . . Rural Camp is still man-made, and most campy objects are urban. (Yet, they often have a serenity -- or a naivet\u00e9 -- which is the equivalent of pastoral. A great deal of Camp suggests Empson\u2019s phrase, \"urban pastoral.\")\n\n8. Camp is a vision of the world in terms of style -- but a particular kind of style. It is the love of the exaggerated, the \"off,\" of things-being-what-they-are-not. The best example is in Art Nouveau, the most typical and fully developed Camp style. Art Nouveau objects, typically, convert one thing into something else: the lighting fixtures in the form of flowering plants, the living room which is really a grotto. A remarkable example: the Paris M\u00e9tro entrances designed by Hector Guimard in the late 1890s in the shape of cast-iron orchid stalks.\n\n9. As a taste in persons, Camp responds particularly to the markedly attenuated and to the strongly exaggerated. The androgyne is certainly one of the great images of Camp sensibility. Examples: the swooning, slim, sinuous figures of pre-Raphaelite painting and poetry; the thin, flowing, sexless bodies in Art Nouveau prints and posters, presented in relief on lamps and ashtrays; the haunting androgynous vacancy behind the perfect beauty of Greta Garbo. Here, Camp taste draws on a mostly unacknowledged truth of taste: the most refined form of sexual attractiveness (as well as the most refined form of sexual pleasure) consists in going against the grain of one's sex. What is most beautiful in virile men is something feminine; what is most beautiful in feminine women is something masculine. . . . Allied to the Camp taste for the androgynous is something that seems quite different but isn't: a relish for the exaggeration of sexual characteristics and personality mannerisms. For obvious reasons, the best examples that can be cited are movie stars. The corny flamboyant female-ness of Jayne Mansfield, Gina Lollobrigida, Jane Russell, Virginia Mayo; the exaggerated he-man-ness of Steve Reeves, Victor Mature. The great stylists of temperament and mannerism, like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Tallulah Bankhead, Edwige Feuilli\u00e8re.\n\n10. Camp sees everything in quotation marks. It's not a lamp, but a \"lamp\"; not a woman, but a \"woman.\" To perceive Camp in objects and persons is to understand Being-as-Playing-a-Role. It is the farthest extension, in sensibility, of the metaphor of life as theater.\n\n11. Camp is the triumph of the epicene style. (The convertibility of \"man\" and \"woman,\" \"person\" and \"thing.\") But all style, that is, artifice, is, ultimately, epicene. Life is not stylish. Neither is nature.\n\n12. The question isn\u2019t, \"Why travesty, impersonation, theatricality?\" The question is, rather, \"When does travesty, impersonation, theatricality acquire the special flavor of Camp?\" Why is the atmosphere of Shakespeare's comedies (As You Like It, etc.) not epicene, while that of Der Rosenkavalier is?\n\n13. The dividing line seems to fall in the 18th century; there the origins of Camp taste are to be found (Gothic novels, Chinoiserie, caricature, artificial ruins, and so forth.) But the relation to nature was quite different then. In the 18th century, people of taste either patronized nature (Strawberry Hill) or attempted to remake it into something artificial (Versailles). They also indefatigably patronized the past. Today's Camp taste effaces nature, or else contradicts it outright. And the relation of Camp taste to the past is extremely sentimental.\n\n14. A pocket history of Camp might, of course, begin farther back -- with the mannerist artists like Pontormo, Rosso, and Caravaggio, or the extraordinarily theatrical painting of Georges de La Tour, or Euphuism (Lyly, etc.) in literature. Still, the soundest starting point seems to be the late 17th and early 18th century, because of that period's extraordinary feeling for artifice, for surface, for symmetry; its taste for the picturesque and the thrilling, its elegant conventions for representing instant feeling and the total presence of character -- the epigram and the rhymed couplet (in words), the flourish (in gesture and in music). The late 17th and early 18th century is the great period of Camp: Pope, Congreve, Walpole, etc, but not Swift; les pr\u00e9cieux in France; the rococo churches of Munich; Pergolesi. Somewhat later: much of Mozart. But in the 19th century, what had been distributed throughout all of high culture now becomes a special taste; it takes on overtones of the acute, the esoteric, the perverse. Confining the story to England alone, we see Camp continuing wanly through 19th century aestheticism (Bume-Jones, Pater, Ruskin, Tennyson), emerging full-blown with the Art Nouveau movement in the visual and decorative arts, and finding its conscious ideologists in such \"wits\" as Wilde and Firbank.\n\n15. Of course, to say all these things are Camp is not to argue they are simply that. A full analysis of Art Nouveau, for instance, would scarcely equate it with Camp. But such an analysis cannot ignore what in Art Nouveau allows it to be experienced as Camp. Art Nouveau is full of \"content,\" even of a political-moral sort; it was a revolutionary movement in the arts, spurred on by a Utopian vision (somewhere between William Morris and the Bauhaus group) of an organic politics and taste. Yet there is also a feature of the Art Nouveau objects which suggests a disengaged, unserious, \"aesthete's\" vision. This tells us something important about Art Nouveau -- and about what the lens of Camp, which blocks out content, is.\n\n16. Thus, the Camp sensibility is one that is alive to a double sense in which some things can be taken. But this is not the familiar split-level construction of a literal meaning, on the one hand, and a symbolic meaning, on the other. It is the difference, rather, between the thing as meaning something, anything, and the thing as pure artifice.\n17. This comes out clearly in the vulgar use of the word Camp as a verb, \"to camp,\" something that people do. To camp is a mode of seduction -- one which employs flamboyant mannerisms susceptible of a double interpretation; gestures full of duplicity, with a witty meaning for cognoscenti and another, more impersonal, for outsiders. Equally and by extension, when the word becomes a noun, when a person or a thing is \"a camp,\" a duplicity is involved. Behind the \"straight\" public sense in which something can be taken, one has found a private zany experience of the thing.\n\n\"To be natural is such a very difficult pose to keep up.\"\n- An Ideal Husband\n\n18. One must distinguish between na\u00efve and deliberate Camp. Pure Camp is always naive. Camp which knows itself to be Camp (\"camping\") is usually less satisfying.\n\n19. The pure examples of Camp are unintentional; they are dead serious. The Art Nouveau craftsman who makes a lamp with a snake coiled around it is not kidding, nor is he trying to be charming. He is saying, in all earnestness: Voil\u00e0! the Orient! Genuine Camp -- for instance, the numbers devised for the Warner Brothers musicals of the early thirties (42nd Street; The Golddiggers of 1933; ... of 1935; ... of 1937; etc.) by Busby Berkeley -- does not mean to be funny. Camping -- say, the plays of Noel Coward -- does. It seems unlikely that much of the traditional opera repertoire could be such satisfying Camp if the melodramatic absurdities of most opera plots had not been taken seriously by their composers. One doesn't need to know the artist's private intentions. The work tells all. (Compare a typical 19th century opera with Samuel Barber's Vanessa, a piece of manufactured, calculated Camp, and the difference is clear.)\n\n20. Probably, intending to be campy is always harmful. The perfection of Trouble in Paradise and The Maltese Falcon, among the greatest Camp movies ever made, comes from the effortless smooth way in which tone is maintained. This is not so with such famous would-be Camp films of the fifties as All About Eve and Beat the Devil. These more recent movies have their fine moments, but the first is so slick and the second so hysterical; they want so badly to be campy that they're continually losing the beat. . . . Perhaps, though, it is not so much a question of the unintended effect versus the conscious intention, as of the delicate relation between parody and self-parody in Camp. The films of Hitchcock are a showcase for this problem. When self-parody lacks ebullience but instead reveals (even sporadically) a contempt for one's themes and one's materials - as in To Catch a Thief, Rear Window, North by Northwest -- the results are forced and heavy-handed, rarely Camp. Successful Camp -- a movie like Carn\u00e9's Dr\u00f4le de Drame; the film performances of Mae West and Edward Everett Horton; portions of the Goon Show -- even when it reveals self-parody, reeks of self-love.\n\n21. So, again, Camp rests on innocence. That means Camp discloses innocence, but also, when it can, corrupts it. Objects, being objects, don't change when they are singled out by the Camp vision. Persons, however, respond to their audiences. Persons begin \"camping\": Mae West, Bea Lillie, La Lupe, Tallulah Bankhead in Lifeboat, Bette Davis in All About Eve. (Persons can even be induced to camp without their knowing it. Consider the way Fellini got Anita Ekberg to parody herself in La Dolce Vita.)\n\n22. Considered a little less strictly, Camp is either completely naive or else wholly conscious (when one plays at being campy). An example of the latter: Wilde's epigrams themselves.\n\n\"It's absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.\"\n- Lady Windemere's Fan\n\n23. In na\u00efve, or pure, Camp, the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails. Of course, not all seriousness that fails can be redeemed as Camp. Only that which has the proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the na\u00efve.\n\n24. When something is just bad (rather than Camp), it's often because it is too mediocre in its ambition. The artist hasn't attempted to do anything really outlandish. (\"It's too much,\" \"It's too fantastic,\" \"It's not to be believed,\" are standard phrases of Camp enthusiasm.)\n\n25. The hallmark of Camp is the spirit of extravagance. Camp is a woman walking around in a dress made of three million feathers. Camp is the paintings of Carlo Crivelli, with their real jewels and trompe-l'oeil insects and cracks in the masonry. Camp is the outrageous aestheticism of Steinberg's six American movies with Dietrich, all six, but especially the last, The Devil Is a Woman. . . . In Camp there is often something d\u00e9mesur\u00e9 in the quality of the ambition, not only in the style of the work itself. Gaud\u00ed's lurid and beautiful buildings in Barcelona are Camp not only because of their style but because they reveal -- most notably in the Cathedral of the Sagrada Familia -- the ambition on the part of one man to do what it takes a generation, a whole culture to accomplish.\n\n26. Camp is art that proposes itself seriously, but cannot be taken altogether seriously because it is \"too much.\" Titus Andronicus and Strange Interlude are almost Camp, or could be played as Camp. The public manner and rhetoric of de Gaulle, often, are pure Camp.\n\n27. A work can come close to Camp, but not make it, because it succeeds. Eisenstein's films are seldom Camp because, despite all exaggeration, they do succeed (dramatically) without surplus. If they were a little more \"off,\" they could be great Camp - particularly Ivan the Terrible I & II. The same for Blake's drawings and paintings, weird and mannered as they are. They aren't Camp; though Art Nouveau, influenced by Blake, is.\n\nWhat is extravagant in an inconsistent or an unpassionate way is not Camp. Neither can anything be Camp that does not seem to spring from an irrepressible, a virtually uncontrolled sensibility. Without passion, one gets pseudo-Camp -- what is merely decorative, safe, in a word, chic. On the barren edge of Camp lie a number of attractive things: the sleek fantasies of Dali, the haute couture preciosity of Albicocco's The Girl with the Golden Eyes. But the two things - Camp and preciosity - must not be confused.\n\n28. Again, Camp is the attempt to do something extraordinary. But extraordinary in the sense, often, of being special, glamorous. (The curved line, the extravagant gesture.) Not extraordinary merely in the sense of effort. Ripley's Believe-It-Or-Not items are rarely campy. These items, either natural oddities (the two-headed rooster, the eggplant in the shape of a cross) or else the products of immense labor (the man who walked from here to China on his hands, the woman who engraved the New Testament on the head of a pin), lack the visual reward - the glamour, the theatricality - that marks off certain extravagances as Camp.\n\n29. The reason a movie like On the Beach, books like Winesburg, Ohio and For Whom the Bell Tolls are bad to the point of being laughable, but not bad to the point of being enjoyable, is that they are too dogged and pretentious. They lack fantasy. There is Camp in such bad movies as The Prodigal and Samson and Delilah, the series of Italian color spectacles featuring the super-hero Maciste, numerous Japanese science fiction films (Rodan, The Mysterians, The H-Man) because, in their relative unpretentiousness and vulgarity, they are more extreme and irresponsible in their fantasy - and therefore touching and quite enjoyable.\n\n30. Of course, the canon of Camp can change. Time has a great deal to do with it. Time may enhance what seems simply dogged or lacking in fantasy now because we are too close to it, because it resembles too closely our own everyday fantasies, the fantastic nature of which we don't perceive. We are better able to enjoy a fantasy as fantasy when it is not our own.\n\n31. This is why so many of the objects prized by Camp taste are old-fashioned, out-of-date, d\u00e9mod\u00e9. It's not a love of the old as such. It's simply that the process of aging or deterioration provides the necessary detachment -- or arouses a necessary sympathy. When the theme is important, and contemporary, the failure of a work of art may make us indignant. Time can change that. Time liberates the work of art from moral relevance, delivering it over to the Camp sensibility. . . . Another effect: time contracts the sphere of banality. (Banality is, strictly speaking, always a category of the contemporary.) What was banal can, with the passage of time, become fantastic. Many people who listen with delight to the style of Rudy Vallee revived by the English pop group, The Temperance Seven, would have been driven up the wall by Rudy Vallee in his heyday.\n\nThus, things are campy, not when they become old - but when we become less involved in them, and can enjoy, instead of be frustrated by, the failure of the attempt. But the effect of time is unpredictable. Maybe Method acting (James Dean, Rod Steiger, Warren Beatty) will seem as Camp some day as Ruby Keeler's does now - or as Sarah Bernhardt's does, in the films she made at the end of her career. And maybe not.\n\n32. Camp is the glorification of \"character.\" The statement is of no importance - except, of course, to the person (Loie Fuller, Gaud\u00ed, Cecil B. De Mille, Crivelli, de Gaulle, etc.) who makes it. What the Camp eye appreciates is the unity, the force of the person. In every move the aging Martha Graham makes she's being Martha Graham, etc., etc. . . . This is clear in the case of the great serious idol of Camp taste, Greta Garbo. Garbo's incompetence (at the least, lack of depth) as an actress enhances her beauty. She's always herself.\n\n33. What Camp taste responds to is \"instant character\" (this is, of course, very 18th century); and, conversely, what it is not stirred by is the sense of the development of character. Character is understood as a state of continual incandescence - a person being one, very intense thing. This attitude toward character is a key element of the theatricalization of experience embodied in the Camp sensibility. And it helps account for the fact that opera and ballet are experienced as such rich treasures of Camp, for neither of these forms can easily do justice to the complexity of human nature. Wherever there is development of character, Camp is reduced. Among operas, for example, La Traviata (which has some small development of character) is less campy than Il Trovatore (which has none).\n\n\"Life is too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it.\"\n- Vera, or The Nihilists\n\n34. Camp taste turns its back on the good-bad axis of ordinary aesthetic judgment. Camp doesn't reverse things. It doesn't argue that the good is bad, or the bad is good. What it does is to offer for art (and life) a different -- a supplementary -- set of standards.\n\n35. Ordinarily we value a work of art because of the seriousness and dignity of what it achieves. We value it because it succeeds - in being what it is and, presumably, in fulfilling the intention that lies behind it. We assume a proper, that is to say, straightforward relation between intention and performance. By such standards, we appraise The Iliad, Aristophanes' plays, The Art of the Fugue, Middlemarch, the paintings of Rembrandt, Chartres, the poetry of Donne, The Divine Comedy, Beethoven's quartets, and - among people - Socrates, Jesus, St. Francis, Napoleon, Savonarola. In short, the pantheon of high culture: truth, beauty, and seriousness.\n\n36. But there are other creative sensibilities besides the seriousness (both tragic and comic) of high culture and of the high style of evaluating people. And one cheats oneself, as a human being, if one has respect only for the style of high culture, whatever else one may do or feel on the sly.\n\nFor instance, there is the kind of seriousness whose trademark is anguish, cruelty, derangement. Here we do accept a disparity between intention and result. I am speaking, obviously, of a style of personal existence as well as of a style in art; but the examples had best come from art. Think of Bosch, Sade, Rimbaud, Jarry, Kafka, Artaud, think of most of the important works of art of the 20th century, that is, art whose goal is not that of creating harmonies but of overstraining the medium and introducing more and more violent, and unresolvable, subject-matter. This sensibility also insists on the principle that an oeuvre in the old sense (again, in art, but also in life) is not possible. Only \"fragments\" are possible. . . . Clearly, different standards apply here than to traditional high culture. Something is good not because it is achieved, but because another kind of truth about the human situation, another experience of what it is to be human - in short, another valid sensibility -- is being revealed.\n\nAnd third among the great creative sensibilities is Camp: the sensibility of failed seriousness, of the theatricalization of experience. Camp refuses both the harmonies of traditional seriousness, and the risks of fully identifying with extreme states of feeling.\n\n37. The first sensibility, that of high culture, is basically moralistic. The second sensibility, that of extreme states of feeling, represented in much contemporary \"avant-garde\" art, gains power by a tension between moral and aesthetic passion. The third, Camp, is wholly aesthetic.\n\n38. Camp is the consistently aesthetic experience of the world. It incarnates a victory of \"style\" over \"content,\" \"aesthetics\" over \"morality,\" of irony over tragedy.\n\n39. Camp and tragedy are antitheses. There is seriousness in Camp (seriousness in the degree of the artist's involvement) and, often, pathos. The excruciating is also one of the tonalities of Camp; it is the quality of excruciation in much of Henry James (for instance, The Europeans, The Awkward Age, The Wings of the Dove) that is responsible for the large element of Camp in his writings. But there is never, never tragedy.\n\n40. Style is everything. Genet's ideas, for instance, are very Camp. Genet's statement that \"the only criterion of an act is its elegance\"2 is virtually interchangeable, as a statement, with Wilde's \"in matters of great importance, the vital element is not sincerity, but style.\" But what counts, finally, is the style in which ideas are held. The ideas about morality and politics in, say, Lady Windemere's Fan and in Major Barbara are Camp, but not just because of the nature of the ideas themselves. It is those ideas, held in a special playful way. The Camp ideas in Our Lady of the Flowers are maintained too grimly, and the writing itself is too successfully elevated and serious, for Genet's books to be Camp.\n\n41. The whole point of Camp is to dethrone the serious. Camp is playful, anti-serious. More precisely, Camp involves a new, more complex relation to \"the serious.\" One can be serious about the frivolous, frivolous about the serious.\n\n42. One is drawn to Camp when one realizes that \"sincerity\" is not enough. Sincerity can be simple philistinism, intellectual narrowness.\n\n43. The traditional means for going beyond straight seriousness - irony, satire - seem feeble today, inadequate to the culturally oversaturated medium in which contemporary sensibility is schooled. Camp introduces a new standard: artifice as an ideal, theatricality.\n\n44. Camp proposes a comic vision of the world. But not a bitter or polemical comedy. If tragedy is an experience of hyperinvolvement, comedy is an experience of underinvolvement, of detachment.\n\n\"I adore simple pleasures, they are the last refuge of the complex.\"\n- A Woman of No Importance\n\n45. Detachment is the prerogative of an elite; and as the dandy is the 19th century's surrogate for the aristocrat in matters of culture, so Camp is the modern dandyism. Camp is the answer to the problem: how to be a dandy in the age of mass culture.\n\n46. The dandy was overbred. His posture was disdain, or else ennui. He sought rare sensations, undefiled by mass appreciation. (Models: Des Esseintes in Huysmans' \u00c0 Rebours, Marius the Epicurean, Val\u00e9ry's Monsieur Teste.) He was dedicated to \"good taste.\"\n\nThe connoisseur of Camp has found more ingenious pleasures. Not in Latin poetry and rare wines and velvet jackets, but in the coarsest, commonest pleasures, in the arts of the masses. Mere use does not defile the objects of his pleasure, since he learns to possess them in a rare way. Camp -- Dandyism in the age of mass culture -- makes no distinction between the unique object and the mass-produced object. Camp taste transcends the nausea of the replica.\n\n47. Wilde himself is a transitional figure. The man who, when he first came to London, sported a velvet beret, lace shirts, velveteen knee-breeches and black silk stockings, could never depart too far in his life from the pleasures of the old-style dandy; this conservatism is reflected in The Picture of Dorian Gray. But many of his attitudes suggest something more modern. It was Wilde who formulated an important element of the Camp sensibility -- the equivalence of all objects -- when he announced his intention of \"living up\" to his blue-and-white china, or declared that a doorknob could be as admirable as a painting. When he proclaimed the importance of the necktie, the boutonniere, the chair, Wilde was anticipating the democratic esprit of Camp.\n\n48. The old-style dandy hated vulgarity. The new-style dandy, the lover of Camp, appreciates vulgarity. Where the dandy would be continually offended or bored, the connoisseur of Camp is continually amused, delighted. The dandy held a perfumed handkerchief to his nostrils and was liable to swoon; the connoisseur of Camp sniffs the stink and prides himself on his strong nerves.\n\n49. It is a feat, of course. A feat goaded on, in the last analysis, by the threat of boredom. The relation between boredom and Camp taste cannot be overestimated. Camp taste is by its nature possible only in affluent societies, in societies or circles capable of experiencing the psychopathology of affluence.\n\n\"What is abnormal in Life stands in normal relations to Art. It is the only thing in Life that stands in normal relations to Art.\"\n- A Few Maxims for the Instruction of the Over-Educated\n\n50. Aristocracy is a position vis-\u00e0-vis culture (as well as vis-\u00e0-vis power), and the history of Camp taste is part of the history of snob taste. But since no authentic aristocrats in the old sense exist today to sponsor special tastes, who is the bearer of this taste? Answer: an improvised self-elected class, mainly homosexuals, who constitute themselves as aristocrats of taste.\n\n51. The peculiar relation between Camp taste and homosexuality has to be explained. While it's not true that Camp taste is homosexual taste, there is no doubt a peculiar affinity and overlap. Not all liberals are Jews, but Jews have shown a peculiar affinity for liberal and reformist causes. So, not all homosexuals have Camp taste. But homosexuals, by and large, constitute the vanguard -- and the most articulate audience -- of Camp. (The analogy is not frivolously chosen. Jews and homosexuals are the outstanding creative minorities in contemporary urban culture. Creative, that is, in the truest sense: they are creators of sensibilities. The two pioneering forces of modern sensibility are Jewish moral seriousness and homosexual aestheticism and irony.)\n\n52. The reason for the flourishing of the aristocratic posture among homosexuals also seems to parallel the Jewish case. For every sensibility is self-serving to the group that promotes it. Jewish liberalism is a gesture of self-legitimization. So is Camp taste, which definitely has something propagandistic about it. Needless to say, the propaganda operates in exactly the opposite direction. The Jews pinned their hopes for integrating into modern society on promoting the moral sense. Homosexuals have pinned their integration into society on promoting the aesthetic sense. Camp is a solvent of morality. It neutralizes moral indignation, sponsors playfulness.\n\n53. Nevertheless, even though homosexuals have been its vanguard, Camp taste is much more than homosexual taste. Obviously, its metaphor of life as theater is peculiarly suited as a justification and projection of a certain aspect of the situation of homosexuals. (The Camp insistence on not being \"serious,\" on playing, also connects with the homosexual's desire to remain youthful.) Yet one feels that if homosexuals hadn't more or less invented Camp, someone else would. For the aristocratic posture with relation to culture cannot die, though it may persist only in increasingly arbitrary and ingenious ways. Camp is (to repeat) the relation to style in a time in which the adoption of style -- as such -- has become altogether questionable. (In the modem era, each new style, unless frankly anachronistic, has come on the scene as an anti-style.)\n\n\"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing.\"\n- In conversation\n\n54. The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly upon refinement. Camp asserts that good taste is not simply good taste; that there exists, indeed, a good taste of bad taste. (Genet talks about this in Our Lady of the Flowers.) The discovery of the good taste of bad taste can be very liberating. The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.\n\n55. Camp taste is, above all, a mode of enjoyment, of appreciation - not judgment. Camp is generous. It wants to enjoy. It only seems like malice, cynicism. (Or, if it is cynicism, it's not a ruthless but a sweet cynicism.) Camp taste doesn't propose that it is in bad taste to be serious; it doesn't sneer at someone who succeeds in being seriously dramatic. What it does is to find the success in certain passionate failures.\n\n56. Camp taste is a kind of love, love for human nature. It relishes, rather than judges, the little triumphs and awkward intensities of \"character.\" . . . Camp taste identifies with what it is enjoying. People who share this sensibility are not laughing at the thing they label as \"a camp,\" they're enjoying it. Camp is a tender feeling.\n\n(Here, one may compare Camp with much of Pop Art, which -- when it is not just Camp -- embodies an attitude that is related, but still very different. Pop Art is more flat and more dry, more serious, more detached, ultimately nihilistic.)\n\n57. Camp taste nourishes itself on the love that has gone into certain objects and personal styles. The absence of this love is the reason why such kitsch items as Peyton Place (the book) and the Tishman Building aren't Camp.\n\n58. The ultimate Camp statement: it's good because it's awful . . . Of course, one can't always say that. Only under certain conditions, those which I've tried to sketch in these notes.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4678000", "artist_names": "Gene Chandler & Jerry

"lyrics": "To Marina LyricsSo many convolutions and not enough simplicity!\nWhen I had you to write to it\nWas different. The quiet, dry Z\nLeaped up to the front of the alphabet.\nYou sit, stilling your spoons\nWith one hand; you move them with the other.\nRadio says, \u201cGod is a postmaster.\u201d\nYou said, Zis is lawflee. And in the heat\nOf writing to you I wrote simply. I thought\nThese are the best things I shall ever write\nAnd have ever written. I thought of nothing but touching you\nThought of seeing you and, in a separate thought, of looking at you.\nYou were concentrated feeling and thought.\nYou were like the ocean\nIn which my poems were the swimming. I brought you\nEar rings. You said, these are lawflee. We went\nTo some beach, where the sand was dirty. Just going in\nTo the bathing house with you drove me \u201cout of my mind.\u201d\nIt is wise to be witty. The shirt collar\u2019s far away.\nMen tramp up and down the city on this windy day.\nI am feeling a-political as a shell\nBrought off some fish. Twenty-one years\nAgo I saw you and loved you still.\nStill! It wasn\u2019t plenty\nOf time. Read Anatole France. Bored, a little. Read\nTolstoy, replaced and overcome. You read Stendhal.\nI told you to. Where was replacement\nThen? I don\u2019t know. He shushed us back in to ourselves.\nI used to understand\n\nThe highest excitement. Someone died\nAnd you were distant. I went away\nAnd made you distant. Where are you now? I see the chair\nAnd hang onto it for sustenance. Good God how you kissed me\nAnd I held you. You screamed\nAnd I wasn\u2019t bothered by anything. Was nearest you.\n\nAnd you were so realistic\nPreferring the Soviet Bookstore\nTo my literary dreams.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like war,\u201d you said\nAfter reading a poem\nIn which I\u2019d simply said I hated war\nIn a whole list of things. To you\nIt seemed a position, to me\nIt was all a flux, especially then.\nI was in an\nUnexpected situation.\nLet\u2019s take a walk\nI wrote. And I love you as a sheriff\nSearches for a walnut. And And so unless\nI\u2019m going to see your face\nBien soon, and you said\nYou must take me away, and\nOh Kenneth\nYou like everything\nTo be pleasant. I was burning\nLike an arch\nMade out of trees.\nI\u2019m not sure we ever actually took a walk\nWe were so damned nervous. I was heading somewhere. And you had to\nbe\nAt an appointment, or else be found out! Illicit love!\nIt\u2019s not a thing to think of. Nor is it when it\u2019s licit!\nIt is too much! And it wasn\u2019t enough. The achievement\nI thought I saw possible when I loved you\nWas that really achievement? Were you my\nLast chance to feel that I had lost my chance?\nI grew faint at your voice on the telephone.\nElectricty and all colors were mine, and the tops of hills\nAnd everything that breathes. That was a feeling. Certain\nArtistic careers had not even started. And I\nCould have surpassed them. I could have I think put the\nWhole world under our feet. You were in the restaurant. It\nWas Chinese. We have walked three blocks. Or four blocks. It is New\nYork\nIn nineteen fifty-three. Nothing has as yet happened\nThat will ever happen and will mean as much to me. You smile, and turn\nyour head.\nWhat rocketing there was in my face and in my head\nAnd bombing everywhere in my body\nI loved you I knew suddenly\nThat nothing had meant anything like you\nI must have hoped (crazily) that something would\nAs if thinking you were the person I had become.\nMy sleep is beginning to be begun. And the sheets were on the bed.\nA clock rang a bird\u2019s song rattled into my typewriter.\nI had been thinking about songs which were very abstract.\nIt was really a table. Now, the telephone. Hello, what?\nWhat is my life like now? Engaged, studying and looking around\nThe library, teaching\u2014I took it rather easy\nA little too easy\u2014we went to the ballet\nThen dark becomes the light (blinding) of the next eighty days\nOrchestra cup become As beautiful as an orchestra or a cup, and\nLocked climbs becomes If we were locked, well not quite, rather\nOh penniless could I really die, and I understood everything\nWhich before was running this way and that in my head\nI saw titles, volumes, and suns I felt the hot\nPressure of your hands in that restaurant\nTo which, along with glasses, plates, lamps, lusters,\nTablecloths, napkins, and all the other junk\nYou added my life for it was entirely in your hands then\u2014\nMy life Yours, My Sister Life of Pasternak\u2019s beautiful title\nMy life without a life, my life in a life, my life impure\nAnd my life pure, life seen as an entity\nOne death and a variety of days\nAnd only on life.\n\nI wasn\u2019t ready\nFor you.\n\nI understood nothing\nSeemingly except my feelings\nYou were whirling\nIn your life\nI was keeping\nEverything in my head\nAn artist friend\u2019s apartment\nFive flights up the\nLower East Side nineteen\nFifty-something I don\u2019t know\nWhat we made love the first time I\nAlmost died I had never felt\nThat way it was like being stamped on in Hell\nIt was roses of Heaven\nMy friends seemed turned to me to empty shell\n\nOn the railroad train\u2019s red velvet back\nYou put your hand in mine and said\n\u201cI told him\u201d\nOr was it the time after that?\nI said Why did you\nDo that you said I thought\nIt was over. Why Because you were so\nNervous of my being there it was something I thought\n\nI read Tolstoy. You said\nI don\u2019t like the way it turns out (Anna\nKarenina) I had just liked the strength\nOf the feeling you thought\nAbout the end. I wanted\nTo I don\u2019t know what never leave you\nFive flights up the June\nStreet empties of fans, cups, kites, cops, eats, nights, no\nThe night was there\nAnd something like air I love you Marina\nEighty-five days\nFour thousand three hundred and sixty-\nTwo minutes all poetry was changed\nFor me what did I do in exchange\nI am selfish, afraid you are\nOverwhelmingly parade, back, sunshine, dreams\nLater thousands of dreams\n\nYou said\nYou make me feel nawble (noble). I said\nYes. I said\nTo nothingness, This is all poems. Another one said (later)\nThat is so American. You were Russian\nYou thought of your feelings, one said, not of her,\nNot of the real situation. But my feelings were a part,\nThey were the force of the real situation. Truer to say I thought\nNot of the whole situation\nFor your husband was also a part\nAnd your feelings about your child were a part\nAnd all my other feelings were a part. We\nTurned this way and that, up-\nStairs then down\nInto the streets.\nDid I die because I didn\u2019t stay with you?\nOr what did I lose of my life? I lose\nYou. I put you\nIn everything I wrote.\n\nI used that precious material I put it in forms\nAlso I wanted to break down the forms\nPoetry was a real occupation\nTo hell with the norms, with what is already written\nTwenty-nine in love finds pure expression\nTwenty-nine years you my whole life\u2019s digression\nNot taken and Oh Kenneth\nEverything afterwards seemed nowhere near\nWhat I could do then in several minutes\u2014\nI wrote,\n\u201cI want to look at you all day long\nBecause you are mine.\u201d\n\nI am twenty-nine, pocket flap folded\nAnd I am smiling I am looking out at a world that\nI significantly re-created from inside\nOut of contradictory actions and emotions. I look like a silly child that\nPhotograph that year\u2014big glasses, unthought-of clothes,\nA suit, slight mess in general, cropped hair. And someone liked me,\nLoved me a lot, I think. And someone else had, you had too. I was\nUndrenched by the tears I\u2019d shed later about this whole thing when\nI\u2019d telephone you I\u2019d be all nerves, though in fact\nAll life was a factor and all my nerves were in my head. I feel\nPeculiar. Or I feel nothing. I am thinking about this poem. I am thinking\nabout your raincoat,\nI am worried about the tactfulness,\nAbout the truth of what I say.\n\nI am thinking about my standards for my actions\nAbout what they were\nYou raised my standards for harmony and for happiness so much\nAnd, too, the sense of a center\nWhich did amazing things for my taste\nBut my taste for action? For honesty, for directness in behavior?\nI believe I simply never felt that anything could go wrong\nThis was abject stupidity\nI also was careless in how I drove then and in what I ate\nAnd drank it was easier to feel that nothing could go wrong\nI had those feelings. I\nDid not those things. I was involved in such and such\nA situation, artistically and socially. We never spent a night\nTogether it is the New York of\nAquamarine sunshine and the Loew\u2019s Theater\u2019s blazing swing of light\nIn the middle of the day\n\nLet\u2019s take a walk\nInto the world\nWhere if our shoes get white\nWith snow, is it snow, Marina,\nIs it snow or light?\nLet\u2019s take a walk\n\nEvery detail is everything in its place (Aristotle). Literature is a cup\nAnd we are the malted. The time is a glass. A June bug comes\nAnd a carpenter spits on a plane, the flowers ruffle ear rings.\nI am so dumb-looking. And you are so beautiful.\n\nSitting in the Hudson Tube\nWalking up the fusky street\nAlways waiting to see you\nYou the original creation of all my You, you the you\nIn every poem the hidden one whom I am talking to\nWorked at Bamberger\u2019s once I went with you to Cerutti\u2019s\nBar\u2014on Madison Avenue? I held your hand and you said\nKenneth you are playing with fire. I said\nSomething witty in reply.\nIt was the time of the McCarthy trial\nHot sunlight on lunches. You squirted\nRed wine into my mouth.\nMy feelings were like a fire my words became very clear\nMy psyche or whatever it is that puts together motions and emotions\nWas unprepared. There was a good part\nAnd an alarmingly bad part which didn\u2019t correspond\u2014\nNo letters! No seeming connection! Your slim pale hand\nIt actually was, your blondness and your turning-around-to-me look\nGood-bye Kenneth.\n\nNo, Marina, don\u2019t go\nAnd what had been before would come after\nNot to be mysterious we\u2019d be together make love again\nIt was the wildest thing I\u2019ve done\nI can hardly remember it\nIt has gotten by now\nSo mixed up with losing you\nThe two almost seemed in some way the same. You\nWore something soft\u2014angora? Cashmere?\nI remember that it was black, You turned around\nAnd on such a spring day which went on and on and on\nI actually think I felt that I could keep\nThe strongest of all feelings contained inside me\nProducing endless emotional designs.\n\nWith the incomparable feeling of rising and of being like a banner\nTwenty seconds worth twenty-five years\nWith feeling noble extremely mobile and very free\nWith Taking a Walk With You, West Wind, In Love With You, and\nYellow Roses\nWith pleasure I felt my leg muscles and my brain couldn\u2019t hold\nWith the Empire State Building the restaurant your wrist bones with\nGreenwich Avenue\nIn nineteen fifty-one with heat humidity a dog pissing with neon\nWith the feeling that at last\nMy body had something to do and so did my mind\n\nYou sit\nAt the window. You call\nMe, across Paris,\nAmsterdam, New\nYork. Kenneth!\nMy Soviet\nGirlhood. My\nSpring, summer\nAnd fall. Do you\nKnow you have\nMissed some of them?\nAlmost all. I am\nWaiting and I\nAm fading I\nAm fainting I\u2019m\nIn a degrading state\nOf inactivity. A ball\nRolls in the gutter. I have\nTwo hands to\nStop it. I am\nA flower I pick\nThe vendor his\nClothes getting up\nToo early and\nWhat is it makes this rose\nInto what is more fragrant than what is not?\n\nI am stunned I am feeling tortured\nBy \u201cA man of words and not a man of deeds\u201d\n\nI was waiting in a taxicab\nIt was white letters in white paints it was you\nSpring comes, summer, then fall\nAnd winter. We really have missed\nAll of that, whatever else there was\nIn those years so sanded by our absence.\nI never saw you for as long as half a day\n\nYou were crying outside the bus station\nAnd I was crying\u2014\nI knew that this really was my life\u2014\nI kept thinking of how we were crying\nLater, when I was speaking, driving, walking,\nLooking at doorways and colors, mysterious entrances\nSometimes I\u2019d be pierced as by a needle\nSometimes be feverish as from a word\nBooks closed and I\u2019d think\nI can\u2019t read this book, I threw away my life\nThese held on to their lives. I was\nExcited by praise from anyone, startled by criticism, always hating it\nTraveling around Europe and being excited\nIt was all in reference to you\nAnd feeling I was not gradually forgetting\nWhat your temples and cheekbones looked like\nAnd always with this secret\n\nLater I thought that what I had done was reasonable\nIt may have been reasonable\nI also thought that I saw what had appealed to me\nSo much about you, the way you responded\nTo everything your excitement about\nMe, I had never seen that. And the fact\nThat you were Russian, very mysterious, all that I didn\u2019t know\nAbout you\u2014and you didn\u2019t know\nMe, for I was as strange to you as you were to me.\nYou were like my first trip to France you had\nMade no assumptions. I could be\nClearly and Passionately and\nNobly (as you\u2019d said) who I was\u2014at the outer limits of my life\nOf my life as my life could be\nIdeally. But what about the dark part all this lifted\nMe out of? Would my bad moods, my uncertainties, my\nDistrust of people I was close to, the\nTwisty parts of my ambition, my\nEnvy, all have gone away? And if\nThey hadn\u2019t gone, what? For didn\u2019t I need\nAll the strength you made me feel I had, to deal\nWith the difficulties of really having you?\nWhere could we have been? But I saw so many new possibilities\nThat it made me rather hate reality\nOr I think perhaps I already did\nI didn\u2019t care about the consequences\nBecause they weren\u2019t \u201cpoetic\u201d weren\u2019t \u201cideal\u201d\n\nAnd oh well you said we walk along\nYour white dress your blue dress your green\nBlouse with sleeves then one without\nSleeves and we are speaking\nOf things but not of very much because underneath it\nI am raving I am boiling I am afraid\nYou ask me Kenneth what are you thinking\nIf I could say\nIt all then I thought if I could say\nExactly everything and have it still be as beautiful\nBillowing over, riding over both our doubts\nSome kind of perfection and what did I actually\nSay? Marina it\u2019s late. Marina\nIt\u2019s early. I love you. Or else, What\u2019s this street?\nYou were the perfection of my life\nAnd I couldn\u2019t have you. That is, I didn\u2019t.\nI couldn\u2019t think. I wrote, instead. I would have had\nTo think hard, to figure everything out\nAbout how I could be with you,\nReally, which I couldn\u2019t do\nIn those moments of permanence we had\nAs we walked along.\n\nWe walk through the park in the sun. It is the end.\nYou phone me. I send you a telegram. It\nIs the end. I keep\nThinking about you, grieving about you. It is the end. I write\nPoems about you, to you. They\nAre no longer simple. No longer\nAre you there to see every day or\nEvery other or every third or fourth warm day\nAnd now it has been twenty-five years\nBut those feelings kept orchestrating I mean rehearsing\nRehearsing in my and tuning up\nWhile I was doing a thousand other things, the band\nIs ready, I am over fifty years old and there\u2019s no you\u2014\nAnd no me, either, not as I was then,\nWhen it was the Renaissance\nFiltered through my nerves and weakness\nOf nineteen fifty-four or fifty-three,\nWhen I had you to write to, when I could see you\nAnd it could change.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

is still my home sweet home\nBut where have all our heroes gone?\n\nI saw a group of boys the other day\nStanding in the corner of a playground\nLooking and laughin' at a magazine\nAnd I overheard one of the boys\nSaid man is he ever cool\nAnd he pointed to the man\nWho's picture was on the magazine cover\nAnd everybody kinda said under their breath\nYeah, he's cool alright\nAnd I got sick to my stomach\nBecause I'd seen the cover\nAnd the man that they were talking about\nHad instigated a riot in one of our major cities last summer\nAnd the magazine was writing\nAbout how the police were unkind to him\nThe judges were not fair with him\nAnd how he talked back and slung\nHis long hair about and cussed\nAnd did his things and they made him into a regular hero\n\nAnd inside this magazine was the story of a baseball player\nWho got involved with the gamblers\nOf the football player who said that football was not the end\nJust a means to an end. meanin' the girls and the good times\nAnd a story of a folk singer who proudly claims\nTo be both a member of a party ailen\nTo our government and a nontax payin' citizen\n\nThese young boys read with open eyes and open minds\nAnd I thought to myself my God\nAre these the people that these young boys look up to\nAre these their idols, are these the heroes\nOf the now generation?\n\n(America is still my home sweet home)\n(But where have all our heroes gone?)\nYou might also likeI had heroes when I was a kid, we all did\nAnd our heroes did their thing too\nLike General Douglas McArthur\nWho returned like he said he would\nLike Gene Autry and Roy Rogers\nWho chased the bad guys right off the screen\nLike Lindberg who flew the ocean\nAnd Jesse Owens who showed Hitler\nAnd John Wayne and Gerry Cooper\nAfter all didn't they really win the war\nAnd General Ike bless your soul\n'Cause he made us feel safe\n\nWe've killed some of our recent heroes\nThe Kennedys and Kings\nAnd even as great as their space feats are\nHow many of the astronauts can you name huh how many\nMy heroes were people like Joe DiMaggio\nWho proved that nice guys can finish first\nAnd Stan Musian who never had an unkind word for anybody\nAnd Winston Churchill who's two fingers\nRaised together meant victory\n\nNot just a let-your-enemy-have-it-all kind of artificial peace\nThis country needs a lotta things today friends\nBut it doesn't need any one thing anymore\nThan it needs some real heroes\nMen who know what it means\nTo be looked up to by a griny faced kid\nMen who wanna sign autograph books\nAnd not deal under the table\nMen who are willing to play the game\nWith the people who made them heroes\nMen who don't mind putting on a white hat\nAnd saying thank you and please\nI wish I knew more men that I'd be proud of\nFor my son to look up to and say\nDaddy when I grow up I want to be just-like-him\n\n(Where have all our heroes gone?)...Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3652743",

Was Richard Simmons hunting?\n- What are you doing? - I'm the best man!\nNow Michael is claiming racism.\nHoney, you gotta pick a race first.\nWhat are you claiming there? Mistreatment of elves?\nGirl, you gotta pick a gender, too. What are you going for?\nYou were Diana Ross. Now you just left it all behind.\nMichael, you're not a freak. You're just surgically enhanced...\nand you spend more money than the Vatican.\nIf you go to Neverland, it says:\n\"You must be this high to ride Michael\"\nObviously, the lawyers at HBO are going, \"Fuck!\"\nHow fucked up would you have to be\nfor Al Sharpton to go, 'I'm outta here, man!'\nIf Al Sharpton bails on your ass,\neven rats are going, 'Man, that guy's quick!'\nFrom the Don King School of hair processing...\nHe's riding for office in Idaho on the\n\"What a fucking, wild, crazy chance in hell you'll be elected\" ticket.\nSorry, my lips just went...\nProbably dyslexic people went: \"Thank you, Habib!\"\nThank you!\nWe were worried about the pledge of the legions.\nWe're gonna say: \"One nation under dog!\"\nIt's OK.\nAnd now people are going: \"I've got a cure for this!\"\nOne nation under Canada, above Mexico.\nBut then you have to the whole...\nAnthems like: \"Someone bless America!\"\nOn a dollar bill, instead of \"In God We Trust\",\n\"In Gates We Trust\"!\nMr Gates, when did you realize you're creating monopoly!\nMonopoly is just a game, senator.\nI'm trying to control the fucking world.\nHave you seen Windows Millennium?\nRight now it's Information Technology.\nSoon it will be Total Information Technology.

For a while everything went like you're OK.\nPeople like to great new Yorkers: \"Have a nice day, asshole!\"\nFuck you, my friend!

And God made them go like...\nBeautiful titties, all shapes, sizes and women running they are going...\nAnd then they hit a breeze and chicken's done!\nYeah, baby!\nThese are not like the tits in Vegas,\nwhere even God goes: \"I didn't make those!\"\nFake tits are like Nazis.\nThey don't laugh, they don't dance, they're just...\nI'm walking here!\nI've seen a woman turn and the tits stayed there.\nIt's like they don't have any teeth because they knock them out.\nI've seen tits that are really bad\nwith the nipples on the top. They look like Kilroy.\nWhen you go up Madison Avenue you see some hardcore surgery like...\nI'm so scared, but I can't express it.\nThese ladies had so much surgery are going:\n\"What are these lumps under my eyes?\"\nThose are your tits, madam!\n- And what's this? - Don't ask, Mrs. Trotski!\nThis is good news for you.\nAnd girls getting botox injections...?\n- Look, I don't have any wrinkles. - You also have no expression.\nYou look like you've had a slight coma, but you're beautiful.\nOne guy say to you: \"Baby, I want you to get your tits done for me!\"\nDo it for me. Do it for your daddy man.\nAnd you say: \"OK, daddy man!\"\nThan I want you to get your balls done for me, OK ?\nI want you to get those big old basket balls.\nSo when you do the Baywatch thingy, it's like...\nNothing drives a woman crazy like a big old Easter basket on her bunny.\nYou go to the doctor...\nGirls...\nPayback's a bitch ! Go for it, girls !\n'Cause you went through a hard time. This whole winter was so bizarre.\nTemperatures were like\n. It was fucking weird!\nThe weathermen are going:\n\"I don't fucking know what's going on!\"\nLet's just see what happens.\nFlowers were like Anne Heche going: \"I'm out, I'm in, I'm out...\"\nI don't know when to go.\nGeorge came back from Japan and went: \"I went to the Coyote Conference\"\n- No, it's Kyoto. - That's a very good car.\nGeorge, walk away.\nThey say there's no global warming.\nBut right now the North Pole is a pool.\nIt is beyond global warming. At this point is cooking.\nAt\nin the middle of the country: \"Is it hot enough for you?\"\nNo, I like sweat to be rolling down the crack of my ass like Niagara.\nI like my old man's titties to lactate, my man.\nYou see people in shorts and you're going: \"Please, don't wear those!\"\nPlease, don't put those on!\nIf you go to South West Airline:\n\"You're not fat, you're horizontally challenged\"\nBig people at South West Airlines have buy two seats.\nThe problem is that they are not together.\nAnd you have to put your tits in the overhead rack.\nPeople don't mind now. We're working our way through.\nAll over the country we've got weird things.\nIn Houston they got Enron field.\nWe're gonna call it  fifth Amendment for you.\nWe can't call it: \"We're fucked for you!\"\nArthur Anderson put in the chairs that spin both ways.\nAnd now Martha Stuart may become somebody's bitch.\nNo!\nSay it ain't so!\nI like to consider it more like \"severed companion\".\nIf you only have one room, and I like to call it my \"private space,\"\nuse the light well. You have vertical bars, don't use horizontal blinds.\nAlso, think of your ankle bracelet as an accessory.\nThe first time she has lunch going: \"You call this quash?\"\nShut up, bitch! You're inside now, you're mine!\nAll over things have been going good. I've been to Memphis, to Graceland.\nI never knew that Ray Charles had a decorating license.\nThey're some severe...\nThey're colors there that have never seen daylight.\nI've been to Nashville, I've heard people sing songs like:\n\"Take your finger outta my ass, 'cause I'm leaving you behind!\"\nWeird shit people do now.

They came through.\nEverybody's worried about people playing baseball on steroids.\nHere's one quick way you tell:\non steroids, your balls shrink and your head grows.\nSo if someone steps up to the plate\nwith a Mardi Gras head and Raisinettes, you're out!\nPoor Barry Bonds! They won't pitch to him\nand when they do it, they're trying to kill him.\nHe's like Yasser Arafat of baseball.\nFor Jerusalem I have an interesting plan.\nIt's called a timeshare, like Miami, let's try that.\nJews will get Hanukkah and Passover,\nChristians will get Christmas and Easter\nand Muslims will have Ramadan and the other holiday, Kaboom.\nObviously, the people of HBO are going \"Oh, fuck off.\nWhat are you doing, you asshole.\"\nI'm very excited because this is my time\nwhen I was watching World Cup Soccer, my man.\nI saw world cup, baby.\nThere's a few soccer fans, the rest of you are going:\n\"Uh, that's like football without pads, right?\"\nFor the rest of the world, it's football.\nFor us, it's \"A strange sport, played by damaged people.\"\nWe made it in the World Cup. Everyone plays it.\nNot like the World Series, 'cause the French don't have a baseball team.\nIf they did, they would only have left field and no one would be safe.\nYou know what I'm saying?\nWhat can you do, huh? It is Bastille day, alore.\nThe day that Marie Antoinette gave the ultimate head. Look out!\nWe are French. Fuck you, Americans, I don't care!\nMy friend Lance Armstrong is racing right now in The Tour du France.\nAnd every year the French go, \"He is on chemicals.\"\n\"It's chemotherapy, you little toad suckers.\"\nOkay, he has one testicle, he's aerodynamic.\nEveryone, cut off your balls. You'll be quicker.\nDo it.

I got a ball. I kick the ball!\nUnlike the Brazilians. When they play is like...\nAnd the fans...\nBrazilians are going: \"Look, I'm playing soccer...\nLook, I'm scoring!\nAnd now I'm kicking the ball.\"\nSoccer is kinda mellow, you know. Is a little passive aggressive though.\nI didn't do anything... What are you looking at?\nIt's not like hockey, when someone comes up with a stick and goes:\n\"Bang, mother fucker!\"\nThat's why there are no Spanish hockey players.\nWhen a white guy takes a stick and goes...\n\"Motherfucker, I'm going to cut you off now!\"\nAnd you, Freddie Krugger bitch, take off the mask, mother fucker!\nComing in there! Katami!\nSometimes guys do this weird thing... They fall down and pretend like...\nI've been killed... I've been blinded...\nThere's nobody near me, huh? OK, I'm kidding!\nAnd the referee comes over: \"Yellow card!\"\nTwo yellow cards. \"Red card!\"\nThree cards. \"Green card!\"\nAnd the referee is so sweet, too.\n\"What's your name? Turn around.\nWhy didn't you call me after the Mexico game ?\nNot like football referees: \"Too much commercial time\"\nMad white man dancing on the field.\nMoving away. Moving away.\nIn the World Cup they always claim there's bad refereeing,\nsomeone may have been paid off.\nOh, shit, say it ain't so!\nYou're telling me that the Oscars are also political?

That's the Clinton money!\"\nNext is gonna be Joey Butafuoco fighting John Wayne Bobbit.\nThere will be no hitting bellow the belt there, my friend.\nFuck, man, give it back! My balls are in the front row.\nWhat's next? The Nixon's daughters belt for the library money.\nBe there as my bitches go at it.\nAt this point, even Caligula is going:\n\"What the fuck are you people doing?\"\nWhy don't you have Hannibal Lector and Iron chef\njust kick out the jams?\n'Cause you got the chamber, the chair, fear factor.\nPeople in Texas are going \"We got those shows.\nWe just don't film them.\"\nTwo weeks ago, Supreme Court banned the execution of retarded people.\nPeople in Texas are going, \"Shit, where's the fun in that?\"\n'Cause they were zapping retarded people every other week.\nIt was like, \"Go sit on Santa's lap, Timmy.\"\nAnd I know the definition of \"retarded\" in Texas is pretty wide.\nIt's crazy!\nEven a Taliban is going: \"You are crazy mother fuckers!\"\nThere was a guy with one leg. They wouldn't gonna give him a wooden leg.\nHe's gonna be dead man hopping.\nThere's a moment of compassion. Before the lethal injection,\nthey do an alcohol swab. Which is so nice!\nWhat the fuck are you doing?\nWe don't want you to get that last second infection!\nIt's all safe now.\nYou remember the Winter Olympics. They had them in Utah. Great place!\nWhat, was Amish country booked, what happened?\nCommon down to Salt Lake! We're gonna party like it's\n.\nBring your wives. Oops! Come on down!\nAt the closing ceremony they introduced\nDonnie and Marie, as the first couple of Utah.\nI went: \"Aha, honey, no! They're only a couple in Arkansas.\nIf you're going to Georgia, Ted Turner and Jane Fonda broke up.\nJane found God and Ted found out it wasn't him.\nAbout the Olympics once again,\nwe're talking about the figure skating.\nI find the figure skating to be kinda sexy.\nNot ice dancing, which is polka on Valium. That's not good.\nThat's that pair figure skating. There's one very special lift.\nWhere the male skater goes...\nRight here!\nWhere even a gynecologist would go: \"Put on a glove, man!\"\nWho's your daddy? Who's your daddy?\nAnd I'm going: \"Let's cut the foreplay,\nlet's have ice fucking, come on!\"\nNipples aroused...\nAnd she holds on without her hands!\nEven the French judge would go: \"I like it!\"\n\"I don't care. I'm giving them the medal. Fuck the Canadians!\"\n\"So fabulous!\"\nThere's other kinda sexual thing in the Olympics: the luge,\nabout which I have only one question:\nwhat drunken, German gynecologist invented this sport?\nWhat guy went, \"I want to dress like a sperm,\nshove an ice skate in my ass,\nand go balls first down an ice chute.\nYa. That would be fun.\"\nNo! This is for pussies!\n- How will you stir? - I will do Kegels!\nI will flex my ass and go down the aisle.\nAnd do not talk to me about two men luge.\nI'm saying \"Boys, get a room!\"\nMake that turn, you bastard, make it.\nHard right, you fucker, hard right!\nPour guy gets to the end of the run: \"I got wood, man, I'm sorry!\"\nYou cost us the race!\nYour penis going brr was\nof a second winds resistance!\nWe could've won if you weren't going brrring!\nDolphin boy!\nThere's always some horrible drug scandal.\nThis year was a Spanish cross-country skilor...\nSkilor, which is like a skier.\n- Are you a skilor? - Yes!\nThey accused him of taking some performance enhancing drug.\nLike an elephant growth hormone.\nAre you on some sort of drug?\nAre you taking an animal tranquilizer?\nAnd they didn't bother drug-testing the snowboarders.\nGo, go my little boys, have fun!\nI guess they realized the word \"half pipe\" meant something.\nRemember the kid who won the gold medal?\nHe was in freestyle.\n- You wanna be on a box of Wheaties? - No. Count Dracula.\nAha, a clue, Sherlock!\nThe poor Canadian snowboarder, in\nOlympics,\nthey took away his medal because he tested positive for marijuana,\nwhich is kinda redundant number one.\nNumber two, they said that marijuana was a \"performance-enhancing drug\".\nMarijuana enhances many things, colors, tastes, sensations,\nbut you are certainly not fucking empowered.\nWhen you're stoned, you're lucky if you can find your own goddamn feet.\nThe only way it's a performance-enhancing drug is\nif there's a big fucking Hershey bar at the end of the run.\nThen you'll be like...\nThen you'll be like a Swiss ski jumper going, \"I'm there!\"\nPour Canadian snowboarder. They asked for his medal back\nand he couldn't find it.

First was your president, who's a cretin\".\nQuebec is going to break away from Canada, but still keep the currency.\nIt's like a kid moving out of the house,\n\"but I still would like to get money\". Fuck off you!\nCanadian money is also called \"the Looney\".\nHow can you take an economic crisis seriously?\n- The Looney is down! - Oh, how sad for you!\nWhat are you saying, eh?\nEveryone was so happy that at the Olympics the security was so tight.\nSecurity was amazing at the Olympics.\nYou chose the whitest fucking State in the Union!\nAn Arab in Utah is like an albino at the Apollo. You would notice!\n- I found one! - It's just Ted. Everybody out!\nThe problem was that there was basically white powder everywhere.\nAll the dogs looking for Anthrax were going:\n\"You go, man, you go!\"\nPour dogs they looked for Anthrax and cocaine.\nIn the cage at the end of the day they're going:\n\"I can't taste my ass, I don't know why?\"\n\"It's my tail!\"\nMeanwhile your cat sits over there going:\n\"You're still an asshole, you know that\".\nIs it me, or are cat's drag queens?\nThe way they kinda go: 'Who loves Kitty?'\n\"Are these your shoes?\"\nWho loves Kitty? Who loves Kitty?\nMale cats have an amazing thing,\nkinda walk around going: \"That's mine!\"\n\"Mine!\"\n\"I like that too.\"\nThank God men aren't like that!\n\"Nice car, Bob. Mine now!\"\n- What are you doing? - Just shopping!\nThe whole Anthrax thing had people going...\nThey said: \"Don't open your mail!\"\n- Why? - There's white powder in envelopes.\nReally?!\nYour mother and I used to look for white powder in envelopes.\nWe weren't on-line. We did lines, my friend.\nAnd there were ninjas on the fucking line, trying to kill us.\nAnd now, there are people trying to kill us.\nAnd that's why I bought a gas mask.\nI can't even get a condom on when I want to!\n\"Hey, baby. Yeah, I got a love glove. Hold on.\"\n\"I'll be right with you, honey.\"\n\"Don't go away on me now.\"\nYou're playing \"Beat the cock\".\n\"I got it, I got it!\"\nThere's your penis like a midget in a diving suit...\n\"I don't think we're going in today, Pete.\nWe didn't make the deadline.\"\nRemember when they sent Anthrax to Tom Daschle's office?\nAnd they cleared that fucking place out.\nEverybody out, come on! Helmets, suits, they're all leaving.\nAnd when the Congressman walked out they go:\n\"But the rest of you, go about your lives.\"\n\"Everything is perfectly OK.\"\n\"We'll be miles away.\"\nIt's like when you go to the dentist and he puts a shit over your balls.\nHe walks behind concrete, going: \"You'll be fine!\"\nHow can you tell if Congress was sick?\nIt's night of the living dead anyway.\nAll those old senators going:\n\"The confederate flag is just the symbol of states' rights.\"\nYeah, and the swastika is just a good luck charm.\nWhen did Ted Kennedy become Jabba the Hutt?\nHe's huge!\nYou're a Kennedy, not a Maisy's day float, come on!\nBring him down. We're voting!\nStep away, boy. I said \"no\" to the Crispy Cream.\nCongress recently approved the covert plan\nto assassinate Saddam Hussein.\nSo what they've done, is PUBLICLY approve\nthe secret plan to assassinate Hussein.\nI wonder if he knows?\nI know there's a cure for bio terrorism or whatever it is.\nAnd it lies within Keith Richards, I know that.\nHe is the only man on the planet\nwho can go: \"Anthrax? All right...\"\nDoesn't go with my E. cola, but fuck...!\nKeith is the only man who can make the Osbornes look fucking Amish.\nI've seen him going to a drug dealer who said: \"I'm out, man!\"\n\"I have nothing left.\"\nSupposedly he goes to Switzerland and changes his blood.\nNot like one pike, but like a fucking Chevrolette, all of it.\nI just wanna know who gets his blood?\nSome old Swiss man going:\n\"You've gotta go on tour, bitch!\"\n\"We gotta pay for mixed babies.\"\nWe may all be dead and gone,\nKeith will still be there with five cockroaches.\nHe'll be going, \"I smoked your uncle, did you know that?\nFucking crazy...\"\nEvery so often, Rumsfeld comes out and goes,\n\"I don't know where. I don't know when.\nBut something awful's going to happen.\nThank you, that's all for today, no further questions.\"\nExcuse me, can you give me a clue?\nWhat is it, the Central \"Intuitive\" Agency now?\nAre you working with Miss Cleo?\nI don't know where, I don't know when,\nbut sometin' awful's gonna happen!\nAnd definitely don't marry that fat man.\nHe only wants you for your money, girl!\nPeople are suing Miss Cleo for fraud. I went: \"Fucking da!\"\nWhat do you want? A blind tarot card before you go, \"Ah ha!\"\nIf she's a psychic, why does she need a fuckin' phone number?\nNumber two, that fake Jamaican accent?\nIf she was a real psychic,\nshe'd be one of those Louisiana psychics, like, \"You gonna die!\"\nThey have to puck your ass up\nand have a place for your bike, come on now!\nIt's like buying hair care products from Cher.\nShe's wearing a wig, you idiot!\nTake that abdominal thing helping you lose weight\nwhile it shocks your fat ass sitting watching TV.\nI'm getting six-pack-abs by knocking my testicles around!\nYou strap that to your head.\nAnd say, \"I will not buy stupid shit for no reason!\"\nNow we are in troubled times.\nWhen it happened, I thought the Statue of Liberty would change.\nInstead of \"Give me your tired and your poor,\"\nit would be her with a baseball bat going \"You want a piece of me.\"\nThere was hardcore security. In NY stopping people in the tunnel..\nIn Washington they had F-  s flying, air cover everywhere.\nIn San Francisco, not so hardcore security.\nAt Golden Gate Bridge there's a Hummer and I'm talking about the car.\nOne Hummer here, two Guardsmen, same at the other end of the bridge.\nThe problem is that the Hummer and the Guardsmen\nare in jungle camouflage.\nFor those who never been to SF, the bridge is bright orange.\nSo I feel like going: \"Be vewy, vewy quiet.\nWe're wooking for tewwowists.\"\nAirport security, before all this happened it was:\n\"Beep, OK, get on the plane, come on.\"\n\"What's that? Oh, that's a gun. OK, get on the plane.\"\nYou could carry a four inch blade, that's about that long.\nNow, you can't even take a nail-clipper on a plane.\nWhat, are they afraid you're gonna go \"All right!\nGive me the plane or the bitch loses a cuticle.\nI have a nail file. I can be irritating.\"\nAnd if you have a steak or a piece of meat, they won't give you a knife.\nIt's like the quest for fire flight.\n\"Sir, you're making a lot of noise.\"\nThe Hindu man in the back is going: \"Hold the bowl higher\".\n\"Don't be afraid to beg, use your hands.\"\nNow the airport security is tight. You go through the metal detector\nand if you are heavily pierced, like some of my friends:\n\"Take out your keys, sir.\"\n\"Tip of the iceberg.\"\nFor those playing the home game, this is called a Prince Albert.\nI'm sure that was his last wish.\nI'm sure Albert said, \"Victoria, I'm dying.\nI want you to name a museum, a performance hall\nand a bolt through the cock after me.\"\n\"That will be Victoria's Secret. Go, my darling.\"\n\"Say a little song to people that have little anal floss.\"\nAnd I'm talking heavily pierced.\nNot like Britney Spears: \"I'm a virgin!\"\nYeah and Michael Jackson is the father. Move on!\nI'm talking like a hoop through your nipple.\nYou know, lady.. I'm guessing!\nJust the kind when your clothes are going...\nWhen you have a big hoop, what you're gonna do? Tie up a pony? No!\nOr you have two. He's and hers towels, whatever you want!\nA towel down here, so you can wash up. Fun!\nIt's interesting when you see a girl with a bolt through her tongue.\nWhy did you do that?\nTo enahthe the thekthual thtimulathon.\n\"Nothing drives my boyfriend crazy\nlike the feel of cold steel on his hot rock.\"\n\"But the problem is I ended up knocking out all my teeth\nand living in a trailer park with a man named Bubba.\"\nThat's the trade-off, my darling.\nYou get a tattoo with a barb wire at\nand by the time you're    it's fucking picket fence.\nAnd Madonna turns into Mother Hamilton.\n\"I'm dying, melting.\"\nHere's what you wanna do.\nWhen I was growing up I didn't have Playboy or Penthouse. Sad for me!\nBut I had National Geographic\nand the girls that got me crazy...\nYou know the ones with the slinky neck going...\nDo that, drive your parents crazy going down the stairs...\nOr do the full ubangy go:\n\"Mom, dad, it's also a CD-player\".\nAnd you can take out the plate and jump with your lower lip.\nHave fun!\nWatch grandma go: \"Shit!\"\nUnion guys going: \"Don't touch it, Mr Williams!\"\nThis shit is gonna be more precious than oil.\nTen years from now, it's already started to happen. People going:\n\"I got water.\nAnd if you want it cold, I got ice, mother fucker.\"\nGoing on the planes now, a sweet little Southern stewardess going:\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, before we board flight five,\nwe're just gonna do a few random bag checks.\"\n\"These are totally random.\"\n\"I'm just gonna read of a few names:\"\n\"Has'N'T'Been' Seen,\nAkeem Been'Laid,\nHave'N'T'Been Fucked,\nJudy Smith?\narabs and a blonde?\nAnd every black and Hispanic man in the room is going: \"Thank you, God!\"\n\"Oh, yes, we're off the list, mother fucker, yeah!\"\n\"They're gonna be fucking with you now, Habib.\"\n\"You better learn to go orderly.\"\nThey take the knitting needles from the eighty-year-old lady,\n'Why, cause I'm gonna knit an Afghan?' Give 'em to me!\nAnd they're patting a five year old boy down, and he's going,\n'What are you doing? You're not a priest, let go of me!'\nI see! You've had a problem too, I guess.\nFather pats little boys down, like,\n'Good game, boy, good game!

Fuck you!\nWould someone remove Ms Thatcher from the chamber?\nTony said: \"This heinous incident has brought us\nto the edge of oblivion...\"\n\"But our civilization shall endure!\"\nAnd there's poor W going: \"Shit, I can't even spell that.\"\n'Cause you look at Bush and you realize it's Bush  . .\nIt's a piner release. It came with certain bugs in the software.\n\"This country will not be taken hostile,\noops, delete, delete, hostage.\"\nAnd you look at him and realize he has a short attention span.\n\"Our economy is going... oh, look at the kitty\".\nHe kinda reminds me of a guy in college with a towel going... gotcha!\nYou just don't want him to drive.\nSome men are born great, some achieve greatness,\nsome get it as a graduation gift.

I don't know, I don't care!\nI know this: he's a six foot five Arab on dialysis...\nWhy is that so fucking hard to find?\nLook for somebody attached to their luggage.\nI also know this.

Great organizer, incredible with chicks.\nYou can't use him.\nChucky all the time comes out for parole\nwith a swastika on his forehead.\n- I'm better. - In many ways, yeah.\n- What would you do if you got out? - I'd kill everybody.\nWhat are we dealing with?\nOne of the fundamental things is in a Jihad.\nSounds like a country western term like Jeeha.\nAnd if you are in a Jihad and you kill an infidel\nwhich, I'm sad to say, is all of us\nand you yourself die...\nyou go to heaven and you are greeted\nby    dark-haired virgins.\nNow everyone who's ever been with one virgin is going...\n\"I don't know...\"\n\"For my talent portion...\"\nRecently, there was a article in the New York Times,\na Koran scholar said:\n\"The actual translation is not    dark-haired virgins,\nbut    crystal clear raisins.\"\nSlight difference in interpretation, really.\nIt's like instead of \"Thy shall not kill\" is \"Thy shall not wear a kilt\".\nAnd the Scottish are going: \"Fuck off!\"\nImagine some guy blows himself up, goes to the gates of Heaven:\n- Where are my bitches? - Here are your raisins.\nOr    Virgils going: \"You got a pretty face!\"\nOsama Bin Laden goes to the gates of Heaven,\nthere's George Washington going:\n\"How dare you defy that what we created\"\nand gets violent on his ass.\nother members of the Congress start kicking the shit outta him.\nOsama: \"Where are the virgins?\"\n\"   Virginians, you asshole!\"\n\"I must talk to Jesus Christ!\"\n\"Where is Jesus Christ?\"\nAnd Saint Peter goes: \"Hey, Jesus, did you call a cab?\"\nI heard it.

Nothing!\nWhat is the Buddhist terrorist do?\nGoes in the middle of the street, takes the gas... Self barbecue!\nPeople are killing each other in the name of God:\n\"What the fuck are you doing?\"\nMaking your deal with your shit.\nI don't understand the whole fundamentalist thing.\nI'm an Episcopal. That's catholic light.\nSame religion, half the guilt. It's frightening.\nCatholics have confession, Episcopals have:\n\"Thanks Giving your father has a couple of gin and tonics\"\n\"I never loved you mother, you know that, don't you?!\"\n\"I didn't, dad. And she's right there. Tell her again.\"\nEpiscopal is basically Church of England which was Henry the  -th\nbreaking away from the Catholic Church: \"I'm the fucking Pope now!\"\nThan people broke away from that church,\nthe Calvinists found him to be too loose.\nThan the Puritans broke away from the Calvinists, our ancestors,\npeople so uptight, the English kicked them out.\nHow anal do you have to be for the English to go: \"Get the fuck out!\"\n\"Take your pimp shoes and go!\"\nAnd they land here in America going: \"Hello!\"\n\"We bring you guilt, syphilis and alcohol.\"\n\"Here chief, try this and once you drunk it,\nkeep moving towards your feathers flow.

Come on!\"\nPeople like Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell say:\n\"This was brought upon us by our sinful ways.\"\nI wanna put them on a plane, take them to the ayatollah\nand have world wide fundamentalist wrestling.\nOne time only. A life after death match for all of our souls.\nLet's get ready to humble.\nHere's the drill. Fundamentalists take it to be \"the word\".\nNot translatable, not metaphorical: \"the word\".\nIn the Genesis, \"Let it be light!\" could be a metaphor for the Big Bang?\nNo. God just went click.\nWe are all descendants from Adam and Eve. So we are all cousins.\nThat's right.\nThere are miracles in the Bible.\nLike when Moses, and I'm not talking Guns'N'Moses, no!\nNot Charlton Heston going:\n\"Let the Jews go or pharaoh gets two in the head. No!\nCharlton Heston, who said:\n\"Guns don't kill people... Apes with guns kill people.\"\nNo, Chucky! The second amendment\nstarted from people going like this...\nAnd that still continues. That's OK!\nWhen Moses said to pharaoh: \"Let my people go\".\nAnd pharaoh went: \"In your dreams!\"\nAnd Moses called the God: \"God, I need some help!\"\nAnd frogs fell from the sky.\nOr maybe there were Jews with catapults going: \"Now!\".\nThank God it wasn't the French, 'cause they would go: \"Lunch!\"\n\"You're great caterers, I can't let you go, you crazy people!\"\nFrogs fell from the sky. I would be going: \"Get your shit and out!\"\nI said wait a minute! That's what we should drop on Afghanistan.\nNot bombs, not food... Fucking frogs!\nFrogs, lizards, hamsters, shit the Heaven seen.\nIf you wanna get people out of caves, a shit load of NY rats.\nNY rats would be going: \"Hey, come on, raid!\"\n\"I eat pussy literately. Bring it on!\"\nEven then pharaoh was not impressed: \"Please, David Copperfield, no!\"\nAnd then boils and then first born dies.\n\"That's it! Hebrews get out!\"\nAnd everybody...\nLet's not wait for the bread to rise.\nJust get the crackers and the skin off your penis. We're leaving.\nExcuse me! Why the skin off the penis?\nWe're traveling, people. You don't want sand in there.\nAnd this is so pass\u00e9! The dicky thing, forget it. Let's move!\nWe're going to the desert. Then they get the    commandments,\nthat would be adjusted later by certain presidents.\nAnd they get to the Red Sea.\nAnd they go: \"What now, Mr Magic, what do we do now?\"\nWe're gonna walk on the \"fregs bocks\", the \"frogs bucks...\nFrogs backs!\nThank you for watching me this far.\nObviously, I did inhale.\n\"What do we do now, Mr BigShot?\"\nAnd he calls to God again and the sea parts.\nAnd even the most doubting Jew is going: \"You're good!\"\nLet's move, don't eat the shellfish. I'll tell you why later.\nWhere are we going?\nTo Jerusalem to start years of struggling,\nand later to Miami to fuck up an election.\nAnd then the pharaoh comes, the sea closes and he calls his cat-like God\nbut the cat-like God can't do shit, 'cause it's afraid of water.\nAnd then there's another miracle.\nThe night that Mary said to Joe: \"Joe, I'm pregnant.\"\nJoe went: \"Holly Mother of God!\" She went: \"You're right!\"\n- Oh, Jesus Christ! - What a great name, Joe!\nThat is so much better than Shmul. Way to go!\n- I love you, Joe! - Hold on a minute, Mary.\n- So I'm the step father? - Yeah.\nI can't discipline him, I can't tell him he's wrong,\n'cause he'll look to me saying: \"You're not my real dad.\"\n- How did it happen? - It's immaculate, Joe.\nIt better be, Mary! It better be immaculate!\nI'm sorry I'm transforming Joe into Ralph Cramdon.\nUp to that point, all the names in the Bible are very Jewish.\nYou have Noah, Moses, Zebedee and then you get Mary and Joe.\nWe're just a hyphenate away from Mary-Jean and Joe-Bob.\nWe could've had Jim Bob, the son of God.\nPraise to him, Jim-Bob\nHe, who finds the stuff And gets me a job, Jim-Bob\nJesus was an only child. Thank God!\nWho would want to be Jerry, the brother of Christ?\nThat's a tough gig.\n\"Come on, Jerry, we're going to the beach.\"\nJesus's gonna walk on the water, feed everybody, heal them\nand get a whole bunch of disciples.\nI'll sat there with a rash and sand in my ass. Great day for me!\nHe ends up in a bar at the age of    going: \"Yeah, I'm Jerry Christ.\nYeah, I healed somebody. Come here Spot, heel! Look at that!\"\nJesus is a carpenter, I'm a plumber. You do the math!\nAnd people say to me Jesus wasn't Jewish... of course he was Jewish!\nThirty years old, single, living at home with his parents, come on.\nWorking in his father's business,\nhis mother thought he was God's gift, he's Jewish! Give it up!\nIt's an old tradition!\nAnd if he was Jewish, and many of his Disciples were Jewish,\nfor the Last Supper, would they not have gone out for Chinese?\n'Welcome to Yahweh. Hold on one minute; no service, no sandals.\nOkay, you come in now.\nYou're twelve. All I got is two tables of six. They're not together.\nI also have a table by the window, but you all have to face this way.\nYou are glowing, so I guess we don't need that lamp, that's very nice!\nYou've just turned a Szechwan chicken into a live chicken, you very good!'\nIt's said that night, he turned to his disciples,\nand said: \"One of you shall betray me.\"\nPeter said, \"Is it me, Jesus?\" Jesus said, \"It is not you Peter.\"\nSimon said, \"Is it me, Jesus?\" Jesus said, \"It is not you Simon.\"\nAnd Judas said: \"Is it me, Jesus?\"\nJesus turned to him: \"Is it me, Jesus?\"\nThus you see two traditions beginning:\nJewish sarcasm and Gentile humor. Together born!\nThe next day the miracle occurred: Crucifixion, Resurrection\nand he rose again from the dead and if he sees his shadow\nanother\nyears of guilt. Yes!\nFor me, the one big question is: how do you get Crucifixion, Resurrection\nand then chocolate bunnies, colored eggs?\nHow do you do that one?\nEven kids are going: \"Rabbits don't lay eggs. What is this?\"\nAnd you don't want a kid biting the head off a chocolate Jesus.\nYou don't want a cream filled cross going...\nYou don't wanna put raspberry jam in the grass going:\n\"We're looking for Jesus, kids, come one!\"\nWhat are we trying to do? You're trying to keep them involved.\nThat's why we have all the saints that did all those amazing things.\nThey're all there to keep your action up.\nAnd then we're starting to loose them.\nLike Saint Christopher:\n\"Chris, sorry, babe. Dashboard sales are down.\"\n\"The medals aren't selling well.\nDrop the kid off your back, pick up your stuff, you're outta here.\"\nWe're gonna have Saint Prada, all ladies accessories.\nBut I want a saint like Mother Teresa.\nShe said: \"You can do only small things with great love.\"\nAnd Pat Robinson said: \"She's not a real Christian!\"\n\"Why? 'Cause she doesn't have tag shelter and a university?\"\nMother Teresa never had a line of products, her own perfume:\n\"Compassion\" by Mother Teresa.\n\"I smell, because I care. Compassion!\"\nGandhi never had 'Gandhi Jeans',\nwhether you're simply not eating and tell the English to get the fuck out.\nThey come in size one and below.\nGandhi was an amazing man.\nThey asked him: \"What do you think about Western civilization?\"\nHe said: \"I think it would be a wonderful idea.\"\nAs beatific as Gandhi was, there was somebody in a Bombay bar going:\n\"I know Gandhi. He was a prick.\"\n\"I saw him sucking on a pork hot-dog, hitting on Mother Teresa.\"\n\"He kept saying: Who's your diaper daddy?\"\n\"I saw that with my eyes.\nIf you don't believe me, I'll bitch slap you like Shiva.\"\n\"Don't press this. Don't fucking do that!\"\nDon't go ding-dong, you asshole!\n'Cause India has the atomic bomb, my friend.\nThey could turn this place into Chicken tika.\nIndia has the bomb. Pakistan has the bomb.\nAnd we're preparing to fight over Kashmir.\nAnd your president probably thought it was a sweater. What an asshole!\nIndia detonated\nground nuclear tests.\nPakistan detonated\nground nuclear tests.\nAnd your spy satellites were like Ray Charles in the Louvre.\nThey didn't have a fucking clue.\nIndia has the bomb. Pakistan has the bomb.\nChina has the bomb.\nOr maybe they just have one billion people going \"Bum!\"\nRussia has the bomb. \"We have many bombs.\"\nWe don't know were they all are.\nMaybe you want a dirty bomb.\nAnd the French have a bomb, too.\nMaybe they have a bomb that only destroys\nrestaurants under four stars.\nThey still test their bombs. They still need their bombs.\nWhere did they do the underground test?\nIn the Sahara, in the total waste land?\nNo, fuck off! In Tahiti! In paradise.\nWhy? \"Because we're French.\"\n\"Look a Green Peace boat coming to protest.\nFuck off, I sink you.\"\n\"I'm the badest mother fucker, am I not?\"\n\"Look, I'm giving a cigarette to a baby.\"\n\"Suck on the cigarette. Life is shit. Get to know this.\"\n\"You, Americans. Fuck all of you Americans!\"\n\"Americans, you politically correct. You cultureless crass Americans.\"\n\"We hate all of you. Fuck off!\"\n\"The Germans are here. Hello, Americans!\"\n\"I love you! Come on, Americans.\"\n\"Welcome back, Americans.\"\n\"You can build the Disneyland near Paris.\"\n\"We won't go, but build it.\"\n\"I will have a Minnie mouse with armpit hair. It will be great!\"\nSmoking a Garwoise, going: \"I never loved Mickey\".\n\"He has three fingers. What am I, a bowling ball? Fuck off!\"\n\"Don't love him!\"\nBut there is one country that watches out for all of us:\nthe Swiss, ya! The Geneva Convention.\nIf there's ever a nuclear war, they will be the only people going:\n\"Vhat was that noise?\"\nIn their big hollowed up country,\nwith their chocolate and their watches. Ya!\nThe nice Germans. Ya!\nOr, as they like to say, \"the other white race.\"\nI have only one question:\nHow can you trust an army, that has a wine opener on it's knife?\nMany of you, men, have never open a Chardonnay under fire.\nYou take out the wine bottle, put out the cock and throw.\nY:i I don't know, but I've been told, Chardonnay must be self-cold\nMy God! Where did all this Impressionistic art come from?\nAnd all these jewelry from\nto\n?\nFairies must've brought it during the night.\nI have to do the vault Heimlich and cough up an account number.\nI know this one thing...\nI know there's one country that's not developing a weapon of destruction.\nThat does not have a secret weapons' lab up in the mountains.\nJamaica!\nHowdy, man!\nJamaica would never make an atomic bomb.\nThey may make an atomic bong.\nWhen the atomic bomb goes off,\nthere's devastation and radiation.\nWhen the atomic bong goes off, there's celebration!\nSmoke a split for the communion.\nIf you don't see Jesus than, you never will.\nI know only one thing.\nI never met me an angry pot smoker.\nI never met a man who said: \"Hey, you fucking prick!\"\n\"Oh, fuck!\nWhat was I gonna do?!\"\n\"Hold me, you piece of shit.

Circe) LyricsThe Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape.

After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear!

I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys!

DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.)

(With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space.

A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah.

He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!\n\n(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap!

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.\n\n\nZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!\n\n\nFLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.\n\n\nBLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C.

I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/514019", "artist_names": "Buddy Miles", "full_title": "Dreams

LARGE.\n\n\u2014\"That may not be, said then the ferryman,\nLeast we unweeting hap to be fordonne;\nFor those same islands seeming now and than,\nAre not firme land, nor any certein wonne,\nBut stragling plots which to and fro do ronne\nIn the wide waters; therefore are they hight\nThe Wandering Islands; therefore do them shonne;\nFor they have oft drawne many a wandring wight\nInto most deadly daunger and distressed plight;\nFor whosoever once hath fastened\nHis foot thereon may never it secure\nBut wandreth evermore uncertein and unsure.\"\n* * * * *\n\"Darke, dolefull, dreary, like a greedy grave,\nThat still for carrion carcasses doth crave;\nOn top whereof ay dwelt the ghastly owl,\nShrieking his balefull note, which ever drave\nFar from that haunt all other cheerful fowl,\nAnd all about it wandring ghosts did wayle and howl.\"\n\nTake five-and-twenty heaps of cinders dumped here and there in an outside city lot; imagine some of them magnified into mountains, and the vacant lot the sea; and you will have a fit idea of the general aspect of the Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles. A group rather of extinct volcanoes than of isles; looking much as the world at large might, after a penal conflagration.\n\nIt is to be doubted whether any spot of earth can, in desolateness, furnish a parallel to this group. Abandoned cemeteries of long ago, old cities by piecemeal tumbling to their ruin, these are melancholy enough; but, like all else which has but once been associated with humanity, they still awaken in us some thoughts of sympathy, however sad. Hence, even the Dead Sea, along with whatever other emotions it may at times inspire, does not fail to touch in the pilgrim some of his less unpleasurable feelings.\n\nAnd as for solitariness; the great forests of the north, the expanses of unnavigated waters, the Greenland ice-fields, are the profoundest of solitudes to a human observer; still the magic of their changeable tides and seasons mitigates their terror; because, though unvisited by men, those forests are visited by the May; the remotest seas reflect familiar stars even as Lake Erie does; and in the clear air of a fine Polar day, the irradiated, azure ice shows beautifully as malachite.\n\nBut the special curse, as one may call it, of the Encantadas, that which exalts them in desolation above Idumea and the Pole, is, that to them change never comes; neither the change of seasons nor of sorrows. Cut by the Equator, they know not autumn, and they know not spring; while already reduced to the lees of fire, ruin itself can work little more upon them. The showers refresh the deserts; but in these isles, rain never falls. Like split Syrian gourds left withering in the sun, they are cracked by an everlasting drought beneath a torrid sky. \"Have mercy upon me,\" the wailing spirit of the Encantadas seems to cry, \"and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.\"\n\nAnother feature in these isles is their emphatic uninhabitableness. It is deemed a fit type of all-forsaken overthrow, that the jackal should den in the wastes of weedy Babylon; but the Encantadas refuse to harbor even the outcasts of the beasts. Man and wolf alike disown them. Little but reptile life is here found: tortoises, lizards, immense spiders, snakes, and that strangest anomaly of outlandish nature, the aguano. No voice, no low, no howl is heard; the chief sound of life here is a hiss.\n\nOn most of the isles where vegetation is found at all, it is more ungrateful than the blankness of Aracama. Tangled thickets of wiry bushes, without fruit and without a name, springing up among deep fissures of calcined rock, and treacherously masking them; or a parched growth of distorted cactus trees.\n\nIn many places the coast is rock-bound, or, more properly, clinker-bound; tumbled masses of blackish or greenish stuff like the dross of an iron-furnace, forming dark clefts and caves here and there, into which a ceaseless sea pours a fury of foam; overhanging them with a swirl of gray, haggard mist, amidst which sail screaming flights of unearthly birds heightening the dismal din. However calm the sea without, there is no rest for these swells and those rocks; they lash and are lashed, even when the outer ocean is most at peace with, itself. On the oppressive, clouded days, such as are peculiar to this part of the watery Equator, the dark, vitrified masses, many of which raise themselves among white whirlpools and breakers in detached and perilous places off the shore, present a most Plutonian sight. In no world but a fallen one could such lands exist.\n\nThose parts of the strand free from the marks of fire, stretch away in wide level beaches of multitudinous dead shells, with here and there decayed bits of sugar-cane, bamboos, and cocoanuts, washed upon this other and darker world from the charming palm isles to the westward and southward; all the way from Paradise to Tartarus; while mixed with the relics of distant beauty you will sometimes see fragments of charred wood and mouldering ribs of wrecks. Neither will any one be surprised at meeting these last, after observing the conflicting currents which eddy throughout nearly all the wide channels of the entire group. The capriciousness of the tides of air sympathizes with those of the sea. Nowhere is the wind so light, baffling, and every way unreliable, and so given to perplexing calms, as at the Encantadas. Nigh a month has been spent by a ship going from one isle to another, though but ninety miles between; for owing to the force of the current, the boats employed to tow barely suffice to keep the craft from sweeping upon the cliffs, but do nothing towards accelerating her voyage. Sometimes it is impossible for a vessel from afar to fetch up with the group itself, unless large allowances for prospective lee-way have been made ere its coming in sight. And yet, at other times, there is a mysterious indraft, which irresistibly draws a passing vessel among the isles, though not bound to them.\n\nTrue, at one period, as to some extent at the present day, large fleets of whalemen cruised for spermaceti upon what some seamen call the Enchanted Ground. But this, as in due place will be described, was off the great outer isle of Albemarle, away from the intricacies of the smaller isles, where there is plenty of sea-room; and hence, to that vicinity, the above remarks do not altogether apply; though even there the current runs at times with singular force, shifting, too, with as singular a caprice.\n\nIndeed, there are seasons when currents quite unaccountable prevail for a great distance round about the total group, and are so strong and irregular as to change a vessel's course against the helm, though sailing at the rate of four or five miles the hour. The difference in the reckonings of navigators, produced by these causes, along with the light and variable winds, long nourished a persuasion, that there existed two distinct clusters of isles in the parallel of the Encantadas, about a hundred leagues apart. Such was the idea of their earlier visitors, the Buccaneers; and as late as 1750, the charts of that part of the Pacific accorded with the strange delusion. And this apparent fleetingness and unreality of the locality of the isles was most probably one reason for the Spaniards calling them the Encantada, or Enchanted Group.\nBut not uninfluenced by their character, as they now confessedly exist, the modern voyager will be inclined to fancy that the bestowal of this name might have in part originated in that air of spell-bound desertness which so significantly invests the isles. Nothing can better suggest the aspect of once living things malignly crumbled from ruddiness into ashes. Apples of Sodom, after touching, seem these isles.\n\nHowever wavering their place may seem by reason of the currents, they themselves, at least to one upon the shore, appear invariably the same: fixed, cast, glued into the very body of cadaverous death.\n\nNor would the appellation, enchanted, seem misapplied in still another sense. For concerning the peculiar reptile inhabitant of these wilds\u2014whose presence gives the group its second Spanish name, Gallipagos\u2014concerning the tortoises found here, most mariners have long cherished a superstition, not more frightful than grotesque. They earnestly believe that all wicked sea-officers, more especially commodores and captains, are at death (and, in some cases, before death) transformed into tortoises; thenceforth dwelling upon these hot aridities, sole solitary lords of Asphaltum.\n\nDoubtless, so quaintly dolorous a thought was originally inspired by the woe-begone landscape itself; but more particularly, perhaps, by the tortoises. For, apart from their strictly physical features, there is something strangely self-condemned in the appearance of these creatures. Lasting sorrow and penal hopelessness are in no animal form so suppliantly expressed as in theirs; while the thought of their wonderful longevity does not fail to enhance the impression.\n\nNor even at the risk of meriting the charge of absurdly believing in enchantments, can I restrain the admission that sometimes, even now, when leaving the crowded city to wander out July and August among the Adirondack Mountains, far from the influences of towns and proportionally nigh to the mysterious ones of nature; when at such times I sit me down in the mossy head of some deep-wooded gorge, surrounded by prostrate trunks of blasted pines and recall, as in a dream, my other and far-distant rovings in the baked heart of the charmed isles; and remember the sudden glimpses of dusky shells, and long languid necks protruded from the leafless thickets; and again have beheld the vitreous inland rocks worn down and grooved into deep ruts by ages and ages of the slow draggings of tortoises in quest of pools of scanty water; I can hardly resist the feeling that in my time I have indeed slept upon evilly enchanted ground.\n\nNay, such is the vividness of my memory, or the magic of my fancy, that I know not whether I am not the occasional victim of optical delusion concerning the Gallipagos. For, often in scenes of social merriment, and especially at revels held by candle-light in old-fashioned mansions, so that shadows are thrown into the further recesses of an angular and spacious room, making them put on a look of haunted undergrowth of lonely woods, I have drawn the attention of my comrades by my fixed gaze and sudden change of air, as I have seemed to see, slowly emerging from those imagined solitudes, and heavily crawling along the floor, the ghost of a gigantic tortoise, with \"Memento * * * * *\" burning in live letters upon his back.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSKETCH SECOND.\n\nTWO SIDES TO A TORTOISE.\n\n\"Most ugly shapes and horrible aspects,\nSuch as Dame Nature selfe mote feare to see,\nOr shame, that ever should so fowle defects\nFrom her most cunning hand escaped bee;\nAll dreadfull pourtraicts of deformitee.\nNo wonder if these do a man appall;\nFor all that here at home we dreadfull hold\nBe but as bugs to fearen babes withall\nCompared to the creatures in these isles' entrall\n* * * * *\n\"Fear naught, then said the palmer, well avized,\nFor these same monsters are not there indeed,\nBut are into these fearful shapes disguized.\n* * * * *\n\n\"And lifting up his vertuous staffe on high,\nThen all that dreadful armie fast gan flye\nInto great Zethy's bosom, where they hidden lye.\"\n\nIn view of the description given, may one be gay upon the Encantadas? Yes: that is, find one the gayety, and he will be gay. And, indeed, sackcloth and ashes as they are, the isles are not perhaps unmitigated gloom. For while no spectator can deny their claims to a most solemn and superstitious consideration, no more than my firmest resolutions can decline to behold the spectre-tortoise when emerging from its shadowy recess; yet even the tortoise, dark and melancholy as it is upon the back, still possesses a bright side; its calipee or breast-plate being sometimes of a faint yellowish or golden tinge. Moreover, every one knows that tortoises as well as turtle are of such a make, that if you but put them on their backs you thereby expose their bright sides without the possibility of their recovering themselves, and turning into view the other. But after you have done this, and because you have done this, you should not swear that the tortoise has no dark side. Enjoy the bright, keep it turned up perpetually if you can, but be honest, and don't deny the black. Neither should he, who cannot turn the tortoise from its natural position so as to hide the darker and expose his livelier aspect, like a great October pumpkin in the sun, for that cause declare the creature to be one total inky blot. The tortoise is both black and bright. But let us to particulars.\n\nSome months before my first stepping ashore upon the group, my ship was cruising in its close vicinity. One noon we found ourselves off the South Head of Albemarle, and not very far from the land. Partly by way of freak, and partly by way of spying out so strange a country, a boat's crew was sent ashore, with orders to see all they could, and besides, bring back whatever tortoises they could conveniently transport.\n\nIt was after sunset, when the adventurers returned. I looked down over the ship's high side as if looking down over the curb of a well, and dimly saw the damp boat, deep in the sea with some unwonted weight. Ropes were dropt over, and presently three huge antediluvian-looking tortoises, after much straining, were landed on deck. They seemed hardly of the seed of earth. We had been broad upon the waters for five long months, a period amply sufficient to make all things of the land wear a fabulous hue to the dreamy mind. Had three Spanish custom-house officers boarded us then, it is not unlikely that I should have curiously stared at them, felt of them, and stroked them much as savages serve civilized guests. But instead of three custom-house officers, behold these really wondrous tortoises\u2014none of your schoolboy mud-turtles\u2014but black as widower's weeds, heavy as chests of plate, with vast shells medallioned and orbed like shields, and dented and blistered like shields that have breasted a battle, shaggy, too, here and there, with dark green moss, and slimy with the spray of the sea. These mystic creatures, suddenly translated by night from unutterable solitudes to our peopled deck, affected me in a manner not easy to unfold. They seemed newly crawled forth from beneath the foundations of the world. Yea, they seemed the identical tortoises whereon the Hindoo plants this total sphere. With a lantern I inspected them more closely. Such worshipful venerableness of aspect! Such furry greenness mantling the rude peelings and healing the fissures of their shattered shells. I no more saw three tortoises. They expanded\u2014became transfigured. I seemed to see three Roman Coliseums in magnificent decay.\n\nYe oldest inhabitants of this, or any other isle, said I, pray, give me the freedom of your three-walled towns.\n\nThe great feeling inspired by these creatures was that of age:\u2014dateless, indefinite endurance. And in fact that any other creature can live and breathe as long as the tortoise of the Encantadas, I will not readily believe. Not to hint of their known capacity of sustaining life, while going without food for an entire year, consider that impregnable armor of their living mail. What other bodily being possesses such a citadel wherein to resist the assaults of Time?\n\nAs, lantern in hand, I scraped among the moss and beheld the ancient scars of bruises received in many a sullen fall among the marly mountains of the isle\u2014scars strangely widened, swollen, half obliterate, and yet distorted like those sometimes found in the bark of very hoary trees, I seemed an antiquary of a geologist, studying the bird-tracks and ciphers upon the exhumed slates trod by incredible creatures whose very ghosts are now defunct.\n\nAs I lay in my hammock that night, overhead I heard the slow weary draggings of the three ponderous strangers along the encumbered deck. Their stupidity or their resolution was so great, that they never went aside for any impediment. One ceased his movements altogether just before the mid-watch. At sunrise I found him butted like a battering-ram against the immovable foot of the foremast, and still striving, tooth and nail, to force the impossible passage. That these tortoises are the victims of a penal, or malignant, or perhaps a downright diabolical enchanter, seems in nothing more likely than in that strange infatuation of hopeless toil which so often possesses them. I have known them in their journeyings ram themselves heroically against rocks, and long abide there, nudging, wriggling, wedging, in order to displace them, and so hold on their inflexible path. Their crowning curse is their drudging impulse to straightforwardness in a belittered world.\n\nMeeting with no such hinderance as their companion did, the other tortoises merely fell foul of small stumbling-blocks\u2014buckets, blocks, and coils of rigging\u2014and at times in the act of crawling over them would slip with an astounding rattle to the deck. Listening to these draggings and concussions, I thought me of the haunt from which they came; an isle full of metallic ravines and gulches, sunk into the hearts of splintered mountains, and covered for many miles with inextricable thickets. I then pictured these three straight-forward monsters, century after century, writhing through the shades, grim as blacksmiths; crawling so slowly and ponderously, that not only did toad-stools and all fungus things grow beneath their feet, but a sooty moss sprouted upon their backs. With them I lost myself in volcanic mazes; brushed away endless boughs of rotting thickets; till finally in a dream I found myself sitting crosslegged upon the foremost, a Brahmin similarly mounted upon either side, forming a tripod of foreheads which upheld the universal cope.\n\nSuch was the wild nightmare begot by my first impression of the Encantadas tortoise. But next evening, strange to say, I sat down with my shipmates, and made a merry repast from tortoise steaks, and tortoise stews; and supper over, out knife, and helped convert the three mighty concave shells into three fanciful soup-tureens, and polished the three flat yellowish calipees into three gorgeous salvers.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSKETCH THIRD.\n\nROCK RODONDO.\n\n\"For they this tight the Rock of vile Reproach,\nA dangerous and dreadful place,\nTo which nor fish nor fowl did once approach,\nBut yelling meaws with sea-gulls hoars and bace\nAnd cormoyrants with birds of ravenous race,\nWhich still sit waiting on that dreadful clift.\"\n* * * * *\n\n\"With that the rolling sea resounding soft\nIn his big base them fitly answered,\nAnd on the Rock, the waves breaking aloft,\nA solemn ineane unto them measured.\"\n* * * * *\n\n\"Then he the boteman bad row easily,\nAnd let him heare some part of that rare melody.\"\n* * * * *\n\n\"Suddeinly an innumerable flight\nOf harmefull fowles about them fluttering cride,\nAnd with their wicked wings them oft did smight\nAnd sore annoyed, groping in that griesly night.\"\n* * * * *\n\n\"Even all the nation of unfortunate\nAnd fatal birds about them flocked were.\"\n\nTo go up into a high stone tower is not only a very fine thing in itself, but the very best mode of gaining a comprehensive view of the region round about. It is all the better if this tower stand solitary and alone, like that mysterious Newport one, or else be sole survivor of some perished castle.\n\nNow, with reference to the Enchanted Isles, we are fortunately supplied with just such a noble point of observation in a remarkable rock, from its peculiar figure called of old by the Spaniards, Rock Rodondo, or Round Rock. Some two hundred and fifty feet high, rising straight from the sea ten miles from land, with the whole mountainous group to the south and east. Rock Rodondo occupies, on a large scale, very much the position which the famous Campanile or detached Bell Tower of St. Mark does with respect to the tangled group of hoary edifices around it.\n\nEre ascending, however, to gaze abroad upon the Encantadas, this sea-tower itself claims attention. It is visible at the distance of thirty miles; and, fully participating in that enchantment which pervades the group, when first seen afar invariably is mistaken for a sail. Four leagues away, of a golden, hazy noon, it seems some Spanish Admiral's ship, stacked up with glittering canvas. Sail ho! Sail ho! Sail ho! from all three masts. But coming nigh, the enchanted frigate is transformed apace into a craggy keep.\n\nMy first visit to the spot was made in the gray of the morning. With a view of fishing, we had lowered three boats and pulling some two miles from our vessel, found ourselves just before dawn of day close under the moon-shadow of Rodondo. Its aspect was heightened, and yet softened, by the strange double twilight of the hour. The great full moon burnt in the low west like a half-spent beacon, casting a soft mellow tinge upon the sea like that cast by a waning fire of embers upon a midnight hearth; while along the entire east the invisible sun sent pallid intimations of his coming. The wind was light; the waves languid; the stars twinkled with a faint effulgence; all nature seemed supine with the long night watch, and half-suspended in jaded expectation of the sun. This was the critical hour to catch Rodondo in his perfect mood. The twilight was just enough to reveal every striking point, without tearing away the dim investiture of wonder.\n\nFrom a broken stair-like base, washed, as the steps of a water-palace, by the waves, the tower rose in entablatures of strata to a shaven summit. These uniform layers, which compose the mass, form its most peculiar feature. For at their lines of junction they project flatly into encircling shelves, from top to bottom, rising one above another in graduated series. And as the eaves of any old barn or abbey are alive with swallows, so were all these rocky ledges with unnumbered sea-fowl. Eaves upon eaves, and nests upon nests. Here and there were long birdlime streaks of a ghostly white staining the tower from sea to air, readily accounting for its sail-like look afar. All would have been bewitchingly quiescent, were it not for the demoniac din created by the birds. Not only were the eaves rustling with them, but they flew densely overhead, spreading themselves into a winged and continually shifting canopy. The tower is the resort of aquatic birds for hundreds of leagues around. To the north, to the east, to the west, stretches nothing but eternal ocean; so that the man-of-war hawk coming from the coasts of North America, Polynesia, or Peru, makes his first land at Rodondo. And yet though Rodondo be terra-firma, no land-bird ever lighted on it. Fancy a red-robin or a canary there! What a falling into the hands of the Philistines, when the poor warbler should be surrounded by such locust-flights of strong bandit birds, with long bills cruel as daggers.\n\nI know not where one can better study the Natural History of strange sea-fowl than at Rodondo. It is the aviary of Ocean. Birds light here which never touched mast or tree; hermit-birds, which ever fly alone; cloud-birds, familiar with unpierced zones of air.\n\nLet us first glance low down to the lowermost shelf of all, which is the widest, too, and but a little space from high-water mark. What outlandish beings are these? Erect as men, but hardly as symmetrical, they stand all round the rock like sculptured caryatides, supporting the next range of eaves above. Their bodies are grotesquely misshapen; their bills short; their feet seemingly legless; while the members at their sides are neither fin, wing, nor arm. And truly neither fish, flesh, nor fowl is the penguin; as an edible, pertaining neither to Carnival nor Lent; without exception the most ambiguous and least lovely creature yet discovered by man. Though dabbling in all three elements, and indeed possessing some rudimental claims to all, the penguin is at home in none. On land it stumps; afloat it sculls; in the air it flops. As if ashamed of her failure, Nature keeps this ungainly child hidden away at the ends of the earth, in the Straits of Magellan, and on the abased sea-story of Rodondo.\n\nBut look, what are yon wobegone regiments drawn up on the next shelf above? what rank and file of large strange fowl? what sea Friars of Orders Gray? Pelicans. Their elongated bills, and heavy leathern pouches suspended thereto, give them the most lugubrious expression. A pensive race, they stand for hours together without motion. Their dull, ashy plumage imparts an aspect as if they had been powdered over with cinders. A penitential bird, indeed, fitly haunting the shores of the clinkered Encantadas, whereon tormented Job himself might have well sat down and scraped himself with potsherds.\n\nHigher up now we mark the gony, or gray albatross, anomalously so called, an unsightly unpoetic bird, unlike its storied kinsman, which is the snow-white ghost of the haunted Capes of Hope and Horn.\n\nAs we still ascend from shelf to shelf, we find the tenants of the tower serially disposed in order of their magnitude:\u2014gannets, black and speckled haglets, jays, sea-hens, sperm-whale-birds, gulls of all varieties:\u2014thrones, princedoms, powers, dominating one above another in senatorial array; while, sprinkled over all, like an ever-repeated fly in a great piece of broidery, the stormy petrel or Mother Cary's chicken sounds his continual challenge and alarm. That this mysterious hummingbird of ocean\u2014which, had it but brilliancy of hue, might, from its evanescent liveliness, be almost called its butterfly, yet whose chirrup under the stern is ominous to mariners as to the peasant the death-tick sounding from behind the chimney jamb\u2014should have its special haunt at the Encantadas, contributes, in the seaman's mind, not a little to their dreary spell.\n\nAs day advances the dissonant din augments. With ear-splitting cries the wild birds celebrate their matins. Each moment, flights push from the tower, and join the aerial choir hovering overhead, while their places below are supplied by darting myriads. But down through all this discord of commotion, I hear clear, silver, bugle-like notes unbrokenly falling, like oblique lines of swift-slanting rain in a cascading shower. I gaze far up, and behold a snow-white angelic thing, with one long, lance-like feather thrust out behind. It is the bright, inspiriting chanticleer of ocean, the beauteous bird, from its bestirring whistle of musical invocation, fitly styled the \"Boatswain's Mate.\"\n\nThe winged, life-clouding Rodondo had its full counterpart in the finny hosts which peopled the waters at its base. Below the water-line, the rock seemed one honey-comb of grottoes, affording labyrinthine lurking-places for swarms of fairy fish. All were strange; many exceedingly beautiful; and would have well graced the costliest glass globes in which gold-fish are kept for a show. Nothing was more striking than the complete novelty of many individuals of this multitude. Here hues were seen as yet unpainted, and figures which are unengraved.\n\nTo show the multitude, avidity, and nameless fearlessness and tameness of these fish, let me say, that often, marking through clear spaces of water\u2014temporarily made so by the concentric dartings of the fish above the surface\u2014certain larger and less unwary wights, which swam slow and deep; our anglers would cautiously essay to drop their lines down to these last. But in vain; there was no passing the uppermost zone. No sooner did the hook touch the sea, than a hundred infatuates contended for the honor of capture. Poor fish of Rodondo! in your victimized confidence, you are of the number of those who inconsiderately trust, while they do not understand, human nature.\n\nBut the dawn is now fairly day. Band after band, the sea-fowl sail away to forage the deep for their food. The tower is left solitary save the fish-caves at its base. Its birdlime gleams in the golden rays like the whitewash of a tall light-house, or the lofty sails of a cruiser. This moment, doubtless, while we know it to be a dead desert rock other voyagers are taking oaths it is a glad populous ship.\n\nBut ropes now, and let us ascend. Yet soft, this is not so easy.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSKETCH FOURTH.\n\nA PISGAH VIEW FROM THE ROCK.\n\n\u2014\"That done, he leads him to the highest mount,\nFrom whence, far off he unto him did show:\"\u2014\n\nIf you seek to ascend Rock Rodondo, take the following prescription. Go three voyages round the world as a main-royal-man of the tallest frigate that floats; then serve a year or two apprenticeship to the guides who conduct strangers up the Peak of Teneriffe; and as many more respectively to a rope-dancer, an Indian juggler, and a chamois. This done, come and be rewarded by the view from our tower. How we get there, we alone know. If we sought to tell others, what the wiser were they? Suffice it, that here at the summit you and I stand. Does any balloonist, does the outlooking man in the moon, take a broader view of space? Much thus, one fancies, looks the universe from Milton's celestial battlements. A boundless watery Kentucky. Here Daniel Boone would have dwelt content.\n\nNever heed for the present yonder Burnt District of the Enchanted Isles. Look edgeways, as it were, past them, to the south. You see nothing; but permit me to point out the direction, if not the place, of certain interesting objects in the vast sea, which, kissing this tower's base, we behold unscrolling itself towards the Antarctic Pole.\n\nWe stand now ten miles from the Equator. Yonder, to the East, some six hundred miles, lies the continent; this Rock being just about on the parallel of Quito.\n\nObserve another thing here. We are at one of three uninhabited clusters, which, at pretty nearly uniform distances from the main, sentinel, at long intervals from each other, the entire coast of South America. In a peculiar manner, also, they terminate the South American character of country. Of the unnumbered Polynesian chains to the westward, not one partakes of the qualities of the Encantadas or Gallipagos, the isles of St. Felix and St. Ambrose, the isles Juan-Fernandez and Massafuero. Of the first, it needs not here to speak. The second lie a little above the Southern Tropic; lofty, inhospitable, and uninhabitable rocks, one of which, presenting two round hummocks connected by a low reef, exactly resembles a huge double-headed shot. The last lie in the latitude of 33\u00b0; high, wild and cloven. Juan Fernandez is sufficiently famous without further description. Massafuero is a Spanish name, expressive of the fact, that the isle so called lies more without, that is, further off the main than its neighbor Juan. This isle Massafuero has a very imposing aspect at a distance of eight or ten miles. Approached in one direction, in cloudy weather, its great overhanging height and rugged contour, and more especially a peculiar slope of its broad summits, give it much the air of a vast iceberg drifting in tremendous poise. Its sides are split with dark cavernous recesses, as an old cathedral with its gloomy lateral chapels. Drawing nigh one of these gorges from sea, after a long voyage, and beholding some tatterdemalion outlaw, staff in hand, descending its steep rocks toward you, conveys a very queer emotion to a lover of the picturesque.\n\nOn fishing parties from ships, at various times, I have chanced to visit each of these groups. The impression they give to the stranger pulling close up in his boat under their grim cliffs is, that surely he must be their first discoverer, such, for the most part, is the unimpaired ... silence and solitude. And here, by the way, the mode in which these isles were really first lighted upon by Europeans is not unworthy of mention, especially as what is about to be said, likewise applies to the original discovery of our Encantadas.\n\nPrior to the year 1563, the voyages made by Spanish ships from Peru to Chili, were full of difficulty. Along this coast, the winds from the South most generally prevail; and it had been an invariable custom to keep close in with the land, from a superstitious conceit on the part of the Spaniards, that were they to lose sight of it, the eternal trade-wind would waft them into unending waters, from whence would be no return. Here, involved among tortuous capes and headlands, shoals and reefs, beating, too, against a continual head wind, often light, and sometimes for days and weeks sunk into utter calm, the provincial vessels, in many cases, suffered the extremest hardships, in passages, which at the present day seem to have been incredibly protracted. There is on record in some collections of nautical disasters, an account of one of these ships, which, starting on a voyage whose duration was estimated at ten days, spent four months at sea, and indeed never again entered harbor, for in the end she was cast away. Singular to tell, this craft never encountered a gale, but was the vexed sport of malicious calms and currents. Thrice, out of provisions, she put back to an intermediate port, and started afresh, but only yet again to return. Frequent fogs enveloped her; so that no observation could be had of her place, and once, when all hands were joyously anticipating sight of their destination, lo! the vapors lifted and disclosed the mountains from which they had taken their first departure. In the like deceptive vapors she at last struck upon a reef, whence ensued a long series of calamities too sad to detail.\n\nIt was the famous pilot, Juan Fernandez, immortalized by the island named after him, who put an end to these coasting tribulations, by boldly venturing the experiment\u2014as De Gama did before him with respect to Europe\u2014of standing broad out from land. Here he found the winds favorable for getting to the South, and by running westward till beyond the influences of the trades, he regained the coast without difficulty; making the passage which, though in a high degree circuitous, proved far more expeditious than the nominally direct one. Now it was upon these new tracks, and about the year 1670, or thereabouts, that the Enchanted Isles, and the rest of the sentinel groups, as they may be called, were discovered. Though I know of no account as to whether any of them were found inhabited or no, it may be reasonably concluded that they have been immemorial solitudes. But let us return to Redondo.\n\nSouthwest from our tower lies all Polynesia, hundreds of leagues away; but straight west, on the precise line of his parallel, no land rises till your keel is beached upon the Kingsmills, a nice little sail of, say 5000 miles.\n\nHaving thus by such distant references\u2014with Rodondo the only possible ones\u2014settled our relative place on the sea, let us consider objects not quite so remote. Behold the grim and charred Enchanted Isles. This nearest crater-shaped headland is part of Albemarle, the largest of the group, being some sixty miles or more long, and fifteen broad. Did you ever lay eye on the real genuine Equator? Have you ever, in the largest sense, toed the Line? Well, that identical crater-shaped headland there, all yellow lava, is cut by the Equator exactly as a knife cuts straight through the centre of a pumpkin pie. If you could only see so far, just to one side of that same headland, across yon low dikey ground, you would catch sight of the isle of Narborough, the loftiest land of the cluster; no soil whatever; one seamed clinker from top to bottom; abounding in black caves like smithies; its metallic shore ringing under foot like plates of iron; its central volcanoes standing grouped like a gigantic chimney-stack.\n\nNarborough and Albemarle are neighbors after a quite curious fashion. A familiar diagram will illustrate this strange neighborhood:\n\nE on its side.\n\nCut a channel at the above letter joint, and the middle transverse limb is Narborough, and all the rest is Albemarle. Volcanic Narborough lies in the black jaws of Albemarle like a wolf's red tongue in his open month.\n\nIf now you desire the population of Albemarle, I will give you, in round numbers, the statistics, according to the most reliable estimates made upon the spot:\n\nMen, none\nAnt-eaters, unknown\nMan-haters, unknown\nLizards, 500,000\nSnakes, 500,000\nSpiders, 10,000,000\nSalamanders, unknown\nDevils, do\nMaking a clean total of 11,000,000\nexclusive of an incomputable host of fiends, ant-eaters, man-haters, and salamanders.\n\nAlbemarle opens his mouth towards the setting sun. His distended jaws form a great bay, which Narborough, his tongue, divides into halves, one whereof is called Weather Bay, the other Lee Bay; while the volcanic promontories, terminating his coasts, are styled South Head and North Head. I note this, because these bays are famous in the annals of the Sperm Whale Fishery. The whales come here at certain seasons to calve. When ships first cruised hereabouts, I am told, they used to blockade the entrance of Lee Bay, when their boats going round by Weather Bay, passed through Narborough channel, and so had the Leviathans very neatly in a pen.\n\nThe day after we took fish at the base of this Round Tower, we had a fine wind, and shooting round the north headland, suddenly descried a fleet of full thirty sail, all beating to windward like a squadron in line. A brave sight as ever man saw. A most harmonious concord of rushing keels. Their thirty kelsons hummed like thirty harp-strings, and looked as straight whilst they left their parallel traces on the sea. But there proved too many hunters for the game. The fleet broke up, and went their separate ways out of sight, leaving my own ship and two trim gentlemen of London. These last, finding no luck either, likewise vanished; and Lee Bay, with all its appurtenances, and without a rival, devolved to us.\n\nThe way of cruising here is this. You keep hovering about the entrance of the bay, in one beat and out the next. But at times\u2014not always, as in other parts of the group\u2014a racehorse of a current sweeps right across its mouth. So, with all sails set, you carefully ply your tacks. How often, standing at the foremast head at sunrise, with our patient prow pointed in between these isles, did I gaze upon that land, not of cakes, but of clinkers, not of streams of sparkling water, but arrested torrents of tormented lava.\n\nAs the ship runs in from the open sea, Narborough presents its side in one dark craggy mass, soaring up some five or six thousand feet, at which point it hoods itself in heavy clouds, whose lowest level fold is as clearly defined against the rocks as the snow-line against the Andes. There is dire mischief going on in that upper dark. There toil the demons of fire, who, at intervals, irradiate the nights with a strange spectral illumination for miles and miles around, but unaccompanied by any further demonstration; or else, suddenly announce themselves by terrific concussions, and the full drama of a volcanic eruption. The blacker that cloud by day, the more may you look for light by night. Often whalemen have found themselves cruising nigh that burning mountain when all aglow with a ball-room blaze. Or, rather, glass-works, you may call this same vitreous isle of Narborough, with its tall chimney-stacks.\n\nWhere we still stand, here on Rodondo, we cannot see all the other isles, but it is a good place from which to point out where they lie. Yonder, though, to the E.N.E., I mark a distant dusky ridge. It is Abington Isle, one of the most northerly of the group; so solitary, remote, and blank, it looks like No-Man's Land seen off our northern shore. I doubt whether two human beings ever touched upon that spot. So far as yon Abington Isle is concerned, Adam and his billions of posterity remain uncreated.\n\nRanging south of Abington, and quite out of sight behind the long spine of Albemarle, lies James's Isle, so called by the early Buccaneers after the luckless Stuart, Duke of York. Observe here, by the way, that, excepting the isles particularized in comparatively recent times, and which mostly received the names of famous Admirals, the Encantadas were first christened by the Spaniards; but these Spanish names were generally effaced on English charts by the subsequent christenings of the Buccaneers, who, in the middle of the seventeenth century, called them after English noblemen and kings. Of these loyal freebooters and the things which associate their name with the Encantadas, we shall hear anon. Nay, for one little item, immediately; for between James's Isle and Albemarle, lies a fantastic islet, strangely known as \"Cowley's Enchanted Isle.\" But, as all the group is deemed enchanted, the reason must be given for the spell within a spell involved by this particular designation. The name was bestowed by that excellent Buccaneer himself, on his first visit here. Speaking in his published voyages of this spot, he says\u2014\"My fancy led me to call it Cowley's Enchanted Isle, for, we having had a sight of it upon several points of the compass, it appeared always in so many different forms; sometimes like a ruined fortification; upon another point like a great city,\" etc. No wonder though, that among the Encantadas all sorts of ocular deceptions and mirages should be met.\n\nThat Cowley linked his name with this self-transforming and bemocking isle, suggests the possibility that it conveyed to him some meditative image of himself. At least, as is not impossible, if he were any relative of the mildly-thoughtful and self-upbraiding poet Cowley, who lived about his time, the conceit might seem unwarranted; for that sort of thing evinced in the naming of this isle runs in the blood, and may be seen in pirates as in poets.\n\nStill south of James's Isle lie Jervis Isle, Duncan Isle, Grossman's Isle, Brattle Isle, Wood's Isle, Chatham Isle, and various lesser isles, for the most part an archipelago of aridities, without inhabitant, history, or hope of either in all time to come. But not far from these are rather notable isles\u2014Barrington, Charles's, Norfolk, and Hood's. Succeeding chapters will reveal some ground for their notability.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSKETCH FIFTH.\n\nTHE FRIGATE, AND SHIP FLYAWAY.\n\n\"Looking far forth into the ocean wide,\nA goodly ship with banners bravely dight,\nAnd flag in her top-gallant I espide,\nThrough the main sea making her merry flight.\"\n\nEre quitting Rodondo, it must not be omitted that here, in 1813, the U.S. frigate Essex, Captain David Porter, came near leaving her bones. Lying becalmed one morning with a strong current setting her rapidly towards the rock, a strange sail was descried, which\u2014not out of keeping with alleged enchantments of the neighborhood\u2014seemed to be staggering under a violent wind, while the frigate lay lifeless as if spell-bound. But a light air springing up, all sail was made by the frigate in chase of the enemy, as supposed\u2014he being deemed an English whale-ship\u2014but the rapidity of the current was so great, that soon all sight was lost of him; and, at meridian, the Essex, spite of her drags, was driven so close under the foam-lashed cliffs of Rodondo that, for a time, all hands gave her up. A smart breeze, however, at last helped her off, though the escape was so critical as to seem almost miraculous.\n\nThus saved from destruction herself, she now made use of that salvation to destroy the other vessel, if possible. Renewing the chase in the direction in which the stranger had disappeared, sight was caught of him the following morning. Upon being descried he hoisted American colors and stood away from the Essex. A calm ensued; when, still confident that the stranger was an Englishman, Porter dispatched a cutter, not to board the enemy, but drive back his boats engaged in towing him. The cutter succeeded. Cutters were subsequently sent to capture him; the stranger now showing English colors in place of American. But, when the frigate's boats were within a short distance of their hoped-for prize, another sudden breeze sprang up; the stranger, under all sail, bore off to the westward, and, ere night, was hull down ahead of the Essex, which, all this time, lay perfectly becalmed.\n\nThis enigmatic craft\u2014American in the morning, and English in the evening\u2014her sails full of wind in a calm\u2014was never again beheld. An enchanted ship no doubt. So, at least, the sailors swore.\n\nThis cruise of the Essex in the Pacific during the war of 1812, is, perhaps, the strangest and most stirring to be found in the history of the American navy. She captured the furthest wandering vessels; visited the remotest seas and isles; long hovered in the charmed vicinity of the enchanted group; and, finally, valiantly gave up the ghost fighting two English frigates in the harbor of Valparaiso. Mention is made of her here for the same reason that the Buccaneers will likewise receive record; because, like them, by long cruising among the isles, tortoise-hunting upon their shores, and generally exploring them; for these and other reasons, the Essex is peculiarly associated with the Encantadas.\n\nHere be it said that you have but three, eye-witness authorities worth mentioning touching the Enchanted Isles:\u2014Cowley, the Buccaneer (1684); Colnet the whaling-ground explorer (1798); Porter, the post captain (1813). Other than these you have but barren, bootless allusions from some few passing voyagers or compilers.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSKETCH SIXTH.\n\nBARRINGTON ISLE AND THE BUCCANEERS.\n\n\"Let us all servile base subjection scorn,\nAnd as we be sons of the earth so wide,\nLet us our father's heritage divide,\nAnd challenge to ourselves our portions dew\nOf all the patrimony, which a few\nhold on hugger-mugger in their hand.\"\n* * * * *\n\n\"Lords of the world, and so will wander free,\nWhereso us listeth, uncontroll'd of any.\"\n* * * * *\n\n\"How bravely now we live, how jocund, how near the\nfirst inheritance, without fear, how free from little troubles!\"\n\nNear two centuries ago Barrington Isle was the resort of that famous wing of the West Indian Buccaneers, which, upon their repulse from the Cuban waters, crossing the Isthmus of Darien, ravaged the Pacific side of the Spanish colonies, and, with the regularity and timing of a modern mail, waylaid the royal treasure-ships plying between Manilla and Acapulco. After the toils of piratic war, here they came to say their prayers, enjoy their free-and-easies, count their crackers from the cask, their doubloons from the keg, and measure their silks of Asia with long Toledos for their yard-sticks.\n\nAs a secure retreat, an undiscoverable hiding-place, no spot in those days could have been better fitted. In the centre of a vast and silent sea, but very little traversed\u2014surrounded by islands, whose inhospitable aspect might well drive away the chance navigator\u2014and yet within a few days' sail of the opulent countries which they made their prey\u2014the unmolested Buccaneers found here that tranquillity which they fiercely denied to every civilized harbor in that part of the world. Here, after stress of weather, or a temporary drubbing at the hands of their vindictive foes, or in swift flight with golden booty, those old marauders came, and lay snugly out of all harm's reach. But not only was the place a harbor of safety, and a bower of ease, but for utility in other things it was most admirable.\n\nBarrington Isle is, in many respects, singularly adapted to careening, refitting, refreshing, and other seamen's purposes. Not only has it good water, and good anchorage, well sheltered from all winds by the high land of Albemarle, but it is the least unproductive isle of the group. Tortoises good for food, trees good for fuel, and long grass good for bedding, abound here, and there are pretty natural walks, and several landscapes to be seen. Indeed, though in its locality belonging to the Enchanted group, Barrington Isle is so unlike most of its neighbors, that it would hardly seem of kin to them.\n\n\"I once landed on its western side,\" says a sentimental voyager long ago, \"where it faces the black buttress of Albemarle. I walked beneath groves of trees\u2014not very lofty, and not palm trees, or orange trees, or peach trees, to be sure\u2014but, for all that, after long sea-faring, very beautiful to walk under, even though they supplied no fruit. And here, in calm spaces at the heads of glades, and on the shaded tops of slopes commanding the most quiet scenery\u2014what do you think I saw? Seats which might have served Brahmins and presidents of peace societies. Fine old ruins of what had once been symmetric lounges of stone and turf, they bore every mark both of artificialness and age, and were, undoubtedly, made by the Buccaneers. One had been a long sofa, with back and arms, just such a sofa as the poet Gray might have loved to throw himself upon, his Crebillon in hand.\n\n\"Though they sometimes tarried here for months at a time, and used the spot for a storing-place for spare spars, sails, and casks; yet it is highly improbable that the Buccaneers ever erected dwelling-houses upon the isle. They never were here except their ships remained, and they would most likely have slept on board. I mention this, because I cannot avoid the thought, that it is hard to impute the construction of these romantic seats to any other motive than one of pure peacefulness and kindly fellowship with nature. That the Buccaneers perpetrated the greatest outrages is very true\u2014that some of them were mere cutthroats is not to be denied; but we know that here and there among their host was a Dampier, a Wafer, and a Cowley, and likewise other men, whose worst reproach was their desperate fortunes\u2014whom persecution, or adversity, or secret and unavengeable wrongs, had driven from Christian society to seek the melancholy solitude or the guilty adventures of the sea. At any rate, long as those ruins of seats on Barrington remain, the most singular monuments are furnished to the fact, that all of the Buccaneers were not unmitigated monsters.\n\n\"But during my ramble on the isle I was not long in discovering other tokens, of things quite in accordance with those wild traits, popularly, and no doubt truly enough, imputed to the freebooters at large. Had I picked up old sails and rusty hoops I would only have thought of the ship's carpenter and cooper. But I found old cutlasses and daggers reduced to mere threads of rust, which, doubtless, had stuck between Spanish ribs ere now. These were signs of the murderer and robber; the reveler likewise had left his trace. Mixed with shells, fragments of broken jars were lying here and there, high up upon the beach. They were precisely like the jars now used upon the Spanish coast for the wine and Pisco spirits of that country.\n\n\"With a rusty dagger-fragment in one hand, and a bit of a wine-jar in another, I sat me down on the ruinous green sofa I have spoken of, and bethought me long and deeply of these same Buccaneers. Could it be possible, that they robbed and murdered one day, reveled the next, and rested themselves by turning meditative philosophers, rural poets, and seat-builders on the third? Not very improbable, after all. For consider the vacillations of a man. Still, strange as it may seem, I must also abide by the more charitable thought; namely, that among these adventurers were some gentlemanly, companionable souls, capable of genuine tranquillity and virtue.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nSKETCH SEVENTH.\n\nCHARLES'S ISLE AND THE DOG-KING.\n\n\u2014So with outragious cry,\nA thousand villeins round about him swarmed\nOut of the rocks and caves adjoining nye;\nVile caitive wretches, ragged, rude, deformed;\nAll threatning death, all in straunge manner armed;\nSome with unweldy clubs, some with long speares.\nSome rusty knives, some staves in fier warmd.\n* * * * *\n\nWe will not be of any occupation,\nLet such vile vassals, born to base vocation,\nDrudge in the world, and for their living droyle,\nWhich have no wit to live withouten toyle.\n\nSouthwest of Barrington lies Charles's Isle. And hereby hangs a history which I gathered long ago from a shipmate learned in all the lore of outlandish life.\n\nDuring the successful revolt of the Spanish provinces from Old Spain, there fought on behalf of Peru a certain Creole adventurer from Cuba, who, by his bravery and good fortune, at length advanced himself to high rank in the patriot army. The war being ended, Peru found itself like many valorous gentlemen, free and independent enough, but with few shot in the locker. In other words, Peru had not wherewithal to pay off its troops. But the Creole\u2014I forget his name\u2014volunteered to take his pay in lands. So they told him he might have his pick of the Enchanted Isles, which were then, as they still remain, the nominal appanage of Peru. The soldier straightway embarks thither, explores the group, returns to Callao, and says he will take a deed of Charles's Isle. Moreover, this deed must stipulate that thenceforth Charles's Isle is not only the sole property of the Creole, but is forever free of Peru, even as Peru of Spain. To be short, this adventurer procures himself to be made in effect Supreme Lord of the Island, one of the princes of the powers of the earth.\n\nHe now sends forth a proclamation inviting subjects to his as yet unpopulated kingdom. Some eighty souls, men and women, respond; and being provided by their leader with necessaries, and tools of various sorts, together with a few cattle and goats, take ship for the promised land; the last arrival on board, prior to sailing, being the Creole himself, accompanied, strange to say, by a disciplined cavalry company of large grim dogs. These, it was observed on the passage, refusing to consort with the emigrants, remained aristocratically grouped around their master on the elevated quarter-deck, casting disdainful glances forward upon the inferior rabble there; much as, from the ramparts, the soldiers of a garrison, thrown into a conquered town, eye the inglorious citizen-mob over which they are set to watch.\n\nNow Charles's Isle not only resembles Barrington Isle in being much more inhabitable than other parts of the group, but it is double the size of Barrington, say forty or fifty miles in circuit.\n\nSafely debarked at last, the company, under direction of their lord and patron, forthwith proceeded to build their capital city. They make considerable advance in the way of walls of clinkers, and lava floors, nicely sanded with cinders. On the least barren hills they pasture their cattle, while the goats, adventurers by nature, explore the far inland solitudes for a scanty livelihood of lofty herbage. Meantime, abundance of fish and tortoises supply their other wants.\n\nThe disorders incident to settling all primitive regions, in the present case were heightened by the peculiarly untoward character of many of the pilgrims. His Majesty was forced at last to proclaim martial law, and actually hunted and shot with his own hand several of his rebellious subjects, who, with most questionable intentions, had clandestinely encamped in the interior, whence they stole by night, to prowl barefooted on tiptoe round the precincts of the lava-palace. It is to be remarked, however, that prior to such stern proceedings, the more reliable men had been judiciously picked out for an infantry body-guard, subordinate to the cavalry body-guard of dogs. But the state of politics in this unhappy nation may be somewhat imagined, from the circumstance that all who were not of the body-guard were downright plotters and malignant traitors. At length the death penalty was tacitly abolished, owing to the timely thought, that were strict sportsman's justice to be dispensed among such subjects, ere long the Nimrod King would have little or no remaining game to shoot. The human part of the life-guard was now disbanded, and set to work cultivating the soil, and raising potatoes; the regular army now solely consisting of the dog-regiment. These, as I have heard, were of a singularly ferocious character, though by severe training rendered docile to their master. Armed to the teeth, the Creole now goes in state, surrounded by his canine janizaries, whose terrific bayings prove quite as serviceable as bayonets in keeping down the surgings of revolt.\n\nBut the census of the isle, sadly lessened by the dispensation of justice, and not materially recruited by matrimony, began to fill his mind with sad mistrust. Some way the population must be increased. Now, from its possessing a little water, and its comparative pleasantness of aspect, Charles's Isle at this period was occasionally visited by foreign whalers. These His Majesty had always levied upon for port charges, thereby contributing to his revenue. But now he had additional designs. By insidious arts he, from time to time, cajoles certain sailors to desert their ships, and enlist beneath his banner. Soon as missed, their captains crave permission to go and hunt them up. Whereupon His Majesty first hides them very carefully away, and then freely permits the search. In consequence, the delinquents are never found, and the ships retire without them.\n\nThus, by a two-edged policy of this crafty monarch, foreign nations were crippled in the number of their subjects, and his own were greatly multiplied. He particularly petted these renegado strangers. But alas for the deep-laid schemes of ambitious princes, and alas for the vanity of glory. As the foreign-born Pretorians, unwisely introduced into the Roman state, and still more unwisely made favorites of the Emperors, at last insulted and overturned the throne, even so these lawless mariners, with all the rest of the body-guard and all the populace, broke out into a terrible mutiny, and defied their master. He marched against them with all his dogs. A deadly battle ensued upon the beach. It raged for three hours, the dogs fighting with determined valor, and the sailors reckless of everything but victory. Three men and thirteen dogs were left dead upon the field, many on both sides were wounded, and the king was forced to fly with the remainder of his canine regiment. The enemy pursued, stoning the dogs with their master into the wilderness of the interior. Discontinuing the pursuit, the victors returned to the village on the shore, stove the spirit casks, and proclaimed a Republic. The dead men were interred with the honors of war, and the dead dogs ignominiously thrown into the sea. At last, forced by stress of suffering, the fugitive Creole came down from the hills and offered to treat for peace. But the rebels refused it on any other terms than his unconditional banishment. Accordingly, the next ship that arrived carried away the ex-king to Peru.\n\nThe history of the king of Charles's Island furnishes another illustration of the difficulty of colonizing barren islands with unprincipled pilgrims.\n\nDoubtless for a long time the exiled monarch, pensively ruralizing in Peru, which afforded him a safe asylum in his calamity, watched every arrival from the Encantadas, to hear news of the failure of the Republic, the consequent penitence of the rebels, and his own recall to royalty. Doubtless he deemed the Republic but a miserable experiment which would soon explode. But no, the insurgents had confederated themselves into a democracy neither Grecian, Roman, nor American. Nay, it was no democracy at all, but a permanent Riotocracy, which gloried in having no law but lawlessness. Great inducements being offered to deserters, their ranks were swelled by accessions of scamps from every ship which touched their shores. Charles's Island was proclaimed the asylum of the oppressed of all navies. Each runaway tar was hailed as a martyr in the cause of freedom, and became immediately installed a ragged citizen of this universal nation. In vain the captains of absconding seamen strove to regain them. Their new compatriots were ready to give any number of ornamental eyes in their behalf. They had few cannon, but their fists were not to be trifled with. So at last it came to pass that no vessels acquainted with the character of that country durst touch there, however sorely in want of refreshment. It became Anathema\u2014a sea Alsatia\u2014the unassailed lurking-place of all sorts of desperadoes, who in the name of liberty did just what they pleased. They continually fluctuated in their numbers. Sailors, deserting ships at other islands, or in boats at sea anywhere in that vicinity, steered for Charles's Isle, as to their sure home of refuge; while, sated with the life of the isle, numbers from time to time crossed the water to the neighboring ones, and there presenting themselves to strange captains as shipwrecked seamen, often succeeded in getting on board vessels bound to the Spanish coast, and having a compassionate purse made up for them on landing there.\n\nOne warm night during my first visit to the group, our ship was floating along in languid stillness, when some one on the forecastle shouted \"Light ho!\" We looked and saw a beacon burning on some obscure land off the beam. Our third mate was not intimate with this part of the world. Going to the captain he said, \"Sir, shall I put off in a boat? These must be shipwrecked men.\"\n\nThe captain laughed rather grimly, as, shaking his fist towards the beacon, he rapped out an oath, and said\u2014\"No, no, you precious rascals, you don't juggle one of my boats ashore this blessed night. You do well, you thieves\u2014you do benevolently to hoist a light yonder as on a dangerous shoal. It tempts no wise man to pull off and see what's the matter, but bids him steer small and keep off shore\u2014that is Charles's Island; brace up, Mr. Mate, and keep the light astern.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nSKETCH EIGHTH.\n\nNORFOLK ISLE AND THE CHOLA WIDOW.\n\n\"At last they in an island did espy\nA seemly woman sitting by the shore,\nThat with great sorrow and sad agony\nSeemed some great misfortune to deplore;\nAnd loud to them for succor called evermore.\"\n\"Black his eye as the midnight sky.\nWhite his neck as the driven snow,\nRed his cheek as the morning light;\u2014\nCold he lies in the ground below.\nMy love is dead,\nGone to his death-bed, ys\nAll under the cactus tree.\"\n\"Each lonely scene shall thee restore,\nFor thee the tear be duly shed;\nBelov'd till life can charm no more,\nAnd mourned till Pity's self be dead.\"\n\nFar to the northeast of Charles's Isle, sequestered from the rest, lies Norfolk Isle; and, however insignificant to most voyagers, to me, through sympathy, that lone island has become a spot made sacred by the strangest trials of humanity.\n\nIt was my first visit to the Encantadas. Two days had been spent ashore in hunting tortoises. There was not time to capture many; so on the third afternoon we loosed our sails. We were just in the act of getting under way, the uprooted anchor yet suspended and invisibly swaying beneath the wave, as the good ship gradually turned her heel to leave the isle behind, when the seaman who heaved with me at the windlass paused suddenly, and directed my attention to something moving on the land, not along the beach, but somewhat back, fluttering from a height.\n\nIn view of the sequel of this little story, be it here narrated how it came to pass, that an object which partly from its being so small was quite lost to every other man on board, still caught the eye of my handspike companion. The rest of the crew, myself included, merely stood up to our spikes in heaving, whereas, unwontedly exhilarated, at every turn of the ponderous windlass, my belted comrade leaped atop of it, with might and main giving a downward, thewey, perpendicular heave, his raised eye bent in cheery animation upon the slowly receding shore. Being high lifted above all others was the reason he perceived the object, otherwise unperceivable; and this elevation of his eye was owing to the elevation of his spirits; and this again\u2014for truth must out\u2014to a dram of Peruvian pisco, in guerdon for some kindness done, secretly administered to him that morning by our mulatto steward. Now, certainly, pisco does a deal of mischief in the world; yet seeing that, in the present case, it was the means, though indirect, of rescuing a human being from the most dreadful fate, must we not also needs admit that sometimes pisco does a deal of good?\n\nGlancing across the water in the direction pointed out, I saw some white thing hanging from an inland rock, perhaps half a mile from the sea.\n\n\"It is a bird; a white-winged bird; perhaps a\u2014no; it is\u2014it is a handkerchief!\"\n\n\"Ay, a handkerchief!\" echoed my comrade, and with a louder shout apprised the captain.\n\nQuickly now\u2014like the running out and training of a great gun\u2014the long cabin spy-glass was thrust through the mizzen rigging from the high platform of the poop; whereupon a human figure was plainly seen upon the inland rock, eagerly waving towards us what seemed to be the handkerchief.\n\nOur captain was a prompt, good fellow. Dropping the glass, he lustily ran forward, ordering the anchor to be dropped again; hands to stand by a boat, and lower away.\n\nIn a half-hour's time the swift boat returned. It went with six and came with seven; and the seventh was a woman.\n\nIt is not artistic heartlessness, but I wish I could but draw in crayons; for this woman was a most touching sight; and crayons, tracing softly melancholy lines, would best depict the mournful image of the dark-damasked Chola widow.\n\nHer story was soon told, and though given in her own strange language was as quickly understood; for our captain, from long trading on the Chilian coast, was well versed in the Spanish. A Cholo, or half-breed Indian woman of Payta in Peru, three years gone by, with her young new-wedded husband Felipe, of pure Castilian blood, and her one only Indian brother, Truxill, Hunilla had taken passage on the main in a French whaler, commanded by a joyous man; which vessel, bound to the cruising grounds beyond the Enchanted Isles, proposed passing close by their vicinity. The object of the little party was to procure tortoise oil, a fluid which for its great purity and delicacy is held in high estimation wherever known; and it is well known all along this part of the Pacific coast. With a chest of clothes, tools, cooking utensils, a rude apparatus for trying out the oil, some casks of biscuit, and other things, not omitting two favorite dogs, of which faithful animal all the Cholos are very fond, Hunilla and her companions were safely landed at their chosen place; the Frenchman, according to the contract made ere sailing, engaged to take them off upon returning from a four months' cruise in the westward seas; which interval the three adventurers deemed quite sufficient for their purposes.\n\nOn the isle's lone beach they paid him in silver for their passage out, the stranger having declined to carry them at all except upon that condition; though willing to take every means to insure the due fulfillment of his promise. Felipe had striven hard to have this payment put off to the period of the ship's return. But in vain. Still they thought they had, in another way, ample pledge of the good faith of the Frenchman. It was arranged that the expenses of the passage home should not be payable in silver, but in tortoises; one hundred tortoises ready captured to the returning captain's hand. These the Cholos meant to secure after their own work was done, against the probable time of the Frenchman's coming back; and no doubt in prospect already felt, that in those hundred tortoises\u2014now somewhere ranging the isle's interior\u2014they possessed one hundred hostages. Enough: the vessel sailed; the gazing three on shore answered the loud glee of the singing crew; and ere evening, the French craft was hull down in the distant sea, its masts three faintest lines which quickly faded from Hunilla's eye.\n\nThe stranger had given a blithesome promise, and anchored it with oaths; but oaths and anchors equally will drag; naught else abides on fickle earth but unkept promises of joy. Contrary winds from out unstable skies, or contrary moods of his more varying mind, or shipwreck and sudden death in solitary waves; whatever was the cause, the blithe stranger never was seen again.\n\nYet, however dire a calamity was here in store, misgivings of it ere due time never disturbed the Cholos' busy mind, now all intent upon the toilsome matter which had brought them hither. Nay, by swift doom coming like the thief at night, ere seven weeks went by, two of the little party were removed from all anxieties of land or sea. No more they sought to gaze with feverish fear, or still more feverish hope, beyond the present's horizon line; but into the furthest future their own silent spirits sailed. By persevering labor beneath that burning sun, Felipe and Truxill had brought down to their hut many scores of tortoises, and tried out the oil, when, elated with their good success, and to reward themselves for such hard work, they, too hastily, made a catamaran, or Indian raft, much used on the Spanish main, and merrily started on a fishing trip, just without a long reef with many jagged gaps, running parallel with the shore, about half a mile from it. By some bad tide or hap, or natural negligence of joyfulness (for though they could not be heard, yet by their gestures they seemed singing at the time) forced in deep water against that iron bar, the ill-made catamaran was overset, and came all to pieces; when dashed by broad-chested swells between their broken logs and the sharp teeth of the reef, both adventurers perished before Hunilla's eyes.\n\nBefore Hunilla's eyes they sank. The real woe of this event passed before her sight as some sham tragedy on the stage. She was seated on a rude bower among the withered thickets, crowning a lofty cliff, a little back from the beach. The thickets were so disposed, that in looking upon the sea at large she peered out from among the branches as from the lattice of a high balcony. But upon the day we speak of here, the better to watch the adventure of those two hearts she loved, Hunilla had withdrawn the branches to one side, and held them so. They formed an oval frame, through which the bluely boundless sea rolled like a painted one. And there, the invisible painter painted to her view the wave-tossed and disjointed raft, its once level logs slantingly upheaved, as raking masts, and the four struggling arms indistinguishable among them; and then all subsided into smooth-flowing creamy waters, slowly drifting the splintered wreck; while first and last, no sound of any sort was heard. Death in a silent picture; a dream of the eye; such vanishing shapes as the mirage shows.\n\nSo instant was the scene, so trance-like its mild pictorial effect, so distant from her blasted bower and her common sense of things, that Hunilla gazed and gazed, nor raised a finger or a wail. But as good to sit thus dumb, in stupor staring on that dumb show, for all that otherwise might be done. With half a mile of sea between, how could her two enchanted arms aid those four fated ones? The distance long, the time one sand. After the lightning is beheld, what fool shall stay the thunder-bolt? Felipe's body was washed ashore, but Truxill's never came; only his gay, braided hat of golden straw\u2014that same sunflower thing he waved to her, pushing from the strand\u2014and now, to the last gallant, it still saluted her. But Felipe's body floated to the marge, with one arm encirclingly outstretched. Lock-jawed in grim death, the lover-husband softly clasped his bride, true to her even in death's dream. Ah, heaven, when man thus keeps his faith, wilt thou be faithless who created the faithful one? But they cannot break faith who never plighted it.\n\nIt needs not to be said what nameless misery now wrapped the lonely widow. In telling her own story she passed this almost entirely over, simply recounting the event. Construe the comment of her features as you might, from her mere words little would you have weened that Hunilla was herself the heroine of her tale. But not thus did she defraud us of our tears. All hearts bled that grief could be so brave.\n\nShe but showed us her soul's lid, and the strange ciphers thereon engraved; all within, with pride's timidity, was withheld. Yet was there one exception. Holding out her small olive hand before her captain, she said in mild and slowest Spanish, \"Se\u00f1or, I buried him;\" then paused, struggled as against the writhed coilings of a snake, and cringing suddenly, leaped up, repeating in impassioned pain, \"I buried him, my life, my soul!\"\n\nDoubtless, it was by half-unconscious, automatic motions of her hands, that this heavy-hearted one performed the final office for Felipe, and planted a rude cross of withered sticks\u2014no green ones might be had\u2014at the head of that lonely grave, where rested now in lasting un-complaint and quiet haven he whom untranquil seas had overthrown.\n\nBut some dull sense of another body that should be interred, of another cross that should hallow another grave\u2014unmade as yet\u2014some dull anxiety and pain touching her undiscovered brother, now haunted the oppressed Hunilla. Her hands fresh from the burial earth, she slowly went back to the beach, with unshaped purposes wandering there, her spell-bound eye bent upon the incessant waves. But they bore nothing to her but a dirge, which maddened her to think that murderers should mourn. As time went by, and these things came less dreamingly to her mind, the strong persuasions of her Romish faith, which sets peculiar store by consecrated urns, prompted her to resume in waking earnest that pious search which had but been begun as in somnambulism. Day after day, week after week, she trod the cindery beach, till at length a double motive edged every eager glance. With equal longing she now looked for the living and the dead; the brother and the captain; alike vanished, never to return. Little accurate note of time had Hunilla taken under such emotions as were hers, and little, outside herself, served for calendar or dial. As to poor Crusoe in the self-same sea, no saint's bell pealed forth the lapse of week or month; each day went by unchallenged; no chanticleer announced those sultry dawns, no lowing herds those poisonous nights. All wonted and steadily recurring sounds, human, or humanized by sweet fellowship with man, but one stirred that torrid trance\u2014the cry of dogs; save which naught but the rolling sea invaded it, an all-pervading monotone; and to the widow that was the least loved voice she could have heard.\n\nNo wonder, that as her thoughts now wandered to the unreturning ship, and were beaten back again, the hope against hope so struggled in her soul, that at length she desperately said, \"Not yet, not yet; my foolish heart runs on too fast.\" So she forced patience for some further weeks. But to those whom earth's sure indraft draws, patience or impatience is still the same.\n\nHunilla now sought to settle precisely in her mind, to an hour, how long it was since the ship had sailed; and then, with the same precision, how long a space remained to pass. But this proved impossible. What present day or month it was she could not say. Time was her labyrinth, in which Hunilla was entirely lost.\n\nAnd now follows\u2014\n\nAgainst my own purposes a pause descends upon me here. One knows not whether nature doth not impose some secrecy upon him who has been privy to certain things. At least, it is to be doubted whether it be good to blazon such. If some books are deemed most baneful and their sale forbid, how, then, with deadlier facts, not dreams of doting men? Those whom books will hurt will not be proof against events. Events, not books, should be forbid. But in all things man sows upon the wind, which bloweth just there whither it listeth; for ill or good, man cannot know. Often ill comes from the good, as good from ill.\n\nWhen Hunilla\u2014\n\nDire sight it is to see some silken beast long dally with a golden lizard ere she devour. More terrible, to see how feline Fate will sometimes dally with a human soul, and by a nameless magic make it repulse a sane despair with a hope which is but mad. Unwittingly I imp this cat-like thing, sporting with the heart of him who reads; for if he feel not he reads in vain.\n\n\u2014\"The ship sails this day, to-day,\" at last said Hunilla to herself; \"this gives me certain time to stand on; without certainty I go mad. In loose ignorance I have hoped and hoped; now in firm knowledge I will but wait. Now I live and no longer perish in bewilderings. Holy Virgin, aid me! Thou wilt waft back the ship. Oh, past length of weary weeks\u2014all to be dragged over\u2014to buy the certainty of to-day, I freely give ye, though I tear ye from me!\"\n\nAs mariners, tost in tempest on some desolate ledge, patch them a boat out of the remnants of their vessel's wreck, and launch it in the self-same waves, see here Hunilla, this lone shipwrecked soul, out of treachery invoking trust. Humanity, thou strong thing, I worship thee, not in the laureled victor, but in this vanquished one.\n\nTruly Hunilla leaned upon a reed, a real one; no metaphor; a real Eastern reed. A piece of hollow cane, drifted from unknown isles, and found upon the beach, its once jagged ends rubbed smoothly even as by sand-paper; its golden glazing gone. Long ground between the sea and land, upper and nether stone, the unvarnished substance was filed bare, and wore another polish now, one with itself, the polish of its agony. Circular lines at intervals cut all round this surface, divided it into six panels of unequal length. In the first were scored the days, each tenth one marked by a longer and deeper notch; the second was scored for the number of sea-fowl eggs for sustenance, picked out from the rocky nests; the third, how many fish had been caught from the shore; the fourth, how many small tortoises found inland; the fifth, how many days of sun; the sixth, of clouds; which last, of the two, was the greater one. Long night of busy numbering, misery's mathematics, to weary her too-wakeful soul to sleep; yet sleep for that was none.\n\nThe panel of the days was deeply worn\u2014the long tenth notches half effaced, as alphabets of the blind. Ten thousand times the longing widow had traced her finger over the bamboo\u2014dull flute, which played, on, gave no sound\u2014as if counting birds flown by in air would hasten tortoises creeping through the woods.\n\nAfter the one hundred and eightieth day no further mark was seen; that last one was the faintest, as the first the deepest.\n\n\"There were more days,\" said our Captain; \"many, many more; why did you not go on and notch them, too, Hunilla?\"\n\n\"Se\u00f1or, ask me not.\"\n\n\"And meantime, did no other vessel pass the isle?\"\n\n\"Nay, Se\u00f1or;\u2014but\u2014\"\n\n\"You do not speak; but what, Hunilla?\"\n\n\"Ask me not, Se\u00f1or.\"\n\n\"You saw ships pass, far away; you waved to them; they passed on;\u2014was that it, Hunilla?\"\n\n\"Se\u00f1or, be it as you say.\"\n\nBraced against her woe, Hunilla would not, durst not trust the weakness of her tongue. Then when our Captain asked whether any whale-boats had\u2014\n\nBut no, I will not file this thing complete for scoffing souls to quote, and call it firm proof upon their side. The half shall here remain untold. Those two unnamed events which befell Hunilla on this isle, let them abide between her and her God. In nature, as in law, it may be libelous to speak some truths.\n\nStill, how it was that, although our vessel had lain three days anchored nigh the isle, its one human tenant should not have discovered us till just upon the point of sailing, never to revisit so lone and far a spot, this needs explaining ere the sequel come.\n\nThe place where the French captain had landed the little party was on the further and opposite end of the isle. There, too, it was that they had afterwards built their hut. Nor did the widow in her solitude desert the spot where her loved ones had dwelt with her, and where the dearest of the twain now slept his last long sleep, and all her plaints awaked him not, and he of husbands the most faithful during life.\n\nNow, high, broken land rises between the opposite extremities of the isle. A ship anchored at one side is invisible from the other. Neither is the isle so small, but a considerable company might wander for days through the wilderness of one side, and never be seen, or their halloos heard, by any stranger holding aloof on the other. Hence Hunilla, who naturally associated the possible coming of ships with her own part of the isle, might to the end have remained quite ignorant of the presence of our vessel, were it not for a mysterious presentiment, borne to her, so our mariners averred, by this isle's enchanted air. Nor did the widow's answer undo the thought.\n\n\"How did you come to cross the isle this morning, then, Hunilla?\" said our Captain.\n\n\"Se\u00f1or, something came flitting by me. It touched my cheek, my heart, Se\u00f1or.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Hunilla?\"\n\n\"I have said, Se\u00f1or, something came through the air.\"\n\nIt was a narrow chance. For when in crossing the isle Hunilla gained the high land in the centre, she must then for the first have perceived our masts, and also marked that their sails were being loosed, perhaps even heard the echoing chorus of the windlass song. The strange ship was about to sail, and she behind. With all haste she now descends the height on the hither side, but soon loses sight of the ship among the sunken jungles at the mountain's base. She struggles on through the withered branches, which seek at every step to bar her path, till she comes to the isolated rock, still some way from the water. This she climbs, to reassure herself. The ship is still in plainest sight. But now, worn out with over tension, Hunilla all but faints; she fears to step down from her giddy perch; she is fain to pause, there where she is, and as a last resort catches the turban from her head, unfurls and waves it over the jungles towards us.\n\nDuring the telling of her story the mariners formed a voiceless circle round Hunilla and the Captain; and when at length the word was given to man the fastest boat, and pull round to the isle's thither side, to bring away Hunilla's chest and the tortoise-oil, such alacrity of both cheery and sad obedience seldom before was seen. Little ado was made. Already the anchor had been recommitted to the bottom, and the ship swung calmly to it.\n\nBut Hunilla insisted upon accompanying the boat as indispensable pilot to her hidden hut. So being refreshed with the best the steward could supply, she started with us. Nor did ever any wife of the most famous admiral, in her husband's barge, receive more silent reverence of respect than poor Hunilla from this boat's crew.\n\nRounding many a vitreous cape and bluff, in two hours' time we shot inside the fatal reef; wound into a secret cove, looked up along a green many-gabled lava wall, and saw the island's solitary dwelling.\n\nIt hung upon an impending cliff, sheltered on two sides by tangled thickets, and half-screened from view in front by juttings of the rude stairway, which climbed the precipice from the sea. Built of canes, it was thatched with long, mildewed grass. It seemed an abandoned hay-rick, whose haymakers were now no more. The roof inclined but one way; the eaves coming to within two feet of the ground. And here was a simple apparatus to collect the dews, or rather doubly-distilled and finest winnowed rains, which, in mercy or in mockery, the night-skies sometimes drop upon these blighted Encantadas. All along beneath the eaves, a spotted sheet, quite weather-stained, was spread, pinned to short, upright stakes, set in the shallow sand. A small clinker, thrown into the cloth, weighed its middle down, thereby straining all moisture into a calabash placed below. This vessel supplied each drop of water ever drunk upon the isle by the Cholos. Hunilla told us the calabash, would sometimes, but not often, be half filled overnight. It held six quarts, perhaps. \"But,\" said she, \"we were used to thirst. At sandy Payta, where I live, no shower from heaven ever fell; all the water there is brought on mules from the inland vales.\"\n\nTied among the thickets were some twenty moaning tortoises, supplying Hunilla's lonely larder; while hundreds of vast tableted black bucklers, like displaced, shattered tomb-stones of dark slate, were also scattered round. These were the skeleton backs of those great tortoises from which Felipe and Truxill had made their precious oil. Several large calabashes and two goodly kegs were filled with it. In a pot near by were the caked crusts of a quantity which had been permitted to evaporate. \"They meant to have strained it off next day,\" said Hunilla, as she turned aside.\n\nI forgot to mention the most singular sight of all, though the first that greeted us after landing.\n\nSome ten small, soft-haired, ringleted dogs, of a beautiful breed, peculiar to Peru, set up a concert of glad welcomings when we gained the beach, which was responded to by Hunilla. Some of these dogs had, since her widowhood, been born upon the isle, the progeny of the two brought from Payta. Owing to the jagged steeps and pitfalls, tortuous thickets, sunken clefts and perilous intricacies of all sorts in the interior, Hunilla, admonished by the loss of one favorite among them, never allowed these delicate creatures to follow her in her occasional birds'-nests climbs and other wanderings; so that, through long habituation, they offered not to follow, when that morning she crossed the land, and her own soul was then too full of other things to heed their lingering behind. Yet, all along she had so clung to them, that, besides what moisture they lapped up at early daybreak from the small scoop-holes among the adjacent rocks, she had shared the dew of her calabash among them; never laying by any considerable store against those prolonged and utter droughts which, in some disastrous seasons, warp these isles.\n\nHaving pointed out, at our desire, what few things she would like transported to the ship\u2014her chest, the oil, not omitting the live tortoises which she intended for a grateful present to our Captain\u2014we immediately set to work, carrying them to the boat down the long, sloping stair of deeply-shadowed rock. While my comrades were thus employed, I looked and Hunilla had disappeared.\n\nIt was not curiosity alone, but, it seems to me, something different mingled with it, which prompted me to drop my tortoise, and once more gaze slowly around. I remembered the husband buried by Hunilla's hands. A narrow pathway led into a dense part of the thickets. Following it through many mazes, I came out upon a small, round, open space, deeply chambered there.\n\nThe mound rose in the middle; a bare heap of finest sand, like that unverdured heap found at the bottom of an hour-glass run out. At its head stood the cross of withered sticks; the dry, peeled bark still fraying from it; its transverse limb tied up with rope, and forlornly adroop in the silent air.\n\nHunilla was partly prostrate upon the grave; her dark head bowed, and lost in her long, loosened Indian hair; her hands extended to the cross-foot, with a little brass crucifix clasped between; a crucifix worn featureless, like an ancient graven knocker long plied in vain. She did not see me, and I made no noise, but slid aside, and left the spot.\n\nA few moments ere all was ready for our going, she reappeared among us. I looked into her eyes, but saw no tear. There was something which seemed strangely haughty in her air, and yet it was the air of woe. A Spanish and an Indian grief, which would not visibly lament. Pride's height in vain abased to proneness on the rack; nature's pride subduing nature's torture.\n\nLike pages the small and silken dogs surrounded her, as she slowly descended towards the beach. She caught the two most eager creatures in her arms:\u2014\"Mia Teeta! Mia Tomoteeta!\" and fondling them, inquired how many could we take on board.\n\nThe mate commanded the boat's crew; not a hard-hearted man, but his way of life had been such that in most things, even in the smallest, simple utility was his leading motive.\n\n\"We cannot take them all, Hunilla; our supplies are short; the winds are unreliable; we may be a good many days going to Tombez. So take those you have, Hunilla; but no more.\"\n\nShe was in the boat; the oarsmen, too, were seated; all save one, who stood ready to push off and then spring himself. With the sagacity of their race, the dogs now seemed aware that they were in the very instant of being deserted upon a barren strand. The gunwales of the boat were high; its prow\u2014presented inland\u2014was lifted; so owing to the water, which they seemed instinctively to shun, the dogs could not well leap into the little craft. But their busy paws hard scraped the prow, as it had been some farmer's door shutting them out from shelter in a winter storm. A clamorous agony of alarm. They did not howl, or whine; they all but spoke.\n\n\"Push off! Give way!\" cried the mate. The boat gave one heavy drag and lurch, and next moment shot swiftly from the beach, turned on her heel, and sped. The dogs ran howling along the water's marge; now pausing to gaze at the flying boat, then motioning as if to leap in chase, but mysteriously withheld themselves; and again ran howling along the beach. Had they been human beings, hardly would they have more vividly inspired the sense of desolation. The oars were plied as confederate feathers of two wings. No one spoke. I looked back upon the beach, and then upon Hunilla, but her face was set in a stern dusky calm. The dogs crouching in her lap vainly licked her rigid hands. She never looked be her: but sat motionless, till we turned a promontory of the coast and lost all sights and sounds astern. She seemed as one who, having experienced the sharpest of mortal pangs, was henceforth content to have all lesser heartstrings riven, one by one. To Hunilla, pain seemed so necessary, that pain in other beings, though by love and sympathy made her own, was unrepiningly to be borne. A heart of yearning in a frame of steel. A heart of earthly yearning, frozen by the frost which falleth from the sky.\n\nThe sequel is soon told. After a long passage, vexed by calms and baffling winds, we made the little port of Tombez in Peru, there to recruit the ship. Payta was not very distant. Our captain sold the tortoise oil to a Tombez merchant; and adding to the silver a contribution from all hands, gave it to our silent passenger, who knew not what the mariners had done.\n\nThe last seen of lone Hunilla she was passing into Payta town, riding upon a small gray ass; and before her on the ass's shoulders, she eyed the jointed workings of the beast's armorial cross.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSKETCH NINTH.\n\nHOOD'S ISLE AND THE HERMIT OBERLUS.\n\n\"That darkesome glen they enter, where they find\nThat cursed man low sitting on the ground,\nMusing full sadly in his sullein mind;\nHis griesly lockes long gronen and unbound,\nDisordered hong about his shoulders round,\nAnd hid his face, through which his hollow eyne\nLookt deadly dull, and stared as astound;\nHis raw-bone cheekes, through penurie and pine,\nWere shronke into the jawes, as he did never dine.\nHis garments nought but many ragged clouts,\nWith thornes together pind and patched reads,\nThe which his naked sides he wrapt abouts.\"\n\nSoutheast of Crossman's Isle lies Hood's Isle, or McCain's Beclouded Isle; and upon its south side is a vitreous cove with a wide strand of dark pounded black lava, called Black Beach, or Oberlus's Landing. It might fitly have been styled Charon's.\n\nIt received its name from a wild white creature who spent many years here; in the person of a European bringing into this savage region qualities more diabolical than are to be found among any of the surrounding cannibals.\n\nAbout half a century ago, Oberlus deserted at the above-named island, then, as now, a solitude. He built himself a den of lava and clinkers, about a mile from the Landing, subsequently called after him, in a vale, or expanded gulch, containing here and there among the rocks about two acres of soil capable of rude cultivation; the only place on the isle not too blasted for that purpose. Here he succeeded in raising a sort of degenerate potatoes and pumpkins, which from time to time he exchanged with needy whalemen passing, for spirits or dollars.\n\nHis appearance, from all accounts, was that of the victim of some malignant sorceress; he seemed to have drunk of Circe's cup; beast-like; rags insufficient to hide his nakedness; his befreckled skin blistered by continual exposure to the sun; nose flat; countenance contorted, heavy, earthy; hair and beard unshorn, profuse, and of fiery red. He struck strangers much as if he were a volcanic creature thrown up by the same convulsion which exploded into sight the isle. All bepatched and coiled asleep in his lonely lava den among the mountains, he looked, they say, as a heaped drift of withered leaves, torn from autumn trees, and so left in some hidden nook by the whirling halt for an instant of a fierce night-wind, which then ruthlessly sweeps on, somewhere else to repeat the capricious act. It is also reported to have been the strangest sight, this same Oberlus, of a sultry, cloudy morning, hidden under his shocking old black tarpaulin hat, hoeing potatoes among the lava. So warped and crooked was his strange nature, that the very handle of his ho seemed gradually to have shrunk and twisted in his grasp, being a wretched bent stick, elbowed more like a savage's war-sickle than a civilized ho-handle. It was his mysterious custom upon a first encounter with a stranger ever to present his back; possibly, because that was his better side, since it revealed the least. If the encounter chanced in his garden, as it sometimes did\u2014the new-landed strangers going from the sea-side straight through the gorge, to hunt up the queer green-grocer reported doing business here\u2014Oberlus for a time hoed on, unmindful of all greeting, jovial or bland; as the curious stranger would turn to face him, the recluse, ho in hand, as diligently would avert himself; bowed over, and sullenly revolving round his murphy hill. Thus far for hoeing. When planting, his whole aspect and all his gestures were so malevolently and uselessly sinister and secret, that he seemed rather in act of dropping poison into wells than potatoes into soil. But among his lesser and more harmless marvels was an idea he ever had, that his visitors came equally as well led by longings to behold the mighty hermit Oberlus in his royal state of solitude, as simply, to obtain potatoes, or find whatever company might be upon a barren isle. It seems incredible that such a being should possess such vanity; a misanthrope be conceited; but he really had his notion; and upon the strength of it, often gave himself amusing airs to captains. But after all, this is somewhat of a piece with the well-known eccentricity of some convicts, proud of that very hatefulness which makes them notorious. At other times, another unaccountable whim would seize him, and he would long dodge advancing strangers round the clinkered corners of his hut; sometimes like a stealthy bear, he would slink through the withered thickets up the mountains, and refuse to see the human face.\n\nExcept his occasional visitors from the sea, for a long period, the only companions of Oberlus were the crawling tortoises; and he seemed more than degraded to their level, having no desires for a time beyond theirs, unless it were for the stupor brought on by drunkenness. But sufficiently debased as he appeared, there yet lurked in him, only awaiting occasion for discovery, a still further proneness. Indeed, the sole superiority of Oberlus over the tortoises was his possession of a larger capacity of degradation; and along with that, something like an intelligent will to it. Moreover, what is about to be revealed, perhaps will show, that selfish ambition, or the love of rule for its own sake, far from being the peculiar infirmity of noble minds, is shared by beings which have no mind at all. No creatures are so selfishly tyrannical as some brutes; as any one who has observed the tenants of the pasture must occasionally have observed.\n\n\"This island's mine by Sycorax my mother,\" said Oberlus to himself, glaring round upon his haggard solitude. By some means, barter or theft\u2014for in those days ships at intervals still kept touching at his Landing\u2014he obtained an old musket, with a few charges of powder and ball. Possessed of arms, he was stimulated to enterprise, as a tiger that first feels the coming of its claws. The long habit of sole dominion over every object round him, his almost unbroken solitude, his never encountering humanity except on terms of misanthropic independence, or mercantile craftiness, and even such encounters being comparatively but rare; all this must have gradually nourished in him a vast idea of his own importance, together with a pure animal sort of scorn for all the rest of the universe.\n\nThe unfortunate Creole, who enjoyed his brief term of royalty at Charles's Isle was perhaps in some degree influenced by not unworthy motives; such as prompt other adventurous spirits to lead colonists into distant regions and assume political preeminence over them. His summary execution of many of his Peruvians is quite pardonable, considering the desperate characters he had to deal with; while his offering canine battle to the banded rebels seems under the circumstances altogether just. But for this King Oberlus and what shortly follows, no shade of palliation can be given. He acted out of mere delight in tyranny and cruelty, by virtue of a quality in him inherited from Sycorax his mother. Armed now with that shocking blunderbuss, strong in the thought of being master of that horrid isle, he panted for a chance to prove his potency upon the first specimen of humanity which should fall unbefriended into his hands.\n\nNor was he long without it. One day he spied a boat upon the beach, with one man, a negro, standing by it. Some distance off was a ship, and Oberlus immediately knew how matters stood. The vessel had put in for wood, and the boat's crew had gone into the thickets for it. From a convenient spot he kept watch of the boat, till presently a straggling company appeared loaded with billets. Throwing these on the beach, they again went into the thickets, while the negro proceeded to load the boat.\n\nOberlus now makes all haste and accosts the negro, who, aghast at seeing any living being inhabiting such a solitude, and especially so horrific a one, immediately falls into a panic, not at all lessened by the ursine suavity of Oberlus, who begs the favor of assisting him in his labors. The negro stands with several billets on his shoulder, in act of shouldering others; and Oberlus, with a short cord concealed in his bosom, kindly proceeds to lift those other billets to their place. In so doing, he persists in keeping behind the negro, who, rightly suspicious of this, in vain dodges about to gain the front of Oberlus; but Oberlus dodges also; till at last, weary of this bootless attempt at treachery, or fearful of being surprised by the remainder of the party, Oberlus runs off a little space to a bush, and fetching his blunderbuss, savagely commands the negro to desist work and follow him. He refuses. Whereupon, presenting his piece, Oberlus snaps at him. Luckily the blunderbuss misses fire; but by this time, frightened out of his wits, the negro, upon a second intrepid summons, drops his billets, surrenders at discretion, and follows on. By a narrow defile familiar to him, Oberlus speedily removes out of sight of the water.\n\nOn their way up the mountains, he exultingly informs the negro, that henceforth he is to work for him, and be his slave, and that his treatment would entirely depend on his future conduct. But Oberlus, deceived by the first impulsive cowardice of the black, in an evil moment slackens his vigilance. Passing through a narrow way, and perceiving his leader quite off his guard, the negro, a powerful fellow, suddenly grasps him in his arms, throws him down, wrests his musketoon from him, ties his hands with the monster's own cord, shoulders him, and returns with him down to the boat. When the rest of the party arrive, Oberlus is carried on board the ship. This proved an Englishman, and a smuggler; a sort of craft not apt to be over-charitable. Oberlus is severely whipped, then handcuffed, taken ashore, and compelled to make known his habitation and produce his property. His potatoes, pumpkins, and tortoises, with a pile of dollars he had hoarded from his mercantile operations were secured on the spot. But while the too vindictive smugglers were busy destroying his hut and garden, Oberlus makes his escape into the mountains, and conceals himself there in impenetrable recesses, only known to himself, till the ship sails, when he ventures back, and by means of an old file which he sticks into a tree, contrives to free himself from his handcuffs.\n\nBrooding among the ruins of his hut, and the desolate clinkers and extinct volcanoes of this outcast isle, the insulted misanthrope now meditates a signal revenge upon humanity, but conceals his purposes. Vessels still touch the Landing at times; and by-and-by Oberlus is enabled to supply them with some vegetables.\n\nWarned by his former failure in kidnapping strangers, he now pursues a quite different plan. When seamen come ashore, he makes up to them like a free-and-easy comrade, invites them to his hut, and with whatever affability his red-haired grimness may assume, entreats them to drink his liquor and be merry. But his guests need little pressing; and so, soon as rendered insensible, are tied hand and foot, and pitched among the clinkers, are there concealed till the ship departs, when, finding themselves entirely dependent upon Oberlus, alarmed at his changed demeanor, his savage threats, and above all, that shocking blunderbuss, they willingly enlist under him, becoming his humble slaves, and Oberlus the most incredible of tyrants. So much so, that two or three perish beneath his initiating process. He sets the remainder\u2014four of them\u2014to breaking the caked soil; transporting upon their backs loads of loamy earth, scooped up in moist clefts among the mountains; keeps them on the roughest fare; presents his piece at the slightest hint of insurrection; and in all respects converts them into reptiles at his feet\u2014plebeian garter-snakes to this Lord Anaconda.\n\nAt last, Oberlus contrives to stock his arsenal with four rusty cutlasses, and an added supply of powder and ball intended for his blunderbuss. Remitting in good part the labor of his slaves, he now approves himself a man, or rather devil, of great abilities in the way of cajoling or coercing others into acquiescence with his own ulterior designs, however at first abhorrent to them. But indeed, prepared for almost any eventual evil by their previous lawless life, as a sort of ranging Cow-Boys of the sea, which had dissolved within them the whole moral man, so that they were ready to concrete in the first offered mould of baseness now; rotted down from manhood by their hopeless misery on the isle; wonted to cringe in all things to their lord, himself the worst of slaves; these wretches were now become wholly corrupted to his hands. He used them as creatures of an inferior race; in short, he gaffles his four animals, and makes murderers of them; out of cowards fitly manufacturing bravos.\n\nNow, sword or dagger, human arms are but artificial claws and fangs, tied on like false spurs to the fighting cock. So, we repeat, Oberlus, czar of the isle, gaffles his four subjects; that is, with intent of glory, puts four rusty cutlasses into their hands. Like any other autocrat, he had a noble army now.\n\nIt might be thought a servile war would hereupon ensue. Arms in the hands of trodden slaves? how indiscreet of Emperor Oberlus! Nay, they had but cutlasses\u2014sad old scythes enough\u2014he a blunderbuss, which by its blind scatterings of all sorts of boulders, clinkers, and other scoria would annihilate all four mutineers, like four pigeons at one shot. Besides, at first he did not sleep in his accustomed hut; every lurid sunset, for a time, he might have been seen wending his way among the riven mountains, there to secrete himself till dawn in some sulphurous pitfall, undiscoverable to his gang; but finding this at last too troublesome, he now each evening tied his slaves hand and foot, hid the cutlasses, and thrusting them into his barracks, shut to the door, and lying down before it, beneath a rude shed lately added, slept out the night, blunderbuss in hand.\n\nIt is supposed that not content with daily parading over a cindery solitude at the head of his fine army, Oberlus now meditated the most active mischief; his probable object being to surprise some passing ship touching at his dominions, massacre the crew, and run away with her to parts unknown. While these plans were simmering in his head, two ships touch in company at the isle, on the opposite side to his; when his designs undergo a sudden change.\n\nThe ships are in want of vegetables, which Oberlus promises in great abundance, provided they send their boats round to his landing, so that the crews may bring the vegetables from his garden; informing the two captains, at the same time, that his rascals\u2014slaves and soldiers\u2014had become so abominably lazy and good-for-nothing of late, that he could not make them work by ordinary inducements, and did not have the heart to be severe with them.\n\nThe arrangement was agreed to, and the boats were sent and hauled upon the beach. The crews went to the lava hut; but to their surprise nobody was there. After waiting till their patience was exhausted, they returned to the shore, when lo, some stranger\u2014not the Good Samaritan either\u2014seems to have very recently passed that way. Three of the boats were broken in a thousand pieces, and the fourth was missing. By hard toil over the mountains and through the clinkers, some of the strangers succeeded in returning to that side of the isle where the ships lay, when fresh boats are sent to the relief of the rest of the hapless party.\n\nHowever amazed at the treachery of Oberlus, the two captains, afraid of new and still more mysterious atrocities\u2014and indeed, half imputing such strange events to the enchantments associated with these isles\u2014perceive no security but in instant flight; leaving Oberlus and his army in quiet possession of the stolen boat.\n\nOn the eve of sailing they put a letter in a keg, giving the Pacific Ocean intelligence of the affair, and moored the keg in the bay. Some time subsequent, the keg was opened by another captain chancing to anchor there, but not until after he had dispatched a boat round to Oberlus's Landing. As may be readily surmised, he felt no little inquietude till the boat's return: when another letter was handed him, giving Oberlus's version of the affair. This precious document had been found pinned half-mildewed to the clinker wall of the sulphurous and deserted hut. It ran as follows: showing that Oberlus was at least an accomplished writer, and no mere boor; and what is more, was capable of the most tristful eloquence.\n\n\"Sir: I am the most unfortunate ill-treated gentleman that lives. I am a patriot, exiled from my country by the cruel hand of tyranny.\n\n\"Banished to these Enchanted Isles, I have again and again besought captains of ships to sell me a boat, but always have been refused, though I offered the handsomest prices in Mexican dollars. At length an opportunity presented of possessing myself of one, and I did not let it slip.\n\n\"I have been long endeavoring, by hard labor and much solitary suffering, to accumulate something to make myself comfortable in a virtuous though unhappy old age; but at various times have been robbed and beaten by men professing to be Christians.\n\n\"To-day I sail from the Enchanted group in the good boat Charity bound to the Feejee Isles.\n\n\"FATHERLESS OBERLUS.\n\n\"P.S.\u2014Behind the clinkers, nigh the oven, you will find the old fowl. Do not kill it; be patient; I leave it setting; if it shall have any chicks, I hereby bequeath them to you, whoever you may be. But don't count your chicks before they are hatched.\"\n\nThe fowl proved a starveling rooster, reduced to a sitting posture by sheer debility.\n\nOberlus declares that he was bound to the Feejee Isles; but this was only to throw pursuers on a false scent. For, after a long time, he arrived, alone in his open boat, at Guayaquil. As his miscreants were never again beheld on Hood's Isle, it is supposed, either that they perished for want of water on the passage to Guayaquil, or, what is quite as probable, were thrown overboard by Oberlus, when he found the water growing scarce.\n\nFrom Guayaquil Oberlus proceeded to Payta; and there, with that nameless witchery peculiar to some of the ugliest animals, wound himself into the affections of a tawny damsel; prevailing upon her to accompany him back to his Enchanted Isle; which doubtless he painted as a Paradise of flowers, not a Tartarus of clinkers.\n\nBut unfortunately for the colonization of Hood's Isle with a choice variety of animated nature, the extraordinary and devilish aspect of Oberlus made him to be regarded in Payta as a highly suspicious character. So that being found concealed one night, with matches in his pocket, under the hull of a small vessel just ready to be launched, he was seized and thrown into jail.\n\nThe jails in most South American towns are generally of the least wholesome sort. Built of huge cakes of sun-burnt brick, and containing but one room, without windows or yard, and but one door heavily grated with wooden bars, they present both within and without the grimmest aspect. As public edifices they conspicuously stand upon the hot and dusty Plaza, offering to view, through the gratings, their villainous and hopeless inmates, burrowing in all sorts of tragic squalor. And here, for a long time, Oberlus was seen; the central figure of a mongrel and assassin band; a creature whom it is religion to detest, since it is philanthropy to hate a misanthrope.\n\nNote.\u2014They who may be disposed to question the possibility of the character above depicted, are referred to the 2d vol. of Porter's Voyage into the Pacific, where they will recognize many sentences, for expedition's sake derived verbatim from thence, and incorporated here; the main difference\u2014save a few passing reflections\u2014between the two accounts being, that the present writer has added to Porter's facts accessory ones picked up in the Pacific from reliable sources; and where facts conflict, has naturally preferred his own authorities to Porter's. As, for instance, his authorities place Oberlus on Hood's Isle: Porter's, on Charles's Isle. The letter found in the hut is also somewhat different; for while at the Encantadas he was informed that, not only did it evince a certain clerkliness, but was full of the strangest satiric effrontery which does not adequately appear in Porter's version. I accordingly altered it to suit the general character of its author.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSKETCH TENTH.\n\nRUNAWAYS, CASTAWAYS, SOLITARIES, GRAVE-STONES, ETC.\n\n\"And all about old stocks and stubs of trees,\nWhereon nor fruit nor leaf was ever seen,\nDid hang upon ragged knotty knees,\nOn which had many wretches hanged been.\"\n\nSome relics of the hut of Oberlus partially remain to this day at the head of the clinkered valley. Nor does the stranger, wandering among other of the Enchanted Isles, fail to stumble upon still other solitary abodes, long abandoned to the tortoise and the lizard. Probably few parts of earth have, in modern times, sheltered so many solitaries. The reason is, that these isles are situated in a distant sea, and the vessels which occasionally visit them are mostly all whalers, or ships bound on dreary and protracted voyages, exempting them in a good degree from both the oversight and the memory of human law. Such is the character of some commanders and some seamen, that under these untoward circumstances, it is quite impossible but that scenes of unpleasantness and discord should occur between them. A sullen hatred of the tyrannic ship will seize the sailor, and he gladly exchanges it for isles, which, though blighted as by a continual sirocco and burning breeze, still offer him, in their labyrinthine interior, a retreat beyond the possibility of capture. To flee the ship in any Peruvian or Chilian port, even the smallest and most rustical, is not unattended with great risk of apprehension, not to speak of jaguars. A reward of five pesos sends fifty dastardly Spaniards into the wood, who, with long knives, scour them day and night in eager hopes of securing their prey. Neither is it, in general, much easier to escape pursuit at the isles of Polynesia. Those of them which have felt a civilizing influence present the same difficulty to the runaway with the Peruvian ports, the advanced natives being quite as mercenary and keen of knife and scent as the retrograde Spaniards; while, owing to the bad odor in which all Europeans lie, in the minds of aboriginal savages who have chanced to hear aught of them, to desert the ship among primitive Polynesians, is, in most cases, a hope not unforlorn. Hence the Enchanted Isles become the voluntary tarrying places of all sorts of refugees; some of whom too sadly experience the fact, that flight from tyranny does not of itself insure a safe asylum, far less a happy home.\n\nMoreover, it has not seldom happened that hermits have been made upon the isles by the accidents incident to tortoise-hunting. The interior of most of them is tangled and difficult of passage beyond description; the air is sultry and stifling; an intolerable thirst is provoked, for which no running stream offers its kind relief. In a few hours, under an equatorial sun, reduced by these causes to entire exhaustion, woe betide the straggler at the Enchanted Isles! Their extent is such-as to forbid an adequate search, unless weeks are devoted to it. The impatient ship waits a day or two; when, the missing man remaining undiscovered, up goes a stake on the beach, with a letter of regret, and a keg of crackers and another of water tied to it, and away sails the craft.\n\nNor have there been wanting instances where the inhumanity of some captains has led them to wreak a secure revenge upon seamen who have given their caprice or pride some singular offense. Thrust ashore upon the scorching marl, such mariners are abandoned to perish outright, unless by solitary labors they succeed in discovering some precious dribblets of moisture oozing from a rock or stagnant in a mountain pool.\n\nI was well acquainted with a man, who, lost upon the Isle of Narborough, was brought to such extremes by thirst, that at last he only saved his life by taking that of another being. A large hair-seal came upon the beach. He rushed upon it, stabbed it in the neck, and then throwing himself upon the panting body quaffed at the living wound; the palpitations of the creature's dying heart injected life into the drinker.\n\nAnother seaman, thrust ashore in a boat upon an isle at which no ship ever touched, owing to its peculiar sterility and the shoals about it, and from which all other parts of the group were hidden\u2014this man, feeling that it was sure death to remain there, and that nothing worse than death menaced him in quitting it, killed seals, and inflating their skins, made a float, upon which he transported himself to Charles's Island, and joined the republic there.\n\nBut men, not endowed with courage equal to such desperate attempts, find their only resource in forthwith seeking some watering-place, however precarious or scanty; building a hut; catching tortoises and birds; and in all respects preparing for a hermit life, till tide or time, or a passing ship arrives to float them off.\n\nAt the foot of precipices on many of the isles, small rude basins in the rocks are found, partly filled with rotted rubbish or vegetable decay, or overgrown with thickets, and sometimes a little moist; which, upon examination, reveal plain tokens of artificial instruments employed in hollowing them out, by some poor castaway or still more miserable runaway. These basins are made in places where it was supposed some scanty drops of dew might exude into them from the upper crevices.\n\nThe relics of hermitages and stone basins are not the only signs of vanishing humanity to be found upon the isles. And, curious to say, that spot which of all others in settled communities is most animated, at the Enchanted Isles presents the most dreary of aspects. And though it may seem very strange to talk of post-offices in this barren region, yet post-offices are occasionally to be found there. They consist of a stake and a bottle. The letters being not only sealed, but corked. They are generally deposited by captains of Nantucketers for the benefit of passing fishermen, and contain statements as to what luck they had in whaling or tortoise-hunting. Frequently, however, long months and months, whole years glide by and no applicant appears. The stake rots and falls, presenting no very exhilarating object.\n\nIf now it be added that grave-stones, or rather grave-boards, are also discovered upon some of the isles, the picture will be complete.\n\nUpon the beach of James's Isle, for many years, was to be seen a rude finger-post, pointing inland. And, perhaps, taking it for some signal of possible hospitality in this otherwise desolate spot\u2014some good hermit living there with his maple dish\u2014the stranger would follow on in the path thus indicated, till at last he would come out in a noiseless nook, and find his only welcome, a dead man\u2014his sole greeting the inscription over a grave. Here, in 1813, fell, in a daybreak duel, a lieutenant of the U.S. frigate Essex, aged twenty-one: attaining his majority in death.\n\nIt is but fit that, like those old monastic institutions of Europe, whose inmates go not out of their own walls to be inurned, but are entombed there where they die, the Encantadas, too, should bury their own dead, even as the great general monastery of earth does hers.\n\nIt is known that burial in the ocean is a pure necessity of sea-faring life, and that it is only done when land is far astern, and not clearly visible from the bow. Hence, to vessels cruising in the vicinity of the Enchanted Isles, they afford a convenient Potter's Field. The interment over, some good-natured forecastle poet and artist seizes his paint-brush, and inscribes a doggerel epitaph. When, after a long lapse of time, other good-natured seamen chance to come upon the spot, they usually make a table of the mound, and quaff a friendly can to the poor soul's repose.\n\nAs a specimen of these epitaphs, take the following, found in a bleak gorge of Chatham Isle:\u2014\n\n\"Oh, Brother Jack, as you pass by,\nAs you are now, so once was I.\nJust so game, and just so gay,\nBut now, alack, they've stopped my pay.\nNo more I peep out of my blinkers,\nHere I be\u2014tucked in with clinkers!\"\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. The American Spaniards have long been in the habit of making presents of islands to deserving individuals. The pilot Juan Fernandez procured a deed of the isle named after him, and for some years resided there before Selkirk came. It is supposed, however, that he eventually contracted the blues upon his princely property, for after a time he returned to the main, and as report goes, became a very garrulous barber in the city of Lima.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/182123", "artist_names": "Love", "full_title": "Alone Again Or by\u00a0Love", "header_image_thumbnail_url":

Beats\nYeah, ayy, ayy\n\n[Verse 1]\nThirty-thousand words in a rap\nThat's a first, and, in fact, that's the most in the world on a track\nYeah, I've been searchin' the map\nFor like any other person who could work it like that\nDo it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast\nI'm the only one that's out here, and I'm certain of that\nPlay me a beat, it gets turned into ash\nIf I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash\nAyy, hold up, wait\nWhen I'm on the track, I make no mistakes\nI can do the shit for like thirty-thousand hours\nFuck thirty-thousand words, I don't slow my breaks\nI go UK, then I make so many pounds\nEverybody think I'm overweight\nGettin' bread, see me eatin'\nBut I gotta go in, better hold my plate\nOoh, ooh, gotta switch up\nI'm so godly, I'm the bishop\nNow these haters wanna link up\nMy bars make them get the hiccups\nSo I had to run it up real quick\nFreestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick\nEverything I do is real big\n'Cause I gotta get the crowd to feel this,  real lit, real shit\nNowadays, they write me and I don't write it back\nSee my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath\nSwear I'm drivin' down the road and I might'a crashed\nDo the dash, always movin', don't know where to find me at\nHey, movin' on, gotta find a team\nEarnin' all my stripes like Camilla, but I'm lima beans\nAll these rappers 'bout to get fucked like they Riley Reid\nI'm your teacher, so be quiet or I am assignin' seats\nPioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson\nI was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn\nAll these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin\nUntil I fall off next year, I'ma be arrogant\nYeah, I'm runnin' all this shit, run it up\nYeah, you know that I be comin' up for a hun'ed bucks\nAt the start, all I wanted was like thirty-thousand hits\nGot bored, add a couple zeroes for the shits\nWhy not? Look what I got, look what I bought\nCamera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause\nShoes, they go too high, only high-tops\nFuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?\nCome in, Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon\nBoy, I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on\nToo lit, I don't even have the mic on\nAnd I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on\nBetter wait up\nShit's too easy, like a layup\nAnd my bitch too entertainin'\nSee the note, you gotta stay up\nTakin' bets on that I'll fail\nIt's time to pay up\nNow you tryna hide your face\nI'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh\nI'm droppin' hits and gettin' world records\nWho's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?\nWell, maybe not, but I tried, though\nPost Malone, I go psycho\nLeave you a stink, like a rhino\n'Cause I rap beef, no gyro\nAnd I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow\nTurned my L's into W's; typo\nUh, hop into the track\nGive you the love and you give it right back\nTen different flows I be spittin', some trap\nAnd some other shit get in it's get on the map\nDone this for like a year, and now, my writing's clear\nI've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here\nAnd I'm here to stay, did you hear me say\n\"I'm not here to play\"?\n\"He got a flow and a voice now\nI remember when he chokin' a boy out\nBut he's back in, showin' no choice now\nDon't you know that he's gonna destroy now?\"\nSo I'm gonna get there, and I know how\nGot these beats, I be blarin' 'em so loud\nWhen we talk about bitches and money, this shit is so funny\nMy parents are so proud, damn\nI'm startin' to try\nTryin' the shots at it, look at the ground and see stars in the sky\nDrawin' the line\nAll of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes\nYou're probably high\nIf you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines\nCopyin' guys\nYou better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly\nThirty-thousand words on a track, lil' bitch\nNow these people turn my vid on and react, lil' bitch\nKnow I got the clout, I got the stats, lil' bitch\nAnd you givin' me a headache, where's the Advil, bitch?\nBut I'm doin' all I can, and I did it in the past-tense\nMakin' all this money up off of YouTube, off me AdSense\nMoney up off of YouTube, off AdSense\nAll of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then\nAnd I rap, huh, I'm a laptop\nEminem holds the world record for \"Rap God\"\n1.6K words\nThough, we already have that topped\nAnd we'll do it for another hour\nAnd I'm underrated and I'm underpowered\nMy bars are so filthy, uh\nAll of y'all need to take another shower\nFor every fan, there's a hundred doubters\nAnd they let me know up in the comments\nBut you know that we ain't done\n'Cause I gotta talk my nonsense\nAnd I gotta keep it clean, uh\nDo exactly what my mom says\nAnd I know when they headed for the top\nAnd we still be makin' progress\nI can spit bars for nine months\nThen deliver you a new life\nYeah, we eatin' in this bitch, uh\nAll y'all better take a huge bite\nAnd I didn't even write that shit\n'Cause I freestyle, you still like that shit\nSee my video, press 'like' on it\nThat subscribe button? Better wipe that shit\nI'm getting tired of this beat\nI think it's time to change it\n'Cause I'll spaz on trap\nOld school boom-bap, you name it\nThink of that as a intro\nNow we get into the meat of it\nThis some shit you didn't see comin'\nI don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!\n[Part II]\n\n[Intro 2]\nHeh, ayy!\nAyy, ayy\nUh, switch up\nYeah, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook out the window, see past it, but we're faintin' reflections\nYou never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions\nYou headin' down the wrong path and they changin' directions\nMaybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessin'\nAnd lately, I question the shit that was taught to me\nI'm awkwardly stoppin' these conversations\nHey, how long you waitin' till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?\nI don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs, but you still gotta play it\nDon't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it\nStop contemplatin' and stop complainin'\nAnd recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative\nReached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it\nLiving a life of pain just to alleviate it\nWhen you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it\nYeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it\nWe headin' onto new platforms and leavin' the basics\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nUh, my creative process is making progress\nDespite my background, I haven't gotten to playin' lacrosse yet\nDon't you know we got a good thing goin'?\nI've been watchin' all these shows while I could be showin'\nI've been creeping up on the door, so dangerous\nYou looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changin' them\nI done learned so many things in my past life\nNow I don't give a single shit about the rap life\nThat's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it\nHave twice much the fame, and\nI can't even comprehend that much in the future\nHatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor\nEnter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder\nStealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter\nProcrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer\nNo willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser\n\n[Verse 4]\nSittin' alone at 3 AM\nChillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend\nMan, this shit is too wild, I \"must behave, Ben\"\nThat's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when\nI'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence\nAccomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?\n-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me\nLuckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me\nI hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it\nI hope that one day, you'll see we made it\nNo, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it\nI'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest\nThat is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'\nI'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'\nI'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside\nGuessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind\n[Hook 1]\nAnd I'm in time\n-Workin' all my life, get that in line\nI'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out\nNobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline\nI'm on the incline, I'm on the incline\nStay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine\nI'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline\nNobody can really understand how my shit climb\n\n[Verse 5]\nHave I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet\nI'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead\nI stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous\nWho is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?\nWhy the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do\nI don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, \"Bye\", to you\nHey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do\nYou have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue\nYou gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset\nSet headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead\nI guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed\nImpressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said\nBut I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song\nDo right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron\nYou try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes\nSome straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline\n\n[Interlude 1]\nWater break\nI got a lot to say\nIt's been eleven minutes so far\nActually, it hasn't, it's been shorter\n\n[Verse 6]\nHow can\nI have a believable meaning\nWhen all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury\nNobody seen it or  greet it?\nBut what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be\nAnd it's in inconceivable dreaming\nI know it's so unbelievable, being\nStuck in this rare unachievable feeling\nThey givin' me something, I ended up leaving\nThey givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'\nNo positive side, ended up seeing\nWhat life could be like from a  different lead in\nThank God for a cover zone\nSo I know when and where to cross it\nAll over the place\nI'm surprised I haven't lost it\n\n[Hook 2]\nYeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh\nLivin' to the max now\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down\nGo till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out\nAfter, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out\nBut I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout\n\n[Verse 7]\nOkay, it's time to go fast\nSo sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it\nAbout time, but maybe you're mad I said it\nYou gon' pay attention, cash or credit?\nI have to let it go back a second\nI have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit\nNow we're back in the middle of the track and fed it\nMix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it\nWe moved on, walked past the exit\nWant you to come back and pass a message\n-Never pack bags and trash, you left it\nKinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it\nMoney, never am glad I spent it\nIf I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it\nIf you ever feel bad or sad, accept it\nThink back to the track and the rap that Ben did\nYeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it\nIf this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus\nI'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this\nVoice is more powerful than a million instruments\nSuddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else\nPeople want me to grow because of you\nBut I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better\nThan the people that never had trust in me\nYeah, uh\n\n[Hook 3]\nAnd I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah\nLivin' to the max now, uh\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds\n\n[Verse 8]\nSpeak up, and they're messing with the track now\nPeople are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short\nLooking back at you when you're missing all the cash now\nAnd I'm mad at the fact that\nI'm not in my right mind\nMeant to be a half-decent rapper\nBut I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time\nLookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find\nLookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime\nI find so much life\nI wonder why I can't just find mine\nGot so many confusing questions\nSo much knowledge, I can't use the lessons\nI'm emerging out with a new profession\nI'ma do the best with my new perfection\nAnd I'm doin' it\nI'm moving onto this future shit\nThese hooligans are complete fools in that\nThey just don't understand that I am through with it\nImprovin' it, I'm improvin' it\nI got my brain, and I'm usin' it\nAnd I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'\nAnd makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits\nYou're clueless\nNinety percent of y'all ignorant\nKeeping your minds oh-so limited\nGet off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out\nSeeming so close, I can picture it now\nSuccess in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now\nEnvisioning deeper ambitions, and now\nI'ma get to it, that is what living's about\n\n[Interlude 2]\nUh, God!\nUh\nMy voice is gone already, shit\nAlright, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\n[Verse 9]\nThink I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches\nAdolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us\nMakin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die\nMakin' you hang your head low, but say, \"Reach for the skies\"\nLife is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies\nI'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes\nI feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry\nWith all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try\nYeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply\nTryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry\nFuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, \"Why?\"\nSo I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh\nLike, oh well, I can say that I tried\nHopped into life and then I stayed for the ride\nSo many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside\nAnd I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn\nThis reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.\u200b\nI'm screamin', \"Hi\" to the sky up with a smile on my face\nNow I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace\nAll of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place\nSwept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace\nAnd now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet\nI used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic\nRecently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it\nSee my friends from kindergarten go to rehab\nThat's the type of shit that makes you think back\nTo simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds\nBefore reality could ground us, we would live in the skies\nAnd as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)\nMan, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist\nI felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist\nAnd now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit\nYou only look at what you got once you see that it's lost\nAnd life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce\nDon't understand rappers braggin', \"I got that paper on me\"\nMan, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me\nSo what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?\nTo me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money\nRain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study\nAnd write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn\nLike Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize\nThese Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's\nThis is a natural high\nI see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies\nI wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried\nThey say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie\nThey think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid\nAs DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive\nThrew out half of my album, it wasn't good enough\nShit, I mean it still isn't good enough\nI'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt\nBut I guess I am not full enough, damn\nI swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel\nMan, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal\nMan, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real\nThirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel\nYeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement\nYeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent\nEvery day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest\nAnd if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted\nMost of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me\nSo when I die, I know I left us with something to leave\nSo when I wake up in the morning with something to see\nYeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be\n\n[Verse 10]\nBenny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said\nIf you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-\nMany want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant\nGot iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence\nYeah, I know I'm way too cocky\nBut I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out\nSo when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better\nThat's benefit of the doubt\nI've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom\nIt's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often\nAnd I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around\nAlways stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-\nYeah, this is freedom of speech\nTryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace\nSacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree\nOpportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-\nNah, I'm just tryna find some clarity\nApparently, it all has to do with popularity\nThere will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to\nWhat is carefully being prepared to me\nSometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity\nI'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least\n\n[Verse 11]\nGiving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see\nEveryone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy\n'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case\nShot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass\nOff of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say\nAnd at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say\nSo let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages\nSeeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand\nThat I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest\nEntertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in\n\n[Verse 12]\n-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize\nStart an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try\nThat's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'\nWith the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon\nBut I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'\nLimited ability with little humility\nBut whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me\nI'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history\nTryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me\nTryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg\nYou beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me\nShowin' up on your device, control/option/delete\nConsider myself elite, measure myself in retweets\nI be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me\nInstead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout\nI'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house\nTryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch\nI'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out\nInto reality, in normality actually happily\nFound myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?\n'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing\nNothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing\nNot complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it\nLove sleepin' and just usin' the internet\nBut my time is limited, and I better figure this\nBefore I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips\nAnd let me just tell you what I have came to do\nTryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to\nTryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo\nAnd say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through\nAnd if a major record label is looking at me\nI'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats\nI can rap fast, and rap slow\nI may make mistakes but everyone, has, so\nI'm like MJ back when he had the afro\nAlso, I'm not black, so... maybe not\nBut before everyone gets angry, stop\nI'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block\nAll the people who keep on going crazy off\n'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got\nA lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker\nWith some dominant teachers\nI deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers\nI'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager\nThey be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it\nTo know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid\nSo when you're nearin' this, please let me know\nWhen I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go\nHear the metronome combined in the compilation\nTo unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation\nBut that is just a dream, and probably a combination\nOf a big ego and false encouragement on the way in\nBut when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game\nI was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name\nBut when you think about it, it is all insane\nWhat can be created from chemicals in this brain\nBut when you look at me, you lackin' respect\nWhen I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest\nHas in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step\nUntil I'm on the same stage, and you have it again\nBut, but when you think about the hall-of-fame\nYou think about how people used to sit and call you names\nAnd you check and wonder if it will be all the same\nStep back into reality, it all remains, damn\n\n[Interlude 3]\nAlright, I just spilled water on my computer right now\nOn my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit\nHold on, uh\nGoddamn it\n\n[Verse 13]\nMy lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean\nThis is off the top, I don't need to use no machines\nHold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever\nBut I am very clever, okay, okay\nI'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too\nThese are some shit' that you can drink to\nBut drink water unless you're of age\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Ayy\n\n[Interlude 4]\nOkay, okay\nUh\nUh\nAyy\n\n[Verse 14]\nI feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous\n-Most of humanity's made of idiots\nI barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?\nYou think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?\nPlease... what I do is barely poetry\nThere's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me\nBut still consider me confident\nStill consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness\nBut honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably\nIt is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling\nInto awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'\nIt's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening\nIt's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake\nI close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away\nYeah, we're just tryna find that great escape\nTo get away from how we're living life day-to-day\nSome people find it in a drink or in a cup\nOr in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love\nBut all I know is that it's tough\nAnd all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much\n\n[Verse 15]\nI'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?\nThese kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players\nThat shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low\nGot amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show\nWhat I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype\nAnd I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life\n-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights\nAhead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night\n-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass\n-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast\nRemember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it\nAnd say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected\nTake a deep breath, 'cause I need that\nMost of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast\nMy bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors\nYou want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards\nSay that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this\nI'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit\nTryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day\n'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?\nI'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go\nI'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own\nI'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit\nReason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch\nMeaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it\nPleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it\nFlow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break\nWe all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day\n'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it\nYou know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments\nAll of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em\nStart a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it\nBreaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it\nI know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'\nUnder the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'\nI found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it\nI try to go slow, but it don't work\n-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure\nYou're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners\nThis is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre\nHah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough\nForgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up\nMy chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us\nAnd so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up\n-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back\nRemember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that\nHit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming\nListen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding\nWe run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through\nThese lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true\n'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred\nShoutout to Didac and Momo and the others\nShit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family\nShoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me\nYeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh\nBetter trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack\nStarted off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me\nIn the past, I never anticipated what there would be\nAnd see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now\nSee ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now\n\n[Interlude 5]\nIt's on now\nOh shit, I'm almost out of water\nThis is a hard- this a- real challenge\nThis like, physically difficult, ayy\n\n[Hook 4]\nWhen I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra\nNow everybody telling me I don't perform enough\nMy math teacher told me that I'd never be shit\nAnd now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula\nI got the formula, I got the formula\nYou got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy\nPeople always asking Ben, \"Why you record so much?\"\nI got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up\n\n[Verse 16]\nFormula, like I'm Mr. Krabs\nI change and transform it up, you stuck in the past\nYeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab\nUh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag\nAnd now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'\nPeople love to criticize me for the life I've had\nThey make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'\nI make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy\nUh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie\nAnd I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami\nWanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'\nTryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies\nAyy, still saying, \"Who would'a thought?\", like, who would'a guessed it?\nHaven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing\nIf you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:\nWant the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook\n\n[Verse 17]\nAyy, they doubt a fucker with a dream\nLooking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah\nLooking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens\nSerpent's told you, \"No,\" and it's like nothing's as it seems\nGod damn, I guess I really thought he was the man\nI guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham\nAll that cash he stocked was from a scam\nAll the views he got was from some spam\nI've been living like, \"Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?\nWhy ain't he just sticking to the plan?\nHow has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?\"\nI don't get it, I don't really understand\nI've been living like, \"Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram\nI'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand\nNext to all these average fucking sad duds?\"\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\n\n[Hook 5]\nYeah\nHate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\nAyy\nJust because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup\nUh, uh, uh\nFeel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones\nAnd so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he\n\n[Verse 18]\n'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine\nI've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap\nThat shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now\nI'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out\nHow did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday\nAnd I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away\nBut I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one\n\n[Verse 19]\nBy now, if you're still watching this shit\nYou are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit\nBut we ain't over, we ain't done, though\nAm I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?\nWell, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K\nWhile all you sit around, I would rather work than play\nLyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae\nHit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates\n\n[Interlude 6]\nThat was actually a pretty good bar\nI just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this\nAyy, ayy\nYou know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh\n\n[Hook 6]\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll\nMake it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 20]\nUh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering\nAll these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen\nAll accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence\nOften is the result of falling under consciousness\nYou'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives\nYou're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie\nAnd I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty\nFearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me\nNo, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever\nBut in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better\nBut I don't ever\nWant to go to show, just one mo' letter\nI'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades\nAnd get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid\nUh... my life is so unusual\nTo most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable\nCan't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral\nI'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero\nUh, but you know that I'm capable\nYou know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available\nFeeling so unique and I think it's not explainable\nNo one hears my lyrics, and says, \"OMG, relatable!\"\nNo, that's not what I'm here to give\nBeen waiting years for this, you're about to experience\nSomething that I've spent time, money and thought on\nLearned about all the times money had thought wrong\nKinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long\nI ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot\n-Out on the inside, see me on the outside\nAlways think I'm positive, and never see the downsides\nIt's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it\nGet your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it\n\n[Interlude 7]\nOkay\nOkay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in\nThirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro\nFuck\n\n[Verse 21]\nYeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware\nI'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared\nI'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs\nBut y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared\nI got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it\nShoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip\nMan, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders\nIt's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip\nDamn, I got a crazy ass work ethic\nBlocked out south east and west, leave in one direction\nI finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it\nFuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection\nWe all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons\nLike a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'\nWanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly\nAnd I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar\nCan't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'\nYeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person\nI base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-\n-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain\n\n[Verse 22]\nYou keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high\nWanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy\nCan't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize\nHow it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize\nAnd analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed\nAnd take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise\nAmerica is very nice, but I'd like to see the world\nBut I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl\n\n[Verse 23]\nIn a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends\nCrazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens\nThey be tens or more, they be tens or more\nI like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors\nIt's free speech, I can say what I want\nBut these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk\nThey don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter\nI get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh\nMotherfucker, I'ma live for the right time\nFuck that, I'ma live for the moment\nSitting here in the middle of the night time\nMy mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'\nDamn, I've been livin' in a headache\nBitches never listenin', they saying that they ready\nBut I can never believe them\nGot these goals and they can never achieve 'em\nHow can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?\nDamn, that's a lot of shit to think about\nSuddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering\nWhat I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out\nMade some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh\nGot these dreams that I'm livin' out\nIn my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses\nThat I never pictured, wow, damn, damn\nThis beat's way too holy to rap over\nMental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower\nYour raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance\nLike a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'\nOoh, but I have got somethin' to tell you\nI ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you\nSpeakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life\nWatching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might\nBe on that stage right beside all these players\nShit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers\nI'll prove it in music I use to influence\nI do this way harder than people assumin'\nResumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'\nThat puts me to be in the view of the hidin'\nI do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me\nNo matter what I do, they just mistake the\nReason I'm flowin', the reason I start up\nNot just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks\nAnd- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place\nMost to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste\nI'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh\nI just need a home run, I already loaded bases\nI have got so many cases\nBeen visiting, living in so many places\nExperiences that I made me to Emmy\nBen, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me\nBe me, I ain't greedy or needy\nBelieve me, I just want to be on your TV\nGet on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase\nDamn, yeah, I've been looking at their space\nAnd, one day, I'll be there\nI know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared\n\n[Verse 24]\nI've been waiting like thirty-thousand years\nTryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear\nI'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career\nI'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here\nNow I earned it, and I'm here to stay\nI'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play\nNot even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame\nNot really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day\nI don't know- I look at the future nostalgically\nI'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me\nUndoubtably know how to be what I am about to be\nTo say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me\n\n[Verse 25]\nRecently, I have been feeling alienated\nMy songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em\nBut, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different\nHate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it\n\n[Verse 26]\nPeople say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen\nAll will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene\nY'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty\nPromise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?\nTrapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages\nWhen I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and\nI'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song\nMove along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns\nWho could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?\nOne great tongue, I am that one great one\nOn vacation, I vacate to a location\nFar away from where people just may run\nA light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun\nOh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young\nI can murder this beat with no gun, go run\nI've too many problems to handle, here, hold one\nI just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks\nAnd now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk\nWas a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station\nPlaying it, making it just get to the worst\nMy head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure\nI'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth\nAnd now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it\nNow the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah\n\n[Verse 27]\nGood rappers never get to see the light of day\nBut when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away\nI'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?\nI'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business\nNobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit\nKnow I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, \"Oh, this kid is big\"\nKnow how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen\nTill I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah\nAnd when I'm, uh... I'm telling y'all that I got a story\nGod ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory\nNot visually, typically, the original me\nSo unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally\nDamn, that was fast, felt so jammed till I unpacked\nAnd I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track\nAnd I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real\nWhenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel\nSo different, and I'm loving it, time to change and discover it\nTime to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it\nI always talk to them other kids, them other kids couldn't understand me\nOne path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B\n\n[Interlude 9]\nI wrote that one a long time ago\nThat was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again\nBut you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty\nI- actually... classic!\n\n[Verse 28]\nWe just living in the solar system\nOne big world here to hold the wisdom\nOne big jail to control the victims\nWe're all here, tryna find a soul in rhythm\nA voice in writing and a choice deciding\nWhether or not to follow what the boys are likin'\nWhat the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to\nThink about who you are, and it's so true\nThink about the people who you think have really known you\nDo they really know you? Do you even know you?\nDamn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet\nSometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be\nAnd lately, it seems to make the extremes\nSo prominent and dominant in making big dreams\nI'm seeing aliens scream\nWhen I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing\nBut I'm just tryna make it in life\nFuck you to people who be saying it like\nI ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike\nI'm chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite\nThe fact that I'm young and little bit nerdy\nAnd I know a lot of people would consider me early\nI'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches\nTryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens\nI'm just me, no, I ain't a victim to hurting\nI just see all the people living and burning\nSo be free, time to be a little bit nervous\nIt don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing\nAnd I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it\nGuessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid\nSo I'll see ya 'round, underachievers\nHop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man\n\n[Hook 8]\nSo basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me\nI'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z\nAnd, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three\nBut now, what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?\n\n[Verse 29]\nI've been see' 'ple- misusing their fans, like crooks\nManipulating their audience to catch that hook\nThey'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-\nYou can feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha\nBut no shots fired, though\nNothing wrong with a little bit of lying though\nI mean... look at Fox News\nThat's the whole premise of their entire show\nBut no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist\nMakin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits\nI got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch\nBut I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids\nI got time!

winnin'\nJust because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it\nJust because your life stucks, stop corrupting mine with it\nI messed-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good\nJust because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy\nAyy, ayy, uh\nJust because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, uh\n\n[Verse 42]\nAnd how am I meant to keep my workflow up?\nIf a girl shows up, all my world blows up\nI'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest\nTryna find a brand new motherfuckin' deal\nAll you bitches fake, all my numbers real\nAll my shit is punchin' in your stomach, like a meal\nAm I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?\nIt's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing\nNow, it's scary for a king, damn, I said, it's scary for a king, even\nThey call me odd, but I bring even\nI bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and\nThe meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons\nYeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'\nI'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people\nMan, I don't know people who so equal\nI don't know nobody who doesn't own evil\nMan, that is just a truth and a lie\nA truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky\nOr a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind\nNew to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise\nAnd uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit\nOh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this\nYou get discouraged for one minute\nAnd the next one, you be callin' it quits\nAnd I'll probably get rich If I focus enough\nYou close-minded, let's open it up\nAnd all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'\nBut they do not know what is up\nUh, I just wish\nThat they'd go away\nAnd I won't obey\nNo, I will never ever show the way\nAnd I will try to mask it up\nWith other jokes on fucking jokes\nAlways playin' G'\nBut now I'm movin' onto other notes\n\n[Interlude 16]\nMy voice is fucking hurting\nIt's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training\nSo I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time\nWithout causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?\nMan, I just live it up\nI'm gonna go a little bit quieter now\nUh-huh\nYeah\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAll of these people keep on changin'\nAll of these times and different phases\nAll of these lights on all these stages\nAll of these sights is so amazing\nYeah, I've seen at least a million faces\nA million times, a million places\nBut when it's all said and done\nI look and I wonder why, uh\n\n[Verse 43]\nEveryone knows that it's so amazing\nAll the support is my motivation\nCompared to the big people at the Capital\nMy name is spelt in lower cases\nPeople loved me before I made it\nPeople liked it before they watched it\nI'm wantin' way too much more than I have\nAnd I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it\nMan on a mission, and I g- vision\nOf talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen\nGotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow\nI'll be the teacher when they need the feature\nGot flow, and it's so damn crazy\nPeople consider me so amazing\nI'm holding control and then folding them verses\nIt hurts because I am on loaded bases\nAdvanced shit, I know the basics\nAlready know them, they're overrated\nMeanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'\n'Cause now I am open for game, and\nI'm charged up\nI ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior\nSo many people they know the players\nDon't know the game and don't know the makers\nDon't know the fakers, but who cares?\nI'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater\nI'm here to go move and just go on the layers\nAnd bitch, I am going so later\nI got time\nMy own lyrics, I got mine\nAnd I'm on time for the wrong lines\nAnd I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go\n\n[Hook 14]\nI've been all on my own\nAll on my own, people keep calling my phone\nWanting to know when I'll be the star of the show\nBut I'm all my own, yeah\nAnd I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it\n'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-\nThe ghost of me is haunting the throne\nSo I'll make it there all on my own\n\n[Verse 44]\nMy intermission is mixing with intermissions\nAnd following intuition conflicting with my decision\nAnd it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval\nAnd it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful\nAnd it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you\nAppearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement\nTo a new type of thing that you can gain from\nTo push away the past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago-\n\n[Interlude 17]\nOh, holy shit!\nI actually reached the end of the beat\nBut I still have, like\nTen-thousand more words\nHold on, I gotta pause this\nHold on, three, it's still one take\n\n[Verse 45]\n-Past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago\nLook at where we been, but imagine where one can go\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nWe now know how much money you can give for a lie\nGive for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?\nWhat's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?\nSo, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen\nAlways been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man\n\n[Hook 15]\nYeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch\nUh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch\n\n[Verse 46]\nI know like four people who truly respect the grind\nAnd it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme\nAnd then if time is money then free time ain't really free\nAnd all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me\n-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree\nI want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me\nIn the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me\nBigger than you, bigger than anybody in history\nThe challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize\nTo satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time\nAnd luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time\nTo learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind\nI'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got\nSeveral different things to potentially make my job\nI want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs\nAnd also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks\nA million- shit, all we ever want is more, really\nAnd once I get three million, I want four milli'\nIt's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle\nWe can never be happy, but that is so vital\n\n[Interlude 18]\nUh\nThose are actually some good lyrics, uh\n\n[Verse 47]\nRebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt\nThey're weaker than previously, her\nBreathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were\nBefore we could be searched, I'm like \"Please, just please work\"\nLike a lenient slave owner\u2014 that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me\nI saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy\nI play- I play-\n-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?\nUh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do\nDisgusted like, \"Ew\", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true\nI'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do\nIt's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue\nFillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed\nIt gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh\nBut if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?\nAnd why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?\nThat shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up\nBut nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up\nL\u2014\n\n[Verse 48]\n\u2014cay to the Vatican, havin' them\nGood times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when\nI was so young, too young to really know fun\nBut so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up\nDry your eyes and wipe your nose up\nJust keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge\nBut we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate\nSuch a twisted system that we've been given to operate\nI've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake\nWash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed\nYeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away\nAnd it's so far away\n\n[Hook 16]\nThis a civil war\nIt's a fuckin' civil war\nYeah, we be aimin' to the peace\nSo what we killin' for?\nYeah, anymore\nWhat we even livin' for?\nYeah, they be murderin' for peace\nThat is a civil war\n\n[Verse 49]\nYou know- you know they be lookin' at me right now\nLike the sewer system, they about to pipe down\nI've been writin' my essays, my webpage\nYeah, I call that a new construction site now\nBlue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out\nAll these questions, man, I really wanna hide out\nOr I wanna

Lee Randolph. I handle the public relations for the museum.\u00a0\n\n[GEORGE]\nDot by dot\nBuilding up the image\n\n[RANDOLPH, spoken]\nThere's a lot of opportunity for some fine press here.\u00a0\n\n[GEORGE]\nShot by shot\u2014\nKeeping at a distance doesn't pay\nStill, if you remember your objective\nNot give all your privacy away\nA little bit of hype can be effective\nLong as you can keep it in perspective\nAfter all, without some recognition\nNo one's going to give you a commission\n\nArt isn't easy\nOvernight you're a trend\nYou're the right combination\nThen the trend's at an end\nYou're suddenly last year's sensation\n\nIf you feel a sense of coalition\nThen you never really stand alone\nIf you want your work to reach fruition\nWhat you need's a link with your tradition\nAnd of course a prominent commission\nPlus a little formal recognition\nSo that you can go on exhibit\u2014\nSo that your work can go on exhibition\n\n[BLAIR, spoken]\nThere's the man of the hour.\u00a0\n\n[GEORGE, spoken]\nBlair!

You're a talented guy. But I think you're capable of far more.\u00a0\n\n[GEORGE]\n\"Be new,\" George\nThey tell you till they're blue, George\n\n[BLAIR, spoken]\nNot that you couldn't succeed by doing Chromolume after Chromolume\u2014but there are new discoveries to be made, George.\u00a0\n\n[GEORGE]\n\"You're new or else you're through, George\"\nAnd even if it's true, George\nYou do what you can do...\n\nBit by bit\nPutting it together\nPiece by piece\nWorking out the vision night and day\nAll it takes is time and perseverance\nWith a little luck along the way\nPutting in a personal appearance\nGathering supporters and adherents\u2014\n\n[HARRIET]\nBut he combines all these different trends\u2014\n\n[GEORGE]\nMapping out the right configuration\nStarting with a suitable foundation\u2014\n\n[BETTY]\nHe's an original\u2014\n\n[ALEX, spoken]\nWas.\u00a0\n\n[GEORGE]\nLining up a prominent commission\u00a0\nAnd an exhibition in addition\u2014\nHere a little dab of politician\n\n[BETTY]\nI like those images\n\n[GEORGE]\nThere a little touch of publication\n\n[ALEX]\nSome\n\n[BETTY]\nThey're just his personal response\n\n[ALEX]\nTo what?\n\n[BETTY]\nThe painting!\u00a0\n\n[GEORGE]\nTill you have a balanced composition\n\n[ALEX]\nBullshit. Anyway, the painting's overrated\u2014\n\n[GREENBERG]\nIt's only new, though, for now\n\n[BETTY]\nOverrated? It's a masterpiece!\n\n[GEORGE]\nEverything depends on preparation\n\n[REDMOND]\nNouveau\n\n[ALEX]\nA masterpiece? Historically important, maybe\u2014\n\n[GREENBERG & REDMOND]\nAnd yesterday's forgotten\n\n[BETTY]\nOh, now you're judging Seurat, are you?\u00a0\n\n[GEORGE]\nEven if you do have the suspicion\n\n[ALEX]\nAll it is is pleasant, just like George's work\n\n[BETTY]\nIt's just your jealousy of George's work\n\n[HARRIET]\nYou can't divide art today\n\n[REDMOND]\nAnd you can't tell good from rotten and\u2014\n\n[ALEX]\nNo nuance, no resonance, no relevance\u2014\n\n[BETTY]\nThere's nuance, and there's resonance, there's relevance\u2014\n\n[GEORGE]\nThat it's taking all your concentration\n\n[BILLY]\nI'm not surprised\n\n[OTHERS]\nMost art today\n\n[GREENBERG & REDMOND]\nToday it's all a matter of promotion\n\n[ALEX]\nThere's not much point in arguing\n\n[HARRIET]\nGo with it\n\n[BETTY]\nNo point in arguing\n\n[OTHERS]\nIs a matter of promotion, but then\u2014\n\n[GEORGE]\nThe art of making art\n\n[ALEX]\nBesides it's all promotion, but then\u2014\n\n[BETTY]\nYou say it's all promotion, but then\u2014\n\n[HARRIET and BILLY]\nWhat will they think of next?\n\n[ALL BUT GEORGE]\nThat is the state of the art\n\n[GEORGE]\nIs putting it together\n\n[ALL BUT
