guitar\nAnd the people came from all around\nAnd all the girls from there to Austin\nWere slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock\nTo take the trip, to go and listen\nTo the little dark-haired boy\nThat played the Tennessee flat top box\nAnd he would play\nWell, he couldn't ride or wrangle\nAnd he never cared to make a dime\nBut give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time\nAnd all the girls from nine to ninety\nWere snapping fingers, tapping toes\nAnd begging him don't stop\nAnd hypnotized and fascinated\nBy the little dark-haired boy\nThat played the Tennessee flat top box\nAnd he would play\n\nThen one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him around\nHe'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town\nBut all the girls still dreamed about him\nAnd hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked\nAnd then one day on the Hit Parade\nWas a little dark-haired boy\nThat played the Tennessee flat top box\n\n[Outro]\nAnd he would playYou

love you so\n\nBut when ye come and all the flowers are dying\nAnd I am dead, as dead I well may be\nGo out and find the place where I am lying\nAnd kneel and say an Ave there for me\nAnd I will hear tho' soft your tread above me\nAnd then my grave will warm and sweeter be\nFor you shall bend and tell me that you love me\nAnd I will sleep in peace until you come to meYou might also likeEmbed"},

It ain't about who the fuck is the pen wizard\nThis is for hard-headed slick niggas\nAnd since you wanted Brizz whippin', think Summer Impact again wit' it\nThese punches gon' hit different\nNigga, you a snake\nWhen you talk and I listen, I don't hear words, I hear hissin'\nSss...the way you and URL set up Brizz? That shit sad\nGuess you think your turn next (necks)\nThis fast'll give me whiplash\nYou can't be from the trenches, 'cause if you was, you would know this shit math\nOnce Raw turned into Roc(k), it gotta get bagged\nThis y'all King of Pop!? Beat It\nThe whole world saw your bitch ass\nAll that moonwalkin' on stage shit - you did Bad!\nHow you gon' tell me I (eye) change, but got the nerve to have on contacts?\nBut you didn't have the nerve to put on when it was contact!\nIf you was anywhere next to Raw, you was supposed to lock up when the fire was on max\nBut you cut wack\nWe saw Roc(k) in hot water...he ain't come back!\n\"Another cut, another cut, another cut\"\nWhere the fuck was all that!?\nYou fitted for this New Era: nigga, you all cap\nAll that \"Cave Gang shit\", that was all act\nWhen it was live and direct, it was, \"Quiet for the set!\"\nWe saw all that violence in your raps, they props\nAnd the real movie started soon as the actin' stopped\nThen, you got caught lyin' in blogs and all that\nAnd y'all fans who overlooked that? Y'all fuckin' up the format\n'Cause battle rap ain't supposed to have the kinda fans that ignore that\nI don't give a fuck how good you battle!\nIf you can't be a man, I can't be a fan\nAll forms of respect you shoulda lost that\nTalkin' 'bout, \"I ain't see Mook when niggas was fightin'\"\nAnd y'all applaud that\nWhere the fuck y'all grew up at!?\nDickhead! How the fuck you tryin' the nigga that tell the nigga who set it off that!?\nBut you know what?

'Cause they say it's no-contact in the contract.\"\nWell, how's that?\nWhen all I did what I'm advised at\nI just crossed T and dotted a eye (I) black\nI'm a man of little words, Roc: read to find (redefine) that\nJohn Hancock: signature right that'll clarify where the line at!\nThen you tried to sell \"I ran after I swung\"\nWho buyin' that?\nFirst off, how he was gon' know if I ran (Iran) if he got his eye racked (Iraq)!?\nAnd please, don't even think I'm glorifyin' that\n'Cause I'm not\nListen, Roc, you ain't in tune wit' the block\nNobody know a dude that you shot!\nThe only TECs (text) you shoot, they blue wit' the dots\nYou just a kid that was cool, so you rocked\nSo whether you knew it or not, I'll lose props for havin' you as a opp!\nPorkchop!\nCall docs, they examine your body: autops'\nSaw him after, he walked right past us - thought not\nAin't seen a sucka haul (Hall) off that fast since cough drops!\n(*cough*)\nThe fuck y'all mean \"Gun Bar King!?\"\nNo, you the fuck not!\nI don't wanna hear no heavy metal you blastin'\nYou a punk, Roc(k)!\nWe saw you in action, you wasn't active\nAll them punches you got, and you ain't let one drop\nYou a faggot!\nYou wouldn't square up for a jump shot!\nY'all jack a nigga who took a plea, when the plan was to go to trial wit' ya co-de'\nBellhop Roc, ain't help Brizz to pop\nI thought Roc(k) was supposed to be solid\nHow you couldn't even send the block (cinderblock)?\nNiggas that stand next to doors will get you knocked\nShit you not, you told Brizz, \"Break a leg\" so he could cripple his stock, before he get too hot\nNiggas like Roc?

COPPOLA\n\nTHIRD DRAFT PARAMOUNT PICTURES\n1 Gulf and Western Plaza\nMarch 29, 1971 New York, New York 10019\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black\nBackground. There is a moment's hesitation, and then the\nSimple words in white lettering:\n\nTHE GODFATHER\n\nWhile this remains, we hear: \"I believe in America.\"\nSuddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a\nMan of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great\nEmotion.\n\nBONASERA\nAmerica has made my fortune.\n\nAs he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.\n\nBONASERA\nI raised my daughter in the American\nFashion; I gave her freedom, but\nTaught her never to dishonor her\nFamily. She found a boy friend,\nNot an Italian. She went to the\nMovies with him, stayed out late.\nTwo months ago he took her for a\nDrive, with another boy friend.\nThey made her drink whiskey and\nThen they tried to take advantage\nOf her. She resisted; she kept her\nHonor. So they beat her like an\nAnimal. When I went to the hospital\nHer nose was broken, her jaw was\nShattered and held together by\nWire, and she could not even weep\nBecause of the pain.\nHe can barely speak; he is weeping now.\n\nBONASERA\nI went to the Police like a good\nAmerican. These two boys were\nArrested and brought to trial. The\nJudge sentenced them to three years\nIn prison, and suspended the\nSentence. Suspended sentence!\nThey went free that very day. I\nStood in the courtroom like a fool,\nAnd those bastards, they smiled at\nMe. Then I said to my wife, for\nJustice, we must go to The Godfather.\n\nBy now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office\nIn his home.\n\nThe blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with\nPatterned shadows. We are watching BONASERA over the\nShoulder of DON CORLEONE. TOM HAGEN sits near a small\nTable, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands\nImpatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a\nGlass of wine. We can HEAR music, and the laughter and\nVoices of many people outside.\nDON CORLEONE\nBonasera, we know each other for\nYears, but this is the first time\nYou come to me for help. I don't\nRemember the last time you invited\nMe to your house for coffee...even\nThough our wives are friends.\n\nBONASERA\nWhat do you want of me? I'll give\nYou anything you want, but do what\nI ask!\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd what is that Bonasera?\n\nBONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo. You ask for too much.\n\nBONASERA\nI ask for Justice.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThe Court gave you justice.\n\nBONASERA\nAn eye for an eye!\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBut your daughter is still alive.\n\nBONASERA\nThen make them suffer as she\nSuffers. How much shall I pay you.\n\nBoth HAGEN and SONNY react.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou never think to protect yourself\nWith real friends. You think it's\nEnough to be an American. All\nRight, the Police protects you,\nThere are Courts of Law, so you\nDon't need a friend like me.\nBut now you come to me and say Don\nCorleone, you must give me justice.\nAnd you don't ask in respect or\nFriendship. And you don't think to\nCall me Godfather; instead you come\nTo my house on the day my daughter\nIs to be married and you ask me to\nDo murder...for money.\n\nBONASERA\nAmerica has been good to me...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThen take the justice from the\nJudge, the bitter with the sweet,\nBonasera. But if you come to me\nWith your friendship, your loyalty,\nThen your enemies become my enemies,\nAnd then, believe me, they would\nFear you...\n\nSlowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.\n\nBONASERA\nBe my friend.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGood. From me you'll get Justice.\n\nBONASERA\nGodfather.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSome day, and that day may never\nCome, I would like to call upon you\nTo do me a service in return.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nA HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight. There\nAre at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard\nAnd gardens. There is music and laughing and dancing and\nCountless tables covered with food and wine.\n\nDON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a\nSon: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of\nThe wedding party. He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the\nHands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the\nChildren, and makes them all welcome. They in turn carry\nWith them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked\nBread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.\n\nThe entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,\nMAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN\nAnd his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the\nBride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI. As they move into\nThe pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhere's Michael?\n\nSONNY\nHe'll be here Pop, it's still early.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThen the picture will wait for him.\n\nEveryone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves\nBack to the house. SONNY gives a delicious smile in the\nDirection of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI. She returns\nIt. Then he moves to his wife.\n\nSONNY\nSandra, watch the kids. They're\nRunning wild.\n\nSANDRA\nYou watch yourself.\n\nHAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine\nBarrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait. TOM\nCrooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is\nNext, straightens, and follows HAGEN.\nEXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nOutside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,\nWorking together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out\nOf the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers\nDown in their notebooks. We HEAR the music and laughter\nComing from the party in the distance.\n\nA MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.\n\nBARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the\nWatchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to\nEmbrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.\n\nThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another\nNumber in the notebook. A shiney new Cadillac with wooden\nBumpers.\n\nPETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping\nBellies with the ladies.\n\nCLEMENZA\nPaulie...wine...WINE.\n\nHe mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.\nPAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings\nIt to him.\n\nPAULIE\nYou look terrif on the floor!\n\nCLEMENZA\nWhat are you, a dance judge? Go do\nYour job; take a walk around the\nNeighborhood... see everything is\nOkay.\n\nPAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps\nBack into the dance.\n\nThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars. Put another\nNumber in the notebook.\n\nTESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-\nOLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his\nEnormous brown shoes.\n\nThe MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out\nOf the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by\nCLEMENZA and PAULIE.\n\nSONNY\nBuddy, this is a private party.\n\nThe MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the\nSedan. SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.\nThe DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,\nWithout saying a word. SONNY steps back, spits on the\nGround, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,\nAnd another TWO MEN. He doesn't say a thing for most of the\nWalk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.\n\nSONNY\nGoddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the\nDark study.\n\nNAZORINE\n...a fine boy from Sicily, captured\nBy the American Army, and sent to\nNew Jersey as a prisoner of war...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNazorine, my friend, tell me what I\nCan do.\n\nNAZORINE\nNow that the war is over, Enzo,\nThis boy is being repatriated to\nItaly. And you see, Godfather...\n(he wrings his hands,\nUnable to express himself)\nHe...my daughter...they...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou want him to stay in this country.\n\nNAZORINE\nGodfather, you understand everything.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTom, what we need is an Act of\nCongress to allow Enzo to become a\nCitizen.\n\nNAZORINE\n(impressed)\nAn Act of Congress!\n\nHAGEN\n(nodding)\nIt will cost.\n\nThe DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE\nNods.\n\nNAZORINE\nIs that all? Godfather, thank\nYou...\n(backing out, enthusiastically)\nOh, wait till you see the cake I\nMade for your beautiful daughter!\n\nNAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.\nDON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.\n\nHAGEN\nWho do I give this job to?\n\nThe DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNot to one of our paisans...give it\nTo a Jew Congressman in another\nDistrict. Who else is on the list\nFor today?\n\nThe DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting\nTo see him.\n\nHAGEN\nFrancesco Nippi. His nephew has\nBeen refused parole. A bad case.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nNIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nHis father worked with you in the\nFreight yards when you were young.\n\nLUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nHe's not on the list, but Luca\nBrasi wants to see you.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe DON turns to HAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nIs it necessary?\n\nHAGEN\nYou understand him better than\nAnyone.\n\nThe DON nods to this. Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nMICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,\nLeads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally\nStopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,\nFollowing them.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces\nHer to his GIRL.\n\nEXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe DON's eyes peering through the blinds.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nKAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,\nBurdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine. She\nIs exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and\nThe vitality.\n\nKAY\nI've never seen anything like it.\n\nMICHAEL\nI told you I had a lot of relatives.\n\nKAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.\nWe see what she sees:\n\nHer interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine\nBarrels.\n\nKAY\n(amused)\nMichael, what are those men doing?\n\nMICHAEL\nThey're waiting to see my father.\n\nKAY\nThey're talking to themselves.\n\nMICHAEL\nThey're going to talk to my father,\nWhich means they're going to ask\nHim for something, which means they\nBetter get it right.\n\nKAY\nWhy do they bother him on a day\nLike this?\n\nMICHAEL\nBecause they know that no Sicilian\nWill refuse a request on his\nDaughter's wedding day.\n\nEXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)\n\nCONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her\nOverly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI. He\nIs bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.\nShe absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from\nHim long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white\nEnvelopes they are putting into the large white purse she\nHolds. In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one\nOf her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,\nWhere she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.\nCARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the\nBulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the\nThings hold.\n\nDiscreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.\n\nCARLO\n(whispered)\nCut it out, Connie.\n\nThe purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,\nIs fat with money.\n\nPAULIE (O.S.)\nWhat do you think? Twenty grand?\n\nA little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a\nProsciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking\nEyes from the purse.\n\nPAULIE\nWho knows? Maybe more. Twenty,\nThirty grand in small bills cash in\nThat silk purse. Holy Toledo, if\nThis was somebody else's wedding!\n\nSONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY\nMANCINI, the Maid of Honor. Every once in a while he\nGlances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with\nSome WOMEN.\n\nHe bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.\n\nSANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.\n\nWOMAN\nIs it true what they say about your\nHusband, Sandra?\n\nSANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and\nFurther apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.\nThrough her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.\nSONNY and LUCY are gone.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe empty hallway. The bathroom door opens and LUCY\nSurreptitiously steps out.\n\nShe looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,\nMotioning for her to come up.\n\nShe lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nKAY and MICHAEL.\n\nKAY\n(in a spooky low tone)\nMichael, that scarey guy...Is he a\nRelative?\n\nShe has picked out LUCA BRASI.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. His name is Luca Brasi. You\nWouldn't like him.\n\nKAY\n(Excited)\nWho is he?\n\nMICHAEL\n(Sizing her up)\nYou really want to know?\n\nKAY\nYes. Tell me.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou like spaghetti?\n\nKAY\nYou know I love spaghetti.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen eat your spaghetti and I'll\nTell you a Luca Brasi story.\n\nShe starts to eat her spaghetti.\n\nShe begins eating, looking at him eagerly.\n\nMICHAEL\nOnce upon a time, about fifteen\nYears ago some people wanted to\nTake over my father's olive oil\nBusiness. They had Al Capone send\nSome men in from Chicago to kill my\nFather, and they almost did.\n\nKAY\nAl Capone!\n\nMICHAEL\nMy Father sent Luca Brasi after\nThem. He tied the two Capone men\nHand and foot, and stuffed small\nBath towels into their mouths.\nThen he took an ax, and chopped one\nMan's feet off...\n\nKAY\nMichael...\n\nMICHAEL\nThen the legs at the knees...\n\nKAY\nMichael you're trying to scare me...\n\nMICHAEL\nThen the thighs where they joined\nThe torso.\n\nKAY\nMichael, I don't want to hear\nAnymore...\n\nMICHAEL\nThen Luca turned to the other man...\n\nKAY\nMichael, I love you.\n\nMICHAEL\n...who out of sheer terror had\nSwallowed the bath towel in his\nMouth and suffocated.\n\nThe smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a\nTall story.\n\nKAY\nI never know when you're telling me\nThe truth.\n\nMICHAEL\nI told you you wouldn't like him.\n\nKAY\nHe's coming over here!\n\nLUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near\nTheir table.\n\nMICHAEL\nTom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay\nAdams.\n\nKAY\n(having survived LUCA)\nHow do you do.\n\nMICHAEL\nMy brother, Tom Hagen.\n\nHAGEN\nHello Kay. Your father's inside,\nDoing some business.\n(privately)\nHe's been asking for you.\n\nMICHAEL\nThanks Tom.\n\nHAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously\nFollowing.\n\nKAY\nIf he's your brother, why does he\nHave a different name?\n\nMICHAEL\nMy brother Sonny found him living\nIn the streets when he was a kid,\nSo my father took him in. He's a\nGood lawyer.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE at the window. He has seen the intimacy of the\nYOUNG COUPLE.\n\nLUCA (O.S.)\nDon Corleone...\n\nTHE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves\nForward to kiss his hand. He takes the envelope from his\nJacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes\nA formal speech.\n\nLUCA\n(with difficulty)\nDon Corleone...I am honored, and\nGrateful...that you invited me to\nYour home...on the wedding day of\nYour...daughter.\nMay their first child...be a\nMasculine child. I pledge my never\nEnding loyalty.\n(he offers the envelope)\nFor your daughter's bridal purse.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThank you, Luca, my most valued\nFriend.\n\nTHE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so\nTightly we might imagine it to be painful.\n\nLUCA\nLet me leave you, Don Corleone. I\nKnow you are busy.\n\nHe turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with\nThe same formality he entered with. DON CORLEONE breathes\nMore easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI'm sure it's the most generous\nGift today.\n\nHAGEN\nThe Senator called--apologized for\nNot coming personally, but said\nYou'd understand. Also, some of\nThe Judges...they've all sent gifts.\nAnd another call from Virgil\nSollozzo.\n\nDON CORLEONE is not pleased.\n\nHAGEN\nThe action is narcotics. Sollozzo\nHas contacts in Turkey for the\nPoppy, in Sicily for the plants to\nProcess down to morphine or up to\nHeroin. Also he has access to this\nCountry. He's coming to us for\nFinancial help, and some sort of\nImmunity from the law. For that we\nGet a piece of the action, I\nCouldn't find out how much.\nSollozzo is vouched for by the\nTattaglia family, and they may have\nA piece of the action. They call\nSollozzo the Turk.\nHe's spent a lot of time in Turkey\nAnd is suppose to have a Turkish\nWife and kids. He's suppose to be\nVery quick with the knife, or was,\nWhen he was younger. Only in\nMatters of business and with some\nReasonable complaint. Also he has\nAn American wife and three children\nAnd he is a good family man.\n\nTHE DON nods.\n\nHAGEN\nHe's his own boss, and very\nCompetent.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd with prison record.\n\nHAGEN\nTwo terms; one in Italy, one in the\nUnited States. He's known to the\nGovernment as a top narcotics man.\nThat could be a plus for us; he\nCould never get immunity to testify.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhen did he call?\n\nHAGEN\nThis morning.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nOn a day like this. Consiglero, do\nYou also have in your notes the the\nTurk made his living from\nProstitution before the war, like\nThe Tattaglias do now. Write that\nDown before you forget it. The\nTurk will wait.\n\nWe now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers\nFrom outside. In Italian, with unmistakable style.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat that? It sounds like Johnny.\n\nHe moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the\nRoom with light.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nIt is Johnny. He came all the way\nFrom California to be at the wedding.\n\nHAGEN\nShould I bring him in.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo. Let the people enjoy him. You\nSee? He is a good godson.\n\nHAGEN\nIt's been two years. He's probably\nIn trouble again.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nJOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and\nExcitement of the wedding GUESTS.\n\nKAY\nI didn't know your family knew\nJohnny Fontane.\n\nMICHAEL\nSure.\n\nKAY\nI used to come down to New York\nWhenever he sang at the Capitol and\nScream my head off.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe's my father's godson; he owes\nHim his whole career.\n\nJOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.\nThey call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy Godson has come three thousand\nMiles to do us honor and no one\nThinks to wet his throat.\n\nAt once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who\nTakes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.\n\nJOHNNY\nI kept trying to call you after my\nDivorce and Tom always said you\nWere busy. When I got the Wedding\nInvitation I knew you weren't sore\nAt me anymore, Godfather.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nCan I do something for you still?\nYou're not too rich, or too famous\nThat I can't help you?\n\nJOHNNY\nI'm not rich anymore, Godfather,\nAnd...my career, I'm almost washed\nUp...\n\nHe's very disturbed. The GODFATHER indicates that he come\nWith him to the office so no one will notice. He turns to\nHAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTell Santino to come in with us.\nHe should hear some things.\n\nThey go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN glances up the staircase.\n\nHAGEN\nSonny?\n\nThen he goes up.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nSONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her\nGown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing\nAgainst the door. Her face peeks out from the layers of\nPetticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.\n\nLUCY\nSonnyeeeeeeee.\n\nHer head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his\nBody. But there is a knocking as well. They stop, freeze\nIn that position.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nSonny? Sonny, you in there?\n\nINT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)\n\nOutside, HAGEN by the door.\n\nHAGEN\nThe old man wants you; Johnny's\nHere...he's got a problem.\n\nSONNY (O.S.)\nOkay. One minute.\n\nHAGEN hesitates. We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the\nDoor again. TOM leaves.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE\nACT LIKE A MAN! By Christ in\nHeaven, is it possible you turned\nOut no better than a Hollywood\nFinocchio.\n\nBoth HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing. The DON\nSmiles. SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still\nAdjusting his clothes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAll right, Hollywood...Now tell me\nAbout this Hollywood Pezzonovanta\nWho won't let you work.\n\nJOHNNY\nHe owns the studio. Just a month\nAgo he bought the movie rights to\nThis book, a best seller. And the\nMain character is a guy just like\nMe. I wouldn't even have to act,\nJust be myself.\n\nThe DON is silent, stern.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou take care of your family?\n\nJOHNNY\nSure.\n\nHe glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as\nHe can.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou look terrible. I want you to\nEat well, to rest. And spend time\nWith your family. And then, at the\nEnd of the month, this big shot\nWill give you the part you want.\n\nJOHNNY\nIt's too late. All the contracts\nHave been signed, they're almost\nReady to shoot.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\n\nHe takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough\nTo hurt.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNow go back to the party and leave\nIt to me.\n\nHe closes the door, smiling to himself. Turns to HAGEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhen does my daughter leave with\nHer bridegroom?\n\nHAGEN\nThey'll cut the cake in a few\nMinutes...leave right after that.\nYour new son-in-law, do we give him\nSomething important?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo, give him a living. But never\nLet him know the family's business.\nWhat else, Tom?\n\nHAGEN\nI've called the hospital; they've\nNotified Consiglere Genco's family\nTo come and wait. He won't last\nOut the night.\n\nThis saddens the DON. He sighs.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGenco will wait for me. Santino,\nTell your brothers they will come\nWith me to the hospital to see\nGenco. Tell Fredo to drive the big\nCar, and ask Johnny to come with us.\n\nSONNY\nAnd Michael?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAll my sons.\n(to HAGEN)\nTom, I want you to go to California\nTonight. Make the arrangements.\nBut don't leave until I come back\nFrom the hospital and speak to you.\nUnderstood?\n\nHAGEN\nUnderstood.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nNow all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over\nThe entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels\nIn a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most\nExtravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument\nOf his gratitude. The CROWD is favorably impressed: they\nBegin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,\nIn the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and\nKiss the Groom. Louder and louder, five hundred forks\nHitting five hundred glasses.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nSilence.\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day. The GUESTS are gone. A\nSingle black car is in the courtyard. FREDDIE is behind the\nDriver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who\nSits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWill your girl friend get back to\nThe city all right?\n\nMICHAEL\nTom said he'd take care of it.\n\nThe DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through\nThe gate of the great Corleone Mall.\n\nINT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)\n\nA long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can\nSee a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but\nAll plump and dressed in black.\n\nDON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end. But then the\nDON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder. MICHAEL\nStops and turns toward his FATHER. The two looks at one\nAnother for some time. SILENCE. DON CORLEONE then lifts\nHis hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's\nUniform.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat was this for?\n\nMICHAEL\nFor bravery.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd this?\n\nMICHAEL\nFor killing a man.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat miracles you do for strangers.\n\nMICHAEL\nI fought for my country. It was my\nChoice.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd now, what do you choose to do?\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm going to finish school.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGood. When you are finished, come\nAnd talk to me. I have hopes for\nYou.\n\nAgain they regard each other without a word. MICHAEL turns,\nAnd continues on. DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then\nFollows.\n\nINT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR\nVIEW. He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\n(whispered)\nGenco, I've brought my sons to pay\nTheir respects. And look, even\nJohnny Fontane, all the way from\nHollywood.\n\nGENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man. DON CORLEONE\nTakes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around\nHis bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.\n\nGENCO\nGodfather, Godfather, it's your\nDaughter's wedding day, you cannot\nRefuse me. Cure me, you have the\nPower.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI have no such power...but Genco,\nDon't fear death.\n\nGENCO\n(with a sly wink)\nIt's been arranged, then?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou blaspheme. Resign yourself.\n\nGENCO\nYou need your old Consigliere. Who\nWill replace me?\n(suddenly)\nStay with me Godfather. Help me\nMeet death. If he sees you, he\nWill be frightened and leave me in\nPeace. You can say a word, pull a\nFew strings, eh? We'll outwit that\nBastard as we outwitted all those\nOthers.\n(clutching his hand)\nGodfather, don't betray me.\n\nThe DON motions all the others to leave the room. They do.\nHe returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and\nWhispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.\n\nINT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nFADE IN:\n\nThe interior of a non-stop Constellation. HAGEN is one of\nThe very few passengers on this late flight. He looks like\nAny young lawyer on a business trip. He is tired from the\nDifficult preparation and duties that he has just executed\nDuring the wedding. On the seat next to him is an enormous,\nBulging briefcase. He closes his eyes.\n\nINT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE. CARLO is in his\nUndershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the\nEnvelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the\nContents. CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble\nBathroom. She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and\nTries to get his interest.\n\nINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE in his office. LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nLuca, I am worried about this man\nSollozzo. Find out what you can,\nThrough the Tattaglias. Let them\nBelieve you could be tempted away\nFrom the Corleone Family, if the\nRight offer was made. Learn what\nHe has under his fingernails...\n\nINT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)\n\nThe hallway of an apartment building. SONNY enters, climbs\nTwo steps at a time. He knocks, and then whispers.\n\nSONNY\nIt's me, Sonny.\n\nThe door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling\nHim into the apartment.\n\nINT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA BRASI's tiny room. He is partly dressed. He kneels\nAnd reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked\nTrunk. He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof\nVest. He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then\nPuts on his shirt and jacket. He takes his gun, quickly\nDisassembles, checks, and reassembles it. And leaves.\n\nINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nA CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.\n\nINT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New\nHampshire.\n\nINT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty\nSubway train.\n\nINT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN on the Constellation. He reaches into his briefcase,\nAnd takes out several pictures and papers.\n\nOne photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm\nIn arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a\nLovely young child star to his immediate right.\n\nHAGEN considers other papers.\n\nINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.\nHe straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nRemember my new Consigliere, a\nLawyer with his briefcase can steal\nMore than a hundred men with guns.\n\nEXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)\n\nJACK WOLTZ ESTATE. HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,\nArmed only with his briefcase. A GATEMAN opens the gate,\nAnd TOM enters.\n\nEXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal\nGardens, martinis in hand.\n\nWOLTZ\nYou should have told me your boss\nWas Corleone, Tom, I had to check\nYou out. I thought you were just\nSome third rate hustler Johnny was\nRunning in to bluff me.\n(a piece of statuary)\nFlorence, thirteenth century.\nDecorated the garden of a king.\n\nThey cross the garden and head toward the stables.\n\nWOLTZ\nI'm going to show you something\nBeautiful.\n\nThey pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a\nHuge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: \"KHARTOUM.\"\nTWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they\nRise as WOLTZ approaches.\n\nWOLTZ\nYou like horses? I like horses, I\nLove 'em. Beautiful, expensive\nRacehorses.\n\nThe animal inside is truly beautiful. WOLTZ whispers to him\nWith true love in his voice.\n\nWOLTZ\nKhartoum...Kartoum...You are\nLooking at six hundred thousand\nDollars on four hoofs. I bet even\nRussian Czars never paid that kind\nOf dough for a single horse. But\nI'm not going to race him I'm going\nTo put him out to Stud.\n\nINT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nHAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,\nAttended by SEVERAL SERVANTS. Great paintings hang on the\nWalls. The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.\n\nHAGEN\nMr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.\nThat is very close, a very sacred\nReligious relationship.\n\nWOLTZ\nOkay, but just tell him this is one\nFavor I can't give. But he should\nTry me again on anything else.\n\nHAGEN\nHe never asks a second favor when\nHe has been refused the first.\nUnderstood?\n\nWOLTZ\nYou smooth son of a bitch, let me\nLay it on the line for you, and\nYour boss. Johnny Fontane never\nGets that movie. I don't care how\nMany Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball\nGoombahs come out of the woodwork!\n\nHAGEN\nI'm German-Irish.\n\nWOLTZ\nOkay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny\nWill never get that part because I\nHate that pinko punk and I'm going\nTo run him out of the Movies. And\nI'll tell you why. He ruined one\nOf Woltz Brothers' most valuable\nProteges. For five years I had\nThis girl under training; singing\nLessons! Acting lessons! Dancing\nLessons! We spent hundreds of\nThousands of dollars--I was going\nTo make her a star. I'll be even\nMore frank, just to show you that\nI'm not a hard-hearted man, that it\nWasn't all dollars and cents. That\nGirl was beautiful and young and\nInnocent and she was the greatest\nPiece of ass I've ever ad and I've\nHad them all over the world. Then\nJohnny comes along with that olive\nOil voice and guinea charm and she\nRuns off. She threw it all away to\nMake me look ridiculous. A MAN IN\nMY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE\nMADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!\n\nEXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)\n\nAn unimposing little building in New York City on Mott\nStreet with a large old sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,\nINC.\" next to an open-faced fruit market.\n\nA dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we\nCannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters\nThe building. This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.\n\nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nLooking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps\nBefore he actually rises into view. He is a small man, very\nDark, with curly black hair. But wiry, and tight and hard,\nAnd obviously very dangerous. He is greeted at the head of\nThe stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,\nIntroducing himself. For a moment, there is a complex of\nHandshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful\nIntroductions. Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's\nGlass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.\nThey are very respectful of one another. Folding chairs are\nBrought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around\nIn a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,\nCLEMENZA and TESSIO. The DON is the slightest bit foolish\nWith all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no\nOne. Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear\nThat this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nMy business is heroin, I have poppy\nFields, laboratories in Narseilles\nAnd Sicily, ready to go into\nProduction. My importing methods\nAre as safe as these things can be,\nAbout five per cent loss. The risk\nIs nothing, the profits enormous.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhy do you come to me? Why do I\nDeserve your generosity?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI need two million dollars in\nCash...more important, I need a\nFriend who has people in high\nPlaces; a friend who can guarantee\nThat if one of my employees be\nArrested, they would get only light\nSentences. Be my friend.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat percentages for my family?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThirty per cent. In the first year\nYour share would be four million\nDollars; then it would go up.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd what is the percentage of the\nTattaglia family?\n\nSOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nMy compliments. I'll take care of\nThem from my share.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSo. I receive 30 per cent just for\nFinance and legal protection. No\nWorries about operations, is that\nWhat you tell me?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nIf you think two million dollars in\nCash is just finance, I congratulate\nYou Don Corleone.\n\nThere is a long silence; in which each person present feels\nThe tension. The DON is about to give his answer.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI said I would see you because I've\nHeard you're a serious man, to be\nTreated with respect...\n(pause)\nBut I'll say no to you.\n\nWe feel this around the room.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI'll give you my reasons. I have\nMany, many friends in Politics.\nBut they wouldn't be so friendly if\nMy business was narcotics instead\nOf gambling. They think gambling\nIs something like liquor, a harmless\nVice...and they think narcotics is\nDirty business.\n\nSOLLOZZO takes a breath.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo...how a man makes his living is\nNone of my business. But this\nProposition of yours is too risky.\nAll the people in my family lived\nWell the last ten years, I won't\nRisk that out of greed.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nAre you worried about security for\nYour million?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe Tattaglias will guarantee your\nInvestment also.\n\nThis startles SONNY; he blurts out.\n\nSONNY\nThe Tattaglia family guarantees our\nInvestment?\n\nSOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face\nHim. Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out\nOf line.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYoung people are greedy, and they\nHave no manners. They speak when\nThey should listen. But I have a\nSentimental weakness for my\nChildren, and I've spoiled them, as\nYou see. But Signor Sollozzo, my\nNo is final.\n\nSOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal. He\nGlances one last time at SONNY. He rises; all the others do\nAs well. He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally\nTakes his leave. When the footsteps can no longer be heard:\n\nThe DON turns to SONNY.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSantino, never let anyone outside\nThe family know what you are\nThinking. I think your brain is\nGoing soft from all that comedy you\nPlay with that young girl.\n\nTWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display\nWith the word \"THANK YOU\" spelled out in flowers.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat is this nonsense?\n\nHAGEN\nIt's from Johnny. It was announced\nThis morning. He's going to play\nThe lead in the new Woltz Brothers\nFilm.\n\nINT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)\n\nIt is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,\nPresumably WOLTZ, is sleeping. Soft light bathes the room\nFrom the large windows. We move closer to him until we see\nHis face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ. He turns uncomfortably;\nMutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets. Something\nWet.\n\nHe wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.\nHe looks at his hand; the wetness is blood. He is\nFrightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on\nHis sheets and pajamas. He grunts, pulls the puddle of\nBlood in his bed. He feels his own body frantically,\nMoving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face\nWith the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of\nHis bed. Just blood from the hacked neck. White reedy\nTendons show. He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle\nOf blood to see more clearly. Froth covers the muzzle, and\nThe enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered\nWith blood.\n\nWOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot. No sound comes out.\nThen, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure\nTerror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and\nKnees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.\n\nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\n\nCLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER. Nodding.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nSend Johnny my congratulations.\n\n----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------\n\n(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)\n\nFifth Avenue in the snow. Christmas week. People are\nBundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.\n\nKAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,\nCarrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.\n\nKAY\nWe have something for your mother,\nFor Sonny, we have the tie for\nFredo and Tom Hagen gets the\nReynolds pen...\n\nMICHAEL\nAnd what do you want for Christmas?\n\nKAY\nJust you.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music. THE VIEW PANS\nAROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nWe'll have a quiet, civil ceremony\nAt the City Hall, no big fuss, no\nFamily, just a couple of friends as\nWitnesses.\n\nThe two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on\nThe two single beds that they have pushed together.\n\nKAY\nWhat will your father say?\n\nMICHAEL\nAs long as I tell him beforehand he\nWon't object. He'll be hurt, but\nHe won't object.\n\nKAY\nWhat time do they expect us?\n\nMICHAEL\nFor dinner. Unless I call and tell\nThem we're still in New Hampshire.\n\nKAY\nMichael.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen we can have dinner, see a\nShow, and spend one more night.\n\nHe moves to the telephone.\n\nMICHAEL (CONT'D.)\nOperator. Get me\n(fill in number)\n\nKAY\nMichael, what are you doing?\n\nMICHAEL\nShhh, you be the long distance\nOperator. Here.\n\nKAY\nHello...this is Long Distance. I\nHave a call from New Hampshire. Mr.\nMichael Corleone. One moment please.\n\nShe hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.\n\nMICHAEL\nHello, Tom? Michael. Yeah...\nListen, we haven't left yet. I'm\nDriving down to the city with Kay\nTomorrow morning. There's something\nImportant I want to tell the old\nMan before Christmas. Will he be\nHome tomorrow night?\n\nINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nHAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office. In the background,\nThrough the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in\nHis office. TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nSure. Anything I can do for you.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nNo. I guess I'll see you Christmas.\nEveryone's going to be out at Long\nBeach, right?\n\nHAGEN\nRight.\n\nHe smiles. MICHAEL has hung up. He looks at the piles of\nWork, and can't face it. He rises, puts on his coat and\nHat, and continues out.\n\nHe peeks into the DON's office.\n\nHAGEN\nMichael called; he's not leaving\nNew Hampshire until tomorrow\nMorning. I've got to go, I promised\nTheresa I'd pick up some toys for\nThe kids.\n\nThe DON smiles and nods.\n\nTOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.\nFREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the\nAfternoon paper. He puts aside the papers the office\nManager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,\nRaps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the\nPaper.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTell Paulie to get the car from the\nLot; I'll be ready to go home in a\nFew minutes.\n\nFREDO\nI'll have to get it myself; Paulie\nCalled in sick this morning.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThat's the third time this month.\nI think maybe you'd better get a\nHealthier bodyguard for me. Tell\nTom.\n\nFREDO\n(going)\nPaulie's a good kid. If he's sick,\nHe's sick. I don't mind getting\nThe car.\n\nFREDDIE leaves. He slowly puts on his jacket. Looks out\nHis window.\n\nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\nFREDDIE crosses the street.\n\nINT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nOFFICE MANAGER\nBuon Watale, Don Corleone.\n\nThe MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat. Once again, the\nDON glances out his window.\n\nThe black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMerry Christmas.\n(handing the MANAGER\nAn envelope)\n\nAnd he starts down the stairs.\n\nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail. When\nFREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the\nDriver's seat. The DON moves to the car, and is about to\nGet in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open\nFruit stand near the corner.\n\nThe PROPRIETOR springs to serve him. The DON walks among\nThe trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular\nPiece of fruit. As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the\nPieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag. The DON\nPays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then\nTurns back to the car.\n\nEXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)\n\nTOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift\nWrapped. He continues past the windows. As he walks,\nSomeone walks right in his way. He looks up. It is SOLLOZZO.\n\nHe takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(quietly)\nDon't be frightened. I just want\nTo talk to you.\n\nA car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(urgently)\nGet in; I want to talk to you.\n\nHAGEN pulls his arm free. He is frightened.\n\nHAGEN\nI haven't got time.\n\nTWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nGet in the car. If I wanted to\nKill you you'd be dead already.\nTrust me.\n\nHAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving\nOur VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story\nOf Hansel and Gretel. We HEAR the car doors shut, and the\nCar drive off.\n\nEXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)\n\nRADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show. KAY and\nMICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and\nShe sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex. KAY\nNostalgically hums \"The Bells of Saint Mary's,\" as they walk\nArm in arm.\n\nKAY\nWould you like me better if I were\nA nun?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo.\n\nKAY\nWould you like me better if I were\nIngrid Bergman?\n\nThey have passed a little enclosed newsstand. KAY sees\nSomething that terrifies her. She doesn't know what to do.\nMICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.\n\nKAY\n(a little voice)\nMichael?\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm thinking about it.\n\nKAY\nMichael...\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I would not like you better if\nYou were Ingrid Bergman.\n\nShe cannot answer him. Rather she pulls him by the arm,\nBack to the newsstand, and points. His face goes grave.\n\nThe headlines read: \"VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED\nDOWN.\"\n\nMICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a\nDollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them. KAY\nKnows to remain silent.\n\nMICHAEL\n(desperately)\nThey don't say if he's dead or alive.\n\nEXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)\n\nDON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the\nCar, when TWO MEN step from the corner. Suddenly, the DON\nDrops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness\nToward the parked car.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nFredo, Fredo!\n\nThe paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins\nRolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.\n\nFive bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,\nAnd continues toward the car.\n\nThe PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking\nOver an entire case of fruit.\n\nThe TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.\n\nTheir feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit. There are\nMore GUNSHOTS.\n\nFREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;\nHaving difficulty opening the door. He rushes out, a gun\nTrembling in his hand; his mouth open. He actually drops\nThe gun.\n\nThe gun falls amid the rolling fruit.\n\nThe GUNMEN are panicked. They fire once more at the downed\nDON CORLEONE. His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;\nAnd pools of blood are beginning to form.\n\nThe GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;\nThey disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.\n\nThe PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:\nRather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely\nFrom around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from\nWindows. But the street itself is now empty.\n\nFREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great\nPuddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and\nFace down in them.\n\nFREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying\nSomething we cannot understand. He begins to weep profusely.\n\nINT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night. He\nGets off.\n\nHe emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.\n\nEXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA walks down the late night street. He approaches an\nElegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still\nWinking this late at night. He waits and watches. Then the\nSign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.\n\nINT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless\nGlistening wooden floors. Now, at this late time, the\nChairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR\nIs waxing them. A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her\nReceipts. LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at\nThe bar. ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves\nBehind the bar.\n\nMAN\nLuca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.\n\nLUCA\nI know.\n\nLUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nDo you know who I am?\n\nLUCA Nods.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nYou've been talking to the\nTattaglias. They thought we could\nDo business.\n\nLUCA listens.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI need somebody strong to protect\nMy operation, physically. I've\nHeard you're not happy with your\nFamily, you might make a switch.\n\nLUCA\nIf the money is good enough.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nOn the first shipment, I can\nGuarantee you fifty thousand dollars.\n\nLUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.\n\nSOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,\nRather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.\nBRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter\nMagically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette. Then,\nHe does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and\nPuts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.\n\nINT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe telephone in SONNY's house is ringing. He approaches\nIt, obviously fresh from a nap.\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nDo you recognize my voice?\n\nSONNY\nI think so. Detective squad?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nRight. Don't say my name, just\nListen. Somebody shot your father\nOutside his place fifteen minutes\nAgo.\n\nSONNY\nIs he alive?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nI think so, but I can't get close\nEnough. There's a lot of blood.\nI'll try to find out more.\n\nSONNY\nFind out anything you can...you got\nA Grand coming.\n(click)\n\nSONNY cradles the phone. An incredible rage builds up in\nHim, his face actually turning red. He would like to rip\nThe phone to pieces in his bare hands. Then he controls it.\nQuickly, he dials another number.\n\nSONNY\nTheresa, let me talk to Tom. Not\nYet? Have him call me as soon as\nHe gets home.\n\nHe hangs up.\n\nSANDRA (O.S.)\nSonny? Sonny, who is it?\n(she enters the room)\nWhat is it?\n\nSONNY\n(calmly)\nThey shot the old man.\n\nSANDRA\nOh God...\n\nSONNY\nHoney...don't worry. Nothing else\nIs going to happen.\n\nThere is a POUNDING on the door. A BABY starts crying.\n\nSANDRA\n(really frightened)\nSONNY?\n\nSONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and\nMoves quickly. He opens the front door quickly. It is\nCLEMENZA. He enters, SONNY closes the door. SANDRA goes to\nLook after the baby.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(excited)\nYou heard about your father?\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThe word is out in the streets that\nHe's dead.\n\nSONNY\nWhere the hell was Paulie, why\nWasn't he with the Don?\n\nCLEMENZA\nPaulie's been a little sick all\nWinter...he was home.\n\nSONNY\nHow many times did he stay home the\nLast couple of months?\n\nCLEMENZA\nMaybe three, four times. I always\nAsked Freddie if he wanted another\nBodyguard, but he said no. Things\nHave been so smooth the last ten\nYears...\n\nSONNY\nGo get Paulie, I don't care how\nSick he is. Pick him up yourself,\nAnd bring him to my father's house.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThat's all? Don't you want me to\nSend some people over here?\n\nSONNY\nNo, just you and Paulie.\n\nCLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the\nCouch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.\n\nSONNY\nA couple of our people will come to\nStay here. Do whatever they say;\nI'm going over to the main house.\nIf you want me, use Pop's special\nPhone.\n\nThe telephone rings again. SONNY answers it.\n\nSONNY\nHello.\n\nSOLLOZZO (O.S.)\nSantino Corleone?\n\nSANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is. SONNY\nIndicates that she be quiet.\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nSOLLOZZO (O.S.)\nWe have Tom Hagen. In about three\nHours he'll be released with our\nProposition. Don't do anything\nUntil you've heard what he has to\nSay. You can only cause a lot of\nTrouble. What's done is done.\n(a pause)\nDon't lose that famous temper of\nYours.\n\nSONNY\n(quietly)\nI'll wait.\n\nEXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nFULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL. It is night, but the\nCourtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the\nTops of all the houses. It is very cold. We see the figure\nOf SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY walks into the empty, darkened house. Then he calls\nOut.\n\nSONNY\nMa? Ma, where are you.\n\nThe kitchen door swings open. He moves quickly and takes\nHer by the arm. He is deliberately calm.\n\nSONNY\nMa, I just got a call. Pop's\nHurt...I don't know how bad.\n\nMAMA\n(quietly)\nSantino? Have they killed him?\n\nSONNY\n(almost in tears)\nWe don't know yet, Ma.\n\nMAMA\nI'll get dressed. In case we can\nSee him...\n\nShe moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs. SONNY\nTurns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying. He\nTakes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,\nAnd sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his\nFather's office.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nHe switches the lights on in the DON's office. The massive\nDesk dominates the room. SONNY moves quickly to the\nTelephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,\nAnd dials a number.\n\nSONNY\nTessio...This is Santino Corleone.\nI want fifty reliable men out here.\n\nTESSIO (O.S.)\nI heard, Sonny...but what about\nClemenza's regime?\n\nSONNY\nI don't want to use Clemenza's\nPeople right now. Understood?\n\nHe hangs up. He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the\nDial, and removes a small notebook. He takes it back to the\nDesk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.\nWe follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA\nBRASI. SONNY dials the number. There is no answer.\n\nSONNY\nLuca.\n\nINT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe interior of an abandoned building. SEVERAL MEN in suits\nAnd ties sit around in the booths.\n\nHAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI know you're not in the muscle end\nOf the family--so I don't want you\nTo be afraid. I want you to help\nThe Corleones and I want you to\nHelp me.\n\nHAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette\nIn his mouth. ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye\nTo the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered\nChina cup. HAGEN sips gratefully.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nYour boss is dead...\n\nHAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.\nSOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(pushing the bottle)\nHave some more. We got him outside\nHis office, just before I picked\nYou up. You have to make the peace\nBetween me and Santino.\n\nHAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nSonny was hot for my deal, right?\nYou know it's the smart thing to\nDo, too. I want you to talk Sonny\nInto it.\n\nHAGEN\n(pulling himself together)\nSonny will come after you with\nEverything he's got.\n\nSOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThat's going to be his first\nReaction. You have to talk some\nSense into him. The Tattaglia\nFamily stands behind me with all\nTheir people. The other New York\nFamilies will go along with anything\nThat prevents a full scale war.\n\nHe leans close to HAGEN.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe Don was slipping; in the old\nDays I could never have gotten to\nHim. Now he's dead, nothing can\nBring him back. Talk to Sonny,\nTalk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza\nAnd Tessio...it's good business.\n\nHAGEN\nEven Sonny won't be able to call\nOff Luca Brasi.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI'll worry about Luca. You take\nCare of Sonny and the other two kids.\n\nHAGEN\nI'll try...It's what the Don would\nWant us to do.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(lifting his hands in\nAn expression of harmlessness)\nGood...then you can go...\n(he escorts him to\nThe door)\nI don't like violence. I'm a\nBusinessman, and blood is a big\nExpense.\n\nHe opens the door; they step out together.\n\nEXT NITE: BUILDING\n\nHAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.\n\nBut a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.\nHe indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to\nSOLLOZZO in private.\n\nThen SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression. He opens the\nDoor, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe old man is still alive. Five\nBullets in his Sicilian hide and\nHe's still alive.\n(he gives a fatalistic\nShrug)\nBad luck for me, bad luck for you.\n\nEXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL driving during the night. There is a little fog in\nThe air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making\nIt difficult to see well. The wipers move across the view,\nAs the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still\nDecorated for Christmas. The courtyard is bathed with white\nFloodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look. The\nNarrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link\nChain. There are strange cars parked along the curving\nCement walk. SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and\nChain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.\n\nMAN\nWho're you?\n\nANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and\nThen turns.\n\nMAN 2\nIt's the Don's kid; take the car,\nI'll bring him inside.\n\nThe FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.\n\nINT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL\nDoesn't recognize. They pay little attention to him. Most\nOf them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas\nTree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.\n\nTHERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a\nCigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water\nGlass half filled with whiskey. On the other side of the\nSofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is\nSweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black\nWith his saliva. PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the\nOther side of the room. CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at\nHim.\n\nCLEMENZA\nYour mother's at the hospital with\nThe old man: He's gonna pull through.\n\nMICHAEL nods his relief.\n\nMICHAEL\nThanks.\n\nHe moves to THERESA.\n\nMICHAEL\n(gently)\nYou heard from Tom yet?\n\nWithout looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and\nTrembles. Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the\nRoom; everyone speaks in a whisper.\n\nMICHAEL\n(taking her hand)\nC'mon.\n\nHe leads her into his father's office without knocking.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad. They look\nUp, startled.\n\nSONNY\nDon't worry, Theresa; they just\nWant to give Tom the proposition,\nThen they're going to turn him loose.\n\nHe reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,\nHe kisses him on the cheek.\n\nSONNY\nI was worried when we couldn't get\nIn touch with you in that hick town.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow's Mom?\n\nSONNY\nGood. She's been through it before.\nMe too. You were too young to know\nAbout it. You better wait outside;\nThere're some things you shouldn't\nHear.\n\nMICHAEL\nI can help you out...\n\nSONNY\nOh no you can't, the old man'd be\nSore as hell if I let you get mixed\nUp in this.\n\nMICHAEL\nJesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.\n\nSONNY\nTheresa.\n\nShe understands, and leaves them alone.\n\nSONNY\nAll right, Mikey...who do we have\nTo hit, Clemenza or Paulie?\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat?\n\nSONNY\nOne of them fingered the old man.\n\nMICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on\nTrial for their lives.\n\nMICHAEL\nClemenza? No, I don't believe it.\n\nSONNY\nYou're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.\nIt was Paulie.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow can you be sure?\n\nSONNY\nOn the three days Paulie was sick\nThis month, he got calls from a\nPayphone across from the old man's\nBuilding. We got people in the\nPhone company.\n(he shrugs)\nThank God it was Paulie...we'll\nNeed Clemenza bad.\n\nMICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the\nSituation.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs it going to be all-out war, like\nLast time?\n\nSONNY\nUntil the old man tells me different.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.\n\nSONNY\nSollozzo is a dead man, I don't\nCare what it costs. I don't care\nIf we have to fight all the five\nFamilies in New York. The Tattaglia\nFamily's going to eat dirt. I\nDon't care if we all go down\nTogether.\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\nThat's not how Pop would have\nPlayed it.\n\nSONNY\nI know I'm not the man he was. But\nI'll tell you this and he'll tell\nYou too. When it comes to real\nAction, I can operate as good as\nAnybody short range.\n\nMICHAEL\n(calmly)\nAll right, Sonny. All right.\n\nSONNY\nChrist, if I could only contact Luca.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs it like they say? Is he that\nGood?\n\nOutside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.\nThen open the door and rush out.\n\nEveryone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped\nIn a tight embrace with his WIFE.\n\nHAGEN\nIf I plead before the Supreme\nCourt, I'll never do better than I\nDid tonight with that Turk.\n\nEXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's\nStudy. It stands out against the cold, dark night.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on\nThe edge of the sofa. The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,\nIn shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep. It is four in the\nMorning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many\nSnacks. They can barely talk anymore.\n\nHAGEN\nIs the hospital covered?\n\nSONNY\nThe cops have it locked in and I\nGot my people there visiting Pop\nAll the time. What about the hit\nList.\n\nHAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.\n\nHAGEN\nToo much, too far, too personal.\nThe Don would consider this all\nPurely a business dispute: Get rid\nOf Sollozzo, and everything falls\nIn line. YOU don't have to go\nAfter the Tattaglias.\n\nCLEMENZA nods.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about Luca? Sollozzo didn't\nSeem worried about Luca. That\nWorries me.\n\nSONNY\nIf Luca sold out we're in real\nTrouble.\n\nHAGEN\nHas anyone been able to get in\nTouch with him?\n\nSONNY\nNo, and I've been calling all night.\nMaybe he's shacked up.\n\nHAGEN\nLuca never sleeps over with a broad.\nHe always goes home when he's\nThrough. Mike, keep ringing Luca's\nNumber.\n\nMICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the\nNumber once again. He can hear the phone ringing on the\nOther end but no one answers. Then hangs up.\n\nHAGEN\nKeep trying every fifteen minutes.\n(exhausted)\n\nSONNY\nTom, you're the Consigliere, what\nDo we do if the old man dies?\n\nHAGEN\nWithout your father's political\nContacts and personal influence,\nThe Corleone family loses half its\nStrength. Without your father, the\nOther New York families might wind\nUp supporting Sollozzo, and the\nTattaglias just to make sure there\nIsn't a long destructive war. The\nOld days are over, this is 1946;\nNobody wants bloodshed anymore. If\nYour father dies...make the deal,\nSonny.\n\nSONNY\n(angry)\nThat's easy to say; it's not your\nFather.\n\nHAGEN\n(quietly)\nI was as good a son to him as you\nOr Mike.\n\nSONNY\nOh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it\nThat way.\n\nHAGEN\nWe're all tired...\n\nSONNY\nOK, we sit tight until the old man\nCan give us the lead. But Tom, I\nWant you to stay inside the Mall.\nYou too, Mike, no chances. Tessio,\nYou hold your people in reserve,\nBut have them nosing around the\nCity. The hospital is yours; I\nWant it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours\nA day.\n\nThere is a timid knock on the door.\n\nSONNY\nWhat is it?\n\nPAULIE GATTO looks in.\n\nCLEMENZA\nI tol' you to stay put, Paulie...\n\nPAULIE\nThe guy at the gate's outside...says\nThere's a package...\n\nSONNY\nTessio, see what it is.\n\nTESSIO gets up, leaves.\n\nPAULIE\nYou want me to hang around?\n\nSONNY\nYeah. Hang around.\n\nPAULIE\nOutside?\n\nCLEMENZA\nOutside.\n\nPAULIE\nSure.\n\nHe closes the door.\n\nSONNY\nClemenza. You take care of Paulie.\nI don't ever want to see him again.\nUnderstood?\n\nCLEMENZA\nUnderstood.\n\nSONNY\nOkay, now you can move your men\nInto the Mall, replace Tessio's\nPeople. Mike, tomorrow you take a\nCouple of Clemenza's people and go\nTo Luca's apartment and wait for\nHim to show. That crazy bastard\nMight be going after Sollozzo right\nNow if he's heard the news.\n\nHAGEN\nMaybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up\nIn this so directly. You know the\nOld man doesn't want that.\n\nSONNY\nOK forget it, just stay on the phone.\n\nMICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected. He dials Luca\nBrasi's number once again. The ring repeats, but no one\nAnswers.\n\nTESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest\nIn his hand. He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped\nInside.\n\nCLEMENZA\nA Sicilian message: Luca Brasi\nSleeps with the fishes.\n\nINT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)\n\nLUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we\nRemember him. BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.\nLUCA looks up at him.\n\nThen SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.\nLUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both\nClamp down as hard as they can. Suddenly, a garrote is\nThrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight. His\nFace begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally\nPurple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a\nFar more extreme way than a normal tongue could. His eyes\nBulge.\n\nONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's\nStrength leaves him.\n\nBRUNO\n(making an ugly face)\nOh Christ...all over the floor.\n\nSOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his\nFace.\n\nLUCA falls to the floor.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nThe Godfather is next.\n\n----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)\n\nMorning in a simple Brooklyn suburb. There are rows of\nPleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block. A\nDark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a\nNoticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell. This\nIs ROCCO LAMPONE. The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,\nTalks to him through the screen door, and then points to the\nSide of the house. ROCCO moves to the garage, which is\nSpecially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work\nWashing a shiny brand new Lincoln. LAMPONE admires the car.\n\nLAMPONE\nNice.\n\nCLEMENZA\nCrazy Detroit delivered it with a\nWooden bumper. They're going to\nSend me the chrome bumpers in a\nCouple months. I waited two years\nFor this car to come with wooden\nBumpers!\n\nHe scrubs and polishes with great affection.\n\nCLEMENZA\nToday you make your bones on Paulie.\nYou understand everything?\n\nLAMPONE\nSure.\n\nAs he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,\nUnwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.\n\nCLEMENZA\n.22 soft-nosed load. Accurate up\nTo five feet.\n\nLAMPONE expertly puts the gun away. GATTO's car pulls into\nThe driveway, and he sounds the horn.\n\nThe two men walk to the car. GATTO is driving, a bit\nNervous, like he doesn't know what is up. LAMPONE gets in\nThe rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of\nRecognition. He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting\nTo chide PAULIE for being late. PAULIE flinches a little\nWhen he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:\n\nPAULIE\nRocco, sit on the other side. A\nBig guy like you blocks my rearview\nMirror.\n\nCLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.\n\nCLEMENZA\nGoddamn Sonny. He's running scared.\nHe's already thinking of going to\nThe mattresses. We have to find a\nPlace on the West Side. Paulie,\nYou know a good location?\n\nPAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook\nHe was on. Also there's the money he can make by selling\nSollozzo any secret location.\n\nPAULIE\nI'll think about it.\n\nCLEMENZA\n(grunting)\nDrive while you thinking; I wanna\nGet to the City this month!\n\nThe car pulls out.\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)\n\nInside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump. OUR\nVIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter\nLight.\n\nINT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)\n\nInside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.\nHe tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of\nHim.\n\nCLEMENZA\nPay attention!\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car is parked in the City. PAULIE comes down from an\nAvailable apartment and gets back into the car.\n\nPAULIE\nGood for ten men...\n\nCLEMENZA\nOK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm\nSuppose to call when I found\nSomethin'.\n\nThe car pulls off.\n\nEXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nNew part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.\nCLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.\n\nCLEMENZA\nYou wait; I'll call.\n\nHe walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the\nCorner and enters the Luna Restaurant.\n\nINT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.\nThe WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some\nBread--and then a plate of veal on his table. He eats.\n\nEXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;\nHe is well fed.\n\nWe move with him around the corner, not knowing what to\nExpect has happened to Paulie.\n\nThere is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,\nLAMPONE in the rear seat. CLEMENZA steps in.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHe talked my ear off. Want us to\nGo back to Long Beach; have another\nJob for us. Rocco, you live in the\nCity, can we drop you off?\n\nLAMPONE (O.S.)\nAh, I left my car at your place.\n\nCLEMENZA\nOK, then you gotta come back.\n\nThe car pulls out. By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and\nSecure.\n\nPAULIE\nYou think we'll go for that last\nPlace?\n\nCLEMENZA\nMaybe, or you gotta know now.\n\nPAULIE\nHoly cow, I don't gotta know nothing.\n\nEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.\nInside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.\n\nCLEMENZA\nPaulie, pull over. I gotta take a\nLeak.\n\nThe car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds. CLEMENZA\nSteps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.\n\nHe turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer\nSee the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting\nThe ground. We wait on this for a moment; and then there\nAre two GUNSHOTS. CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and\nTurns, moving back to the car.\n\nPAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind\nHim are shattered.\n\nCLEMENZA\nLeave the gun.\n\nLAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few\nFeet where there is another car. They get in, and drive off.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nHIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL. It is late afternoon. Many strange\nCars are parked on the nearby streets. We can see the group\nOf BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries\nWith concealed weapons.\n\nMICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.\n\nHe is bundled in a warm marine coat. He looks at the\nStrange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe. They\nLook back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the\nRespect of his position. He is like an exile Prince. He\nWanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.\n\nA rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground\nEquipment. The basketball ring now half coming off. This\nIs where he was a child. Then a shout.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nMike. Hey Mikey; telephone.\n\nCLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window. MICHAEL\nHurries into the house.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.\nHe points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the\nHook.\n\nCLEMENZA\nSome dame.\n\nMICHAEL picks it up.\n\nMICHAEL\nHello. Kay?\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nHow is your father?\n\nMICHAEL\nHe'll be OK.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\n(pause)\nI love you.\n\nHe glances at the THUGS in the kitchen. Tries to shield the\nPhone.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nI LOVE YOU.\n\nMICHAEL\nYeah Kay, I'm here.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nCan you say it?\n\nMICHAEL\nHuh?\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nTell me you love me.\n\nMICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table. He curls\nUp in a corner, and in a quarter voice:\n\nMICHAEL\nI can't...\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nPlease say it.\n\nMICHAEL\nLook. I'll see you tonight, OK?\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nOK.\n(click)\n\nCLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all\nThe button men stationed around the house.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHow come you don't tell that nice\nGirl you love her...here, learn\nSomething... you may have to feed\nFifty guys some day. You start\nWith olive oil...fry some garlic,\nSee. And then fry some sausage...or meat\nBalls if you like...then you throw\nIn the tomatoes, the tomato\nPaste...some basil; and a little\nRed wine...that's my trick.\n\nSONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.\n\nSONNY\nYou take care of Paulie?\n\nCLEMENZA\nYou won't see Paulie anymore. He's\nSick for good this winter.\n\nMICHAEL starts to leave.\n\nSONNY\nWhere are you going?\n\nMICHAEL\nTo the city.\n\nSONNY\n(to Clemenza; dipping\nBread into the sauce)\nSend some bodyguards.\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't need them, Sonny. I'm just\nGoing to see Pop in the hospital.\nAlso, I got other things.\n\nCLEMENZA\nSollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.\n\nSONNY\nOK, but be careful.\n\nEXT NITE: CAR\n\nMICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven\nInto the city. THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front\nSeat.\n\nINT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY\n\nMICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying\nTo book rooms.\n\nINT NITE: HOTEL\n\nMICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel. He is\nPreoccupied, she's concerned.\n\nMICHAEL\nVisiting hour ends at eight thirty.\nI'll just sit with him; I want to\nShow respect.\n\nKAY\nCan I go to the hospital with you?\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't think so. You don't want\nTo end up on page 3 of the Daily\nNews.\n\nKAY\nMy parents don't read the Daily\nNews. All right, if you think I\nShouldn't. I can't believe the\nThings the papers are printing.\nI'm sure most of it's not true.\n\nMICHAEL\nI don't think so either.\n(silence)\nI better go.\n\nKAY\nWhen will I see you again?\n\nMICHAEL\nI want you to go back to New\nHampshire...think things over.\n\nHe leans over her; kisses her.\n\nKAY\nWhen will I see you again?\n\nMICHAEL\nGoodbye.\n\nQuietly, he moves out the door.\n\nKAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:\n\nKAY\nGoodbye.\n\nEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\n\nA taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with\nA neon sign \"HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY.\" MICHAEL steps out, pays\nThe fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.\n\nMICHAEL looks.\n\nHe sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted. He\nIs the only one on the street. There are gay, twinkling\nChristmas decorations all over the building. He walks,\nSlowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps. He\nHesitates, looks around. This area is empty. He checks the\nAddress on a scrap of paper. It is correct. He tries the\nDoor, it is empty.\n\nHe walks in.\n\nINT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital\nLobby. He looks to the right; there is a long, empty\nCorridor. To the left: the same.\n\nHIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated\nBuilding lit by eerie green neon lighting. All we hear are\nHis sole footsteps.\n\nHe walks up to a desk marked \"INFORMATION\". No one is there.\nHe moves quickly to a door marked \"OFFICE\"; swings into it;\nNo one is there. He looks onto the desk: There is half a\nSandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.\n\nMICHAEL\nHello? Hello?\n\nNow he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,\nAlertly. MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all\nAlone. The floors have just been mopped. They are still wet.\n\nINT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS\n\nNow he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several\nFlights.\n\nINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR\n\nHe steps out onto the fourth floor. He looks. There are\nMerely empty corridors. He takes out his scrap of paper;\nChecks it. \"Room 4A.\" Now he hurries, trying to follow the\nCode of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker\nAnd quicker they flash by him. Now he stops, looks up \"4A--\nCorleone\".\n\nThere is a special card table set up there with some\nMagazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the\nAshtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A\n\nSlowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he\nWill find. He looks. Lit by the moonlight through the\nWindow, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the\nRoom, and under a transparent oxygen tent. All that can be\nHeard is the steady though strained breathing. Slowly\nMICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,\nSecurely asleep. Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the\nBed, and run to his nose and mouth.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nThis startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around. It is a\nNURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.\n\nNURSE\nYou're not supposed to be here now.\n\nMICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm Michael Corleone--this is my\nFather. What happened to the\nDetectives who were guarding him?\n\nNURSE\nOh your father just had too many\nVisitors. It interfered with the\nHospital service. The police came\nAnd made them all leave just ten\nMinutes ago.\n(comfortingly)\nBut don't worry. I look in on him.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou just stand here one minute...\n\nQuickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.\n\nMICHAEL\nSonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm\nDown at the hospital. I came down\nLate. There's no one here. None\nOf Tessio's people--no detectives,\nNo one. The old man is completely\nUnprotected.\n\nSONNY (O.S.)\nAll right, get him in a different\nRoom; lock the door from the inside.\nI'll have some men there inside of\nFifteen minutes. Sit tight, and\nDon't panic.\n\nMICHAEL\n(furiously, but kept inside)\nI won't panic.\n\nHe hangs up; returns to the NURSE...\n\nNURSE\nYou cannot stay here...I'm sorry.\n\nMICHAEL\n(coldly)\nYou and I are going to move my\nFather right now...to another room\nOn another floor...Can you\nDisconnect those tubes so we can\nWheel the bed out?\n\nNURSE\nAbsolutely not! We have to get\nPermission from the Doctor.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou've read about my father in the\nPapers. You've seen that no one's\nHere to guard him. Now I've just\nGotten word that men are coming to\nThis hospital to kill him. Believe\nMe and help me.\n\nNURSE\n(frightened)\nWe don't have to disconnect them,\nWe can wheel the stand with the bed.\n\nShe does so...and they perform the very difficult task of\nMoving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.\n\nINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\n\nThey roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently\nDown the corridor. We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.\nMICHAEL hears them, stops.\n\nMICHAEL\nHurry, into there.\n\nThey push it into the first available room. MICHAEL peeks\nOut from the door. The footsteps are louder; then they\nEmerge. It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet\nOf flowers.\n\nMICHAEL\n(stepping out)\nWho is it?\n\nENZO\nMichael...do you remember me, Enzo,\nThe baker's helper to Nazorine, now\nHis son-in-law.\n\nMICHAEL\nEnzo, get out of here. There's\nGoing to be trouble.\n\nA look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.\n\nENZO\nIf there...will be trouble...I stay\nWith you, to help. I owe it to the\nGodfather.\n\nMICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.\n\nMICHAEL\nGo outside; stand in front...I'll\nBe out in a minute.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nThey part. MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they\nPut his FATHER.\n\nNURSE\n(frightened)\nHe's awake.\n\nMICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he\nCannot speak. MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.\n\nMICHAEL\nPop...Pop, it's me Michael. Shhhh,\nDon't try to speak. There are men\nWho are coming to try to kill you.\nBut I'm with you...I'm with you\nNow...\n\nThe OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot. MICHAEL tenderly\nPuts his finger to his FATHER's lips.\n\nEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)\n\nOutside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,\nPacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only\nWeapon. MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him. They\nBoth stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.\nThey are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,\nLights it. ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.\n\nMICHAEL\nGet rid of those and look like\nYou've got a gun in your pocket.\n\nThe windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas\nDecorations.\n\nMICHAEL\nListen...\n\nWe HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming. MICHAEL\nAnd ENZO look with fear in their eyes. Then MICHAEL takes\nThe bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.\nThey stand, hands in their pockets.\n\nA long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.\nMICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive. The car\nSeems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.\nMICHAEL and ENZO are relieved. MICHAEL looks down; the\nBAKER's hands are shaking. He looks at his own, and they\nAre not.\n\nAnother moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of\nPolice sirens. They are clearly coming toward the hospital,\nGetting louder and louder. MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.\n\nIn a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of\nThe hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed\nPOLICE and DETECTIVES. He smiles his relief and starts\nToward them. TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his\nArms while ANOTHER frisks him. A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,\nSpattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,\nWith beefy red face and white hair seems furious. This is\nMcCLUSKEY.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nI thought I got all you guinea\nHoods locked up. Who the hell are\nYou and what are you doing here?\n\nANOTHER COP standing nearby:\n\nCOP\nHe's clean, Captain.\n\nMICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly)\nWhat happened to the detectives who\nWere supposed to be guarding my\nFather?\n\nMCCLUSKEY\n(furious)\nYou punk-hood. Who the hell are\nYou to tell me my business. I\nPulled them off. I don't care how\nMany Dago gangsters kill each other.\nI wouldn't lift a finger to keep\nYour old man from getting knocked\nOff. Now get the hell out of here;\nGet off this street you punk, and\nStay away from this hospital.\n\nMICHAEL stands quiet.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll stay until you put guards\nAround my father's room.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nPhil, lock this punk up.\n\nA DETECTIVE\nThe Kid's clean, Captain...He's a\nWar hero, and he's never been mixed\nUp in the rackets...\n\nMCCLUSKEY\n(furious)\nGoddam it, I said lock him up. Put\nThe cuffs on him.\n\nMICHAEL\n(deliberately, right\nTo McCLUSKEY's face,\nAs he's being handcuffed)\nHow much is the Turk paying you to\nSet my father up, Captain?\n\nWithout any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL\nSquarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.\nMICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw. He looks at\nMcCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and\nHe falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S\nMEN arrive.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\n\nHIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL. The gateway now has a\nLong black car blocking it. There are more BUTTON MEN\nStationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying\nRifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN\nStanding by open windows. It is clear that the war is\nEscalating. A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,\nMICHAEL and HAGEN. MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged. He\nStops and looks up at the open window. We can see MEN\nHolding rifles.\n\nMICHAEL\nChrist, Sonny really means business.\n\nThey continue walking. TESSIO joins them. The various\nBODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.\n\nCLEMENZA\nHow come all the new men?\n\nTESSIO\nWe'll need them now. After the\nHospital incident, Sonny got mad.\nWe hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock\nThis morning.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY\n\nThey enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nSONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.\n\nSONNY\nI've got a hundred button men on\nThe streets twenty-four hours a day.\nIf Sollozzo shows one hair on his\nAss he's dead.\n\nHe sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,\nKiddingly.\n\nSONNY\nMikey, you look beautiful!\n\nMICHAEL\nCut it out.\n\nSONNY\nThe Turk wants to talk! The nerve\nOf that son of a bitch! After he\nCraps out last night he wants a meet.\n\nHAGEN\nWas there a definite proposal?\n\nSONNY\nSure, he wants us to send Mike to\nMeet him to hear his proposition.\nThe promise is the deal will be so\nGood we can't refuse.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about that Tattaglias? What\nWill they do about Bruno?\n\nSONNY\nPart of the deal: Bruno cancels out\nWhat they did to my father.\n\nHAGEN\nWe should hear what they have to say.\n\nSONNY\nNo, no Consiglere. Not this time.\nNo more meetings, no more\nDiscussions, no more Sollozzo\nTricks. Give them one message: I\nWANT SOLLOZZO. If not, it's all\nOut war. We go to the mattresses\nAnd we put all the button men out\nOn the street.\n\nHAGEN\nThe other families won't sit still\nFor all out war.\n\nSONNY\nThen THEY hand me Sollozzo.\n\nHAGEN\nCome ON Sonny, your father wouldn't\nWant to hear this. This is not a\nPersonal thing, this is Business.\n\nSONNY\nAnd when they shot me father...\n\nHAGEN\nYes, even the shooting of your\nFather was business, not personal...\n\nSONNY\nNo no, no more advice on how to\nPatch it up Tom. You just help me\nWin. Understood?\n\nHAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.\n\nHAGEN\nI found out about this Captain\nMcCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.\nHe's definitely on Sollozzo's\nPayroll, and for big money.\nMcCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's\nBodyguard. What you have to\nUnderstand is that while Sollozzo\nIs guarded like this, he's\nInvulnerable. Nobody has ever\nGunned down a New York Police\nCaptain. Never. It would be\nDisastrous. All the five families\nWould come after you Sonny; the\nCorleone family would be outcasts;\nEven the old man's political\nProtection would run for cover. So\nJust...take that into consideration.\n\nSONNY\n(still fuming)\nMcCluskey can't stay with the Turk\nForever. We'll wait.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe can't wait. No matter what\nSollozzo say about a deal, he's\nFiguring out how to kill Pop. You\nHave to get Sollozzo now.\n\nSONNY\nThe kid's right.\n\nHAGEN\nWhat about McCluskey?\n\nMICHAEL\nLet's say now that we have to kill\nMcCluskey. We'll clear that up\nThrough our Newspaper contacts later.\n\nSONNY\nGo on Mike.\n\nMICHAEL\nThey want me to go to the conference\nWith Sollozzo. Set up the meeting\nFor two days from now. Sonny, get\nOur informers to find out where the\nMeeting will be held.\nInsist it has to be a public place:\nA bar or restaurant at the height\nOf the dinner hour. So I'll feel\nSafe. They'll check me when I meet\nThem so I won't be able to carry a\nWeapon; but Clemenza, figure out a\nWay to have one planted there for\nMe.\n(pause)\nThen I'll kill them both.\n\nEveryone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.\nSilence. SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter. He points\nA finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.\n\nSONNY\nYou? You, the high-class college\nKid. You never wanted to get mixed\nUp in the family business. Now you\nWanta gun down a police Captain and\nThe Turk just because you got\nSlapped in the face. You're taking\nIt personal, it's just business and\nHe's taking it personal.\n\nNow CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps\nHis face serious.\n\nMICHAEL\n(angrily, but cold)\nSonny, it's all personal, and I\nLearned it from him, the old man,\nThe Godfather. He took my joining\nThe Marines personal. I take\nSollozzo trying to kill my father\nPersonal, and you know I'll kill\nThem Sonny.\n\nMICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.\n\nINT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nCLOSE on a revolver.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nIt's as cold as they come,\nImpossible to trace.\n(he turns it upside down)\nDon't worry about prints Mike, I\nPut a special tape on the trigger\nAnd butt. Here.\n(he hands the gun to\nAnother pair of hands)\nWhatsamatter? Trigger too tight.\n(it fires: very LOUD)\nI left it noisy, so it'll scare any\nPain-in-the-neck innocent bystander\nAway.\n\nMICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.\n\nCLEMENZA\nJust let your hand drop to your\nSide, and let the gun slip out.\nEverybody will still think you got\nIt. They'll be starin' at your\nFace, see? Then walk out of the\nPlace real fast, but don't run.\nDon't look anybody directly in the\nEye, but don't look away from them\nNeither. Hey, they'll be scared\nStiff o you, believe me. Nobody's\nGonna bother with you. Don't worry\nAbout nothing; you'd be surprised\nHow good these things go. O.K.,\nPut your hat on, let's see how you\nLook. Helps with identification.\n\nThey put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.\n\nCLEMENZA\nMostly it gives witnesses an excuse\nTo change their identification when\nWe make them see the light. Then\nYou take a long vacation and we\nCatch the hell.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow bad will it be?\n\nCLEMENZA\nProbably all the other families\nWill line up against us. But, it's\nAlright. These things have to\nHappen once every ten years or\nSo...gets rid of the bad blood.\nYou gotta stop 'em at the beginning.\nLike they shoulda stopped Hitler at\nMunich, they shoulda never let him\nGet away with that, they were just\nAsking for big trouble...\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house. A card\nTable is set up with a man playing cards with three of the\nCorleone buttonmen.\n\nHe continues into the living room. It's a mess. SONNY\nAsleep on the sofa. On the coffee table are the remains of\nA take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of\nWhisky. The radio is playing.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy don't you stop living like a\nBum and get this place cleaned up.\n\nSONNY\nWhat are you, inspecting the\nBarracks?\n(SONNY sits up with\nHis head in his hands)\nYou ready? Did Clemenza tell you\nBe sure to drop the gun right away?\n\nMICHAEL\nA million times.\n\nSONNY\nSollozzo and McCluskey are going to\nPick you up in an hour and a half\nOn Times Square, under the big\nCamels sign.\n\nHAGEN\nWe don't let Mike go until we have\nThe hostage, Sonny.\n\nCLEMENZA\nIt's okay...the hostage is outside\nPlaying pinochle with three of my\nMen.\n\nThe phone rings in the DON's office.\n\nSONNY\nThat could be a Tattaglia informer\nWith the meeting place.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nHAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS\nMove in.\n\nHAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.\n\nSONNY\nOne of Tattaglia's people?\n\nHAGEN\nNo. Our informer in McCluskey's\nPrecinct. Tonight at 8:00 he\nSigned out for Louis' Restaurant in\nThe Bronx. Anyone know it.\n\nTESSIO\nSure, I do. It's perfect for us.\nA small family place with big\nBooths where people can talk in\nPrivate. Good food. Everybody\nMinds their business. Perfect.\n(he moves to the desk\nAnd makes a crude drawing)\nThis is the entrance, Mike. When\nYou finish just walk out and turn\nLeft, then turn the corner.\nClemenza, you gotta work fast to\nPlant the gun. They got an old-\nFashioned toilet with a space\nBetween the water container and the\nWall. We can tape the gun behind\nThere.\n\nCLEMENZA\nMike, they're gonna frisk you in\nThe car. You'll be clean so they\nWon't worry 'bout nothing. In the\nRestaurant, wait and talk a while,\nAnd then ask permission to go. See?\nThen when you come out, don't waste\nTime; don't sit down...you come out\nBlasting. And don't take chances.\nIn the head, two shots apiece. And\nOut as fast as your legs can move.\n\nSONNY\nI want somebody very good, very\nSafe to plant that gun. I don't\nWant my brother coming out of that\nToilet with just his dick in his\nHand.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThe gun will be there.\n\nSONNY\n(to MICHAEL, warmly)\nYou're on, kid...I'll square it\nWith Mom your not seeing her before\nYou left. And I'll get a message\nTo your girl friend when I think\nThe time is right.\n\nCLEMENZA\nWe gotta move...\n\nMICHAEL\nO.K. How long do you think before\nI can come back?\n\nSONNY\nProbably a year...\n\nHAGEN\n(starting to crack)\nJesus, I don't know...\n\nSONNY\nCan you do it Mike?\n\nMICHAEL moves out.\n\nEXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe enormous \"CAMELS\" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands\nMICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat\nCLEMENZA had given him. A long black car pulls around the\nCorner and slows before him. The DRIVER, leaning over, open\nThe front door.\n\nDRIVER\nGet in, Mike.\n\nHe does, the car drives off.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nInside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat\nAnd shakes MIKE's hand.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we\nCan straighten everything out. All\nThis is terrible, it's not the way\nI wanted things to happen at all.\nIt should never have happened.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want to settle things tonight. I\nWant my father left alone.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nHe won't be; I swear to you be my\nChildren he won't be. Just keep an\nOpen mind when we talk. I hope\nYou're not a hothead like your\nBrother, Sonny. It's impossible to\nTalk business with him.\n\nMcCLUSKEY grunts.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nHe's a good kid. He's all right.\nTurn around, up on your knees,\nFacing me.\n\nHe gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nI'm sorry about the other night\nMike. I'm getting too old for my\nJob, too grouchy. Can't stand the\nAggravation. You know how it is.\nHe's clean.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where\nThey're heading.\n\nThe car takes the George Washington Bridge. MICHAEL is\nConcerned.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe're going to New Jersey?\n\nSOLLOZZO\n(sly)\nMaybe.\n\nMICHAEL closes his eyes.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way\nTo New Jersey. Then suddenly it hits the divider,\nTemporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the\nLanes going back to New York. It then hits it very fast, on\nThe way back to the city.\n\nEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nSOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and\nThen leans to the DRIVER.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nNice work; I'll remember it.\n\nMICHAEL is relieved.\n\nEXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\n\nThe car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in\nThe Bronx: The \"LUNA AZURA\". There is no one on the street.\nMICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with\nThem. He gets out, and opens the door. SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY\nAnd MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the\nCar. They enter the restaurant.\n\nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n\nA very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.\nSOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small\nRound table near the center of the room. There are empty\nBooths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,\nAnd ONE or TWO WAITERS. It is very quiet.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nIs the Italian food good here?\n\nSOLLOZZO\nTry the veal; it's the finest in\nNew York.\n\nThe solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.\nThey watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three\nGlasses. Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:\n\nSOLLOZZO\nI am going to talk Italian to Mike.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nSure, you two go right ahead; I'll\nConcentrate on my veal and my\nSpaghetti.\n\nSOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian. MICHAEL listening\nCarefully and nodding every so often. Then MICHAEL answers\nIn Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on. The WAITER occasionally\nBrings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.\nThen MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in\nItalian, accidentally lapses into English.\n\nMICHAEL\n(using English for emphasis)\nMost important...I want a sure\nGuarantee that no more attempts\nWill be made on my father's life.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nWhat guarantees can I give you? I\nAm the hunted one. I've missed my\nChance. You think too highly of\nMe, my friend...I am not so\nClever...all I want if a truce...\n\nMICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling\nHolding his open hands up as if to say: \"I have no tricks up\nMy sleeve\". Then he looks away and makes a distressed look\nOn his face.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nWhat is it?\n\nMICHAEL\nIs it all right if I go to the\nBathroom?\n\nSOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious. He studies MICHAEL with\nHis dark eyes. Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's\nThigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.\n\nMCCLUSKEY\nI frisked him; I've frisked\nThousands of young punks; he's clean.\n\nHe looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;\nIndicating the bathroom with his eyes. The MAN nods,\nIndicating no one is there.\n\nSOLLOZZO\nDon't take too long.\n\nMICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and\nDisappears inside.\n\nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)\n\nMICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very\nHard. He actually uses the urinal. Then he washes his\nHands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.\nThen he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.\nSlowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he\nCannot feel the gun. We see behind the tank his hand is\nJust a few inches from the gun...he gropes\nSearchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.\n\nCLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him. Then he\nBreaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep\nBreath and shoves it under his waistband. For some\nUnexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately\nWashes his hands and dries them. Then he goes out.\n\nINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n\nHe hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.\nMcCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal. SOLLOZZO\nTurns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at\nMICHAEL. MICHAEL looks back. Then he smiles and continues\nBack to the table. He sits down.\n\nMICHAEL\nNow I can talk. I feel much better.\n\nThe MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now\nHe too relaxes. SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down\nComfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton\nHis jacket. SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again\nBut MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear\nHim.\n\nThe WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to\nSpeak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away\nFrom him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts\nThe gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his\nTemple. He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's\nHead blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the\nEntire area.\n\nThe WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is\nSprayed and stained with blood.\n\nSOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he\nSeems to hang in space suspended.\n\nMICHAEL pivots, and looks:\n\nThere is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal\nSuspended in air before his gaping mouth.\n\nMICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging\nThroat. He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound. Then\nCoolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right\nThrough McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.\n\nThe air is filled with pink mist.\nMICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.\nHe does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.\nNow he carefully shows his hands to be empty.\nThe WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an\nExpression of horror on his face.\nMICHAEL looks at his two victims:\nSOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by\nThe table.\nMcCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.\nMICHAEL is wildly at a peak. He starts to move out. His\nHand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.\nHe moves, not letting the gun go.\n\nMICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.\n\nHis hand: still holding the gun.\n\nHis face: finally he closes his eyes.\n\nHis hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.\n\nHe walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.\n\nHe sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had\nBeen recreated in wax.\n\nThen he leaves.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old\nUpright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.\nANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.\n\nA little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,\nQuietly eating. They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there\nIs an occasional laugh.\n\nROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered\nWith a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.\n\nA large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.\n\nThe sentimental tune is continued over the following:\n\nINT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie\nStill together in a bullet-riddled automobile.\n\nINT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.\n\nINT DAY: MATTRESS\n\nTen mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty\nLiving room of an apartment. THREE or FOUR MEN including\nCLEMENZA, are taking naps.\n\nAn arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.\n\nThe MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and\nPouring the wine.\n\nTrash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.\n\nINT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an\nOffice building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.\nTruman.\n\nEXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)\n\nANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning\nThree steps of a front stoop.\n\nINT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nTESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a\nCrossword puzzle.\n\nA thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.\n\nSix or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.\nCoffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.\n\nA MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of\nRuffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.\n\nEXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)\n\nA CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet\nAlley.\n\nINT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)\n\nA MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in\nA pool of blood on the tablecloth.\n\nINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n\nA neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an\nApartment. We catch a glimpse of one headline: \"Five Family\nWar...\"\n\nThe table. The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts. ONE\nHas fallen asleep on his arms at the table.\n\nSEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.\n\nThe PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse. Picks up\nAnd takes a drag from his cigarette. The OTHER MAN nods\nAppreciatively.\n\nMAN\nNice Augie...nice.\n\nEXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)\n\nSeveral cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York\nApartment building. We recognize a couple of SONNY's\nBodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards\nAgainst the curb.\n\nInside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of\nBrass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.\n\nUp one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,\nSmoking a cigarette.\n\nOne of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,\nWhich is attached to a key chain. We HEAR the sound of a\nDoor opening; they look up.\n\nThe man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.\n\nSONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI\nWrapped around him. She doesn't want to let go of him; she\nDraws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he\nComes out alone, adjusting his clothes.\n\nHe jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard\nOn the first floor, and moves outside toward his car. The\nMen quickly take up their positions. As he gets in his car:\n\nDRIVER\nPick up your sister?\n\nSONNY\nYeah.\n\nThe car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the\nBodyguards in their cars.\n\nINT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)\n\nHe knocks on the door. No answer. Then again.\n\nCONNIE'S VOICE\nWho is it?\n\nSONNY\nIt's me, Sonny.\n\nWe hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. SONNY\nEnters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her\nBack to him.\n\nSONNY\n(tenderly)\nConnie, what is it?\n\nHe turns her around in his arms.\n\nHer face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her\nRough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.\nAs soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red\nWith rage. She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing\nHim from running out of the apartment.\n\nCONNIE\n(desperately)\nIt was my fault! I started a fight\nWith him and I tried to hit him so\nHe hit me. He didn't even try to\nHit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.\n\nSonny listens, and calms himself. He touches her shoulder,\nThe thin silk robe.\n\nSONNY\nI'm goin' to have the doctor come\nOver and take a look at you.\n\nHe starts to leave.\n\nCONNIE\nOh Sonny, please don't do anything.\nPlease don't.\n\nHe stops, and then laughs good naturedly.\n\nSONNY\nHey. Con. What'm I goin' to do?\nMake your kid a orphan before he's\nBorn.\n\nShe laughs with him. He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.\n\nEXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET\n\nCARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.\n\"Book\" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking\nBeer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the\nCorner. The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the\nKids on the street are still playing stickball.\n\nCARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street\nSuddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block\nAnd to a halt in front of the candy store. The tires\nScream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a\nMAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast\nThe everyone is paralyzed. It is a moment before we\nRecognize that it is SONNY.\n\nHis face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on\nThe stoop and has CARLO by the throat.\n\nHe pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down\nInto the street. But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,\nAnd hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to\nHide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.\nHis shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.\n\nSALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.\n\nSONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,\nIn a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing. His\nBlows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.\n\nThe kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching\nIn fascination.\n\nCARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.\n\nSONNY beats him mercilessly.\n\nNow SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become\nSpectators.\n\nSONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into\nCARLO's face and body.\n\nCARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does\nNothing, other than hang onto the railing.\n\nSONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag\nHim off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in\nThe effort. Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;\nEven biting them. CARLO screams but he does not let go.\n\nIt's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will\nNot be moved. SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him\nMore; but he is exhausted. Totally out of breath, he\nStammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.\n\nSONNY\nYou...bastard...You...hurt my\nSister... again...and I'll\nKill...you.\n\nHe wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.\nAnd hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,\nLeaving even his bodyguards in confusion. We notice ONE MAN\nWith a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially\nInterested.\n\nCARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands. He slumps\nOnto the stoop.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nHIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall. It is a gray, rainy day.\nYoung BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of\nVarious points around the main house and compound. Things\nHave changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new\nAnd secure gate house has been built. Security measures\nThat had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made\nA permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval\nFortress. We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the\nResult of a recent bomb attempt. The house nearest the\nCrater is damaged by fire.\n\nA taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright\nYellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the\nShelter of the gate house.\n\nThey are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they\nCall the main house.\n\nKAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still\nRuns down onto her face.\n\nShe notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the\nSullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.\n\nTOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.\n\nHAGEN\nKay, we weren't expecting you. You\nShould call...\n\nKAY\nI've tried calling and writing. I\nWant to reach Michael.\n\nHAGEN\nNobody knows where he is. We know\nHe's all right, but that's all.\n\nKAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with\nRainwater.\n\nKAY\nWhat was that?\n\nHAGEN\nAn accident. No one was hurt.\n\nKAY\nListen Tom, I let my cab go; can I\nCome in to call another one?\n\nTOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has\nTo.\n\nHAGEN\nSure...I'm sorry.\n\nThey hurry through the rain and into the Main House.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nIn the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and\nTakes her rainhat off.\n\nKAY\nWill you give this to him.\n\nHAGEN\nIf I accept that letter and you\nTold a Court of Law I accepted it,\nThey would interpret it as my\nHaving knowledge of his whereabouts.\nJust wait Kay, he'll contact you.\n\nWe hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE\nEnters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.\n\nMAMA\nYou're Mikey's little girl.\n\nKAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.\n\nMAMA\nYou eat anything?\n\nKAY shakes her head.\n\nMAMA\n(to HAGEN)\nDisgrazia, you don't even give the\nPoor girl a cup of coffee?\n\nHAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves\nToward MAMA, the letter extended.\n\nKAY\nWill you give this letter to Michael.\n\nHAGEN\nMama, no.\n\nMAMA\nYou tell me what to do? Even he\nDon't tell me what to do.\n\nShe takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.\n\nKAY\nWhy did they blame Michael?\n\nMAMA\nYou listen to me, you go home to\nYour family, and you find a good\nYoung man and get married. Forget\nAbout Mikey; he's no good for you,\nAnymore.\n\nShe looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what\nThat means.\n\nEXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)\n\nA hospital in New York City. POLICE and teams of PRIVATE\nDETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area. An ambulance\nWith a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the\nHospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL\nASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying\nThe DON.\n\nTESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing\nUp the rear. HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a\nMoment they disappear behind the ambulance. Then suddenly,\nSiren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung\nCars.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe Corleone Mall.\n\nEqually impressive security stands ready at the Corleone\nMall. EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE\nDETECTIVES.\n\nIt all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.\nAll is silent. The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday\nClothes, wait.\n\nEXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)\n\nOne ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,\nPreceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a\nTeam of BUTTON MEN.\n\nSitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with\nA rifle on his lap.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nInside the Main CORLEONE House:\n\nHospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully\nUnder the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and\nVarious GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.\n\nAll the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,\nTHERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but\nBeen converted into a hospital room, with complete and\nExtensive equipment. The various CHILDREN get a turn to\nKiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then\nSONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO\nShould leave.\n\nThey do, the door is closed.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the\nSunday dinner, and set the table.\n\nCARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.\n\nCONNIE\nWhat's the matter, Carlo?\n\nCARLO\nShut up.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nAll the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with\nGrim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN. The DON\nDoes not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and\nGlances, as clearly as if they were verbalized. HAGEN is\nThe spokesman for the family.\n\nHAGEN\n...since McCluskey's killing, the\nPolice have cracked down on most of\nOur operations...on the other\nFamilies too. There's been a lot\nOf bad blood.\n\nThe OLD MAN glances at SONNY.\n\nSONNY\nPop, they hit us and we hit them\nBack.\n\nHAGEN\nWe put out a lot of material\nThrough our contacts in the\nNewspapers...about McCluskey's\nBeing tied up with Sollozzo in the\nDrug Rackets...things are starting\nTo loosen up.\n\nThe OLD MAN nods.\n\nSONNY\nFreddie's gonna go to Las\nVegas...under the protection of Don\nFrancesco of L.A. I want him to\nRest...\n\nFREDO\nI'm goin' to learn the casino\nBusiness.\n\nThe DON nods approvingly. Then he searches around the room\nFor a face he does not see. HAGEN knows who he's looking for.\n\nHAGEN\nMichael...\n(he takes a breath)\nIt was Michael who killed Sollozzo.\n\nThe DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and\nRage.\n\nHAGEN\nHe's safe now...we're already\nWorking on ways to bring him back.\n\nThe DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they\nLeave him alone.\n\nINT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nHAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is\nExpansive and optimistic.\n\nSONNY\nWe'll let the old man take it easy\nFor a couple of weeks. I want to\nGet things going good before he\nGets better. What's the matter\nWith you?\n\nHAGEN\nYou start operating, the five\nFamilies will start their raids\nAgain. We're at a stalemate Sonny,\nYour war is costing us a lot of\nMoney.\n\nSONNY\nNo more stalemate Tom, we got the\nSoldiers, we'll match them gun for\nGun if that's how they want it.\nThey know me for what I am, Tom--\nAnd they're scared of me.\n\nHAGEN\nYes. That's true, you're getting a\nHell of a reputation.\n\nSONNY\nWell it's war! We might not be in\nThis shape if we had a real war-\nTime Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop\nHad Genco, who do I have?\n(TOM starts to leave)\nHey Tom, hey...hey. It's Sunday,\nWe're gonna have dinner. Don't be\nSore.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table\nOver Sunday dinner. SONNY is at the head of the table.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)\n\nSOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed\nMall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally\nBy the gate.\n\nONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house. A\nYoung BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.\n\n-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------\n\nINT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)\n\nCONNIE and CARLO's apartment. She's in a slip, on the phone.\nWe HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.\n\nCONNIE\nWho is this?\n\nGIRL (O.S.)\n(giggle)\nI'm a friend of Carlo's. I just\nWanted to tell him I can't see him\nTonight; I have to go out of town.\n\nCONNIE's face turns red.\n\nCONNIE\nYou lousy tramp bitch.\n(click)\n\nShe slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the\nBathroom drying his golden body.\n\nCARLO\nWhat was that?\n\nCONNIE\nYour girl friend. She says she\nCan't make it tonight. You lousy\nBastard you have the nerve to give\nYour whores my telephone number.\nI'll kill you, you bastard!\n\nShe hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then\nShe flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy\nBelly heaving under the thin slip.\n\nCARLO\n(defending himself)\nYou're crazy. She was kidding\nAround; I don't know, some nut.\n\nHe pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue\nDressing.\n\nCONNIE\nYou're staying home. You're not\nGoing out.\n\nCARLO\nOK, OK. You gonna make me something\nTo eat at least?\n\nThat calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing\nHeavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and\nStarts her wifely duties.\n\nCARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in\nThe doorway.\n\nCONNIE\nThe food is on the table.\n\nCARLO\nI'm not hungry yet.\n\nCONNIE\nEat it, it's on the table.\n\nCARLO\nBa Fa Goulle.\n\nCONNIE\nBA FA GOULE YOU!\n\nShe turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen. A moment\nLater we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking. CARLO\nSlowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically\nSmashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy\nVeal and peppers all over the apartment floor.\n\nCARLO\nYou filthy guinea spoiled brat.\nClean it up or I'll kick your head\nIn.\n\nCONNIE\nLike hell I will.\n\nShe stands there, solid, ready to punch him again. Slowly,\nHe slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in\nHis hand.\n\nCARLO\nClean it up!\n\nHe swings the belt against her heavy hips. She moves back\nInto the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it\nReady.\n\nCARLO\nEven the female Corleones are\nMurderers.\n\nHe puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her. She\nMakes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids. He\nPulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process. She\nGets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,\nGets her; and starts to slap her in the face.\n\nShe breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.\n\nCONNIE\nThe baby! The baby!\n\nINT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nShe runs into the bedroom; he follows. She moves into a\nCorner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide\nUnder the bed.\n\nHe reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.\n\nHe slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he\nThrows her on the bed, contemptuously. He grabs part of her\nThigh, pinching it very hard.\n\nCARLO\nYou're fat as a pig.\n\nThen he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving\nHer in tears. She is crying; she pulls herself to the\nBedroom phone, and in a whisper:\n\nCONNIE\nMama...mama, it's Connie. Mama, I\nCan't talk any louder. No, I don't\nWant to talk to Sonny.\n\nWe can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)\n\nIn the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the\nWhispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.\n\nSONNY\nYeah Connie.\n\nCONNIE (O.S.)\nSonny, just send a car to bring me\nHome. I'll tell you then, it's\nNothing Sonny, don't you come.\nSend TOM, please Sonny, it's\nNothing; I just want to come home.\n\nSONNY's face is turning red.\n\nSONNY\n(in a controlled voice)\nYou wait there. You just wait there.\n\nHe hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.\n\nSONNY\n(quietly)\nThat sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...\n\nHAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he\nCannot interfere.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL\n\nSONNY leaves the house. HAGEN moves to the outside mall\nJust as SONNY's car is driving off. He moves to a group of\nBUTTON MEN.\n\nHAGEN\nGo after him.\n\nEXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)\n\nSONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.\nAfter a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is\nTrailing.\n\nSONNY is driving; he is very angry.\n\nEXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\nSONNY in his car; driving back. Still breathing hard and\nStill furious. Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.\nHe starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a\nToll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the\nCOLLECTOR.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT\n\nThe serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nThis is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for\nDon Corleone, at his request.\n\nBONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.\nBONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.\n\nBONASERA\nYes, I understand. I'm listening.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nYou owe the Don a service. In one\nHour, not before, perhaps later, he\nWill be at your funeral parlor to\nAsk for your help. Be there to\nGreet him. If you have any\nObjections speak now, and I'll\nInform him.\n\nSilence. BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.\n\nBONASERA\nAnything...Anything the Godfather\nWishes.\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nGood. He never doubted you.\n\nBONASERA\nThe Don himself is coming to me\nTonight?\n\nHAGEN (O.S.)\nYes.\n(click)\n\nBONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE\nSees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.\n\nSilently, he begins the ritual of dressing. His WIFE knows\nSomething serious is happening, and never takes her eyes\nFrom him. He lights a cigarette.\n\nBONASERA\nFor the last year, they have been\nKilling one another. So now, what?\nYour Godfather comes to me...Why?\n(whispering, slyly)\nThey've killed someone so important\nThat they wish to make his body\nDisappear.\n\nMRS. BONASERA\n(frightened)\nAmerigo!\n\nBONASERA\nThey could make me an accomplice to\nTheir murder. They could send me\nTo jail!\n\nHe slips into his trousers. Then he moves to his WIFE to\nTie his tie, as she has done for years.\n\nBONASERA\nAnd if the other families find\nOut...they will make me their enemy.\nThey could come here to our house.\nI curse the day I ever went to the\nGodfather.\n\nEXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\nWith his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.\n\nINT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)\n\nBONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without\nTurning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,\nPast the tables, and equipment. He operates the chain that\nLifts a large overhead garage type door. And looks out into\nThe alley.\n\nHe sits on a bench, and waits.\n\nEXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;\nWe notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral\nParlor.\n\nCLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.\nBONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak. He notices TWO\nOTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a\nCORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet\nProtruding.\n\nBONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way\nThe MEN should carry their sinister burden.\n\nINT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThey carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming\nRoom.\n\nThen BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the\nDarkness somewhat uncertainly. It is DON CORLEONE.\n\nHe walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking. His\nCold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.\nThen, after a long gaze:\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWell my friend, are you ready to do\nMe this service?\n\nBONASERA nods. The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming\nTable; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.\n\nBONASERA\nWhat do you wish me to do?\n\nDON CORLEONE\n(staring at the table)\nI want you to use all your powers,\nAll your skill, as you love me. I\nDo not want his mother to see him\nAs he is.\n\nHe draws down the gray blanket.\n\nBONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:\n\nThe bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.\n\nEXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)\n\nSONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.\n\nA car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the\nBooth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets\nHim, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll\nBooths on both side of him, and from the front window of the\nCar blocking him.\n\nThe windows of his car are shot out.\n\nBullet holes puncture the doors of his car.\n\nHis hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.\n\nHis arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it\nContinues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that\nHe will survive it.\n\nSuddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and\nActually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER\nFire.\n\nHis face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.\n\nA FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and\nMake off in the distance.\n\nSONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they\nAre too late.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nView on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room. He is silent\nA moment, and then:\n\nHAGEN\n(quietly)\nOK. Go to Clemenza's house and\nTell him to come here right away.\nHe'll tell you what to do.\n\nThe MEN leave him alone. He is quiet, standing in the\nMiddle of the living room a moment. He looks in the\nDirection of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA\nMoving around.\n\nINT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)\n\nTOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the\nDON's room. He opens the DON's door. Looks in.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe DON in his hospital bed. Asleep under sedation. HAGEN\nHesitates. He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN. He\nCloses the door.\n\nINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)\n\nHAGEN alone in the office. He is drinking. He looks up at\nThe sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving. Then he\nHears footsteps.\n\nThe door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE\nSlowly enters the room. He walks directly to his stuffed\nArmchair, sits down. His face is stern, as he looks into\nHAGEN's eyes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGive me a drop of anisette.\n\nHAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy wife was weeping before she fell\nAsleep, outside my window I saw my\nCaporegimes to the house, and it is\nMidnight. So, Consigliere of mine,\nI think you should tell your Don\nWhat everyone knows.\n\nHAGEN\n(quietly)\nI didn't tell Mama anything. I was\nAbout to come up and wake you and\nTell you. Just now.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBut you needed a drink first.\n\nHAGEN\nYes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNow you've had your drink.\n\nPause.\n\nHAGEN\nThey shot Sonny on the Causeway.\n(pause)\nHe's dead.\n\nDON CORLEONE blinks. One feels that just for a second he\nLoses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of\nHim on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI want no inquiries made. No acts\nOf vengeance.\n(pause)\nConsigliere, arrange a meeting with\nThe heads of the five\nFamilies...this war stops now.\n\nHe rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nCall Bonasera...he will do me a\nService.\n\nAnd leaves. HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...\n\nHAGEN\nThis is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for\nDon Corleone, at his request.\n\nBONASERA (O.S.)\nYes, I understand I'm listening.\n\nHAGEN\nYou owe the Don a service. He has\nNo doubt that you will repay it.\n\nEXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)\n\nDay in Manhattan. An impressive Bank Building in the\nFinancial center of New York. Many limousines are parked,\nUniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.\n\nINT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.\n\nCARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,\nSits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a\nMAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and\nSettles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;\nAs the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:\n\nDON CORLEONE (O.S.)\nI want to thank you all for coming.\nI consider it a service done to me\nPersonally and I am in the debt of\nEach and every one of you.\nEspecially those of you who have\nTraveled from such distances as\nCalifornia, St. Louis, Kansas City;\nAnd New Orleans...\n\nThe VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both\nYounger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,\nShort and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the\nTable to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his\nJEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an\nOlder man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO\nCUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then\nDON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair\nAnd a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his\nEarly sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at\nCONNIE's Wedding.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAh well, let's get down to business.\nWe are all honorable men here, we\nDon't have to give assurances as if\nWe were lawyers.\n(he sits, gazes out\nAt them, and sighs)\nHow did things ever go so far?\nWell, no matter. A lot of\nFoolishness has come to pass. It\nWas so unfortunate, so unnecessary.\n\nThe VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks. A\nLarge, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,\nAnd two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during\nThe day's trading, and projected above.\n\nDON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTattaglia has lost a son; I have\nLost a son. We are quits. Let\nThere be a peace...\n(he gestures\nExpressively,\nSubmissively, with\nHis hands)\nThat is all I want...\n\nBARZINI\nDon Corleone is too modest. He had\nThe judges and politicians in his\nPocket and he refused to share them.\nHis refusal is not the act of a\nFriend. He takes the bread out of\nThe mouths of our families. Times\nHave changed, it's not like the old\nDays where everyone can go his own\nWay. If Don Corleone had all the\nJudges and politicians in New York,\nThen he must share them or let\nOthers use them. Certainly he can\nPresent a bill for such services,\nWe're not Communists, after all.\nBut he has to let us draw water\nFrom the well. It's that simple.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy friends, I didn't refuse out of\nMalice. You all know me. When\nHave I ever refused an accommodation?\nBut why, this time? Because I\nThink this drug business will\nDestroy us in the years to come.\nIt's not like whiskey or gambling\nOr even women which most people\nWant and is forbidden them by the\nPezzonovante of the Church and the\nGovernment. But drugs? No. Even\nPolicemen, who help us in gambling\nAnd other things would refuse to\nHelp us in drugs. But...I am\nWilling to do whatever all of you\nThink is necessary.\n\nDON ZALUCHI\nI don't believe in drugs. For\nYears I paid my people extra so\nThey wouldn't do that kind of\nBusiness...$200 a week. But it\nDidn't matter. Somebody comes to\nThem and says, \"I have powders, if\nYou put up three, four thousand\nDollar investment, we can make\nFifty thousand distributing.\" Who\nCan resist such a profit?\nThere's no way to control it, as a\nBusiness...to keep it respectable.\n(rapping the table)\nI don't want it near schools! I\nDon't want it sold to children.\nThat is an infamita.\n(thinking)\nIn my city I would try to keep the\nTraffic in the dark people, the\nColored. They are the best\nCustomers, the least troublesome,\nAnd they are animals anyway. They\nHave no respect for their wives or\nTheir families or themselves. Let\nThem lose their souls with drugs.\nBut something has to be done, we\nCan't have everybody running around\nDoing just what they please, like a\nBunch of anarchists.\n\nBARZINI\nThen, are we agreed; the traffic in\nDrugs will be permitted, but\nControlled; and Don Corleone agrees\nTo give it protection in the East.\n\nDON CORLEONE nods.\n\nBARZINI\nThat's the whole matter then, we\nHave the peace, and let me pay my\nRespects to Don Corleone, whom we\nHave all known over the years as a\nMan of his word.\n(noticing TATTAGLIA\nIs uneasy)\nDon Philip?\n\nTATTAGLIA\nI agree to everything here, I'm\nWilling to forget my own misfortune.\nBut I must hear strict assurance\nFrom Corleone. When time goes by\nAnd his position becomes stronger,\nWill he attempt any individual\nVengeance?\n\nThey all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that\nDON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something\nElse in mind. Slowly the DON rises.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI forego my vengeance for my dead\nSon, for the common good. But I\nHave selfish reasons. My youngest\nSon had to flee, accused of\nSollozzo's murder, and I must now\nMake arrangements so that he can\nCome home with safety, cleared of\nAll those false charges. That is\nMy affair, and I will make those\nArrangements.\n(with strength)\nBut I am a superstitious man...and\nSo if some unlucky accident should\nBefall my youngest son, if some\nPolice officer should accidentally\nShoot him, or if he should hang\nHimself in his cell, or if my son\nIs struck by a bolt of lightning,\nThen I will blame some of the\nPeople here. That, I could never\nForgive, but...aside from that, let\nMe swear by the souls of my\nGrandchildren that I will never be\nThe one to break the peace we have\nMade.\n\nEXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)\n\nThe DON's black limousine. He sits quietly in the padded\nRear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.\n\nIt is night. Lights flash by them every so often.\n\nHAGEN\nWhen I meet with Tattaglia's\nPeople; should I insist that all\nHis drug middle-men be clean?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMention it, don't insist. Barzini\nIs a man who will know that without\nBeing told.\n\nHAGEN\nYou mean Tattaglia.\n\nDON CORLEONE\n(shaking his head)\nBarzini.\n\nHAGEN\n(a revelation)\nHe was the one behind Sollozzo?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTattaglia is a pimp. He could\nNever have outfought Santino. But\nI wasn't sure until this day. No,\nIt was Barzini all along.\n\nThe black limousine speeds away from us in the night.\n\n------------------------------------------FADE OUT------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT\n\nA CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and\nDowncast, the left side of his face healed, but left\nGrotesque and misshapen.\n\nGRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea\nJacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.\n\nTHE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on\nEither side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his\nShoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple\nHonest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,\nAnd with a pleasing build. Each of the SHEPHERDS carry\nKnapsacks.\n\nThe THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,\nOverlooking an impressive view of land and sea.\n\nEXT DAY: SICILY ROAD\n\nThe THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make\nTheir way to a dusty rural road. We HEAR a rinky horn\nSound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.\nAn OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL. The\nCar pulls in front of them and stops. MICHAEL nods\nRespectfully.\n\nMICHAEL\nDon Tommassino.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nMichael, why must you do this. We\nHave been lucky so far, all these\nMonths you've been here we've kept\nYour name a secret. It is from\nLove for your father that I've\nAsked you never to more than an\nHour from the Villa.\n\nMICHAEL\nCalo and Fabrizzio are with me;\nNothing will happen.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nYou must understand that your\nFather's enemies have friends in\nPalermo.\n\nMICHAEL\nI know.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nWhere are you going?\n\nMICHAEL\nCorleone.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nThere is nothing there. Not anymore.\n\nMICHAEL\nI was told that my Grandfather was\nMurdered on its main street; and\nHis murderers came to kill my\nFather there when he was twelve\nYears old.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nLong ago. Now there is nothing:\nThe men killed each other in family\nVendettas...the others escaped to\nAmerica.\n\nMICHAEL\nDon Tommassino...I should see this\nPlace.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nThat is your birthright...but\nMichael, use this car.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo...I would like to walk to\nCorleone.\n\nThe OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nBe careful Michael, don't let them\nKnow your name.\n\nThe old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues\nOn his journey.\n\nEXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE\n\nThe THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit\nTrees, in bloom and bursting with life.\n\nEXT DAY: VILLAGE\n\nThey continue in the empty streets of a little town; the\nPost-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the\nEmpty streets. Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only\nGasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass. And there\nAre many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.\n\nThe THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main\nRoad \"VOTA COMMUNISTA\".\n\nEXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD\n\nThey continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally\nA donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.\n\nEXT DAY: FIELD\n\nOut in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession\nOf peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,\nMarching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men\nCarrying billowing red banners.\n\nEXT DAY: GROVE\n\nThey are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees\nIs a deep, tall field of wild flowers.\n\nThe Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out\nLoaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.\n\nMICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou tell us about America.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow do you know I come from America?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nWe hear. We were told you were a\nPezzonovanta...big shot.\n\nMICHAEL\nOnly the son of a Pezzonovanta.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nHey America! Is she as rich as\nThey say?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nTake me to America! You need a\nGood lupara in America?\n(pats his shotgun)\nYou take me, I'll be the best man\nYou got. \"Oh say, can you\nSeeee...By da star early light...\"\n\nMICHAEL laughs.\n\nEXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD\n\nThe TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military\nConvoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of\nThe U.S. drivers, as they move by.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nAmerica.\nHey America!\nTake me with you!\nHey, take me to America G.I.!\n\nEXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL\n\nThey continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until\nThey hesitate, and look down.\n\nCALO\nCorleone.\n\nThey can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.\n\nEXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET\n\nMICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of\nThe village. They walk behind him, and spread to either\nSide about fifteen feet away from him.\n\nThey move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.\nMICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.\nThey go on.\n\nThey move up a very narrow old street. MICHAEL looks at the\nDoorways that they pass.\n\nMOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.\n\nCALO sees MICHAEL looking.\n\nCALO\nThe names of the dead.\n\nMICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street. He looks.\n\nThe street is empty, barren. Occasionally, an old woman\nWill pass.\n\nMICHAEL turns his head.\n\nThe other side of the street: empty and deathly.\n\nA HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old\nStreet, the shepherds a respectful distance away.\n\n-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------\n\nEXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE\n\nA green ribboned field of a baronial Estate. Further ahead\nIs a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been\nDiscovered in the ruins of Pompeii. There is a group of\nYoung village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,\nDressed in black. They have been gathering the pink sulla,\nPurple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon\nBlossoms. They are singing, off in the distance as they work.\n\nMICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this\nFantasy-like scene.\n\nFABRIZZIO\n(calling out to them)\nHey, beautiful girls!\n\nMICHAEL\n(sternly)\nShhhhh.\n\nHe settles down to watch.\n\nThe GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that\nCling to their bodies. They are still in their teens, but\nDeveloped and womanly.\n\nThey are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not\nAware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.\nThree or four of the girls begin chasing one of them\nPlayfully, in the direction of the grove.\n\nThe GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her\nLeft hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws\nThem back at her pursuers laughing.\n\nThey come closer and closer. Just short of the grove, she\nPoses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the\nView of the THREE MEN. She stands there on her toes about\nTo run.\n\nMICHAEL sees her; now face to face. He looks.\n\nHer face. Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair\nAnd a rich mouth.\n\nFABRIZZIO\n(murmuring)\nJesus Christ, take my soul. I'm\nDying.\n\nQuickly, she turns, and runs away.\n\nMICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her. We hold\nOn him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS\nLaughing. Then he turns to them.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?\n\nCALO pats him on the shoulder.\n\nCALO\nEasy man.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou can't hide it when you're hit\nBy the thunderbolt.\n\nEXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE\n\nThe little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,\nIs decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.\n\nMICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central\nSquare, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.\n\nThe proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;\nHe greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at\nTheir table.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nYou know all the girls in this\nTown, eh? We saw some beauties\nComing down the road. One in\nParticular got our friend hit with\nThe Thunderbolt...\n(he indicates MICHAEL)\n\nVITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with\nNew interest.\n\nVITELLI\nYou had better bring a few bottles\nHome with you, my friend; you'll\nNeed help sleeping tonight.\n(he laughs)\n\nFABRIZZIO\nThis one could seduce the devil. A\nBody! and eyes as big and black as\nOlives.\n\nVITELLI\n(laughing with\nThem...pouring more wine)\nI know about what you mean!\n\nFABRIZZIO\nThis was a beauty. Right, Calo?\n\nVITELLI\n(laughing)\nBeautiful all over, eh?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nAnd hair. Black and curly, like a\nDoll. And such a mouth.\n\nVITELLI does not laugh quite so much.\n\nVITELLI\nYes, we have beautiful girls here...\nBut virtuous.\n\nVITELLI is no longer drinking with them.\n\nMICHAEL\nShe wore a red dress, and a red\nRibbon in her hair. She looks more\nGreek than Italian. Do you know a\nBeauty like that?\n\nAs MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,\nUntil he wears a scowl.\n\nVITELLI\nNo.\n\nThen he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nGod in Heaven, I think I\nUnderstand...\n\nHe goes into the back room after the innkeeper. Then he\nReturns.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nLet's get out of here; he's boiling\nUp his blood to do us mischief.\nIt's his daughter.\n\nThey start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.\n\nCALO\nCome quickly.\n\nMICHAEL\nInnkeeper. More wine!\n\nFABRIZZIO\n(whispered)\nThe old bastard mentioned two sons\nHe only has to whistle up.\n\nMICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.\n\nMICHAEL\nTell him to come to me.\n\nThe two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in\nA moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI\nBetween them.\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly)\nI understand I've offended you by\nTalking about your daughter. I\nOffer you my apologies, I'm a\nStranger in this country, I don't\nKnow the customs very well. Let me\nSay this, I meant no disrespect to\nYou or her...\n\nCALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.\n\nVITELLI\n(shrugs)\nWho are you and what do you want\nFrom my daughter?\n\nMICHAEL\nI am an American hiding in Sicily\nFrom the police of my country. My\nName is Michael. You can inform\nThe police and make your fortune\nBut then your daughter would lose a\nFather rather than gain a husband.\nIn any case, I want to meet your\nDaughter. With your permission and\nUnder the supervision of your\nFamily. With all decorum. With\nAll respect. I am an honorable man.\n\nCALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then\nAsks:\n\nVITELLI\nAre you a friend of the friends?\n\nMICHAEL\nWhen the proper time comes, I'll\nTell you everything that a wife's\nFather should know.\n\nFABRIZZIO\nIt's the real Thunderbolt, then.\n\nVITELLI\n(formally)\nCome Sunday morning: My name is\nVitelli and my house is up there on\nThe hill, above the village.\n\nMICHAEL\nYour daughter's name?\n\nVITELLI\nAppolonia.\n\n-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------\n\nEXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD\n\nMUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from\nPalermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an\nAlfa Romeo. CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday\nBest, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their\nLuparas on their shoulders.\n\nDON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,\nRocky and bouncing on the dirt road.\n\nThe Sunday churchbells ring.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE\n\nMICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by\nThe yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the\nMOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.\nFinally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate\nSunday clothing. Now he presents the wrapped gift to\nAPPOLONIA. She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives\nHer permission to open it. She unwraps it. Her eyes light\nAt the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.\n\nShe looks at him.\n\nAPPOLONIA\nGrazia.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE\n\nNow the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's\nCafe.\n\nMICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,\nThough they are all dressed differently.\n\nThey go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is\nTalking and talking.\n\nMICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.\nShe wears the gold necklace around her neck.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME\n\nMICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,\nSeemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.\n\nAs the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a\nHalf dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces\nFurther behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on\nTheir shoulders.\n\nFurther up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,\nAnd falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm. She modestly regains\nHer balance, and they continue walking.\n\nBehind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH\n\nChurch bells in an ancient belfry ring out. Music, old and\nDissonant, plays.\n\nThere is a bridal procession in the street of the village;\nThe same in feeling and texture as it might have been five\nHundred years ago.\n\nDonkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant\nFlowers; children carrying candles and wearing white\nConfirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by\nCountless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.\n\nWe present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with\nAll the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in\nSicily.\n\nAPPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome\nDespite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nEXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE\n\nCALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the\nGreat wedding celebration. It is held in the Village\nSquare; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the\nTops of buildings, carrying luparas.\n\n--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------\n\nINT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA\n\nMICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight\nFills the room.\n\nHe turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA. A\nLittle frightened; but lovely.\n\nHe moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,\nLooking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.\n\nSlowly and tenderly he kisses her. Her tiny hands come up\nTo his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.\n\nShe lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nINT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA\n\nMorning. MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the\nRoom.\n\nAPPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially\nCovered by the bedsheets.\n\nHe looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.\n\nEXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA\n\nWe HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving\nErratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost\nHitting th inner court wall.\n\nAPPOLONIA is laughing, driving. MICHAEL pretends to be\nFrightened, as he teaches her to drive.\n\nOutside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking\nGuard duty.\n\nThe car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.\n\nMICHAEL\nIt's safer to teach you English.\n\nAPPOLONIA\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\nThursday, Friday...See, I learned\nIt. Now teach me to drive!\n\nDON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard. He seems tired and\nConcerned.\n\nMICHAEL\nCiao, Don Tommassino.\n\nAPPOLONIA kisses him.\n\nMICHAEL\nThings went badly in Palermo?\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nThe younger men have no respect.\nThings are changing; I don't know\nWhat will happen. Michael, because\nOf the wedding, people now know\nYour name.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs that why there are more men on\nThe walls?\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nEven so, I don't think it is safe\nHere anymore. I've made plans to\nMove you to a villa near Siracuse.\nYou must go right away.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhat is it?\n\nDON TOMMASSINO\nBad news from America. Your\nBrother, Santino. He has been\nKilled.\n\nFor a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the\nFive Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.\n\nEXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD\n\nMorning. MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.\n\nBelow, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,\nCombing his thick hair.\n\nMICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.\n\nMICHAEL\nGet the car. I'll be leaving in\nTen minutes. Where's Calo?\n\nFABRIZZIO\nCalo is having a cup of coffee in\nThe kitchen. Is your wife coming\nWith you?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, she's going home to her family.\nShe'll join me in a few weeks...\n\nINT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN\n\nMICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the\nKitchen. CALO is just finishing a bite. He rises when he\nSees MICHAEL.\n\nCALO\nShould I get your bag?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, I'll get it. Where's Appolonia?\n\nCALO\n(smiling)\nShe is sitting in the driver's seat\nOf the car, dying to step on the\nGas. She'll be a real American\nWoman before she gets to America.\n\nMICHAEL smiles.\n\nMICHAEL\nTell Fabrizzio and wait for me in\nThe car.\n\nHe leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.\n\nHe looks out from the opening in the doorway.\n\nEXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD\n\nThere is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's\nSeat, playing with the wheel like a child.\n\nCALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear\nSeat.\n\nThen MICHAEL seems disturbed.\n\nOver, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO\nDisappear through the gate.\n\nMICHAEL\n(muttering to himself)\nWhere the hell is he going?\n\nMICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.\n\nMICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer\nCourtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.\n\nAPPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay\nWhere he is.\n\nAPPOLONIA\n(calling out)\nI'll drive to you.\n\nHe smiles affectionately.\n\nCALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling\nBy his side. There is no sight of FABRIZZIO. Suddenly the\nSmile fades from MICHAEL's face. He steps forward and holds\nOut his hand.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. No!\n\nHis shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,\nAs she switched on the ignition.\n\nPart of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;\nAnd there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.\n\nMICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.\n\nINT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM\n\nMICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room. We hear\nWhispering around him, but can't make any of it out. A soft\nCloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. DON\nTOMMASSINO is there, close to him. He looks at them and\nFrom their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.\n\nMICHAEL\nFabrizzio. Let your shepherds know\nThat the one who gives me Fabrizzio\nWill own the finest pastures in\nSicily.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)\n\nEaster.\n\nA HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime. Hordes\nOf little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children\nAnd Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,\nSearching here and there for candy treasures and hidden\nEaster eggs.\n\nThe DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing\nBaggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around\nHis garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.\n\nSuddenly, he stops and looks.\n\nMICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.\n\nGreat emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in\nMICHAEL's direction.\n\nMICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son\nAnd embraces him.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBe my son...\n\nINT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY\n\nDON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the\nBuilding.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThis old building has seen its day.\nNo way to do business...too small,\nToo old.\n\nThey enter the DON's glass-panelled office.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nHave you thought about a wife? A\nFamily?\n\nMICHAEL\n(pained)\nNo.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI understand, Michael. But you\nMust make a family, you know.\n\nMICHAEL\nI want children, I want a family.\nBut I don't know when.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAccept what's happened, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nI could accept everything that's\nHappened; I could accept it, but\nThat I never had a choice. From\nThe time I was born, you had laid\nThis all out for me.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nNo, I wanted other things for you.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou wanted me to be your son.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYes, but sons who would be\nProfessors, scientists,\nMusicians...and grandchildren who\nCould be, who knows, a Governor, a\nPresident even, nothing's impossible\nHere in America.\n\nMICHAEL\nThen why have I become a man like\nYou?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYou are like me, we refuse to be\nFools, to be puppets dancing on a\nString pulled by other men. I\nHoped the time for guns and killing\nAnd massacres was over. That was\nMy misfortune. That was your\nMisfortune. I was hunted on the\nStreets of Corleone when I was\nTwelve years old because of who my\nFather was. I had no choice.\n\nMICHAEL\nA man has to choose what he will be.\nI believe that.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nWhat else do you believe in?\n\nMICHAEL doesn't answer.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBelieve in a family. Can you\nBelieve in your country? Those\nPezzonovante of the State who\nDecide what we shall do with our\nLives? Who declare wars they wish\nUs to fight in to protect what they\nOwn. Do you put your fate in the\nHands of men whose only talent is\nThat they tricked a bloc of people\nTo vote for them? Michael, in five\nYears the Corleone family can be\nCompletely legitimate. Very\nDifficult things have to happen to\nMake that possible. I can't do\nThem anymore, but you can, if you\nChoose to.\n\nMICHAEL listens.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBelieve in a family; believe in a\nCode of Honor, older and higher,\nBelieve in Roots that go back\nThousands of years into your Race.\nMake a family, Michael, and protect\nIt. These are our affairs, sono cosa\nNostra, Governments only protect\nMen who have their own individual\nPower. Be one of those men...you\nHave the choice.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nEXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)\n\nA MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.\n\nFREDO (O.S.)\nThere's a new one. Construction\nGoing on everywhere.\n\nMORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the\nBill marquees read: \"MARTIN AND LEWIS\", \"PATTI PAGE\", etc.\n\nFREDO (O.S.)\nThat's one of the family's new ones.\nNot bad, eh?\n\nEXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)\n\nThe car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.\n\nInside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,\nNERI, quiet and sinister.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhy didn't Moe Green meet us at the\nAirport?\n\nFREDO\nHe had business at the hotel, but\nHe'll drop in for dinner.\n\nFrom the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a\nDiscourtesy.\n\nINT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)\n\nA whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of\nMICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI. Great fuss is made. They are\nBeing shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.\n\nFREDO\nYou look wonderful, kid; really\nWonderful. That doctor did some\nJob on your face.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou look good, too.\n\nThey enter the suite.\n\nFREDO\nNice, eh?\n\nFREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the\nBellboys, waiters and maids.\n\nFREDO\n(hurrying into the bedroom)\nKid, take a look-see.\n\nMICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.\n\nThere is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,\nMirrors to each side. FREDO points upward.\n\nA VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.\n\nFREDO\nEver seen anything like that before?\n\nMICHAEL\n(dryly)\nNo.\n\nINT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)\n\nMICHAEL is alone in the bedroom. He is just finishing\nDressing; he puts on his jacket. From the window, with the\nLights blinking, we can tell it's late at night. MICHAEL\nPasses into the other room.\n\nHe stops, looks. He is disturbed.\n\nINT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)\n\nA magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;\nA lavish table setting for eight. Standing by the table are\nHAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,\nBeautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.\nNERI stands quietly by the door.\n\nFREDO\nMike! The party starting!\n\nMICHAEL\nCome here a minute, Fredo.\n\nFREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.\n\nMICHAEL\nWho are those girls?\n\nFREDO\n(jokingly)\nThat's for you to find out.\n\nMICHAEL\nGive them some money and send them\nHome.\n\nFREDO\nMike!\n\nMICHAEL\nGet rid of them...\n\nINT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)\n\nThey are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.\nMICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.\n\nMICHAEL\nJohnny, the Corleone family is\nThinking of selling out all our\nInterests in the Olive Oil business\nAnd settling here. Moe Greene will\nSell us his interest so it can be\nWholly owned by friends of the\nFamily.\n\nFREDDIE seems anxious.\n\nFREDO\nMike, you sure about Moe selling.\nHe never mentioned it to me and he\nLoves the business.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\n\nMICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.\n\nMICHAEL\nJohnny, the Don wants you to help\nUs get started. We figure\nEntertainment will be the big\nFactor in drawing gamblers. We\nHope you'll sign a contract to\nAppear five times a year for maybe\nA week long engagement.\nWe hope your friends in the movies\nWill do the same. We count on you\nTo convince them.\n\nJOHNNY\nSure, I'll do anything for my\nGodfather. You know that, Mike.\n\nThere is knock on the door. NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,\nWho nods. NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,\nFollowed by TWO BODYGUARDS. He is a handsome hood, dressed\nIn the Hollywood style. His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast\nStyle.\n\nMOE\nMike, good to see you. Got\nEverything you want?\n\nMICHAEL\nThanks.\n\nMOE\nThe chef cooked for you special;\nThe dancers will kick your tongue\nOut and you credit is good!\n(to his BODYGUARDS)\nDraw chips for all these people so\nThey can play on the house.\n\nMICHAEL\nIs my credit good enough to buy you\nOut?\n\nMOE laughs.\n\nMOE\nBuy me out?...\n\nMICHAEL\nThe hotel, the casino. The Corleone\nFamily wants to buy you out.\n\nGREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense. NERI eyes\nThe BODYGUARDS.\n\nMOE\n(furious)\nThe Corleone family wants to buy me\nOut. I buy you out. You don't buy\nMe out.\n\nMICHAEL\nYour casino loses money. Maybe we\nCan do better.\n\nMOE\nYou think I scam?\n\nMICHAEL\n(the worst insult)\nYou're unlucky.\n\nMOE\nYou goddamn dagos. I do you a\nFavor and take Freddie in when\nYou're having a bad time, and then\nYou try to push me out.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou took Freddie in because the\nCorleone family bankrolled your\nCasino. You and the Corleone\nFamily are evened out. This is for\nBusiness; name your price.\n\nMOE\nThe Corleone family don't have that\nKind of muscle anymore. The\nGodfather is sick. You're getting\nChased out of New York by Barzini\nAnd the other families, and you\nThink you can find easier pickings\nHere. I've talked to Barzini; I\nCan make a deal with him and keep\nMy hotel!\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly, deadly)\nIs that why you thought you could\nSlap Freddie around in public?\n\nFREDO\n(his face turns red)\nAh Mike, that was nothing. Moe\nDidn't mean anything. He flies off\nThe handle sometimes; but me and\nHim are good friends. Right, Moe?\n\nMOE\nYeah sure. Sometimes I gotta kick\nAsses to make this place run right.\nFreddie and I had a little argument\nAnd I had to straighten him out.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou straightened my brother out?\n\nMOE\nHell, he was banging cocktail\nWaitresses two at a time. Players\nCouldn't get a drink.\n\nMICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:\n\nMICHAEL\nI have to go back to New York\nTomorrow. Think of your price.\n\nMOE\nYou son of a bitch, you think you\nCan brush me off like that? I made\nMy bones when you were going out\nWith cheerleaders.\n\nFREDO\n(frightened)\nTom, you're the Consigliere; you\nCan talk to the Don and advise him.\n\nMICHAEL\nThe Don has semi-retired. I'm\nRunning the Family business now.\nSo anything you have to say, say it\nTo me.\n\nNobody answers. MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.\nMOE exits angrily.\n\nMICHAEL\nFreddie, you're my older brother.\nI love you. But don't ever take\nSides with anybody against the\nFamily again.\n\nEXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)\n\nKAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark\nAIRPORT. ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.\n\nShe has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who\nPlays with a cardboard bird on a string.\n\nTwo other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have\nLearned to tell are bodyguards.\n\nMICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO\nPORTERS carrying luggage.\n\nNERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.\n\nMICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.\n\nLAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and\nMICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son. Automatically,\nThe luggage is put in. NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;\nAnd LAMPONE joins the other men. HAGEN gets into one of the\nOther cars.\n\nAnd the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other\nSedans.\n\nINT DAY: LIMO (1955)\n\nThe little BOY looks out the window as they drive.\n\nMICHAEL\nI have to see my father and his\nPeople when we get back to the Mall.\n\nKAY\nOh Michael.\n\nMICHAEL\nWe'll go to the show tomorrow\nNight--we can change the tickets.\n\nKAY\nDon't you want dinner first?\n\nMICHAEL\nNo, you eat...don't wait up for me.\n\nKAY\nWake me up when you come to bed?\n\nThe little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding\nLimousine window.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nThe limousine arrives at the Mall. We are inside.\n\nKAY\nYour sister wants to ask you\nSomething.\n\nMICHAEL\nLet HER ask.\n\nNERI opens the door. KAY wants to talk just a little more.\n\nKAY\nShe's afraid to. Michael...\n\nMICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment\nLonger.\n\nKAY\nWhy are you so cold to her and\nCarlo? They live with us on the\nMall now, but you never get close\nTo them.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm busy.\n\nKAY\nConnie and Carlo want you to be\nGodfather to their little boy.\n\nNERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.\n\nHe smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.\n\nKAY\nWill you?\n\nMICHAEL\nLet me think about it, O.K.?\n\nShe smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY\nAnd the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)\n\nVIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size. He\nWears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt. He sits in a\nChair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.\n\nTESSIO (O.S.)\nBarzini's people chisel my territory\nAnd we do nothing about it. Pretty\nSoon there won't be one place in\nBrooklyn I can hang my hat.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nJust be patient.\n\nTESSIO\nI'm not asking you for help, Mike.\nJust take off the handcuffs.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nBe patient.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nWe gotta fight sometime. Let us at\nLeast recruit our regimes to full\nStrength.\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nNo, I don't want to give Barzini an\nExcuse to start fighting.\n\nTESSIO (O.S.)\nMike, you're wrong.\n\nCLEMENZA (O.S.)\nDon Corleone...Don Corleone.\n\nThe OLD MAN looks up. CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.\nBeside him is an anxious TESSIO. NERI stands by the door;\nHAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.\n\nCLEMENZA\nYou said there would come a day\nWhen Tessio and me could form our\nOwn Families. Only with your\nBenediction, of course. I ask\nPermission...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nMy son is head of the Family now.\nIf you have his permission, you\nHave my good will.\n\nMICHAEL\nIn six months you can break off\nFrom the Corleone Family and go on\nYour own. Carlo, I'm counting on\nYou to make the move to Nevada;\nYou'll be my right-hand man out\nThere. Tom Hagen is no longer the\nConsigliere.\n\nEveryone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.\nHe remains inexpressive.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe's going to be our lawyer in\nVegas. Nobody goes to him with any\nOther business as of now, this\nMinute. No reflection on Tom;\nThat's the way I want it. Besides,\nIf I ever need any advice, who's a\nBetter Consigliere than my father.\n\nCLEMENZA\nThen in a six month time we're on\nOur own; is that it?\n\nMICHAEL\nMaybe less...\n\nTESSIO\nLet us fill up our Regimes.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. I want things very calm for\nAnother six months.\n\nTESSIO\nForgive me, Godfather, let our\nYears of friendship be my excuse.\nHow can you hope for success there\nWithout your strength here to back\nYou up? The two go hand in hand.\nAnd with you gone from here the\nBarzini and the Tattaglias will be\nToo strong for us.\n\nCLEMENZA\nAnd I don't like Barzini. I say\nThe Corleone Family has to move\nFrom strength, not weakness. We\nShould build our Regimes and take\nBack our lost territories in Staten\nIsland, at least.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nDo you have faith in my judgement?\n\nCLEMENZA\nYes, Godfather...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThen do what Michael says...\n\nMICHAEL\nAll I can say is that things are\nBeing resolved that are more\nEffective than a thousand buttonmen\nOn the streets. Understood?\n\nThere are uneasy looks all around.\n\nCARLO\nUnderstood. I just wish I was\nDoing more to help out.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll come to you when I need you.\n\nHe looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN. They all nod,\nReluctantly.\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right, then it's resolved.\n\nNERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.\n\nCLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,\nThen CARLO. NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the\nCorridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.\n\nThen NERI closes the door.\n\nMICHAEL relaxes.\n\nHAGEN\nMike, why are you cutting me out of\nThe action?\n\nMICHAEL\nTom, we're going to be legitimate\nAll the way, and you're the legal\nMan. What could be more important\nThan that.\n\nHAGEN\nI'm not talking about that. I'm\nTalking about Rocco Lampone building\nA secret regime. Why does Neri\nReport directly to you, rather than\nThrough me or a caporegime?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI told you that it wouldn't escape\nHis eye.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow did you find out?\n\nHAGEN\nBookkeepers know everything.\nRocco's men are all a little too\nGood for the jobs they're supposed\nTo be doing. They get a little\nMore money than the job's worth.\n(pause)\nLampone's a good man; he's operating\nPerfectly.\n\nMICHAEL\nNot so perfectly if you noticed.\n\nHAGEN\nMike, why am I out?\n\nMICHAEL\nYou're not a wartime Consigliere.\nThings may get tough with the move\nWe're trying.\n\nHAGEN\nOK, but then I agree with Tessio.\nYou're going about it all wrong;\nYou're making the move out of\nWeakness... Barzini's a wolf, and\nIf he tears you apart, the other\nFamilies won't come running to help\nThe Corleones...\n\nDON CORLEONE\nTom, I never thought you were a bad\nConsigliere, I thought Santino a\nBad Don, rest in peace. He had a\nGood heart but he wasn't the right\nMan to head the family when I had\nMy misfortune. Michael has all my\nConfidence, as you do. For reasons\nWhich you can't know, you must have\nNo part in what will happen.\n\nHAGEN\nMaybe I can help.\n\nMICHAEL\n(coldly)\nYou're out, Tom.\n\nTOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence. TOM\nLeaves.\n\nMICHAEL looks at NERI.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'm going to talk to my father.\n\nNERI nods, and then leaves. The DON opens the doors,\nBreathes in the air, and steps outside.\n\nEXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)\n\nDON CORLEONE\nI see you have your Luca Brasi.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll need him.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nThere are men in this world who\nDemand to be killed. They argue in\nGambling games; they jump out of\nTheir cars in a rage if someone so\nMuch as scratches their fender.\nThese people wander through the\nStreets calling out \"Kill me, kill\nMe.\" Luca Brasi was like that.\nAnd since he wasn't scared of\nDeath, and in fact, looked for\nIt...I made him my weapon. Because\nI was the only person in the world\nThat he truly hoped would not kill\nHim. I think you have done the\nSame with this man.\n\nThey walk through the DON's vegetable garden. Tomatoes,\nPeppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.\nMICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him. Then\nStoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nBarzini will move against you first.\n\nMICHAEL\nHow?\n\nDON CORLEONE\nHe will get in touch with you\nThrough someone you absolutely\nTrust. That person will arrange a\nMeeting, guarantee your safety...\n\nHe rises, and looks at Michael...\n\nDON CORLEONE\n...and at that meeting you will be\nAssassinated.\n\nThe DON walks on further.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nYour wife and children...you're\nHappy with them?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nGood.\n\nMICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:\n\nMICHAEL\nI've always respected you...\n\nA long silence. The DON smiles at MICHAEL.\n\nDON CORLEONE\nAnd I...you.\n\nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nKAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left\nThem off.\n\nKAY\nHow is your husband feeling?\n\nMAMA\nHe's not the same since they shot\nHim. He lets Michael do all the\nWork. He just plays the fool with\nHis garden, his peppers, his\nTomatoes, as if he was some peasant\nStill. But men are like that...\n\nShe stops toward the Church.\n\nMAMA\nYou come in, too.\n\nKAY shakes her head.\n\nMAMA\nThe Priest ain't gonna bite you\nCause you're not Catholic.\n(whispered)\nHe's in the back drinkin' his wine.\n\nKAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.\nThey enter.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nInside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from\nThe holy water.\n\nMAMA\nYou can.\n\nTentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and\nBlesses herself. Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in\nAwe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally\nThe Altar.\n\nMAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles. There is a\nLarge coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting\nCandles. MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives\nHer some.\n\nMAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the\nTaper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great\nDignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights\nTwenty candles.\n\nShe finishes, and bows her head.\n\nEXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME\n\nVery few people in the streets. TOTAL SILENCE. But black\nFlower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.\nAn expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.\nCertainly no more could be done for a President or a King.\n\nEach car carries an elaborate floral decoration. We show\nThese in detail; and the flowered messages: \"A Benefactor to\nMankind\", \"He Knew and Pitied\"...\"Our Don Our Leader\"...\"The\nSacred Heart\"...\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\nSilence.\n\nThe flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill\nAll the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.\n\nHundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the\nWedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is\nSomber and respectful.\n\nMICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform\nWhich holds the ornate coffin. We cannot see the remains of\nDon Corleone.\n\nBONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved\nFamily. One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely\nWith grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.\n\nThe VIEW ALTERS,\n\nAnd we see that the line is endless. JOHNNY FONTANE, tears\nOpenly falling, takes his turn.\n\nChildren are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last\nLook at the great man.\n\nCLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE. LAMPONE\nImmediately arranges for the members of the Five New York\nFamilies to pay their respects.\n\nFirst CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI. Then PHILIP\nTATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.\n\nThen BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.\n\nMICHAEL watches the scene.\n\nBARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined\nBy his men.\n\nAs BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on\nHim; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear\nFrom the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that\nHe is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don\nCorleone.\n\nMICHAEL watches silently.\n\nBARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes. First\nCLEMENZA. Then TESSIO.\n\nCONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes. He\nEmbraces and comforts her.\n\nEverywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching\nAll who come close to him.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (LATER)\n\nLater on the Mall; some people have left, although there are\nStill hundreds of mourners.\n\nA young GIRL approaches TESSIO. She's about 18.\n\nGIRL\nDo you remember me?\n\nTESSIO\nNo...\n\nGIRL\nWe danced together at Connie's\nWedding.\n\nTESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',\nAnd they move though the crowd, looking for Michael. He\nFinds him.\n\nTESSIO\nMike, could I have a minute?\n\nMIKE; nods; and they move to a private place. NERI is close\nBy.\n\nTESSIO\nBarzini wants to arrange a meeting.\nSays we can straighten any of our\nProblems out.\n\nMICHAEL\nHe talked to you?\n\nTESSIO\n(nods)\nI can arrange security.\n\nMICHAEL looks at him.\n\nEXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)\n\nThe Cemetery. Late day.\n\nThe hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the\nStone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in\nQueens Village.\n\nHundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take\nPictures, etc.\n\nMICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\nChrist, Tom; I needed more time\nWith him. I really needed him.\n\nHAGEN\nDid he give you his politicians?\n\nMICHAEL\nNot all...I needed another four\nMonths and I would have had them\nAll.\n(he looks at TOM)\nI guess you've figured it all out?\n\nHAGEN\nHow will they come at you?\n\nMICHAEL\nI know now.\n(a passion wells up\nInside of MICHAEL)\nI'll make them call me Don.\n\nHAGEN\nHave you agreed on a meeting?\n\nMICHAEL\n(nods)\nA week from tonight. In Brooklyn\nOn Tessio's ground, where I'll be\nSafe.\n\nHAGEN looks at him; understands.\n\nMICHAEL\nBut after the Baptism. I've\nDecided to stand as godfather to\nConnie's baby.\n\nThey look up.\n\nThe coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which\nStands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,\nWith the bold inscription: CORLEONE.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)\n\nALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he\nPulls a small trunk from under his bed. He opens it, and we\nSee in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's\nUniform. He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.\nThen the badge, and the identification card; with his\nPicture on it. Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he\nBegins to dress.\n\nINT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)\n\nMICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in\nTheir room. MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is\nBeginning to take on a matronly look.\n\nINT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)\n\nIn a Long Island motel.\n\nROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,\nChecks it, and puts it back together.\n\nEXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)\n\nPETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln. He hesitates,\nTakes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then\nGets in, drives off.\n\nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nThe Church.\n\nVarious relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the\nChurch. They laugh and talk. A MONSIGNOR is officiating.\nNot all of the participants have arrived yet.\n\nCONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO. She holds the\nInfant; showing him off to interested people.\n\nEXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)\n\nNERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN\nBuilding. He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a\nPoliceman. He carries a huge flashlight.\n\nEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)\n\nLAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort\nMotel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising\n\"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY\".\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nThe Church.\n\nCONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and\nMICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.\n\nPRIEST\n(to MICHAEL)\nDo you pledge to guide and protect\nThis child if he is left fatherless?\nDo you promise to shield him\nAgainst the wickedness of the world?\n\nMICHAEL\nYes, I promise.\n\nEXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.\n\nNERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area. He\nContinues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center. On\nHis side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly\nAcross from the main entrance of the building. Slowly he\nApproaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his\nNightstick.\n\nThe DRIVER looks up in surprise.\n\nNERI points to the \"No Parking\" sign.\n\nThe DRIVER turns his head away.\n\nNERI\nOK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or\nYou wanna move?\n\nDRIVER\n(obviously a hood)\nYou better check with your precinct.\n\nNERI\nMove it!\n\nThe DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,\nAnd hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's\nJacket.\n\nNERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street. Then\nHe crooks a finger at the DRIVER.\n\nNERI\nLet me see you license and\nRegistration.\n\nEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY\n\nLAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.\nIt parks. A young, pretty GIRL gets out. Quickly, he\nReturns into the room.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)\n\nCLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel. He\nRounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nThe Church. Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently\nApplies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.\n\nPRIEST\nEphetha...be opened...So you may\nPerceive the fragrance of God's\nSweetness.\n\nEXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)\n\nThe DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center\nIs arguing with NERI.\n\nNow the DRIVER looks up.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nTWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving\nGlass doors.\n\nNERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass\nDoors. The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of\nBARZINI within them.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nIn the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL. The PRIEST hands him\nThe infant.\n\nPRIEST\nDo you renounce Satan.\n\nMICHAEL\nI do renounce him.\n\nPRIEST\nAnd all his works?\n\nMICHAEL\nI do renounce them.\n\nINT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)\n\nLAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down\nThe iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.\nPHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a\nSemi-nude young GIRL leans up.\n\nThey are riddled with gunfire.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)\n\nCLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with\nHis package.\n\nINT DAY: CHURCH\n\nThe PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant\nMICHAEL holds.\n\nPRIEST\nDo you wish to be baptized?\n\nMICHAEL\nI do wish to be baptized.\n\nINT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)\n\nCLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.\n\nHe walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate\nElevator waiting shaft.\n\nThe lights indicate the elevator has arrived.\n\nThe doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with\nThe dapper MOE GREENE.\n\nCLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.\n\nThe PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.\n\nPRIEST\nI christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.\n\nFlash bulbs go off. Everyone is smiles, and crowds around\nMICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.\n\n--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------\n\nEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\n\nThe christening party outside the Church.\n\nFour or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to\nReceive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.\n\nEveryone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.\n\nAs the fuss is going on, a car pulls up. LAMPONE gets out\nAnd works his way to MICHAEL. He whispers in his ear. This\nIs the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.\n\nCONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.\n\nCONNIE\nKiss your Godfather.\n\nThe infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an\nExcuse to back away.\n\nMICHAEL\nCarlo...we've had a change in the\nPlans. Mama, Connie, Kay and the\nKids will have to take the trip out\nTo Vegas without us.\n\nCONNIE\nOh Mike, it's our first vacation\nTogether.\n\nCARLO\n(anxious to please)\nJesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...\n\nMICHAEL\nGo back to your house and wait for\nMe...\n\nHe kisses KAY.\n\nMICHAEL\n(to KAY)\nI'll just be a couple of days...\n\nPeople are guided to the correct limousines; they start to\nDrive off.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN\n\nTESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.\n\nHAGEN enters.\n\nHAGEN\nYou'd better make your call to\nBarzini; Michael's ready.\n\nTESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.\n\nTESSIO\nWe're on our way to Brooklyn.\n\nHe hangs up and smiles.\n\nTESSIO\nI hope Mike can get us a good deal\nTonight.\n\nHAGEN\n(gravely)\nI'm sure he will.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nThe TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car. On their\nWay they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.\n\nBUTTON MAN\nThe boss says he'll come in a\nSeparate car. He says for you two\nTo go on ahead.\n\nTESSIO\n(frowning)\nHell, he can't do that. It screws\nUp all my arrangements.\n\nTHREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.\n\nHAGEN\n(gently)\nI can't go with you either, Tessio.\n\nHe flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he\nPanics, and then he accepts it.\n\nTESSIO\n(after the pause)\nTell Mike it was business...I\nAlways liked him.\n\nHAGEN\nHe understands that.\n\nTESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.\n\nTESSIO\n(softly)\nTom, can you get me off the hook?\nFor old times' sake?\n\nHAGEN\nI can't.\n\nHAGEN turns, and walks away from the group. Then about\nTwenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.\n\nTESSIO is led into a waiting car.\n\nHAGEN looks away, and walks off.\n\nINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\nCARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather\nNervously. He moves to the window and looks out.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nMICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,\nLAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.\n\nThey move toward us.\n\nExcitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.\n\nHe wears a broad smile.\n\nCARLO\nGodfather!\n\nMICHAEL\nYou have to answer for Santino.\n\nThe smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish\nAttempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and\nBacks into the living room.\n\nINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\nThe door opens, and the grim party enters.\n\nMICHAEL\nYou fingered Sonny for the Barzini\nPeople. That little farce you\nPlayed out with my sister. Did\nBarzini kid you that would fool a\nCorleone?\n\nCARLO\n(dignity)\nI swear I'm innocent. I swear on\nThe head of my children, I'm\nInnocent. Mike, don't do this to\nMe, please Mike, don't do this to me!\n\nMICHAEL\n(quietly)\nBarzini is dead. So is Philip\nTattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo\nAnd Moe Greene...I want to square\nAll the family accounts tonight.\nSo don't tell me you're innocent;\nAdmit what you did.\n\nCARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.\n\nMICHAEL\n(almost kindly)\nDon't be frightened. Do you think\nI'd make my sister a widow? Do you\nThink I'd make your children\nFatherless? After all, I'm\nGodfather to your son. No, your\nPunishment is that you're out of\nThe family business. I'm putting\nYou on a plane to Vegas--and I want\nYou to stay there. I'll send\nConnie an allowance, that's all.\nBut don't keep saying you're\nInnocent; it insults my intelligence\nAnd makes me angry. Who approached\nYou, Tattaglia or Barzini?\n\nCARLO\n(sees his way out)\nBarzini.\n\nMICHAEL\n(softly)\nGood, good. Leave now; there's a\nCar waiting to take you to the\nAirport.\n\nCARLO moves to the door; opens it. There is a car waiting;\nWith a group of MEN around it.\n\nHe looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.\n\nMICHAEL\nI'll call your wife and tell her\nWhat flight you're on.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL\n\nCARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his\nThings in the trunk.\n\nONE opens the front door for him.\n\nSOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.\n\nCARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back\nTo see the other man.\n\nIt is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.\n\nThe motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA\nSuddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck. He chokes\nAnd leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.\n\nThe garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.\n\nHis thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.\n\nThen the body goes slack.\n\nCLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car\nDrives off.\n\nEXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)\n\nMICHAEL and his party. They watch.\n\nThen he turns and walks off, and they follow.\n\n---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)\n\nMICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.\n\nThey do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights\nFlash by.\n\nNERI turns back.\n\nNERI\nYou know I would never question\nAnything you say.\n\nMICHAEL\n(smiles)\nSpeak your mind.\n\nNERI\nI'll do this for you; you know I\nShould.\n\nMICHAEL\nNo. This I have to do.\n\nEXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)\n\nMICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an\nItalian Pizzeria. NERI opens the door.\n\nMICHAEL\nSit in the car.\n\nINT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)\n\nHe walks alone into the restaurant. A MAN is tossing pizza\nDough in the air.\n\nMICHAEL\nWhere's the boss?\n\nMAN\nIn the back. Hey Frank, someone\nWants you.\n\nA MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.\n\nMAN\nWhat is it?\n\nHe stops, frozen in fear. It is FABRIZZIO.\n\nVIEW ON MICHAEL. Gunfire from under his coat. FABRIZZIO is\nCut down. MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.\n\nEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\n\nHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL\n\nSeveral moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that\nThese are the final days; the families are moving out; signs\nIndicating that the property is for sale are evident.\n\nA black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,\nThe rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,\nRestrained by MAMA. She manages to break free and runs\nAcross the Mall into Michael's house.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\n\nInside the Corleone house. Big boxes have been packed;\nFurniture prepared for shipping.\n\nCONNIE\nMichael!\n\nShe hurries into the living room, where she comes upon\nMICHAEL and KAY.\n\nKAY\n(comforting)\nConnie...\n\nBut CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL. NERI\nIs watchful.\n\nCONNIE\nYou lousy bastard; you killed my\nHusband...\n\nKAY\nConnie...\n\nCONNIE\nYou waited until our father died\nAnd nobody could stop you and you\nKilled him, you killed him! You\nBlamed him about Sonny, you always\nDid, everybody did. But you never\nThought about me, never gave a damn\nAbout me.\n(crying)\nWhat am I going to do now, what am\nI going to do.\n\nTWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders\nFrom him. But he stands there, waiting for his sister to\nFinish.\n\nKAY\nConnie, how could you say such\nThings?\n\nCONNIE\nWhy do you think he kept Carlo on\nThe Mall? All the time he knew he\nWas going to kill my husband. But\nHe didn't dare while my father was\nAlive. And then he stood Godfather\nTo our child. That coldhearted\nBastard.\n(to KAY)\nAnd do you know how many men he had\nKilled with Carlo? Just read the\nPapers. That's your husband.\n\nShe tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria\nShe has no saliva.\n\nMICHAEL\nGet her home and get a doctor.\n\nThe TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,\nGently but firmly.\n\nKAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from\nMICHAEL. He feels her look.\n\nMICHAEL\nShe's hysterical.\n\nBut KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.\n\nKAY\nMichael, it's not true. Please\nTell me.\n\nMICHAEL\nDon't ask me.\n\nKAY\nTell me!\n\nMICHAEL\nAll right, this one time I'll let\nYou ask about my affairs, one last\nTime.\n\nKAY\nIs it true?\n\nShe looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so\nDirectly that we know he will tell the truth.\n\nMICHAEL\n(after a very long pause)\nNo.\n\nKAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs\nHim. Then she kisses him.\n\nKAY\n(through her tears)\nWe both need a drink.\n\nINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)\n\nShe moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the\nDrinks. From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the\nDrinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the\nHouse with their BODYGUARDS.\n\nShe watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive\nThem.

Are you any good at\nthat?\n\nTIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS.\n\n63.\n\n\n\nINT. OFFICE/DR. PATEL'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n\nDR. PATEL\nYou seemed to have trouble last\nnight.\n\nPAT\nLet me just set the record straight\nabout last night. Hurting my mother\nwas a mistake and I hate myself for\nit, and I hate my illness and I\nwant to control it. My father, on\nthe other hand, had no trouble\nslapping the shit out of me last\nnight, which I did not return\n`cause I could've killed him and I\ndidn't. He's sixty-five years old.\nYou don't think I could've beat the\nshit out of him? I mean....\n\nDR. PATEL\nHe was scared for your mother and\nyou hurt him as well.\n\nPAT\nYes, last night was a mess. Okay?\nAnd I think he probably just tried\nto do his best.\n\nDR. PATEL\nPat, you have to have a strategy. I\ntold you earlier. You need to\nrecognize these feelings coming to\nyou, otherwise you will be sent\nback to Baltimore. So when you get\nthese feelings, you need to get to\na quieter place, and be at peace\nwith yourself, however you can.\n\nPAT\nYeah, but that's easier said than\ndone.\n\nDR. PATEL\nYou have to do it. You have no\nchoice. Excelsior.\n\nPAT\nYeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a\nletter I want you to give Nikki,\nokay?\n\nDR. PATEL\nNo.\n\nPAT\nWhy?\n\n64.\n\n\n\nDR. PATEL\nBecause you have a restraining\norder.\n\nPAT\n\n(SIGHS)\nWhat good are you, man?\n\nDR. PATEL\nWhy did you have this overwhelming\nurgency to see your wedding video\nlast night?\n\nPAT\nOh, I don't know, because I'm\nmarried and I haven't seen my wife\nin eight and a half months?\n\nDR. PATEL\nMaybe you think that Nikki's not\naround and Tiffany's an attractive\ngirl and if you get drawn towards\nTiffany, you will spoil your\nchances of getting Nikki back to\nyou?\n\nPAT\nNot bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't\nthink I'm gonna blow it with Nikki\nbecause Tiffany's a slut.\n\nDR. PATEL\nWhy is she a slut?\n\nPAT\nAfter the dinner at Ronnie's, she\nsaid, quote, \"We can go to the back\nhouse and you can fuck me as long\nas we turn the lights out.\"\nUnquote. And she still wears her\nwedding ring. So she's a loyal,\nmarried-to-a-dead-guy slut.\n\nDR. PATEL\nMaybe she just needs a friend and\nshe thought if she offers you sex,\nit will be easier for you to become\nfriends with her.\n\nPAT\nShe said she's not a whore anymore,\nbut she likes that part of herself\nalong with all the other parts of\nherself and can I say the same?\n\nDR. PATEL\nCan you?\n\n65.\n\n\n\nPAT\nIs that....? You're asking me,\nyou're really asking me that\nquestion?\n\nDR. PATEL\nYes.\n\nPAT\nWith all my crazy sad shit? What,\nare you fucking nuts?\n\nDR. PATEL\nPat, the silver lining thing is\nyours. I'm just giving back your\nwords to you. This \"crazy sad\nshit,\" as you call it, made you a\nhappier, calmer person with a\nbeautiful positive philosophy of\ngoing outdoors, working out, and\nreading books.\n\nPAT\nNo, not the books.\n\nDR. PATEL\nYou said Nikki's friends with\nRonnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if\nyou become friends with Tiffany,\nNikki will think that you're a\nkind, generous, large-hearted\nperson, who helps people in need,\nwho is basically thriving. So if\nyou help Tiffany, it will be good\nfor you.\n\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\n\nPAT RUNS. CAMERA TILTS UP AND MOVES BG. WITH HIM.

So how's your\nthing going -- your dancing thing?\n\nTIFFANY\nIt's good. How's your restraining\norder?\n\nPAT\nI wouldn't actually call the\nrestraining order \"my thing,\" but\ngetting back with Nikki is, and\nI've been doing pretty well. Except\nfor a minor incident at the\ndoctor's office.\n\nTIFFANY\nAnd the so-called incident with the\nweights.\n\nPAT\nYeah. That was a thing with my\nparents. I wish I could just\nexplain it all in a letter to Nikki\nbecause it was minor and I could\njust explain it and let her know\nthat I'm actually not out of\ncontrol and that I'm actually doing\nreally well.\n\nTIFFANY TAKES THIS IN.

You sat on her lap?\n\nTIFFANY\nMm-hmm.\n\nPAT\nShe told you what to do?\n\nTIFFANY\nMm-hmm.\n\nPAT\nOh...my God. Nikki hated when I\ntalked like this. Made me feel like\nsuch a pervert. Maybe we should\nchange the subject.\n\nTIFFANY\nI don't mind it.\n\nPAT\nYou don't, do you.\n\nTIFFANY\nNo. But then people were getting\ninto fights in the parking lot at\nwork, and in the bathroom...and the\nboss called me in to his office and\ntried to pin it all on me. So I\naccused him of harassment and then\nthey fired me, sent me home and put\nme on some meds.\n\n71.\n\n\n\nPAT\nI get it. The song that was playing\nwhen my wife...was in the shower\nwith the history teacher...\n\nTIFFANY\nI heard about that.\n\nPAT\n...it was my wedding song and when\nI hear it, I go kinda crazy.\nSometimes I hear it when it's not\neven playing.\n\nTIFFANY\nWow.\n\nPAT\nYeah.

It was a\ntest. How did I do? I think I did\npretty well.\n\nTIFFANY\nYeah, she said you were cool,\nbasically.\n\nPAT\n\"Basically\"?

How am I? What\ndoes that mean?\n\nTIFFANY\nSort of like me.\n\nPAT\n\"Sort of like you\"? I hope to God\nshe didn't tell Nikki that.\n\nTIFFANY\nWhy?\n\n73.\n\n\n\nPAT\nBecause, it's just not right,\nlumping you and I together, I mean,\nit's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't\nlike that.

I must admit you sound\nterrific and I'm happy that you are\nfeeling so positive and becoming a\nmore loving and caring man, which I\nalways knew you were. I was moved\nto read about `Excelsior' and your\nbelief in happy endings. I am also\nmoved by your act of love to read\nthe books I have taught at the high\nschool. I'm sorry you find them so\nnegative, but I disagree. I think\nthey are great works of art that\nreflect how hard life can be and\nthey can also help kids prepare\nthemselves for the hardness of\nlife. In spite of all these\npositive developments, Pat, I have\nto say if it's me reading the\nsigns, I need to see something to\nprove you are ready to resume our\nmarriage. Otherwise I find myself\nthinking that we might both be\nbetter off moving on with our lives\nseparately. Please don't react\nquickly to this, but take time to\nthink about it.

That's crazy.\n\n125.\n\n\n\nTIFFANY\nThere have been no games since Pat\nand I have been rehearsing every\nday and if Pat had been with me\nlike he was supposed to, he\nwouldn't have gotten in a fight, he\nwouldn't be in trouble, maybe the\nEagles beat the New York Giants.\n\nJAKE\nShe's making a lot of sense, Pop.\nThat's all right on all counts.\n\nTIFFANY\nDoes anybody here happen to know\nwhat the official motto of the\nstate of New York is on the\nofficial seal of the State of New\nYork? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do\nyou? Do you know? \"Excelsior.\" Look\nit up. Yeah, \"Excelsior.\"\n\nDOLORES\nOh Pat.\n\nTIFFANY\nNot that I give a fuck about\nfootball or about your\nsuperstitions, but if it's me\nreading the signs, I don't send the\nEagles guy whose personal motto is\n\"Excelsior,\" to a fucking Giants\ngame, especially when he's already\nin a legal situation.\n\nRONNIE\nUnbelievable.\n\nPAT\nWow. How did you know all that\nstuff?\n\nTIFFANY\nI did my research.\n\nSHE SNAPS OFF A BEER BOTTLE CAP AND DRINKS.\n\nPAT SR.\nWell, I gotta say, I'm impressed.\n\nTIFFANY\nThank you.\n\nPAT SR.\nI gotta rethink this whole thing.

You made the bet, I won a lot\nof money, and now look, your whole\nfamily is in turmoil.\n\nTIFFANY\nOh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.\nYou live for this shit. You've been\nbetting against my father for\nyears.\n\nPAT\nIs that right?\n\nTIFFANY\nYou're twisting the knife right\nnow. You get off on it!\n\nRANDY\nThat's bullshit! That's not true!\nDon't say that!\n\nTIFFANY\nYou get off on it! If not, then\nprove it. Prove it.\n\nPAT SR.\nYeah, prove it, prove it!\n\nRANDY\nHow do you want me to prove it?\n\nPAT SR.\nHow's he gonna prove it?\n\nTIFFANY\nBy giving them the chance to win\nback everything, double or nothing.\n\nPAT\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\nRANDY\nDouble or nothing on the Bengals,\nnext week?

Don't you believe\nin America's Team?\n\nTIFFANY\nYeah, Randy, don't you believe in\nAmerica's Team?\n\nRANDY\nYeah, I believe in America's Team\nbut if I win that bet, I win your\nbook, you're out of action, you get\nno restaurant, no nothing.\n\nPAT SR.\nI like it.\n\nDOLORES\nNo. No, Patrizio--\n\n128.\n\n\n\nPAT SR.\nI believe in the Eagles, I believe\nin my son, I'll take the action.\nI'll take it.\n\nPAT\nDad!\n\nDOLORES\nPatrizio, don't!

I didn't know\nthat \"Excelsior\" was the state\nmotto of New York, okay?\n\nPAT SR.\nI didn't know, either, but now I\nknow.\n\nPAT\nI know, but listen to me, this is\ntoxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is\ntoxic, you shouldn't be doing this,\nyou shouldn't be doing--\n\nPAT SR.\nRandy, what do you say-- (to Pat)\nBe quiet, shut up. You already did\nenough. (to Randy) Randy, what do\nyou say? My birds, Benjamin\nFranklin's team favored by one and\na half points. I'll give you three\nmore.\n\nDOLORES\nPatrizio, stop it!

Cowboys are\ncowards. And I'll bet you're such a\ncoward, you won't take the ten.\nPlus, are you listening, plus\nwhatever their score is at the\ndance thing. (to Tiffany) What's\nthat? Tiffany, what's that?\n\nPAT\nWhat? No, no, no, no.\n\nRANDY\nYou're crazy to give away that many\npoints. That's ridiculous! I won't\ntake that! However, wait a second.\nI do like the idea of a parlay.\n\nDOLORES\nWhat? No parlay! No!\n\nPAT\nNo, don't do it. Don't do it.\n\nRANDY\nPat, how do they run this dance\ncompetition? I mean, how do they\nscore it and everything?\n\nPAT\nI don't know, I don't know how they\nfucking score! We're participating.\nWe're not, we're not a part of it.\nThere are people, this is a high-\nend dance contest. I don't know. Do\nnot put it as part of the parlay,\nRandy. Don't--\n\n130.\n\n\n\nTIFFANY\nThey go by the Philadelphia rules.\nEach dancer is scored on a scale of\none to ten, ten being the highest.\nYou have to average the four\njudges' scores.\n\nRANDY\nOkay, score is from one to ten,\nright? And you guys are how good?\n\nPAT\nWe suck.\n\nTIFFANY\nWe don't suck. Pat's a beginner,\nI'm okay, we're happy just to be\ngoing there.\n\nRANDY\nAnd how are the people you're\ncompeting against?\n\nTIFFANY\nThey're good. Some of them are\nprofessionals.\n\nRANDY\nThey're good? Better than you?\nPause. Tiffany says nothing.\n\nPAT\nA lot better.\n\nRANDY\nA lot better. So if I was to say\nyou only have to score five, I\nwould be really very generous,\nright?\n\nPAT\nNo, no, that would be amazing if we\ngot five. Let's not get away--\n\nTIFFANY\nOh, come on, we can get a five out\nof ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a\nbreak!\n\nPAT\nWe can't get five!\n\nPAT SR.\nGive `em a five. Give `em a five.\n\n131.\n\n\n\nTIFFANY\nWe can do a five.\n\nPAT\nWhat are you talking about, Dad?\nYou haven't even seen us dance!\n\nRANDY\nThat's the parlay.\n\nDR. PATEL\nWill somebody please explain to me\nthe parlay? Please?\n\nRONNIE\nYou gotta win two bets or you lose\nthe whole thing. For Pat Sr. to\nwin, the birds gotta beat the\nCowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta\nget at least a five at the dance.\n\nDR.

Incorporated received a contract to rub out Elliott Fress\nStuttering Sam Goldman gave the order:\n\n[From 'Blue Moon' by The Marcels]\nBomp-a-bomp-bomp....\nDang-a-dang.....\n\nThe job was given to Babyface Latka, notorious East New York trigger man\nAs Fress stepped from his headquarters.....[machine gun fire]\nHis gun still smoking, Babyface called\nStuttering Sam and gave his report:\n[From 'Baby Sittin' Boogie' by Buzz Clifford]\nBoogie, boogie, boogie, all night\n\nHearing the good news, Stuttering Sam rewarded\nHim with Gangland's highest tribute:\n\n[From 'Baby Blue' by The Echoes]\nYou're my baby blue\n\nBut Elliott Fress was still alive\nMurder Incorporated took care of Babyface\nNew York police found his body buried in:\n\n[From 'A Hundred Pounds of Clay' by Gene McDaniels]\nA hundred pounds of clay\n\nThe following day, Canary Cone, another killer\nDisguised as a messenger, delivered a small package\nTo the home of Elliott Fress\nAs the door opened, Canary sang:\n\n[From 'Dedicated To the One I Love' by The Shirelles]\nThis is dedicated to the one I love\n\n[sound of explosion]\nYou might also likeRealizing he was in the wrong house\nThe killer looked down at his victim and said:\n\n[From 'Pony Time' by Chubby Checker]\nIt's Pony time, get up!\n\nTaken into custody, Cone made a full confession\nArmed with this evidence, the Touchables\nSurrounded a Brooklyn warehouse\nHeadquarters of Murder Incorporated\nFress called to Stuttering Sam:\n\n[From 'Surrender' by Elvis Presley]\nOh my darling, please surrender\n\nFrom inside came the answer....[sound of machine gun fire]\n\nAfter a brief gun battle, Stuttering Sam stumbled\nFrom the building, screaming:\n\n[From 'That's It-I Quit-I'm Movon' On' by Sam Cooke]\nThat's it. I Quit\n\nAftraid he might talk, the National Crime Syndicate\nSent two killers disguised as police to the hotel where\nHe was being held. Terrified he pleaded:\n[From 'I Don't Want To Cry' by Chuck Jackson]\nI don't want to cry\n\nHe cried but not for long.....[sound of machine gun fire]\n\nMortally wounded, Stuttering Sam fell from\nA seventeenth story window. His final words were:\n\n[From 'Blue Moon' by The Marcels]\nBomp-a-bomp-bomp.......\nDang-a-dang.....\n\nThis was the end of Murder Incorporated\nCalled to Washington for official ceremonies\nThe Touchables were asked what dangerous assignment\nThey would like next\n\n\"We would like our own television show!\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1243542",

"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Marcel-proust"}, "artist": "Marcel Proust", "lyrics": "Life with Albertine(Chap. 1.2) Lyrics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I put out the light before she came in. It was in the darkness, barely guided by the glow of a smouldering log, that she lay down by my side. My hands, my cheeks alone identified her without my eyes beholding her, my eyes that often were afraid of finding her altered. With the result that by virtue of this unseeing love she may have felt herself bathed in a warmer affection than usual. On other evenings, I undressed, I lay down, and, with Albertine perched on the side of my bed, we resumed our game or our conversation interrupted by kisses; and, in the desire that alone makes us take an interest in the existence and character of another person, we remain so true to our own nature (even if, at the same time, we abandon successively the different people whom we have loved in turn), that on one occasion, catching sight of myself in the glass at the moment when I was kissing Albertine and calling her my little girl, the sorrowful, passionate expression on my own face, similar to the expression it had assumed long ago with Gilberte whom I no longer remembered, and would perhaps assume one day with another girl, if I was fated ever to forget Albertine, made me think that over and above any personal considerations (instinct requiring that we consider the person of the moment as the only true person) I was performing the duties of an ardent and painful devotion dedicated as an oblation to the youth and beauty of Woman. And yet with this desire, honouring youth with an ex voto, with my memories also of Balbec, there was blended, in the need that I felt of keeping Albertine in this way every evening by my side, something that had hitherto been unknown, at least in my amorous existence, if it was not entirely novel in my life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a soothing power the like of which I had not known since the evenings at Combray long ago when my mother, stooping over my bed, brought me repose in a kiss. To be sure, I should have been greatly astonished at that time, had anyone told me that I was not wholly virtuous, and more astonished still to be told that I would ever seek to deprive some one else of a pleasure. I must have known myself very slightly, for my pleasure in having Albertine to live with me was much less a positive pleasure than that of having withdrawn from the world, where everyone was free to enjoy her in turn, the blossoming damsel who, if she did not bring me any great joy, was at least withholding joy from others. Ambition, fame would have left me unmoved. Even more was I incapable of feeling hatred. And yet to me to love in a carnal sense was at any rate to enjoy a triumph over countless rivals. I can never repeat it often enough; it was first and foremost a sedative\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all that I might, before Albertine returned, have doubted her loyalty, have imagined her in the room at Montjouvain, once she was in her dressing-gown and seated facing my chair, or (if, as was more frequent, I had remained in bed) at the foot of my bed, I would deposit my doubts in her, hand them over for her to relieve me of them, with the abnegation of a worshipper uttering his prayer. All the evening she might have been there, huddled in a provoking ball upon my bed, playing with me, like a great cat; her little pink nose, the tip of which she made even tinier with a coquettish glance which gave it that sharpness which we see in certain people who are inclined to be stout, might have given her a fiery and rebellious air; she might have allowed a tress of her long, dark hair to fall over a cheek of rosy wax and, half shutting her eyes, unfolding her arms, have seemed to be saying to me: \u201cDo with me what you please!\u201d; when, as the time came for her to leave me, she drew nearer to say good night, it was a meekness that had become almost a part of my family life that I kissed on either side of her firm throat which now never seemed to me brown or freckled enough, as though these solid qualities had been in keeping with some loyal generosity in Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it was Albertine\u2019s turn to bid me good night, kissing me on either side of my throat, her hair caressed me like a wing of softly bristling feathers. Incomparable as were those two kisses of peace, Albertine slipped into my mouth, making me the gift of her tongue, like a gift of the Holy Spirit, conveyed to me a viaticum, left me with a provision of tranquillity almost as precious as when my mother in the evening at Combray used to lay her lips upon my brow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAre you coming with us to-morrow, you naughty man?\u201d she asked before leaving me. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cThat will depend on the weather and on yourself. But have you written anything to-day, my little darling? No? Then it was hardly worth your while, not coming with us. Tell me, by the way, when I came in, you knew my step, you guessed at once who it was?\u201d \u201cOf course. Could I possibly be mistaken, couldn\u2019t I tell my little sparrow\u2019s hop among a thousand? She must let me take her shoes off, before she goes to bed, it will be such a pleasure to me. You are so nice and pink in all that white lace.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such was my answer; among the sensual expressions, we may recognise others that were peculiar to my grandmother and mother for, little by little, I was beginning to resemble all my relatives, my father who \u2014 in a very different fashion from myself, no doubt, for if things do repeat themselves, it is with great variations \u2014 took so keen an interest in the weather; and not my father only, I was becoming more and more like my aunt L\u00e9onie. Otherwise, Albertine could not but have been a reason for my going out of doors, so as not to leave her by herself, beyond my control. My aunt L\u00e9onie, wrapped up in her religious observances, with whom I could have sworn that I had not a single point in common, I so passionately keen on pleasure, apparently worlds apart from that maniac who had never known any pleasure in her life and lay mumbling her rosary all day long, I who suffered from my inability to embark upon a literary career whereas she had been the one person in the family who could never understand that reading was anything more than an amusing pastime, which made reading, even at the paschal season, lawful upon Sunday, when every serious occupation is forbidden, in order that the day may be hallowed by prayer alone. Now, albeit every day I found an excuse in some particular indisposition which made me so often remain in bed, a person (not Albertine, not any person that I loved, but a person with more power over me than any beloved) had migrated into me, despotic to the extent of silencing at times my jealous suspicions or at least of preventing me from going to find out whether they had any foundation, and this was my aunt L\u00e9onie. It was quite enough that I should bear an exaggerated resemblance to my father, to the extent of not being satisfied like him with consulting the barometer, but becoming an animated barometer myself; it was quite enough that I should allow myself to be ordered by my aunt L\u00e9onie to stay at home and watch the weather, from my bedroom window or even from my bed; yet here I was talking now to Albertine, at one moment as the child that I had been at Combray used to talk to my mother, at another as my grandmother used to talk to me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we have passed a certain age, the soul of the child that we were and the souls of the dead from whom we spring come and bestow upon us in handfuls their treasures and their calamities, asking to be allowed to cooperate in the new sentiments which we are feeling and in which, obliterating their former image, we recast them in an original creation. Thus my whole past from my earliest years, and earlier still the past of my parents and relatives, blended with my impure love for Albertine the charm of an affection at once filial and maternal. We have to give hospitality, at a certain stage in our life, to all our relatives who have journeyed so far and gathered round us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before Albertine obeyed and allowed me to take off her shoes, I opened her chemise. Her two little upstanding breasts were so round that they seemed not so much to be an integral part of her body as to have ripened there like fruit; and her belly (concealing the place where a man\u2019s is marred as though by an iron clamp left sticking in a statue that has been taken down from its niche) was closed, at the junction of her thighs, by two valves of a curve as hushed, as reposeful, as cloistral as that of the horizon after the sun has set. She took off her shoes, and lay down by my side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O mighty attitudes of Man and Woman, in which there seeks to be reunited, in the innocence of the world\u2019s first age and with the humility of clay, what creation has cloven apart, in which Eve is astonished and submissive before the Man by whose side she has awoken, as he himself, alone still, before God Who has fashioned him. Albertine folded her arms behind her dark hair, her swelling hip, her leg falling with the inflexion of a swan\u2019s neck that stretches upwards and then curves over towards its starting point. It was only when she was lying right on her side that one saw a certain aspect of her face (so good and handsome when one looked at it from in front) which I could not endure, hook-nosed as in some of Leonardo\u2019s caricatures, seeming to indicate the shiftiness, the greed for profit, the cunning of a spy whose presence in my house would have filled me with horror and whom that profile seemed to unmask. At once I took Albertine\u2019s face in my hands and altered its position\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBe a good boy, promise me that if you don\u2019t come out to-morrow you will work,\u201d said my mistress as she slipped into her chemise. \u201cYes, but don\u2019t put on your dressing-gown yet.\u201d Sometimes I ended by falling asleep by her side. The room had grown cold, more wood was wanted. I tried to find the bell above my head, but failed to do so, after fingering all the copper rods in turn save those between which it hung, and said to Albertine who had sprung from the bed so that Fran\u00e7oise should not find us lying side by side: \u201cNo, come back for a moment, I can\u2019t find the bell.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comforting moments, gay, innocent to all appearance, and yet moments in which there accumulates in us the never suspected possibility of disaster, which makes the amorous life the most precarious of all, that in which the incalculable rain of sulphur and brimstone falls after the most radiant moments, after which, without having the courage to derive its lesson from our mishap, we set to work immediately to rebuild upon the slopes of the crater from which nothing but catastrophe can emerge. I was as careless as everyone who imagines that his happiness will endure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is precisely because this comfort has been necessary to bring grief to birth \u2014 and will return moreover at intervals to calm it \u2014 that men can be sincere with each other, and even with themselves, when they pride themselves upon a woman\u2019s kindness to them, although, taking things all in all, at the heart of their intimacy there lurks continually in a secret fashion, unavowed to the rest of the world, or revealed unintentionally by questions, inquiries, a painful uncertainty. But as this could not have come to birth without the preliminary comfort, as even afterwards the intermittent comfort is necessary to make suffering endurable and to prevent ruptures, their concealment of the secret hell that life can be when shared with the woman in question, carried to the pitch of an ostentatious display of an intimacy which, they pretend, is precious, expresses a genuine point of view, a universal process of cause and effect, one of the modes in which the production of grief is rendered possible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It no longer surprised me that Albertine should be in the house, and would not be going out to-morrow save with myself or in the custody of Andr\u00e9e. These habits of a life shared in common, this broad outline which defined my existence and within which nobody might penetrate but Albertine, also (in the future plan, of which I was still unaware, of my life to come, like the plan traced by an architect for monumental structures which will not be erected until long afterwards) the remoter lines, parallel to the others but vaster, that sketched in me, like a lonely hermitage, the somewhat rigid and monotonous formula of my future loves, had in reality been traced that night at Balbec when, in the little tram, after Albertine had revealed to me who it was that had brought her up, I had decided at any cost to remove her from certain influences and to prevent her from straying out of my sight for some days to come. Day after day had gone by, these habits had become mechanical, but, like those primitive rites the meaning of which historians seek to discover, I might (but would not) have said to anybody who asked me what I meant by this life of seclusion which I carried so far as not to go any more to the theatre, that its origin was the anxiety of a certain evening, and my need to prove to myself, during the days that followed, that the girl whose unfortunate childhood I had learned should not find it possible, if she wished, to expose herself to similar temptations. I no longer thought, save very rarely, of these possibilities, but they were nevertheless to remain vaguely present in my consciousness. The fact that I was destroying \u2014 or trying to destroy \u2014 them day by day was doubtless the reason why it comforted me to kiss those cheeks which were no more beautiful than many others; beneath any carnal attraction which is at all profound, there is the permanent possibility of danger\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had promised Albertine that, if I did not go out with her, I would settle down to work, but in the morning, just as if, taking advantage of our being asleep, the house had miraculously flown, I awoke in different weather beneath another clime. We do not begin to work at the moment of landing in a strange country to the conditions of which we have to adapt ourself. But each day was for me a different country. Even my laziness itself, beneath the novel forms that it had assumed, how was I to recognise it?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, on days when the weather was, according to everyone, past praying for, the mere act of staying in the house, situated in the midst of a steady and continuous rain, had all the gliding charm, the soothing silence, the interest of a sea voyage; at another time, on a bright day, to lie still in bed was to let the lights and shadows play around me as round a tree-trunk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or yet again, in the first strokes of the bell of a neighbouring convent, rare as the early morning worshippers, barely whitening the dark sky with their fluttering snowfall, melted and scattered by the warm breeze, I had discerned one of those tempestuous, disordered, delightful days, when the roofs soaked by an occasional shower and dried by a breath of wind or a ray of sunshine let fall a cooing eavesdrop, and, as they wait for the wind to resume its turn, preen in the momentary sunlight that has burnished them their pigeon\u2019s-breast of slates, one of those days filled with so many changes of weather, atmospheric incidents, storms, that the idle man does not feel that he has wasted them, because he has been taking an interest in the activity which, in default of himself, the atmosphere, acting in a sense in his stead, has displayed; days similar to those times of revolution or war which do not seem empty to the schoolboy who has played truant from his classroom, because by loitering outside the Law Courts or by reading the newspapers, he has the illusion of finding, in the events that have occurred, failing the lesson which he has not learned, an intellectual profit and an excuse for his idleness; days to which we may compare those on which there occurs in our life some exceptional crisis from which the man who has never done anything imagines that he is going to acquire, if it comes to a happy issue, laborious habits; for instance, the morning on which he sets out for a duel which is to be fought under particularly dangerous conditions; then he is suddenly made aware, at the moment when it is perhaps about to be taken from him, of the value of a life of which he might have made use to begin some important work, or merely to enjoy pleasures, and of which he has failed to make any use at all. \u201cIf I can only not be killed,\u201d he says to himself, \u201chow I shall settle down to work this very minute, and how I shall enjoy myself too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Life has in fact suddenly acquired, in his eyes, a higher value, because he puts into life everything that it seems to him capable of giving, instead of the little that he normally makes it give. He sees it in the light of his desire, not as his experience has taught him that he was apt to make it, that is to say so tawdry! It has, at that moment, become filled with work, travel, mountain-climbing, all the pleasant things which, he tells himself, the fatal issue of the duel may render impossible, whereas they were already impossible before there was any question of a duel, owing to the bad habits which, even had there been no duel, would have persisted. He returns home without even a scratch, but he continues to find the same obstacles to pleasures, excursions, travel, to everything of which he had feared for a moment to be for ever deprived by death; to deprive him of them life has been sufficient. As for work \u2014 exceptional circumstances having the effect of intensifying what previously existed in the man, labour in the laborious, laziness in the lazy \u2014 he takes a holiday\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I followed his example, and did as I had always done since my first resolution to become a writer, which I had made long ago, but which seemed to me to date from yesterday, because I had regarded each intervening day as non-existent. I treated this day in a similar fashion, allowing its showers of rain and bursts of sunshine to pass without doing anything, and vowing that I would begin to work on the morrow. But then I was no longer the same man beneath a cloudless sky; the golden note of the bells did not contain merely (as honey contains) light, but the sensation of light and also the sickly savour of preserved fruits (because at Combray it had often loitered like a wasp over our cleared dinner-table). On this day of dazzling sunshine, to remain until nightfall with my eyes shut was a thing permitted, customary, healthgiving, pleasant, seasonable, like keeping the outside shutters closed against the heat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was in such weather as this that at the beginning of my second visit to Balbec I used to hear the violins of the orchestra amid the bluish flow of the rising tide. How much more fully did I possess Albertine to-day. There were days when the sound of a bell striking the hour bore upon the sphere of its resonance a plate so cool, so richly loaded with moisture or with light that it was like a transcription for the blind, or if you prefer a musical interpretation of the charm of rain or of the charm of the sun. So much so that, at that moment, as I lay in bed, with my eyes shut, I said to myself that everything is capable of transposition and that a universe which was merely audible might be as full of variety as the other. Travelling lazily upstream from day to day, as in a boat, and seeing appear before my eyes an endlessly changing succession of enchanted memories, which I did not select, which a moment earlier had been invisible, and which my mind presented to me one after another, without my being free to choose them, I pursued idly over that continuous expanse my stroll in the sunshine\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those morning concerts at Balbec were not remote in time. And yet, at that comparatively recent moment, I had given but little thought to Albertine. Indeed, on the very first mornings after my arrival, I had not known that she was at Balbec. From whom then had I learned it? Oh, yes, from Aim\u00e9. It was a fine sunny day like this. He was glad to see me again. But he does not like Albertine. Not everybody can be in love with her. Yes, it was he who told me that she was at Balbec. But how did he know? Ah! he had met her, had thought that she had a bad style. At that moment, as I regarded Aim\u00e9\u2018s story from another aspect than that in which he had told me it, my thoughts, which hitherto had been sailing blissfully over these untroubled waters, exploded suddenly, as though they had struck an invisible and perilous mine, treacherously moored at this point in my memory. He had told me that he had met her, that he had thought her style bad. What had he meant by a bad style? I had understood him to mean a vulgar manner, because, to contradict him in advance, I had declared that she was most refined. But no, perhaps he had meant the style of Gomorrah. She was with another girl, perhaps their arms were round one another\u2019s waist, they were staring at other women, they were indeed displaying a \u2018style\u2019 which I had never seen Albertine adopt in my presence. Who was the other girl, where had Aim\u00e9 met her, this odious Albertine?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I tried to recall exactly what Aim\u00e9 had said to me, in order to see whether it could be made to refer to what I imagined, or he had meant nothing more than common manners. But in vain might I ask the question, the person who put it and the person who might supply the recollection were, alas, one and the same person, myself, who was momentarily duplicated but without adding anything to my stature. Question as I might, it was myself who answered, I learned nothing fresh. I no longer gave a thought to Mlle. Vinteuil. Born of a novel suspicion, the fit of jealousy from which I was suffering was novel also, or rather it was only the prolongation, the extension of that suspicion, it had the same theatre, which was no longer Montjouvain, but the road upon which Aim\u00e9 had met Albertine, and for its object the various friends one or other of whom might be she who had been with Albertine that day. It was perhaps a certain Elisabeth, or else perhaps those two girls whom Albertine had watched in the mirror at the Casino, while appearing not to notice them. She had doubtless been having relations with them, and also with Esther, Bloch\u2019s cousin. Such relations, had they been revealed to me by a third person, would have been enough almost to kill me, but as it was myself that was imagining them, I took care to add sufficient uncertainty to deaden the pain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We succeed in absorbing daily, under the guise of suspicions, in enormous doses, this same idea that we are being betrayed, a quite minute quantity of which might prove fatal, if injected by the needle of a stabbing word. It is no doubt for that reason, and by a survival of the instinct of self-preservation, that the same jealous man does not hesitate to form the most terrible suspicions upon a basis of innocuous details, provided that, whenever any proof is brought to him, he may decline to accept its evidence. Anyhow, love is an incurable malady, like those diathetic states in which rheumatism affords the sufferer a brief respite only to be replaced by epileptiform headaches. Was my jealous suspicion calmed, I then felt a grudge against Albertine for not having been gentle with me, perhaps for having made fun of me to Andr\u00e9e. I thought with alarm of the idea that she must have formed if Andr\u00e9e had repeated all our conversations; the future loomed black and menacing. This mood of depression left me only if a fresh jealous suspicion drove me upon another quest or if, on the other hand, Albertine\u2019s display of affection made the actual state of my fortunes seem to me immaterial. Whoever this girl might be, I should have to write to Aim\u00e9, to try to see him, and then I should check his statement by talking to Albertine, hearing her confession. In the meantime, convinced that it must be Bloch\u2019s cousin, I asked Bloch himself, who had not the remotest idea of my purpose, simply to let me see her photograph, or, better still, to arrange if possible for me to meet her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How many persons, cities, roads does not jealousy make us eager thus to know? It is a thirst for knowledge thanks to which, with regard to various isolated points, we end by acquiring every possible notion in turn except those that we require. We can never tell whether a suspicion will not arise, for, all of a sudden, we recall a sentence that was not clear, an alibi that cannot have been given us without a purpose. And yet, we have not seen the person again, but there is such a thing as a posthumous jealousy, that is born only after we have left her, a jealousy of the doorstep. Perhaps the habit that I had formed of nursing in my bosom several simultaneous desires, a desire for a young girl of good family such as I used to see pass beneath my window escorted by her governess, and especially of the girl whom Saint-Loup had mentioned to me, the one who frequented houses of ill fame, a desire for handsome lady\u2019s-maids, and especially for the maid of Mme. Putbus, a desire to go to the country in early spring, to see once again hawthorns, apple trees in blossom, storms at sea, a desire for Venice, a desire to settle down to work, a desire to live like other people \u2014 perhaps the habit of storing up, without assuaging any of them, all these desires, contenting myself with the promise, made to myself, that I would not forget to satisfy them one day, perhaps this habit, so many years old already, of perpetual postponement, of what M. de Charlus used to castigate under the name of procrastination, had become so prevalent in me that it assumed control of my jealous suspicions also and, while it made me take a mental note that I would not fail, some day, to have an explanation from Albertine with regard to the girl, possibly the girls (this part of the story was confused, rubbed out, that is to say obliterated, in my memory) with whom Aim\u00e9 had met her, made me also postpone this explanation. In any case, I would not mention it this evening to my mistress for fear of making her think me jealous and so offending her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet when, on the following day, Bloch had sent me the photograph of his cousin Esther, I made haste to forward it to Aim\u00e9. And at the same moment I remembered that Albertine had that morning refused me a pleasure which might indeed have tired her. Was that in order to reserve it for some one else? This afternoon, perhaps? For whom?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus it is that jealousy is endless, for even if the beloved object, by dying for instance, can no longer provoke it by her actions, it so happens that posthumous memories, of later origin than any event, take shape suddenly in our minds as though they were events also, memories which hitherto we have never properly explored, which had seemed to us unimportant, and to which our own meditation upon them has been sufficient, without any external action, to give a new and terrible meaning. We have no need of her company, it is enough to be alone in our room, thinking, for fresh betrayals of us by our mistress to come to light, even though she be dead. And so we ought not to fear in love, as in everyday life, the future alone, but even the past which often we do not succeed in realising until the future has come and gone; and we are not speaking only of the past which we discover long afterwards, but of the past which we have long kept stored up in ourselves and learn suddenly how to interpret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No matter, I was very glad, now that afternoon was turning to evening, that the hour was not far off when I should be able to appeal to Albertine\u2019s company for the consolation of which I stood in need. Unfortunately, the evening that followed was one of those on which this consolation was not afforded me, on which the kiss that Albertine would give me when she left me for the night, very different from her ordinary kiss, would no more soothe me than my mother\u2019s kiss had soothed me long ago, on days when she was vexed with me and I dared not send for her, but at the same time knew that I should not be able to sleep. Such evenings were now those on which Albertine had formed for the morrow some plan of which she did not wish me to know. Had she confided in me, I would have employed, to assure its successful execution, an ardour which none but Albertine could have inspired in me. But she told me nothing, nor had she any need to tell me anything; as soon as she came in, before she had even crossed the threshold of my room, as she was still wearing her hat or toque, I had already detected the unknown, restive, desperate, indomitable desire. Now, these were often the evenings when I had awaited her return with the most loving thoughts, and looked forward to throwing my arms round her neck with the warmest affection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, those misunderstandings that I had often had with my parents, whom I found cold or cross at the moment when I was running to embrace them, overflowing with love, are nothing in comparison with these that occur between lovers! The anguish then is far less superficial, far harder to endure, it has its abode in a deeper stratum of the heart. This evening, however, Albertine was obliged to mention the plan that she had in her mind; I gathered at once that she wished to go next day to pay a call on Mme. Verdurin, a call to which in itself I would have had no objection. But evidently her object was to meet some one there, to prepare some future pleasure. Otherwise she would not have attached so much importance to this call. That is to say, she would not have kept on assuring me that it was of no importance. I had in the course of my life developed in the opposite direction to those races which make use of phonetic writing only after regarding the letters of the alphabet as a set of symbols; I, who for so many years had sought for the real life and thought of other people only in the direct statements with which they furnished me of their own free will, failing these had come to attach importance, on the contrary, only to the evidence that is not a rational and analytical expression of the truth; the words themselves did not enlighten me unless they could be interpreted in the same way as a sudden rush of blood to the cheeks of a person who is embarrassed, or, what is even more telling, a sudden silence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some subsidiary word (such as that used by M. de Cambremer when he understood that I was \u2018literary,\u2019 and, not having spoken to me before, as he was describing a visit that he had paid to the Verdurins, turned to me with: \u201cWhy, Boreli was there!\u201d) bursting into flames at the unintended, sometimes perilous contact of two ideas which the speaker has not expressed, but which, by applying the appropriate methods of analysis or electrolysis I was able to extract from it, told me more than a long speech\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine sometimes allowed to appear in her conversation one or other of these precious amalgams which I made haste to \u2018treat\u2019 so as to transform them into lucid ideas. It is by the way one of the most terrible calamities for the lover that if particular details \u2014 which only experiment, espionage, of all the possible realisations, would ever make him know \u2014 are so difficult to discover, the truth on the other hand is easy to penetrate or merely to feel by instinct\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often I had seen her, at Balbec, fasten upon some girls who came past us a sharp and lingering stare, like a physical contact, after which, if I knew the girls, she would say to me: \u201cSuppose we asked them to join us? I should so love to be rude to them.\u201d And now, for some time past, doubtless since she had succeeded in reading my character, no request to me to invite anyone, not a word, never even a sidelong glance from her eyes, which had become objectless and mute, and as revealing, with the vague and vacant expression of the rest of her face, as had been their magnetic swerve before. Now it was impossible for me to reproach her, or to ply her with questions about things which she would have declared to be so petty, so trivial, things that I had stored up in my mind simply for the pleasure of making mountains out of molehills. It is hard enough to say: \u201cWhy did you stare at that girl who went past?\u201d but a great deal harder to say: \u201cWhy did you not stare at her?\u201d And yet I knew quite well, or at least I should have known, if I had not chosen to believe Albertine\u2019s assertions rather than all the trivialities contained in a glance, proved by it and by some contradiction or other in her speech, a contradiction which often I did not perceive until long after I had left her, which kept me on tenterhooks all the night long, which I never dared mention to her again, but which nevertheless continued to honour my memory from time to time with its periodical visits\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often, in the case of these furtive or sidelong glances on the beach at Balbec or in the streets of Paris, I might ask myself whether the person who provoked them was not merely at the moment when she passed an object of desire but was an old acquaintance, or else some girl who had simply been mentioned to her, and of whom, when I heard about it, I was astonished that anybody could have spoken to her, so utterly unlike was she to anyone that Albertine could possibly wish to know. But the Gomorrah of to-day is a dissected puzzle made up of fragments which are picked up in the places where we least expected to find them. Thus I once saw at Rivebelle a big dinner-party of ten women, all of whom I happened to know \u2014 at least by name \u2014 women as unlike one another as possible, perfectly united nevertheless, so much so that I never saw a party so homogeneous, albeit so composite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to the girls whom we passed in the street, never did Albertine gaze at an old person, man or woman, with such fixity, or on the other hand with such reserve, and as though she saw nothing. The cuckolded husbands who know nothing know everything all the same. But it requires more accurate and abundant evidence to create a scene of jealousy. Besides, if jealousy helps us to discover a certain tendency to falsehood in the woman whom we love, it multiplies this tendency an hundredfold when the woman has discovered that we are jealous. She lies (to an extent to which she has never lied to us before), whether from pity, or from fear, or because she instinctively withdraws by a methodical flight from our investigations. Certainly there are love affairs in which from the start a light woman has posed as virtue incarnate in the eyes of the man who is in love with her. But how many others consist of two diametrically opposite periods? In the first, the woman speaks almost spontaneously, with slight modifications, of her zest for sensual pleasure, of the gay life which it has made her lead, things all of which she will deny later on, with the last breath in her body, to the same man \u2014 when she has felt that he is jealous of and spying upon her. He begins to think with regret of the days of those first confidences, the memory of which torments him nevertheless. If the woman continued to make them, she would furnish him almost unaided with the secret of her conduct which he has been vainly pursuing day after day. And besides, what a surrender that would mean, what trust, what friendship. If she cannot live without betraying him, at least she would be betraying him as a friend, telling him of her pleasures, associating him with them. And he thinks with regret of the sort of life which the early stages of their love seemed to promise, which the sequel has rendered impossible, making of that love a thing exquisitely painful, which will render a final parting, according to circumstances, either inevitable or impossible\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the script from which I deciphered Albertine\u2019s falsehoods, without being ideographic needed simply to be read backwards; so this evening she had flung at me in a careless tone the message, intended to pass almost unheeded: \u201cIt is possible that I may go to-morrow to the Verdurins\u2019, I don\u2019t in the least know whether I shall go, I don\u2019t really want to.\u201d A childish anagram of the admission: \u201cI shall go to-morrow to the Verdurins\u2019, it is absolutely certain, for I attach the utmost importance to the visit.\u201d This apparent hesitation indicated a resolute decision and was intended to diminish the importance of the visit while warning me of it. Albertine always adopted a tone of uncertainty in speaking of her irrevocable decisions. Mine was no less irrevocable. I took steps to arrange that this visit to Mme. Verdurin should not take place. Jealousy is often only an uneasy need to be tyrannical, applied to matters of love. I had doubtless inherited from my father this abrupt, arbitrary desire to threaten the people whom I loved best in the hopes with which they were lulling themselves with a security that I determined to expose to them as false; when I saw that Albertine had planned without my knowledge, behind my back, an expedition which I would have done everything in the world to make easier and more pleasant for her, had she taken me into her confidence, I said carelessly, so as to make her tremble, that I intended to go out the next day myself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I set to work to suggest to Albertine other expeditions in directions which would have made this visit to the Verdurins impossible, in words stamped with a feigned indifference beneath which I strove to conceal my excitement. But she had detected it. It encountered in her the electric shock of a contrary will which violently repulsed it; I could see the sparks flash from her eyes. Of what use, though, was it to pay attention to what her eyes were saying at that moment? How had I failed to observe long ago that Albertine\u2019s eyes belonged to the class which even in a quite ordinary person seem to be composed of a number of fragments, because of all the places which the person wishes to visit \u2014 and to conceal her desire to visit \u2014 that day. Those eyes which their falsehood keeps ever immobile and passive, but dynamic, measurable in the yards or miles to be traversed before they reach the determined, the implacably determined meeting-place, eyes that are not so much smiling at the pleasure which tempts them as they are shadowed with melancholy and discouragement because there may be a difficulty in their getting to the meeting-place. Even when you hold them in your hands, these people are fugitives. To understand the emotions which they arouse, and which other people, even better looking, do not arouse, we must take into account that they are not immobile but in motion, and add to their person a sign corresponding to what in physics is the sign that indicates velocity. If you upset their plans for the day, they confess to you the pleasure that they had hidden from you: \u201cI did so want to go to tea at five o\u2019clock with So-and-So, my dearest friend.\u201d Very well, if, six months later, you come to know the person in question, you will learn that the girl whose plans you upset, who, caught in the trap, in order that you might set her free, confessed to you that she was in the habit of taking tea like this with a dear friend, every day at the hour at which you did not see her \u2014 has never once been inside this person\u2019s house, that they have never taken tea together, and that the girl used to explain that her whole time was take up by none other than yourself. And so the person with whom she confessed that she had gone to tea, with whom she begged you to allow her to go to tea, that person, the excuse that necessity made her plead, was not the real person, there was somebody, something else! Something else, what? Some one, who?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, the kaleidoscopic eyes starting off into the distance and shadowed with melancholy might enable us perhaps to measure distance, but do not indicate direction. The boundless field of possibilities extends before us, and if by any chance the reality presented itself to our gaze, it would be so far beyond the bounds of possibility that, dashing suddenly against the boundary wall, we should fall over backwards. It is not even essential that we should have proof of her movement and flight, it is enough that we should guess them. She had promised us a letter, we were calm, we were no longer in love. The letter has not come; no messenger appears with it; what can have happened? anxiety is born afresh, and love. It is such people more than any others who inspire love in us, for our destruction. For every fresh anxiety that we feel on their account strips them in our eyes of some of their personality. We were resigned to suffering, thinking that we loved outside ourselves, and we perceive that our love is a function of our sorrow, that our love perhaps is our sorrow, and that its object is, to a very small extent only, the girl with the raven tresses. But, when all is said, it is these people more than any others who inspire love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Generally speaking, love has not as its object a human body, except when an emotion, the fear of losing it, the uncertainty of finding it again have been infused into it. This sort of anxiety has a great affinity for bodies. It adds to them a quality which surpasses beauty even; which is one of the reasons why we see men who are indifferent to the most beautiful women fall passionately in love with others who appear to us ugly. To these people, these fugitives, their own nature, our anxiety fastens wings. And even when they are in our company the look in their eyes seems to warn us that they are about to take flight. The proof of this beauty, surpassing the beauty added by the wings, is that very often the same person is, in our eyes, alternately wingless and winged. Afraid of losing her, we forget all the others. Sure of keeping her, we compare her with those others whom at once we prefer to her. And as these emotions and these certainties may vary from week to week, a person may one week see sacrificed to her everything that gave us pleasure, in the following week be sacrificed herself, and so for weeks and months on end. All of which would be incomprehensible did we not know from the experience, which every man shares, of having at least once in a lifetime ceased to love, forgotten a woman, for how very little a person counts in herself when she is no longer \u2014 or is not yet \u2014 permeable by our emotions. And, be it understood, what we say of fugitives is equally true of those in prison, the captive women, we suppose that we are never to possess them. And so men detest procuresses, for these facilitate the flight, enhance the temptation, but if on the other hand they are in love with a cloistered woman, they willingly have recourse to a procuress to make her emerge from her prison and bring her to them. In so far as relations with women whom we abduct are less permanent than others, the reason is that the fear of not succeeding in procuring them or the dread of seeing them escape is the whole of our love for them and that once they have been carried off from their husbands, torn from their footlights, cured of the temptation to leave us, dissociated in short from our emotion whatever it may be, they are only themselves, that is to say almost nothing, and, so long desired, are soon forsaken by the very man who was so afraid of their forsaking him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How, I have asked, did I not guess this? But had I not guessed it from the first day at Balbec? Had I not detected in Albertine one of those girls beneath whose envelope of flesh more hidden persons are stirring, than in . . . I do not say a pack of cards still in its box, a cathedral or a theatre before we enter it, but the whole, vast, ever changing crowd? Not only all these persons, but the desire, the voluptuous memory, the desperate quest of all these persons. At Balbec I had not been troubled because I had never even supposed that one day I should be following a trail, even a false trail. No matter! This had given Albertine, in my eyes, the plenitude of a person filled to the brim by the superimposition of all these persons, and desires and voluptuous memories of persons. And now that she had one day let fall the words \u2018Mlle. Vinteuil,\u2019 I would have wished not to tear off her garments so as to see her body but through her body to see and read that memorandum block of her memories and her future, passionate engagements\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How suddenly do the things that are probably the most insignificant assume an extraordinary value when a person whom we love (or who has lacked only this duplicity to make us love her) conceals them from us! In itself, suffering does not of necessity inspire in us sentiments of love or hatred towards the person who causes it: a surgeon can hurt our body without arousing any personal emotion. But a woman who has continued for some time to assure us that we are everything in the world to her, without being herself everything in the world to us, a woman whom we enjoy seeing, kissing, taking upon our knee, we are astonished if we merely feel from a sudden resistance that we are not free to dispose of her life. Disappointment may then revive in us the forgotten memory of an old anguish, which we know, all the same, to have been provoked not by this woman but by others whose betrayals are milestones in our past life; if it comes to that, how have we the courage to wish to live, how can we move a finger to preserve ourselves from death, in a world in which love is provoked only by falsehood, and consists merely in our need to see our sufferings appeased by the person who has made us suffer? To restore us from the collapse which follows our discovery of her falsehood and her resistance, there is the drastic remedy of endeavouring to act against her will, with the help of people whom we feel to be more closely involved than we are in her life, upon her who is resisting us and lying to us, to play the cheat in turn, to make ourselves loathed. But the suffering caused by such a love is of the sort which must inevitably lead the sufferer to seek in a change of posture an illusory comfort\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These means of action are not wanting, alas! And the horror of the kind of love which uneasiness alone has engendered lies in the fact that we turn over and over incessantly in our cage the most trivial utterances; not to mention that rarely do the people for whom we feel this love appeal to us physically in a complex fashion, since it is not our deliberate preference, but the chance of a minute of anguish, a minute indefinitely prolonged by our weakness of character, which repeats its experiments every evening until it yields to sedatives, that chooses for us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt my love for Albertine was not the most barren of those to which, through feebleness of will, a man may descend, for it was not entirely platonic; she did give me carnal satisfaction and, besides, she was intelligent. But all this was a superfluity. What occupied my mind was not the intelligent remark that she might have made, but some chance utterance that had aroused in me a doubt as to her actions; I tried to remember whether she had said this or that, in what tone, at what moment, in response to what speech of mine, to reconstruct the whole scene of her dialogue with me, to recall at what moment she had expressed a desire to call upon the Verdurins, what words of mine had brought that look of vexation to her face. The most important matter might have been in question, without my giving myself so much trouble to establish the truth, to restore the proper atmosphere and colour. No doubt, after these anxieties have intensified to a degree which we find insupportable, we do sometimes manage to soothe them altogether for an evening. The party to which the mistress whom we love is engaged to go, the true nature of which our mind has been toiling for days to discover, we are invited to it also, our mistress has neither looks nor words for anyone but ourselves, we take her home and then we enjoy, all our anxieties dispelled, a repose as complete, as healing, as that which we enjoy at times in the profound sleep that comes after a long walk. And no doubt such repose deserves that we should pay a high price for it. But would it not have been more simple not to purchase for ourselves, deliberately, the preceding anxiety, and at a higher price still? Besides, we know all too well that however profound these momentary relaxations may be, anxiety will still be the stronger. Sometimes indeed it is revived by the words that were intended to bring us repose. But as a rule, all that we do is to change our anxiety. One of the words of the sentence that was meant to calm us sets our suspicions running upon another trail. The demands of our jealousy and the blindness of our credulity are greater than the woman whom we love could ever suppose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, of her own accord, she swears to us that some man is nothing more to her than a friend, she appalls us by informing us \u2014 a thing we never suspected \u2014 that he has been her friend. While she is telling us, in proof of her sincerity, how they took tea together, that very afternoon, at each word that she utters the invisible, the unsuspected takes shape before our eyes. She admits that he has asked her to be his mistress, and we suffer agonies at the thought that she can have listened to his overtures. She refused them, she says. But presently, when we recall what she told us, we shall ask ourselves whether her story is really true, for there is wanting, between the different things that she said to us, that logical and necessary connexion which, more than the facts related, is a sign of the truth. Besides, there was that terrible note of scorn in her: \u201cI said to him no, absolutely,\u201d which is to be found in every class of society, when a woman is lying. We must nevertheless thank her for having refused, encourage her by our kindness to repeat these cruel confidences in the future. At the most, we may remark: \u201cBut if he had already made advances to you, why did you accept his invitation to tea?\u201d \u201cSo that he should not be angry with me and say that I hadn\u2019t been nice to him.\u201d And we dare not reply that by refusing she would perhaps have been nicer to us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine alarmed me further when she said that I was quite right to say, out of regard for her reputation, that I was not her lover, since \u201cfor that matter,\u201d she went on, \u201cit\u2019s perfectly true that you aren\u2019t.\u201d I was not her lover perhaps in the full sense of the word, but then, was I to suppose that all the things that we did together she did also with all the other men whose mistress she swore to me that she had never been? The desire to know at all costs what Albertine was thinking, whom she was seeing, with whom she was in love, how strange it was that I should be sacrificing everything to this need, since I had felt the same need to know, in the case of Gilberte, names, facts, which now left me quite indifferent. I was perfectly well aware that in themselves Albertine\u2019s actions were of no greater interest. It is curious that a first love, if by the frail state in which it leaves our heart it opens the way to our subsequent loves, does not at least provide us, in view of the identity of symptoms and sufferings, with the means of curing them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After all, is there any need to know a fact? Are we not aware beforehand, in a general fashion, of the mendacity and even the discretion of those women who have something to conceal? Is there any possibility of error? They make a virtue of their silence, when we would give anything to make them speak. And we feel certain that they have assured their accomplice: \u201cI never tell anything. It won\u2019t be through me that anybody will hear about it, I never tell anything.\u201d A man may give his fortune, his life for a person, and yet know quite well that in ten years\u2019 time, more or less, he would refuse her the fortune, prefer to keep his life. For then the person would be detached from him, alone, that is to say null and void. What attaches us to people are those thousand roots, those innumerable threads which are our memories of last night, our hopes for to-morrow morning, those continuous trammels of habit from which we can never free ourselves. Just as there are misers who hoard money from generosity, so we are spendthrifts who spend from avarice, and it is not so much to a person that we sacrifice our life as to all that the person has been able to attach to herself of our hours, our days, of the things compared with which the life not yet lived, the relatively future life, seems to us more remote, more detached, less practical, less our own. What we require is to disentangle ourselves from those trammels which are so much more important than the person, but they have the effect of creating in us temporary obligations towards her, obligations which mean that we dare not leave her for fear of being misjudged by her, whereas later on we would so dare for, detached from us, she would no longer be ourselves, and because in reality we create for ourselves obligations (even if, by an apparent contradiction, they should lead to suicide) towards ourselves alone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I was not in love with Albertine (and of this I could not be sure) then there was nothing extraordinary in the place that she occupied in my life: we live only with what we do not love, with what we have brought to live with us only to kill the intolerable love, whether it be of a woman, of a place, or again of a woman embodying a place. Indeed we should be sorely afraid to begin to love again if a further separation were to occur. I had not yet reached this stage with Albertine. Her falsehoods, her admissions, left me to complete the task of elucidating the truth: her innumerable falsehoods because she was not content with merely lying, like everyone who imagines that he or she is loved, but was by nature, quite apart from this, a liar, and so inconsistent moreover that, even if she told me the truth every time, told me what, for instance, she thought of other people, she would say each time something different; her admissions, because, being so rare, so quickly cut short, they left between them, in so far as they concerned the past, huge intervals quite blank over the whole expanse of which I was obliged to retrace \u2014 and for that first of all to learn \u2014 her life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the present, so far as I could interpret the sibylline utterances of Fran\u00e7oise, it was not only in particular details, it was as a whole that Albertine was lying to me, and \u2018one fine day\u2019 I would see what Fran\u00e7oise made a pretence of knowing, what she refused to tell me, what I dared not ask her. It was no doubt with the same jealousy that she had felt in the past with regard to Eulalie that Fran\u00e7oise would speak of the most improbable things, so vague that one could at the most suppose them to convey the highly improbable insinuation that the poor captive (who was a lover of women) preferred marriage with somebody who did not appear altogether to be myself. If this were so, how, notwithstanding her power of radiotelepathy, could Fran\u00e7oise have come to hear of it? Certainly, Albertine\u2019s statements could give me no definite enlightenment, for they were as different day by day as the colours of a spinning-top that has almost come to a standstill. However, it seemed that it was hatred, more than anything else, that impelled Fran\u00e7oise to speak. Not a day went by but she said to me, and I in my mother\u2019s absence endured such speeches as:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo be sure, you yourself are kind, and I shall never forget the debt of gratitude that I owe to you\u201d (this probably so that I might establish fresh claims upon her gratitude) \u201cbut the house has become a plague-spot now that kindness has set up knavery in it, now that cleverness is protecting the stupidest person that ever was seen, now that refinement, good manners, wit, dignity in everything allow to lay down the law and rule the roost and put me to shame, who have been forty years in the family \u2014 vice, everything that is most vulgar and abject.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Fran\u00e7oise resented most about Albertine was having to take orders from somebody who was not one of ourselves, and also the strain of the additional housework which was affecting the health of our old servant, who would not, for all that, accept any help in the house, not being a \u2018good for nothing.\u2019 This in itself would have accounted for her nervous exhaustion, for her furious hatred. Certainly, she would have liked to see Albertine-Esther banished from the house. This was Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s dearest wish. And, by consoling her, its fulfilment alone would have given our old servant some repose. But to my mind there was more in it than this. So violent a hatred could have originated only in an overstrained body. And, more even than of consideration, Fran\u00e7oise was in need of sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine went to take off her things and, so as to lose no time in finding out what I wanted to know, I attempted to telephone to Andr\u00e9e; I took hold of the receiver, invoked the implacable deities, but succeeded only in arousing their fury which expressed itself in the single word \u2018Engaged!\u2019 Andr\u00e9e was indeed engaged in talking to some one else. As I waited for her to finish her conversation, I asked myself how it was \u2014 now that so many of our painters are seeking to revive the feminine portraits of the eighteenth century, in which the cleverly devised setting is a pretext for portraying expressions of expectation, spleen, interest, distraction \u2014 how it was that none of our modern Bouchers or Fragonards had yet painted, instead of \u2018The Letter\u2019 or \u2018The Harpsichord,\u2019 this scene which might be entitled \u2018At the Telephone,\u2019 in which there would come spontaneously to the lips of the listener a smile all the more genuine in that it is conscious of being unobserved. At length, Andr\u00e9e was at the other end: \u201cYou are coming to call for Albertine to-morrow?\u201d I asked, and as I uttered Albertine\u2019s name, thought of the envy I had felt for Swann when he said to me on the day of the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s party: \u201cCome and see Odette,\u201d and I had thought how, when all was said, there must be something in a Christian name which, in the eyes of the whole world including Odette herself, had on Swann\u2019s lips alone this entirely possessive sense\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must not such an act of possession \u2014 summed up in a single word \u2014 over the whole existence of another person (I had felt whenever I was in love) be pleasant indeed! But, as a matter of fact, when we are in a position to utter it, either we no longer care, or else habit has not dulled the force of affection, but has changed its pleasure into pain. Falsehood is a very small matter, we live in the midst of it without doing anything but smile at it, we practise it without meaning to do any harm to anyone, but our jealousy is wounded by it, and sees more than the falsehood conceals (often our mistress refuses to spend the evening with us and goes to the theatre simply so that we shall not notice that she is not looking well). How blind it often remains to what the truth is concealing! But it can extract nothing, for those women who swear that they are not lying would refuse, on the scaffold, to confess their true char \u2014 acter. I knew that I alone was in a position to say \u2018Albertine\u2019 in that tone to Andr\u00e9e. And yet, to Albertine, to Andr\u00e9e, and to myself, I felt that I was nothing. And I realised the impossibility against which love is powerless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We imagine that love has as its object a person whom we can see lying down before our eyes, enclosed in a human body. Alas, it is the extension of that person to all the points in space and time which the person has occupied and will occupy. If we do not possess its contact with this or that place, this or that hour, we do not possess it. But we cannot touch all these points. If only they were indicated to us, we might perhaps contrive to reach out to them. But we grope for them without finding them. Hence mistrust, jealousy, persecutions. We waste precious time upon absurd clues and pass by the truth without suspecting it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But already one of the irascible deities, whose servants speed with the agility of lightning, was annoyed, not because I was speaking, but because I was saying nothing. \u201cCome along, I\u2019ve been holding the line for you all this time; I shall cut you off.\u201d However, she did nothing of the sort but, as she evoked Andr\u00e9e\u2019s presence, enveloped it, like the great poet that a telephone girl always is, in the atmosphere peculiar to the home, the district, the very life itself of Albertine\u2019s friend. \u201cIs that you?\u201d asked Andr\u00e9e, whose voice was projected towards me with an instantaneous speed by the goddess whose privilege it is to make sound more swift than light. \u201cListen,\u201d I replied; \u201cgo wherever you like, anywhere, except to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s. Whatever happens, you simply must keep Albertine away from there to-morrow.\u201d \u201cWhy, that\u2019s where she promised to go to-morrow.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I was obliged to break off the conversation for a moment and to make menacing gestures, for if Fran\u00e7oise continued \u2014 as though it had been something as unpleasant as vaccination or as dangerous as the aeroplane \u2014 to refuse to learn to telephone, whereby she would have spared us the trouble of conversations which she might intercept without any harm, on the other hand she would at once come into the room whenever I was engaged in a conversation so private that I was particularly anxious to keep it from her ears. When she had left the room, not without lingering to take away various things that had been lying there since the previous day and might perfectly well have been left there for an hour longer, and to place in the grate a log that was quite unnecessary in view of my burning fever at the intruder\u2019s presence and my fear of finding myself \u2018cut off\u2019 by the operator: \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d I said to Andr\u00e9e, \u201cI was interrupted. Is it absolutely certain that she has to go to the Verdurins\u2019 tomorrow?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely, but I can tell her that you don\u2019t like it.\u201d \u201cNo, not at all, but it is possible that I may come with you.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Andr\u00e9e, in a tone of extreme annoyance and as though alarmed by my audacity, which was all the more encouraged by her opposition. \u201cThen I shall say good night, and please forgive me for disturbing you for nothing.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Andr\u00e9e, and (since nowadays, the telephone having come into general use, a decorative ritual of polite speeches has grown up round it, as round the tea-tables of the past) added: \u201cIt has been a great pleasure to hear your voice.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I might have said the same, and with greater truth than Andr\u00e9e, for I had been deeply touched by the sound of her voice, having never before noticed that it was so different from the voices of other people. Then I recalled other voices still, women\u2019s voices especially, some of them rendered slow by the precision of a question and by mental concentration, others made breathless, even silenced at moments, by the lyrical flow of what the speakers were relating; I recalled one by one the voices of all the girls whom I had known at Balbec, then Gilberte\u2019s voice, then my grandmother\u2019s, then that of Mme. de Guermantes, I found them all unlike, moulded in a language peculiar to each of the speakers, each playing upon a different instrument, and I said to myself how meagre must be the concert performed in paradise by the three or four angel musicians of the old painters, when I saw mount to the Throne of God, by tens, by hundreds, by thousands, the harmonious and multisonant salutation of all the Voices. I did not leave the telephone without thanking, in a few propitiatory words, her who reigns over the swiftness of sounds for having kindly employed on behalf of my humble words a power which made them a hundred times more rapid than thunder, by my thanksgiving received no other response than that of being cut off\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Albertine returned to my room, she was wearing a garment of black satin which had the effect of making her seem paler, of turning her into the pallid, ardent Parisian, etiolated by want of fresh air, by the atmosphere of crowds and perhaps by vicious habits, whose eyes seemed more restless because they were not brightened by any colour in her cheeks\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGuess,\u201d I said to her, \u201cto whom I\u2019ve just been talking on the telephone. Andr\u00e9e!\u201d \u201cAndr\u00e9e?\u201d exclaimed Albertine in a harsh tone of astonishment and emotion, which so simple a piece of intelligence seemed hardly to require. \u201cI hope she remembered to tell you that we met Mme. Verdurin the other day.\u201d \u201cMme. Verdurin? I don\u2019t remember,\u201d I replied, as though I were thinking of something else, so as to appear indifferent to this meeting and not to betray Andr\u00e9e who had told me where Albertine was going on the morrow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But how could I tell that Andr\u00e9e was not herself betraying me, and would not tell Albertine to-morrow that I had asked her to prevent her at all costs from going to the Verdurins\u2019, and had not already revealed to her that I had many times made similar appeals. She had assured me that she had never repeated anything, but the value of this assertion was counterbalanced in my mind by the impression that for some time past Albertine\u2019s face had ceased to shew that confidence which she had for so long reposed in me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is remarkable is that, a few days before this dispute with Albertine, I had already had a dispute with her, but in Andr\u00e9e\u2019s presence. Now Andr\u00e9e, while she gave Albertine good advice, had always appeared to be insinuating bad. \u201cCome, don\u2019t talk like that, hold your tongue,\u201d she said, as though she were at the acme of happiness. Her face assumed the dry raspberry hue of those pious housekeepers who made us dismiss each of our servants in turn. While I was heaping reproaches upon Albertine which I ought never to have uttered, Andr\u00e9e looked as though she were sucking a lump of barley sugar with keen enjoyment. At length she was unable to restrain an affectionate laugh. \u201cCome, Titine, with me. You know, I\u2019m your dear little sister.\u201d I was not merely exasperated by this rather sickly exhibition, I asked myself whether Andr\u00e9e really felt the affection for Albertine that she pretended to feel. Seeing that Albertine, who knew Andr\u00e9e far better than I did, had always shrugged her shoulders when I asked her whether she was quite certain of Andr\u00e9e\u2019s affection, and had always answered that nobody in the world cared for her more, I was still convinced that Andr\u00e9e\u2019s affection was sincere. Possibly, in her wealthy but provincial family, one might find an equivalent of some of the shops in the Cathedral square, where certain sweetmeats are declared to be \u2018the best quality.\u2019 But I do know that, for my own part, even if I had invariably come to the opposite conclusion, I had so strong an impression that Andr\u00e9e was trying to rap Albertine\u2019s knuckles that my mistress at once regained my affection and my anger subsided\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suffering, when we are in love, ceases now and then for a moment, but only to recur in a different form. We weep to see her whom we love no longer respond to us with those outbursts of sympathy, the amorous advances of former days, we suffer more keenly still when, having lost them with us, she recovers them for the benefit of others; then, from this suffering, we are distracted by a new and still more piercing grief, the suspicion that she was lying to us about how she spent the previous evening, when she doubtless played us false; this suspicion in turn is dispelled, the kindness that our mistress is shewing us soothes us, but then a word that we had forgotten comes back to our mind; some one has told us that she was ardent in moments of pleasure, whereas we have always found her calm; we try to picture to ourselves what can have been these frenzies with other people, we feel how very little we are to her, we observe an air of boredom, longing, melancholy, while we are talking, we observe like a black sky the unpretentious clothes which she puts on when she is with us, keeping for other people the garments with which she used to flatter us at first. If on the contrary she is affectionate, what joy for a moment; but when we see that little tongue outstretched as though in invitation, we think of those people to whom that invitation has so often been addressed, and that perhaps even here at home, even although Albertine was not thinking of them, it has remained, by force of long habit, an automatic signal. Then the feeling that we are bored with each other returns. But suddenly this pain is reduced to nothing when we think of the unknown evil element in her life, of the places impossible to identify where she has been, where she still goes perhaps at the hours when we are not with her, if indeed she is not planning to live there altogether, those places in which she is parted from us, does not belong to us, is happier than when she is with us. Such are the revolving searchlights of jealousy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jealousy is moreover a demon that cannot be exorcised, but always returns to assume a fresh incarnation. Even if we could succeed in exterminating them all, in keeping for ever her whom we love, the Spirit of Evil would then adopt another form, more pathetic still, despair at having obtained fidelity only by force, despair at not being loved\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between Albertine and myself there was often the obstacle of a silence based no doubt upon grievances which she kept to herself, because she supposed them to be irremediable. Charming as Albertine was on some evenings, she no longer shewed those spontaneous impulses which I remembered at Balbec when she used to say: \u201cHow good you are to me all the same!\u201d and her whole heart seemed to spring towards me without the reservation of any of those grievances which she now felt and kept to herself because she supposed them no doubt to be irremediable, impossible to forget, unconfessed, but which set up nevertheless between her and myself the significant prudence of her speech or the interval of an impassable silence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd may one be allowed to know why you telephoned to Andr\u00e9e?\u201d \u201cTo ask whether she had any objection to my joining you to-morrow, so that I may pay the Verdurins the call I promised them at la Raspeli\u00e8re.\u201d \u201cJust as you like. But I warn you, there is an appalling mist this evening, and it\u2019s sure to last over to-morrow. I mention it, because I shouldn\u2019t like you to make yourself ill. Personally, you can imagine I would far rather you came with us. However,\u201d she added with a thoughtful air: \u201cI\u2019m not at all sure that I shall go to the Verdurins\u2019. They\u2019ve been so kind to me that I ought, really. . . . Next to yourself, they have been nicer to me than anybody, but there are some things about them that I don\u2019t quite like. I simply must go to the Bon March\u00e9 and the Trois-Quartiers and get a white scarf to wear with this dress which is really too black.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Allow Albertine to go by herself into a big shop crowded with people perpetually rubbing against one, furnished with so many doors that a woman can always say that when she came out she could not find the carriage which was waiting farther along the street; I was quite determined never to consent to such a thing, but the thought of it made me extremely unhappy. And yet I did not take into account that I ought long ago to have ceased to see Albertine, for she had entered, in my life, upon that lamentable period in which a person disseminated over space and time is no longer a woman, but a series of events upon which we can throw no light, a series of insoluble problems, a sea which we absurdly attempt, Xerxes-like, to scourge, in order to punish it for what it has engulfed. Once this period has begun, we are perforce vanquished. Happy are they who understand this in time not to prolong unduly a futile, exhausting struggle, hemmed in on every side by the limits of the imagination, a struggle in which jealousy plays so sorry a part that the same man who once upon a time, if the eyes of the woman who was always by his side rested for an instant upon another man, imagined an intrigue, suffered endless torments, resigns himself in time to allowing her to go out by herself, sometimes with the man whom he knows to be her lover, preferring to the unknown this torture which at least he does know! It is a question of the rhythm to be adopted, which afterwards one follows from force of habit. Neurotics who could never stay away from a dinner-party will afterwards take rest cures which never seem to them to last long enough; women who recently were still of easy virtue live for and by acts of penitence. Jealous lovers who, in order to keep a watch upon her whom they loved, cut short their own hours of sleep, deprived themselves of rest, feeling that her own personal desires, the world, so vast and so secret, time, are stronger than they, allow her to go out without them, then to travel, and finally separate from her. Jealousy thus perishes for want of nourishment and has survived so long only by clamouring incessantly for fresh food. I was still a long way from this state\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was now at liberty to go out with Albertine as often as I chose. As there had recently sprung up all round Paris a number of aerodromes, which are to aeroplanes what harbours are to ships, and as ever since the day when, on the way to la Raspeli\u00e8re, that almost mythological encounter with an airman, at whose passage overhead my horse had shied, had been to me like a symbol of liberty, I often chose to end our day\u2019s excursion \u2014 with the ready approval of Albertine, a passionate lover of every form of sport \u2014 at one of these aerodromes. We went there, she and I, attracted by that incessant stir of departure and arrival which gives so much charm to a stroll along the pier, or merely upon the beach, to those who love the sea, and to loitering about an \u2018aviation centre\u2019 to those who love the sky. At any moment, amid the repose of the machines that lay inert and as though at anchor, we would see one, laboriously pushed by a number of mechanics, as a boat is pushed down over the sand at the bidding of a tourist who wishes to go for an hour upon the sea. Then the engine was started, the machine ran along the ground, gathered speed, until finally, all of a sudden, at right angles, it rose slowly, in the awkward, as it were paralysed ecstasy of a horizontal speed suddenly transformed into a majestic, vertical ascent. Albertine could not contain her joy, and demanded explanations of the mechanics who, now that the machine was in the air, were strolling back to the sheds. The passenger, meanwhile, was covering mile after mile; the huge skiff, upon which our eyes remained fixed, was nothing more now in the azure than a barely visible spot, which, however, would gradually recover its solidity, size, volume, when, as the time allowed for the excursion drew to an end, the moment came for landing. And we watched with envy, Albertine and I, as he sprang to earth, the passenger who had gone up like that to enjoy at large in those solitary expanses the calm and limpidity of evening. Then, whether from the aerodrome or from some museum, some church that we had been visiting, we would return home together for dinner. And yet, I did not return home calmed, as I used to be at Balbec by less frequent excursions which I rejoiced to see extend over a whole afternoon, used afterwards to contemplate standing out like clustering flowers from the rest of Albertine\u2019s life, as against an empty sky, before which we muse pleasantly, without thinking. Albertine\u2019s time did not belong to me then in such ample quantities as to-day. And yet, it had seemed to me then to be much more my own, because I took into account only \u2014 my love rejoicing in them as in the bestowal of a favour \u2014 the hours that she spent with me; now \u2014 my jealousy searching anxiously among them for the possibility of a betrayal \u2014 only those hours that she spent apart from me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, on the morrow she was looking forward to some such hours. I must choose, either to cease from suffering, or to cease from loving. For, just as in the beginning it is formed by desire, so afterwards love is kept in existence only by painful anxiety. I felt that part of Albertine\u2019s life was escaping me. Love, in the painful anxiety as in the blissful desire, is the insistence upon a whole. It is born, it survives only if some part remains for it to conquer. We love only what we do not wholly possess. Albertine was lying when she told me that she probably would not go to the Verdurins\u2019, as I was lying when I said that I wished to go there. She was seeking merely to dissuade me from accompanying her, and I, by my abrupt announcement of this plan, which I had no intention of putting into practice, to touch what I felt to be her most sensitive spot, to track down the desire that she was concealing and to force her to admit that my company on the morrow would prevent her from gratifying it. She had virtually made this admission by ceasing at once to wish to go to see the Verdurins\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go to the Verdurins\u2019,\u201d I told her, \u201cthere is a splendid charity show at the Trocad\u00e9ro.\u201d She listened to my urging her to attend it with a sorrowful air. I began to be harsh with her as at Balbec, at the time of my first jealousy. Her face reflected a disappointment, and I employed, to reproach my mistress, the same arguments that had been so often advanced against myself by my parents when I was little, and had appeared unintelligent and cruel to my misunderstood childhood. \u201cNo, for all your melancholy air,\u201d I said to Albertine, \u201cI cannot feel any pity for you; I should feel sorry for you if you were ill, if you were in trouble, if you had suffered some bereavement; not that you would mind that in the least, I dare say, since you pour out false sentiment over every trifle. Anyhow, I have no opinion of the feelings of people who pretend to be so fond of us and are quite incapable of doing us the slightest service, and whose minds wander so that they forget to deliver the letter we have entrusted to them, on which our whole future depends.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These words \u2014 a great part of what we say being no more than a recitation from memory \u2014 I had heard spoken, all of them, by my mother, who was ever ready to explain to me that we ought not to confuse true feeling, what (she said) the Germans, whose language she greatly admired notwithstanding my father\u2019s horror of their nation, called Empfindung, and affectation or Empfindelei. She had gone so far, once when I was in tears, as to tell me that Nero probably suffered from his nerves and was none the better for that. Indeed, like those plants which bifurcate as they grow, side by side with the sensitive boy which was all that I had been, there was now a man of the opposite sort, full of common sense, of severity towards the morbid sensibility of others, a man resembling what my parents had been to me. No doubt, as each of us is obliged to continue in himself the life of his forebears, the balanced, cynical man who did not exist in me at the start had joined forces with the sensitive one, and it was natural that I should become in my turn what my parents had been to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is more, at the moment when this new personality took shape in me, he found his language ready made in the memory of the speeches, ironical and scolding, that had been addressed to me, that I must now address to other people, and which came so naturally to my lips, whether I evoked them by mimicry and association of memories, or because the delicate and mysterious enchantments of the reproductive power had traced in me unawares, as upon the leaf of a plant, the same intonations, the same gestures, the same attitudes as had been adopted by the people from whom I sprang. For sometimes, as I was playing the wise counsellor in conversation with Albertine, I seemed to be listening to my grandmother; had it not, moreover, occurred to my mother (so many obscure unconscious currents inflected everything in me down to the tiniest movements of my fingers even, to follow the same cycles as those of my parents) to imagine that it was my father at the door, so similar was my knock to his\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand the coupling of contrary elements is the law of life, the principle of fertilisation, and, as we shall see, the cause of many disasters. As a general rule, we detest what resembles ourself, and our own faults when observed in another person infuriate us. How much the more does a man who has passed the age at which we instinctively display them, a man who, for instance, has gone through the most burning moments with an icy countenance, execrate those same faults, if it is another man, younger or simpler or stupider, that is displaying them. There are sensitive people to whom merely to see in other people\u2019s eyes the tears which they themselves have repressed is infuriating. It is because the similarity is too great that, in spite of family affection, and sometimes all the more the greater the affection is, families are divided\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly in myself, and in many others, the second man that I had become was simply another aspect of the former man, excitable and sensitive in his own affairs, a sage mentor to other people. Perhaps it was so also with my parents according to whether they were regarded in relation to myself or in themselves. In the case of my grandmother and mother it was as clear as daylight that their severity towards myself was deliberate on their part and indeed cost them a serious effort, but perhaps in my father himself his coldness was but an external aspect of his sensibility. For it was perhaps the human truth of this twofold aspect: the side of private life, the side of social relations, that was expressed in a sentence which seemed to me at the time as false in its matter as it was commonplace in form, when some one remarked, speaking of my father: \u201cBeneath his icy chill, he conceals an extraordinary sensibility; what is really wrong with him is that he is ashamed of his own feelings.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Did it not, after all, conceal incessant secret storms, that calm (interspersed if need be with sententious reflexions, irony at the maladroit exhibitions of sensibility) which was his, but which now I too was affecting in my relations with everybody and never laid aside in certain circumstances of my relations with Albertine?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I really believe that I came near that day to making up my mind to break with her and to start for Venice. What bound me afresh in my chains had to do with Normandy, not that she shewed any inclination to go to that region where I had been jealous of her (for it was my good fortune that her plans never impinged upon the painful spots in my memory), but because when I had said to her: \u201cIt is just as though I were to speak to you of your aunt\u2019s friend who lived at Infreville,\u201d she replied angrily, delighted \u2014 like everyone in a discussion, who is anxious to muster as many arguments as possible on his side \u2014 to shew me that I was in the wrong and herself in the right: \u201cBut my aunt never knew anybody at Infreville, and I have never been near the place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had forgotten the lie that she had told me one afternoon about the susceptible lady with whom she simply must take tea, even if by going to visit this lady she were to forfeit my friendship and shorten her own life. I did not remind her of her lie. But it appalled me. And once again I postponed our rupture to another day. A person has no need of sincerity, nor even of skill in lying, in order to be loved. I here give the name of love to a mutual torment. I saw nothing reprehensible this evening in speaking to her as my grandmother \u2014 that mirror of perfection \u2014 used to speak to me, nor, when I told her that I would escort her to the Verdurins\u2019, in having adopted my father\u2019s abrupt manner, who would never inform us of any decision except in the manner calculated to cause us the maximum of agitation, out of all proportion to the decision itself. So that it was easy for him to call us absurd for appearing so distressed by so small a matter, our distress corresponding in reality to the emotion that he had aroused in us. Since \u2014 like the inflexible wisdom of my grandmother \u2014 these arbitrary moods of my father had been passed on to myself to complete the sensitive nature to which they had so long remained alien, and, throughout my whole childhood, had caused so much suffering, that sensitive nature informed them very exactly as to the points at which they must take careful aim: there is no better informer than a reformed thief, or a subject of the nation we are fighting. In certain untruthful families, a brother who has come to call upon his brother without any apparent reason and asks him, quite casually, on the doorstep, as he is going away, for some information to which he does not even appear to listen, indicates thereby to his brother that this information was the main object of his visit, for the brother is quite familiar with that air of detachment, those words uttered as though in parentheses and at the last moment, having frequently had recourse to them himself. Well, there are also pathological families, kindred sensibilities, fraternal temperaments, initiated into that mute language which enables people in the family circle to make themselves understood without speaking. And who can be more nerve-wracking than a neurotic? Besides, my conduct, in these cases, may have had a more general, a more profound cause. I mean that in those brief but inevitable moments, when we detest some one whom we love \u2014 moments which last sometimes for a whole lifetime in the case of people whom we do not love \u2014 we do not wish to appear good, so as not to be pitied, but at once as wicked and as happy as possible so that our happiness may be truly hateful and may ulcerate the soul of the occasional or permanent enemy. To how many people have I not untruthfully slandered myself, simply in order that my \u2018successes\u2019 might seem to them immoral and make them all the more angry! The proper thing to do would be to take the opposite course, to shew without arrogance that we have generous feelings, instead of taking such pains to hide them. And it would be easy if we were able never to hate, to love all the time. For then we should be so glad to say only the things that can make other people happy, melt their hearts, make them love us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, I felt some remorse at being so irritating to Albertine, and said to myself: \u201cIf I did not love her, she would be more grateful to me, for I should not be nasty to her; but no, it would be the same in the end, for I should also be less nice.\u201d And I might, in order to justify myself, have told her that I loved her. But the confession of that love, apart from the fact that it could not have told Albertine anything new, would perhaps have made her colder to myself than the harshness and deceit for which love was the sole excuse. To be harsh and deceitful to the person whom we love is so natural! If the interest that we shew in other people does not prevent us from being kind to them and complying with their wishes, then our interest is not sincere. A stranger leaves us indifferent, and indifference does not prompt us to unkind actions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The evening passed. Before Albertine went to bed, there was no time to lose if we wished to make peace, to renew our embraces. Neither of us had yet taken the initiative. Feeling that, anyhow, she was angry with me already, I took advantage of her anger to mention Esther Levy. \u201cBloch tells me\u201d (this was untrue) \u201cthat you are a great friend of his cousin Esther.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t know her if I saw her,\u201d said Albertine with a vague air. \u201cI have seen her photograph,\u201d I continued angrily. I did not look at Albertine as I said this, so that I did not see her expression, which would have been her sole reply, for she said nothing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was no longer the peace of my mother\u2019s kiss at Combray that I felt when I was with Albertine on these evenings, but, on the contrary, the anguish of those on which my mother scarcely bade me good night, or even did not come up at all to my room, whether because she was vexed with me or was kept downstairs by guests. This anguish \u2014 not merely its transposition in terms of love \u2014 no, this anguish itself which had at one time been specialised in love, which had been allocated to love alone when the division, the distribution of the passions took effect, seemed now to be extending again to them all, become indivisible again as in my childhood, as though all my sentiments which trembled at the thought of my not being able to keep Albertine by my bedside, at once as a mistress, a sister, a daughter; as a mother too, of whose regular good-night kiss I was beginning again to feel the childish need, had begun to coalesce, to unify in the premature evening of my life which seemed fated to be as short as a day in winter. But if I felt the anguish of my childhood, the change of person that made me feel it, the difference of the sentiment that it inspired in me, the very transformation in my character, made it impossible for me to demand the soothing of that anguish from Albertine as in the old days from my mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could no longer say: \u201cI am unhappy.\u201d I confined myself, with death at my heart, to speaking of unimportant things which afforded me no progress towards a happy solution. I waded knee-deep in painful platitudes. And with that intellectual egoism which, if only some insignificant fact has a bearing upon our love, makes us pay great respect to the person who has discovered it, as fortuitously perhaps as the fortune-teller who has foretold some trivial event which has afterwards come to pass, I came near to regarding Fran\u00e7oise as more inspired than Bergotte and Elstir because she had said to me at Balbec: \u201cThat girl will only land you in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every minute brought me nearer to Albertine\u2019s good night, which at length she said. But this evening her kiss, from which she herself was absent, and which did not encounter myself, left me so anxious that, with a throbbing heart, I watched her make her way to the door, thinking: \u201cIf I am to find a pretext for calling her back, keeping her here, making peace with her, I must make haste; only a few steps and she will be out of the room, only two, now one, she is turning the handle; she is opening the door, it is too late, she has shut it behind her!\u201d Perhaps it was not too late, all the same. As in the old days at Combray when my mother had left me without soothing me with her kiss, I wanted to dart in pursuit of Albertine, I felt that there would be no peace for me until I had seen her again, that this next meeting was to be something immense which no such meeting had ever yet been, and that \u2014 if I did not succeed by my own efforts in ridding myself of this melancholy \u2014 I might perhaps acquire the shameful habit of going to beg from Albertine. I sprang out of bed when she was already in her room, I paced up and down the corridor, hoping that she would come out of her room and call me; I stood without breathing outside her door for fear of failing to hear some faint summons, I returned for a moment to my own room to see whether my mistress had not by some lucky chance forgotten her handkerchief, her bag, something which I might have appeared to be afraid of her wanting during the night, and which would have given me an excuse for going to her room. No, there was nothing. I returned to my station outside her door, but the crack beneath it no longer shewed any light. Albertine had put out the light, she was in bed, I remained there motionless, hoping for some lucky accident but none occurred; and long afterwards, frozen, I returned to bestow myself between my own sheets and cried all night long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there were certain evenings also when I had recourse to a ruse which won me Albertine\u2019s kiss. Knowing how quickly sleep came to her as soon as she lay down (she knew it also, for, instinctively, before lying down, she would take off her slippers, which I had given her, and her ring which she placed by the bedside, as she did in her own room when she went to bed), knowing how heavy her sleep was, how affectionate her awakening, I would plead the excuse of going to look for something and make her lie down upon my bed. When I returned to the room she was asleep and I saw before me the other woman that she became whenever one saw her full face. But she very soon changed her identity, for I lay down by her side and recaptured her profile. I could place my hand in her hand, on her shoulder, on her cheek. Albertine continued to sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I might take her head, turn it round, press it to my lips, encircle my neck in her arms, she continued to sleep like a watch that does not stop, like an animal that goes on living whatever position you assign to it, like a climbing plant, a convulvulus which continues to thrust out its tendrils whatever support you give it. Only her breathing was altered by every touch of my fingers, as though she had been an instrument on which I was playing and from which I extracted modulations by drawing from first one, then another of its strings different notes. My jealousy grew calm, for I felt that Albertine had become a creature that breathes, that is nothing else besides, as was indicated by that regular breathing in which is expressed that pure physiological function which, wholly fluid, has not the solidity either of speech or of silence; and, in its ignorance of all evil, her breath, drawn (it seemed) rather from a hollowed reed than from a human being, was truly paradisal, was the pure song of the angels to me who, at these moments, felt Albertine to be withdrawn from everything, not only materially but morally. And yet in that breathing, I said to myself of a sudden that perhaps many names of people borne on the stream of memory must be playing. Sometimes indeed to that music the human voice was added. Albertine uttered a few words. How I longed to catch their meaning! It happened that the name of a person of whom we had been speaking and who had aroused my jealousy came to her lips, but without making me unhappy, for the memory that it brought with it seemed to be only that of the conversations that she had had with me upon the subject. This evening, however, when with her eyes still shut she was half awake, she said, addressing myself: \u201cAndr\u00e9e.\u201d I concealed my emotion. \u201cYou are dreaming, I am not Andr\u00e9e,\u201d I said to her, smiling. She smiled also. \u201cOf course not, I wanted to ask you what Andr\u00e9e was saying to you.\u201d \u201cI should have supposed that you were used to lying like this by her side.\u201d \u201cOh no, never,\u201d she said. Only, before making this reply, she had hidden her face for a moment in her hands. So her silences were merely screens, her surface affection merely kept beneath the surface a thousand memories which would have rent my heart, her life was full of those incidents the derisive account, the comic history of which form our daily gossip at the expense of other people, people who do not matter, but which, so long as a person remains lost in the dark forest of our heart, seem to us so precious a revelation of her life that, for the privilege of exploring that subterranean world, we would gladly sacrifice our own. Then her sleep appeared to me a marvellous and magic world in which at certain moments there rises from the depths of the barely translucent element the confession of a secret which we shall not understand. But as a rule, when Albertine was asleep, she seemed to have recovered her innocence. In the attitude which I had imposed upon her, but which in her sleep she had speedily made her own, she looked as though she were trusting herself to me! Her face had lost any expression of cunning or vulgarity, and between herself and me, towards whom she was raising her arm, upon whom her hand was resting, there seemed to be an absolute surrender, an indissoluble attachment. Her sleep moreover did not separate her from me and allowed her to r\u00e9tain her consciousness of our affection; its effect was rather to abolish everything else; I embraced her, told her that I was going to take a turn outside, she half-opened her eyes, said to me with an air of astonishment \u2014 indeed the hour was late: \u201cBut where are you off to, my darling \u2014\u2014-\u201d calling me by my Christian name, and at once fell asleep again. Her sleep was only a sort of obliteration of the rest of her life, a continuous silence over which from time to time would pass in their flight words of intimate affection. By putting these words together, you would have arrived at the unalloyed conversation, the secret intimacy of a pure love. This calm slumber delighted me, as a mother is delighted, reckoning it among his virtues, by the sound sleep of her child. And her sleep was indeed that of a child. Her waking also, and so natural, so loving, before she even knew where she was, that I sometimes asked myself with terror whether she had been in the habit, before coming to live with me, of not sleeping by herself but of finding, when she opened her eyes, some one lying by her side. But her childish charm was more striking. Like a mother again, I marvelled that she should always awake in so good a humour. After a few moments she recovered consciousness, uttered charming words, unconnected with one another, mere bird-pipings. By a sort of \u2018general post\u2019 her throat, which as a rule passed unnoticed, now almost startlingly beautiful, had acquired the immense importance which her eyes, by being closed in sleep, had forfeited, her eyes, my regular informants to which I could no longer address myself after the lids had closed over them. Just as the closed lids impart an innocent, grave beauty to the face by suppressing all that the eyes express only too plainly, there was in the words, not devoid of meaning, but interrupted by moments of silence, which Albertine uttered as she awoke, a pure beauty that is not at every moment polluted, as is conversation, by habits of speech, commonplaces, traces of blemish. Anyhow, when I had decided to wake Albertine, I had been able to do so without fear, I knew that her awakening would bear no relation to the evening that we had passed together, but would emerge from her sleep as morning emerges from night. As soon as she had begun to open her eyes with a smile, she had offered me her lips, and before she had even uttered a word, I had tasted their fresh savour, as soothing as that of a garden still silent before the break of day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the morrow of that evening when Albertine had told me that she would perhaps be going, then that she would not be going to see the Verdurins, I awoke early, and, while I was still half asleep, my joy informed me that there was, interpolated in the winter, a day of spring. Outside, popular themes skilfully transposed for various instruments, from the horn of the mender of porcelain, or the trumpet of the chair weaver, to the flute of the goat driver who seemed, on a fine morning, to be a Sicilian goatherd, were lightly orchestrating the matutinal air, with an \u2018Overture for a Public Holiday.\u2019 Our hearing, that delicious sense, brings us the company of the street, every line of which it traces for us, sketches all the figures that pass along it, shewing us their colours. The iron shutters of the baker\u2019s shop, of the dairy, which had been lowered last night over every possibility of feminine bliss, were rising now like the canvas of a ship which is setting sail and about to proceed, crossing the transparent sea, over a vision of young female assistants. This sound of the iron curtain being raised would perhaps have been my sole pleasure in a different part of the town. In this quarter a hundred other sounds contributed to my joy, of which I would not have lost a single one by remaining too long asleep. It is the magic charm of the old aristocratic quarters that they are at the same time plebeian. Just as, sometimes, cathedrals used to have them within a stone\u2019s throw of their porches (which have even preserved the name, like the porch of Rouen styled the Booksellers\u2019, because these latter used to expose their merchandise in the open air against its walls), so various minor trades, but peripatetic, used to pass in front of the noble H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, and made one think at times of the ecclesiastical France of long ago. For the appeal which they launched at the little houses on either side had, with rare exceptions, nothing of a song. It differed from song as much as the declamation \u2014 barely coloured by imperceptible modulations \u2014 of Boris Godounov and Pell\u00e9as; but on the other hand recalled the psalmody of a priest chanting his office of which these street scenes are but the good-humoured, secular, and yet half liturgical counterpart. Never had I so delighted in them as since Albertine had come to live with me; they seemed to me a joyous signal of her awakening, and by interesting me in the life of the world outside made me all the more conscious of the soothing virtue of a beloved presence, as constant as I could wish. Several of the foodstuffs cried in the street, which personally I detested, were greatly to Albertine\u2019s liking, so much so that Fran\u00e7oise used to send her young footman out to buy them, slightly humiliated perhaps at finding himself mingled with the plebeian crowd. Very distinct in this peaceful quarter (where the noise was no longer a cause of lamentation to Fran\u00e7oise and had become a source of pleasure to myself), there came to me, each with its different modulation, recitatives declaimed by those humble folk as they would be in the music \u2014 so entirely popular \u2014 of Boris, where an initial intonation is barely altered by the inflexion of one note which rests upon another, the music of the crowd which is more a language than a music. It was \u201cah! le bigorneau, deux sous le bigorneau,\u201d which brought people running to the cornets in which were sold those horrid little shellfish, which, if Albertine had not been there, would have disgusted me, just as the snails disgusted me which I heard cried for sale at the same hour. Here again it was of the barely lyrical declamation of Moussorgsky that the vendor reminded me, but not of it alone. For after having almost \u2018spoken\u2019: \u201cLes escargots, ils sont frais, ils sont beaux,\u201d it was with the vague melancholy of Maeterlinck, transposed into music by Debussy, that the snail vendor, in one of those pathetic finales in which the composer of Pell\u00e9as shews his kinship with Rameau: \u201cIf vanquished I must be, is it for thee to be my vanquisher?\u201d added with a singsong melancholy: \u201cOn les vend six sous la douzaine. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have always found it difficult to understand why these perfectly simple words were sighed in a tone so far from appropriate, mysterious, like the secret which makes everyone look sad in the old palace to which M\u00e9lisande has not succeeded in bringing joy, and profound as one of the thoughts of the aged Arkel who seeks to utter, in the simplest words, the whole lore of wisdom and destiny. The very notes upon which rises with an increasing sweetness the voice of the old King of Allemonde or that of Goland, to say: \u201cWe know not what is happening here, it may seem strange, maybe nought that happens is in vain,\u201d or else: \u201cNo cause here for alarm, \u2019twas a poor little mysterious creature, like all the world,\u201d were those which served the snail vendor to resume, in an endless cadenza: \u201cOn les vend six sous la douzaine. . . . \u201d But this metaphysical lamentation had not time to expire upon the shore of the infinite, it was interrupted by a shrill trumpet. This time, it was no question of victuals, the words of the libretto were: \u201cTond les chiens, coupe les chats, les queues et les oreilles.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was true that the fantasy, the spirit of each vendor or vendress frequently introduced variations into the words of all these chants that I used to hear from my bed. And yet a ritual suspension interposing a silence in the middle of a word, especially when it was repeated a second time, constantly reminded me of some old church. In his little cart drawn by a she-ass which he stopped in front of each house before entering the courtyard, the old-clothes man, brandishing a whip, intoned: \u201cHabits, marchand d\u2019habits, ha . . . bits\u201c with the same pause between the final syllables as if he had been intoning in plain chant: \u201cPer omnia saecula saeculo . . . rum\u201c or \u201crequiescat in pa . . . ce\u201c albeit he had no reason to believe in the immortality of his clothes, nor did he offer them as cerements for the supreme repose in peace. And similarly, as the motives were beginning, even at this early hour, to become confused, a vegetable woman, pushing her little hand-cart, was using for her litany the Gregorian division:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A la tendresse, \u00e0 la verduresse\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Artichauts tendres et beaux\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arti . . . chauts\n\nAlthough she had probably never heard of the antiphonal, or of the seven tones that symbolise four the sciences of the quadrivium and three those of the trivium\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drawing from a penny whistle, from a bagpipe, airs of his own southern country whose sunlight harmonised well with these fine days, a man in a blouse, wielding a bull\u2019s pizzle in his hand and wearing a basque b\u00e9ret on his head, stopped before each house in turn. It was the goatherd with two dogs driving before him his string of goats. As he came from a distance, he arrived fairly late in our quarter; and the women came running out with bowls to receive the milk that was to give strength to their little ones. But with the Pyrenean airs of this good shepherd was now blended the bell of the grinder, who cried: \u201cCouteaux, ciseaux, rasoirs.\u201d With him the saw-setter was unable to compete, for, lacking an instrument, he had to be content with calling: \u201cAvez-vous des scies \u00e0 repasser, v\u2019i\u00e0 le repasseur,\u201d while in a gayer mood the tinker, after enumerating the pots, pans and everything else that he repaired, intoned the refrain:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tam, tam, tam\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C\u2019est moi qui r\u00e9tame\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M\u00eame le macadam\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C\u2019est moi qui mets des fonds partout\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Qui bouche tous les trous, trou, trou;\n\nAnd young Italians carrying big iron boxes painted red, upon which the numbers \u2014 winning and losing \u2014 were marked, and springing their rattles, gave the invitation: \u201cAmusez-vous, mesdames, v\u2019l\u00e0 le plaisir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise brought in the Figaro. A glance was sufficient to shew me that my article had not yet appeared. She told me that Albertine had asked whether she might come to my room and sent word that she had quite given up the idea of calling upon the Verdurins, and had decided to go, as I had advised her, to the \u2018special\u2019 matin\u00e9e at the Trocad\u00e9ro \u2014 what nowadays would be called, though with considerably less significance, a \u2018gala\u2019 matin\u00e9e \u2014 after a short ride which she had promised to take with Andr\u00e9e. Now that I knew that she had renounced her desire, possibly evil, to go and see Mme. Verdurin, I said with a laugh: \u201cTell her to come in,\u201d and told myself that she might go where she chose and that it was all the same to me. I knew that by the end of the afternoon, when dusk began to fall, I should probably be a different man, moping, attaching to every one of Albertine\u2019s movements an importance that they did not possess at this morning hour when the weather was so fine. For my indifference was accompanied by a clear notion of its cause, but was in no way modified by it. \u201cFran\u00e7oise assured me that you were awake and that I should not be disturbing you,\u201d said Albertine as she entered the room. And since next to making me catch cold by opening the window at the wrong moment, what Albertine most dreaded was to come into my room when I was asleep: \u201cI hope I have not done anything wrong,\u201d she went on. \u201cI was afraid you would say to me: What insolent mortal comes here to meet his doom?\u201d and she laughed that laugh which I always found so disturbing. I replied in the same vein of pleasantry: \u201cWas it for you this stern decree was made?\u201d\u2014 and, lest she should ever venture to break it, added: \u201cAlthough I should be furious if you did wake me.\u201d \u201cI know, I know, don\u2019t be frightened,\u201d said Albertine. And, to relieve the situation, I went on, still enacting the scene from Esther with her, while in the street below the cries continued, drowned by our conversation: \u201cI find in you alone a certain grace That charms me and of which I never tire\u201d (and to myself I thought: \u201cyes, she does tire me very often\u201d). And remembering what she had said to me overnight, as I thanked her extravagantly for having given up the Verdurins, so that another time she would obey me similarly with regard to something else, I said: \u201cAlbertine, you distrust me who love you and you place your trust in other people who do not love you\u201d (as though it were not natural to distrust the people who love us and who alone have an interest in lying to us in order to find out things, to hinder us), and added these lying words: \u201cYou don\u2019t really believe that I love you, which is amusing. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t adore you.\u201d She lied in her turn when she told me that she trusted nobody but myself and then became sincere when she assured me that she knew very well that I loved her. But this affirmation did not seem to imply that she did not believe me to be a liar and a spy. And she seemed to pardon me as though she had seen these defects to be the agonising consequence of a strong passion or as though she herself had felt herself to be less good. \u201cI beg of you, my dearest girl, no more of that haute voltige you were practising the other day. Just think, Albertine, if you were to meet with an accident!\u201d Of course I did not wish her any harm. But what a pleasure it would be if, with her horses, she should take it into her head to ride off somewhere, wherever she chose, and never to return again to my house. How it would simplify everything, that she should go and live happily somewhere else, I did not even wish to know where. \u201cOhl I know you wouldn\u2019t survive me for more than a day; you would commit suicide.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So we exchanged lying speeches. But a truth more profound than that which we would utter were we sincere may sometimes be expressed and announced by another channel than that of sincerity. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind all that noise outside,\u201d she asked me; \u201cI love it. But you\u2019re such a light sleeper anyhow.\u201d I was on the contrary an extremely heavy sleeper (as I have already said, but I am obliged to repeat it in view of what follows), especially when I did not begin to sleep until the morning. As this kind of sleep is \u2014 on an average \u2014 four times as refreshing, it seems to the awakened sleeper to have lasted four times as long, when it has really been four times as short. A splendid, sixteenfold error in multiplication which gives so much beauty to our awakening and makes life begin again on a different scale, like those great changes of rhythm which, in music, mean that in an andante a quaver has the same duration as a minim in a prestissimo, and which are unknown in our waking state. There life is almost always the same, whence the disappointments of travel. It may seem indeed that our dreams are composed of the coarsest stuff of life, but that stuff is treated, kneaded so thoroughly, with a protraction due to the fact that none of the temporal limitations of the waking state is there to prevent it from spinning itself out to heights so vast that we fail to recognise it. On the mornings after this good fortune had befallen me, after the sponge of sleep had obliterated from my brain the signs of everyday occupations that are traced upon it as upon a blackboard, I was obliged to bring my memory back to life; by the exercise of our will we can recapture what the amnesia of sleep or of a stroke has made us forget, what gradually returns to us as our eyes open or our paralysis disappears. I had lived through so many hours in a few minutes that, wishing to address Fran\u00e7oise, for whom I had rung, in language that corresponded to the facts of real life and was regulated by the clock, I was obliged to exert all my power of internal repression in order not to say: \u201cWell, Fran\u00e7oise, here we are at five o\u2019clock in the evening and I haven\u2019t set eyes on you since yesterday afternoon.\u201d And seeking to dispel my dreams, giving them the lie and lying to myself as well, I said boldly, compelling myself with all my might to silence, the direct opposite: \u201cFran\u00e7oise, it must be at least ten!\u201d I did not even say ten o\u2019clock in the morning, but simply ten, so that this incredible hour might appear to be uttered in a more natural tone. And yet to say these words, instead of those that continued to run in the mind of the half-awakened sleeper that I still was, demanded the same effort of equilibrium that a man requires when he jumps out of a moving train and runs for some yards along the platform, if he is to avoid falling. He runs for a moment because the environment that he has just left was one animated by great velocity, and utterly unlike the inert soil upon which his feet find it difficult to keep their balance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the dream world is not the waking world, it does not follow that the waking world is less genuine, far from it. In the world of sleep, our perceptions are so overcharged, each of them increased by a counterpart which doubles its bulk and blinds it to no purpose, that we are not able even to distinguish what is happening in the bewilderment of awakening; was it Fran\u00e7oise that had come to me, or I that, tired of waiting, went to her? Silence at that moment was the only way not to reveal anything, as at the moment when we are brought before a magistrate cognisant of all the charges against us, when we have not been informed of them ourselves. Was it Fran\u00e7oise that had come, was it I that had summoned her? Was it not, indeed, Fran\u00e7oise that had been asleep and I that had just awoken her; nay more, was not Fran\u00e7oise enclosed in my breast, for the distinction between persons and their reaction upon one another barely exists in that murky obscurity in which reality is as little translucent as in the body of a porcupine, and our all but non-existent perception may perhaps furnish an idea of the perception of certain animals. Besides, in the limpid state of unreason that precedes these heavy slumbers, if fragments of wisdom float there luminously, if the names of Taine and George Eliot are not unknown, the waking life does still retain the superiority, inasmuch as it is possible to continue it every morning, whereas it is not possible to continue the dream life every night. But are there perhaps other worlds more real than the waking world? Even if we have seen transformed by every revolution in the arts, and still more, at the same time, by the degree of proficiency and culture that distinguishes an artist from an ignorant fool\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And often an extra hour of sleep is a paralytic stroke after which we must recover the use of our limbs, learn to speak. Our will would not be adequate for this task. We have slept too long, we no longer exist. Our waking is barely felt, mechanically and without consciousness, as a water pipe might feel the turning off of a tap. A life more inanimate than that of the jellyfish follows, in which we could equally well believe that we had been drawn up from the depths of the sea or released from prison, were we but capable of thinking anything at all. But then from the highest heaven the goddess Mnemotechnia bends down and holds out to us in the formula \u2018the habit of ringing for our coffee\u2019 the hope of resurrection. However, the instantaneous gift of memory is not always so simple. Often we have before us, in those first minutes in which we allow ourself to slip into the waking state, a truth composed of different realities among which we imagine that we can choose, as among a pack of cards\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is Friday morning and we have just returned from our walk, or else it is teatime by the sea. The idea of sleep and that we are lying in bed and in our nightshirt is often the last that occurs to us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our resurrection is not effected at once; we think that we have rung the bell, we have not done so, we utter senseless remarks. Movement alone restores our thought, and when we have actually pressed the electric button we are able to say slowly but distinctly: \u201cIt must be at least ten o\u2019clock, Fran\u00e7oise, bring me my coffee.\u201d Oh, the miracle! Fran\u00e7oise could have had no suspicion of the sea of unreality in which I was still wholly immersed and through which I had had the energy to make my strange question pass. Her answer was: \u201cIt is ten past ten.\u201d Which made my remark appear quite reasonable, and enabled me not to let her perceive the fantastic conversations by which I had been interminably beguiled, on days when it was not a mountain of non-existence that had crushed all life out of me. By strength of will, I had reinstated myself in life. I was still enjoying the last shreds of sleep, that is to say of the only inventiveness, the only novelty that exists in story-telling, since none of our narrations in the waking state, even though they be adorned with literary graces, admit those mysterious differences from which beauty derives. It is easy to speak of the beauty created by opium. But to a man who is accustomed to sleeping only with the aid of drugs, an unexpected hour of natural sleep will reveal the vast, matutinal expanse of a country as mysterious and more refreshing. By varying the hour, the place at which we go to sleep, by wooing sleep in an artificial manner, or on the contrary by returning for once to natural sleep \u2014 the strangest kind of all to whoever is in the habit of putting himself to sleep with soporifics \u2014 we succeed in producing a thousand times as many varieties of sleep as a gardener could produce of carnations or roses. Gardeners produce flowers that are delicious dreams, and others too that are like nightmares. When I fell asleep in a certain way I used to wake up shivering, thinking that I had caught the measles, or, what was far more painful, that my grandmother (to whom I never gave a thought now) was hurt because I had laughed at her that day when, at Balbec, in the belief that she was about to die, she had wished me to have a photograph of herself. At once, albeit I was awake, I felt that I must go and explain to her that she had misunderstood me. But, already, my bodily warmth was returning. The diagnosis of measles was set aside, and my grandmother became so remote that she no longer made my heart throb. Sometimes over these different kinds of sleep there fell a sudden darkness. \u00cf was afraid to continue my walk along an entirely unlighted avenue, where I could hear prowling footsteps. Suddenly a dispute broke out between a policeman and one of those women whom one often saw driving hackney carriages, and mistook at a distance for young men. Upon her box among the shadows I could not see her, but she spoke, and in her voice I could read the perfections of her face and the youthfulness of her body. I strode towards her, in the darkness, to get into her carriage before she drove off. It was a long way. Fortunately, her dispute with the policeman continued. I overtook the carriage which was still drawn up. This part of the avenue was lighted by street lamps. The driver became visible. She was indeed a woman, but old and corpulent, with white hair tumbling beneath her hat, and a red birthmark on her face. I walked past her, thinking: Is this what happens to the youth of women? Those whom we have met in the past, if suddenly we desire to see them again, have they become old? Is the young woman whom we desire like a character on the stage, when, unable to secure the actress who created the part, the management is obliged to entrust it to a new star? But then it is no longer the same\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With this a feeling of melancholy invaded me. We have thus in our sleep a number of Pities, like the \u2018Piet\u00e0\u2019 of the Renaissance, but not, like them, wrought in marble, being, rather, unsubstantial. They have their purpose, however, which is to make us remember a certain outlook upon things, more tender, more human, which we are too apt to forget in the common sense, frigid, sometimes full of hostility, of the waking state. Thus I was reminded of the vow that I had made at Balbec that I would always treat Fran\u00e7oise with compassion. And for the whole of that morning at least I would manage to compel myself not to be irritated by Fran-\u00e7oise\u2019s quarrels with the butler, to be gentle with Fran\u00e7oise to whom the others shewed so little kindness. For that morning only, and I would have to try to frame a code that was a little more permanent; for, just as nations are not governed for any length of time by a policy of pure sentiment, so men are not governed by the memory of their dreams. Already this dream was beginning to fade away. In attempting to recall it in order to portray it I made it fade all the faster. My eyelids were no longer so firmly sealed over my eyes. If I tried to reconstruct my dream, they opened completely. At every moment we must choose between health and sanity on the one hand, and spiritual pleasures on the other. I have always taken the cowardly part of choosing the former. Moreover, the perilous power that I was renouncing was even more perilous than we suppose. Pities, dreams, do not fly away unaccompanied. When we alter thus the conditions in which we go to sleep, it is not our dreams alone that fade, but, for days on end, for years it may be, the faculty not merely of dreaming but of going to sleep. Sleep is divine but by no means stable; the slightest shock makes it volatile. A lover of habits, they retain it every night, being more fixed than itself, in the place set apart for it, they preserve it from all injury, but if we displace it, if it is no longer subordinated, it melts away like a vapour. It is like youth and love, never to be recaptured\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In these various forms of sleep, as likewise in music, it was the lengthening or shortening of the interval that created beauty. I enjoyed this beauty, but, on the other hand, I had lost in my sleep, however brief, a good number of the cries which render perceptible to us the peripatetic life of the tradesmen, the victuallers of Paris. And so, as a habit (without, alas, foreseeing the drama in which these late awakenings and the Draconian, Medo-Persian laws of a Racinian Assu\u00e9rus were presently to involve me) I made an effort to awaken early so as to lose none of these cries\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, more than the pleasure of knowing how fond Albertine was of them and of being out of doors myself without leaving my bed, I heard in them as it were the symbol of the atmosphere of the world outside, of the dangerous stirring life through the veins of which I did not allow her to move save under my tutelage, from which I withdrew her at the hour of my choosing to make her return home to my side. And so it was with the most perfect sincerity that I was able to say in answer to Albertine: \u201cOn the contrary, they give me pleasure because I know that you like them.\u201d \u201cA la barque, les hu\u00eetres, \u00e0 la barque.\u201d \u201cOh, oysters! I\u2019ve been simply longing for some!\u201d Fortunately Albertine, partly from inconsistency, partly from docility, quickly forgot the things for which she had been longing, and before I had time to tell her that she would find better oysters at Prunier\u2019s, she wanted in succession all the things that she heard cried by the fish hawker: \u201cA la crevette, \u00e0 la bonne crevette, j\u2019ai de la raie toute en vie, toute en vie.\u201d \u201cMerlans \u00e0 frire, \u00e0 frire.\u201d \u201cIl arrive le maquereau, maquereau frais, maquereau nouveau.\u201d \u201cVoil\u00e0 le maquereau, mesdames, il est beau le maquereau.\u201d \u201cA la moule fra\u00eeche et bonne, \u00e0 la moule!\u201d In spite of myself, the warning: \u201cIl arrive le maquereau\u201c made me shudder. But as this warning could not, I felt, apply to our chauffeur, I thought only of the fish of that name, which I detested, and my uneasiness did not last. \u201cAh! Mussels,\u201d said Albertine, \u201cI should so like some mussels.\u201d \u201cMy darling! They were all very well at Balbec, here they\u2019re not worth eating; besides, I implore you, remember what Cottard told you about mussels.\u201d But my remark was all the more ill-chosen in that the vegetable woman who came next announced a thing that Cottard had forbidden even more strictly:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A la romaine, \u00e0 la romaine!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On ne le vend pas, on la prom\u00e8ne\n\nAlbertine consented, however, to sacrifice her lettuces, on the condition that I would promise to buy for her in a few days\u2019 time from the woman who cried: \u201cJ\u2019ai de la belle asperge d\u2019Argenteuil, j\u2019ai de la belle asperge.\u201d A mysterious voice, from which one would have expected some stranger utterance, insinuated: \u201cTonneaux, tonneaux!\u201d We were obliged to remain under the disappointment that nothing more was being offered us than barrels, for the word was almost entirely drowned by the appeal: \u201cVitri, vitri-er, carreaux cass\u00e9s, voil\u00e0 le vitrier, vitri-er,\u201d a Gregorian division which reminded me less, however, of the liturgy than did the appeal of the rag vendor, reproducing unconsciously one of those abrupt interruptions of sound, in the middle of a prayer, which are common enough in the ritual of the church: \u201cPraeceptis salutaribus moniti et divina institutione formait audemus dicere,\u201d says the priest, ending sharply upon \u2018dicere.\u2019 Without irreverence, as the populace of the middle ages used to perform plays and farces within the consecrated ground of the church, it is of that \u2018dicere\u2018 that this rag vendor makes one think when, after drawling the other words, he utters the final syllable with a sharpness befitting the accentuation laid down by the great Pope of the seventh century: \u201cChiffons, ferrailles \u00e0 vendre\u201c (all this chanted slowly, as are the two syllables that follow, whereas the last concludes more briskly than \u2018dicere\u2018) \u201cpeaux d\u2019la-pins.\u201d \u201cLa Valence, la belle Valence, la fra\u00eeche orange.\u201d The humble leeks even: \u201cVoil\u00e0 d\u2019beaux poireaux,\u201d the onions: \u201cHuit sous mon oignon,\u201d sounded for me as if it were an echo of the rolling waves in which, left to herself, Albertine might have perished, and thus assumed the sweetness of a \u201cSuave mari magno.\u201d \u201cVoil\u00e0 des carrottes \u00e0 deux ronds la botte.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d exclaimed Albertine, \u201ccabbages, carrots, oranges. All the things I want to eat. Do make Fran\u00e7oise go out and buy some. She shall cook us a dish of creamed carrots. Besides, it will be so nice to eat all these things together. It will be all the sounds that we hear, transformed into a good dinner. . . . Oh, please, ask Fran\u00e7oise to give us instead a ray with black butter. It is so good!\u201d \u201cMy dear child, of course I will, but don\u2019t wait; if you do, you\u2019ll be asking for all the things on the vegetable-barrows.\u201d \u201cVery well, I\u2019m off, but I never want anything again for our dinners except what we\u2019ve heard cried in the street. It is such fun. And to think that we shall have to wait two whole months before we hear: \u2018Haricots verts et tendres, haricots, v\u2019la l\u2019haricot vert.\u2019 How true that is: tender haricots; you know I like them as soft as soft, dripping with vinegar sauce, you wouldn\u2019t think you were eating, they melt in the mouth like drops of dew. Oh dear, it\u2019s the same with the little hearts of cream cheese, such a long time to wait: \u2018Bon fromage \u00e0 la cr\u00e9, \u00e0 la cr\u00e9, bon fromage.\u2019 And the water-grapes from Fontainebleau: \u2018J\u2019ai du bon chasselas.\u2019\u201d And I thought with dismay of all the time that I should have to spend with her before the water-grapes were in season. \u201cListen, I said that I wanted only the things that we had heard cried, but of course I make exceptions. And so it\u2019s by no means impossible that I may look in at Rebattet\u2019s and order an ice for the two of us. You will tell me that it\u2019s not the season for them, but I do so want one!\u201d I was disturbed by this plan of going to Rebattet\u2019s, rendered more certain and more suspicious in my eyes by the words \u2018it\u2019s by no means impossible.\u2019 It was the day on which the Verdurins were at home, and, ever since Swann had informed them that Rebattet\u2019s was the best place, it was there that they ordered their ices and pastry. \u201cI have no objection to an ice, my darling Albertine, but let me order it for you, I don\u2019t know myself whether it will be from Poir\u00e9-Blanche\u2019s, or Rebattet\u2019s, or the Ritz, anyhow I shall see.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019re going out?\u201d she said with an air of distrust. She always maintained that she would be delighted if I went out more often, but if anything that I said could make her suppose that I would not be staying indoors, her uneasy air made me think that the joy that she would feel in seeing me go out every day was perhaps not altogether sincere. \u201cI may perhaps go out, perhaps not, you know quite well that I never make plans beforehand. In any case ices are not a thing that is cried, that people hawk in the streets, why do you want one?\u201d And then she replied in words which shewed me what a fund of intelligence and latent taste had developed in her since Balbec, in words akin to those which, she pretended, were due entirely to my influence, to living continually in my company, words which, however, I should never have uttered, as though I had been in some way forbidden by some unknown authority ever to decorate my conversation with literary forms. Perhaps the future was not destined to be the same for Albertine as for myself. I had almost a presentiment of this when I saw her eagerness to employ in speech images so \u2018written,\u2019 which seemed to me to be reserved for another, more sacred use, of which I was still ignorant. She said to me (and I was, in spite of everything, deeply touched, for I thought to myself: Certainly I would not speak as she does, and yet, all the same, but for me she would not be speaking like this, she has come profoundly under my influence, she cannot therefore help loving me, she is my handiwork): \u201cWhat I like about these foodstuffs that are cried is that a thing which we hear like a rhapsody changes its nature when it comes to our table and addresses itself to my palate. As for ices (for I hope that you won\u2019t order me one that isn\u2019t cast in one of those old-fashioned moulds which have every architectural shape imaginable), whenever I take one, temples, churches, obelisks, rocks, it is like an illustrated geography-book which I look at first of all and then convert its raspberry or vanilla monuments into coolness in my throat.\u201d I thought that this was a little too well expressed, but she felt that I thought that it was well expressed, and went on, pausing for a moment when she had brought off her comparison to laugh that beautiful laugh of hers which was so painful to me because it was so voluptuous. \u201cOh dear, at the Ritz I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll find Vend\u00f4me Columns of ice, chocolate ice or raspberry, and then you will need a lot of them so that they may look like votive pillars or pylons erected along an avenue to the glory of Coolness. They make raspberry obelisks too, which will rise up here and there in the burning desert of my thirst, and I shall make their pink granite crumble and melt deep down in my throat which they will refresh better than any oasis\u201d (and here the deep laugh broke out, whether from satisfaction at talking so well, or in derision of herself for using such hackneyed images, or, alas, from a physical pleasure at feeling inside herself something so good, so cool, which was tantamount to a sensual satisfaction). \u201cThose mountains of ice at the Ritz sometimes suggest Monte Rosa, and indeed, if it is a lemon ice, I do not object to its not having a monumental shape, its being irregular, abrupt, like one of Elstir\u2019s mountains. It ought not to be too white then, but slightly yellowish, with that look of dull, dirty snow that Elstir\u2019s mountains have. The ice need not be at all big, only half an ice if you like, those lemon ices are still mountains, reduced to a tiny scale, but our imagination restores their dimensions, like those little Japanese dwarf trees which, one knows quite well, are still cedars, oaks, manchineels; so much so that if I arranged a few of them beside a little trickle of water in my room I should have a vast forest stretching down to a river, in which children would be lost. In the same way, at the foot of my yellowish lemon ice, I can see quite clearly postilions, travellers, post chaises over which my tongue sets to work to roll down freezing avalanches that will swallow them up\u201d (the cruel delight with which she said this excited my jealousy); \u201cjust as,\u201d she went on, \u201cI set my lips to work to destroy, pillar after pillar, those Venetian churches of a porphyry that is made with strawberries, and send what I spare of them crashing down upon the worshippers. Yes, all those monuments will pass from their stony state into my inside which throbs already with their melting coolness. But, you know, even without ices, nothing is so exciting or makes one so thirsty as the advertisements of mineral springs. At Montjouvain, at Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s, there was no good confectioner who made ices in the neighbourhood, but we used to make our own tour of France in the garden by drinking a different sparkling water every day, like Vichy water which, as soon as you pour it out, sends up from the bottom of the glass a white cloud which fades and dissolves if you don\u2019t drink it at once.\u201d But to hear her speak of Montjouvain was too painful, I cut her short. \u201cI am boring you, good-bye, my dear boy.\u201d What a change from Balbec, where I would defy Elstir himself to have been able to divine in Albertine this wealth of poetry, a poetry less strange, less personal than that of C\u00e9leste Albaret, for instance. Albertine would never have thought of the things that C\u00e9leste used to say to me, but love, even when it seems to be nearing its end, is partial. I preferred the illustrated geography-book of her ices, the somewhat facile charm of which seemed to me a reason for loving Albertine and a proof that I had an influence over her, that she was in love with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as Albertine had gone out, I felt how tiring it was to me, this perpetual presence, insatiable of movement and life, which disturbed my sleep with its movements, made me live in a perpetual chill by that habit of leaving doors open, forced me \u2014 in order to find pretexts that would justify me in not accompanying her, without, however, appearing too unwell, and at the same time to see that she was not unaccompanied \u2014 to display every day greater ingenuity than Scheherezade. Unfortunately, if by a similar ingenuity the Persian story-teller postponed her own death, I was hastening mine. There are thus in life certain situations which are not all created, as was this, by amorous jealousy and a precarious state of health which does not permit us to share the life of a young and active person, situations in which nevertheless the problem of whether to continue a life shared with that person or to return to the separate existence of the past sets itself almost in medical terms; to which of the two sorts of repose ought we to sacrifice ourselves (by continuing the daily strain, or by returning to the agonies of separation) to that of the head or of the heart?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, I was very glad that Andr\u00e9e was to accompany Albertine to the Trocad\u00e9ro, for certain recent and for that matter entirely trivial incidents had brought it about that while I had still, of course, the same confidence in the chauffeur\u2019s honesty, his vigilance, or at least the perspicacity of his vigilance did not seem to be quite what it had once been. It so happened that, only a short while since, I had sent Albertine alone in his charge to Versailles, and she told me that she had taken her luncheon at the R\u00e9servoirs; as the chauffeur had mentioned the restaurant Vatel, the day on which I noticed this contradiction, I found an excuse to go downstairs and speak to him (it was still the same man, whose acquaintance we had made at Balbec) while Albertine was dressing. \u201cYou told me that you had had your luncheon at the Vatel. Mlle. Albertine mentions the R\u00e9servoirs. What is the meaning of that?\u201d The driver replied: \u201cOh, I said that I had had my luncheon at the Vatel, but I cannot tell where Mademoiselle took hers. She left me as soon as we reached Versailles to take a horse cab, which she prefers when it is not a question of time.\u201d Already I was furious at the thought that she had been alone; still, it was only during the time that she spent at her luncheon. \u201cYou might surely,\u201d I suggested mildly (for I did not wish to appear to be keeping Albertine actually under surveillance, which would have been humiliating to myself, and doubly so, for it would have shewn that she concealed her activities from me), \u201chave had your luncheon, I do not say at her table, but in the same restaurant?\u201d \u201cBut all she told me was to meet her at six o\u2019clock at the Place d\u2019Armes. I had no orders to call for her after luncheon.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d I said, making an effort to conceal my dismay. And I returned upstairs. And so it was for more than seven hours on end that Albertine had been alone, left to her own devices. I might assure myself, it is true, that the cab had not been merely an expedient whereby to escape from the chauffeur\u2019s supervision. In town, Albertine preferred driving in a cab, saying that one had a better view, that the air was more pleasant. Nevertheless, she had spent seven hours, as to which I should never know anything. And I dared not think of the manner in which she must have employed them. I felt that the driver had been extremely clumsy, but my confidence in him was now absolute. For if he had been to the slightest extent in league with Albertine, he would never have acknowledged that he had left her unguarded from eleven o\u2019clock in the morning to six in the afternoon. There could be but one other explanation, and it was absurd, of the chauffeur\u2019s admission. This was that some quarrel between Albertine and himself had prompted him, by making a minor disclosure to me, to shew my mistress that he was not the sort of man who could be hushed, and that if, after this first gentle warning, she did not do exactly as he told her, he would take the law into his own hands. But this explanation was absurd; I should have had first of all to assume a non-existent quarrel between him and Albertine, and then to label as a consummate blackmailer this good-looking motorist who had always shewn himself so affable and obliging. Only two days later, as it happened, I saw that he was more capable than I had for a moment supposed in my frenzy of suspicion of exercising over Albertine a discreet and far-seeing vigilance. For, having managed to take him aside and talk to him of what he had told me about Versailles, I said to him in a careless, friendly tone: \u201cThat drive to Versailles that you told me about the other day was everything that it should be, you behaved perfectly as you always do. But, if I may give you just a little hint, I have so much responsibility now that Mme. Bontemps has placed her niece under my charge, I am so afraid of accidents, I reproach myself so for not going with her, that I prefer that it should be yourself, you who are so safe, so wonderfully skilful, to whom no accident can ever happen, that shall take Mlle. Albertine everywhere. Then I need fear nothing.\u201d The charming apostolic motorist smiled a subtle smile, his hand resting upon the consecration-cross of his wheel. Then he uttered these words which (banishing all the anxiety from my heart where its place was at once filled by joy) made me want to fling my arms round his neck: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he said to me. \u201cNothing can happen to her, for, when my wheel is not guiding her, my eye follows her everywhere. At Versailles, I went quietly along and visited the town with her, as you might say. From the R\u00e9servoirs she went to the Ch\u00e2teau, from the Ch\u00e2teau to the Trianons, and I following her all the time without appearing to see her, and the astonishing thing is that she never saw me. Oh, if she had seen me, the fat would have been in the fire. It was only natural, as I had the whole day before me with nothing to do that I should visit the castle too. All the more as Mademoiselle certainly hasn\u2019t failed to notice that I\u2019ve read a bit myself and take an interest in all those old curiosities\u201d (this was true, indeed I should have been surprised if I had learned that he was a friend of Morel, so far more refined was his taste than the violinist\u2019s). \u201cAnyhow, she didn\u2019t see me.\u201d \u201cShe must have met some of her own friends, of course, for she knows a great many ladies at Versailles.\u201d \u201cNo, she was alone all the time.\u201d \u201cThen people must have stared at her, a girl of such striking appearance, all by herself.\u201d \u201cWhy, of course they stared at her, but she knew nothing about it; she went all the time with her eyes glued to her guide-book, or gazing up at the pictures.\u201d The chauffeur\u2019s story seemed to me all the more accurate in that it was indeed a \u2018card\u2019 with a picture of the Ch\u00e2teau, and another of the Trianons, that Albertine had sent me on the day of her visit. The care with which the obliging chauffeur had followed every step of her course touched me deeply. How was I to suppose that this correction \u2014 in the form of a generous amplification \u2014 of his account given two days earlier was due to the fact that in those two days Albertine, alarmed that the chauffeur should have spoken to me, had surrendered, and made her peace with him. This suspicion never even occurred to me. It is beyond question that this version of the driver\u2019s story, as it rid me of all fear that Albertine might have deceived me, quite naturally cooled me towards my mistress and made me take less interest in the day that she had spent at Versailles. I think, however, that the chauffeur\u2019s explanations, which, by absolving Albertine, made her even more tedious than before, would not perhaps have been sufficient to calm me so quickly. Two little pimples which for some days past my mistress had had upon her brow were perhaps even more effective in modifying the sentiments of my heart. Finally these were diverted farther still from her (so far that I was conscious of her existence only when I set eyes upon her) by the strange confidence volunteered me by Gilberte\u2019s maid, whom I happened to meet. I learned that, when I used to go every day to see Gilberte, she was in love with a young man of whom she saw a great deal more than of myself. I had had an inkling of this for a moment at the time, indeed I had questioned this very maid. But, as she knew that I was in love with Gilberte, she had denied, sworn that never had Mlle. Swann set eyes on the young man. Now, however, knowing that my love had long since died, that for years past I had left all her letters unanswered \u2014 and also perhaps because she was no longer in Gilberte\u2019s service \u2014 of her own accord she gave me a full account of the amorous episode of which I had known nothing. This seemed to her quite natural. I supposed, remembering her oaths at the time, that she had not been aware of what was going on. Far from it, it was she herself who used to go, at Mme. Swann\u2019s orders, to inform the young man whenever the object of my love was alone. The object then of my love. . . . But I asked myself whether my love of those days was as dead as I thought, for this story pained me. As I do not believe that jealousy can revive a dead love, I supposed that my painful impression was due, in part at least, to the injury to my self-esteem, for a number of people whom I did not like and who at that time and even a little later \u2014 their attitude has since altered \u2014 affected a contemptuous attitude towards myself, knew perfectly well, while I was in love with Gilberte, that I was her dupe. And this made me ask myself retrospectively whether in my love for Gilberte there had not been an element of self-love, since it so pained me now to discover that all the hours of affectionate intercourse, which had made me so happy, were known to be nothing more than a deliberate hoodwinking of me by my mistress, by people whom I did not like. In any case, love or self-love, Gilberte was almost dead in me but not entirely, and the result of this annoyance was to prevent me from worrying myself beyond measure about Albertine, who occupied so small a place in my heart. Nevertheless, to return to her (after so long a parenthesis) and to her expedition to Versailles, the postcards of Versailles (is it possible, then, to have one\u2019s heart caught in a noose like this by two simultaneous and interwoven jealousies, each inspired by a different person?) gave me a slightly disagreeable impression whenever, as I tidied my papers, my eye fell upon them. And I thought that if the driver had not been such a worthy fellow, the harmony of his second narrative with Albertine\u2019s \u2018cards\u2019 would not have amounted to much, for what are the first things that people send you from Versailles but the Ch\u00e2teau and the Trianons, unless that is to say the card has been chosen by some person of refined taste who adores a certain statue, or by some idiot who selects as a \u2018view\u2019 of Versailles the station of the horse tramway or the goods depot. Even then I am wrong in saying an idiot, such postcards not having always been bought by a person of that sort at random, for their interest as coming from Versailles. For two whole years men of intelligence, artists, used to find Siena, Venice, Granada a \u2018bore,\u2019 and would say of the humblest omnibus, of every railway-carriage: \u201cThere you have true beauty.\u201d Then this fancy passed like the rest. Indeed, I cannot be certain that people did not revert to the \u2018sacrilege of destroying the noble relics of the past.\u2019 Anyhow, a first class railway carriage ceased to be regarded as a priori more beautiful than St. Mark\u2019s at Venice. People continued to say: \u201cHere you have real life, the return to the past is artificial,\u201d but without drawing any definite conclusion. To make quite certain, without forfeiting any of my confidence in the chauffeur, in order that Albertine might not be able to send him away without his venturing to refuse for fear of her taking him for a spy, I never allowed her to go out after this without the reinforcement of Andr\u00e9e, whereas for some time past I had found the chauffeur sufficient. I had even allowed her then (a thing I would never dare do now) to stay away for three whole days by herself with the chauffeur and to go almost as far as Balbec, so great was her longing to travel at high speed in an open car. Three days during which my mind had been quite at rest, although the rain of postcards that she had showered upon me did not reach me, owing to the appalling state of the Breton postal system (good in summer, but disorganised, no doubt, in winter), until a week after the return of Albertine and the chauffeur, in such health and vigour that on the very morning of their return they resumed, as though nothing had happened, their daily outings. I was delighted that Albertine should be going this afternoon to the Trocad\u00e9ro, to this \u2018special\u2019 matin\u00e9e, but still more reassured that she would have a companion there in the shape of Andr\u00e9e\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dismissing these reflexions, now that Albertine had gone out, I went and took my stand for a moment at the window. There was at first a silence, amid which the whistle of the tripe vendor and the horn of the tramcar made the air ring in different octaves, like a blind piano-tuner. Thea gradually the interwoven motives became distinct, and others were combined with them. There was also a new whistle, the call of a vendor the nature of whose wares I have never discovered, a whistle that was itself exactly like the scream of the tramway, and, as it was not carried out of earshot by its own velocity, one thought of a single car, not endowed with motion, or broken down, immobilised, screaming at short intervals like a dying animal. And I felt that, should I ever have to leave this aristocratic quarter \u2014 unless it were to move to one that was entirely plebeian \u2014 the streets and boulevards of central Paris (where the fruit, fish and other trades, stabilised in huge stores, rendered superfluous the cries of the street hawkers, who for that matter would not have been able to make themselves heard) would seem to me very dreary, quite uninhabitable, stripped, drained of all these litanies of the small trades and peripatetic victuals, deprived of the orchestra that returned every morning to charm me. On the pavement a woman with no pretence to fashion (or else obedient to an ugly fashion) came past, too brightly dressed in a sack overcoat of goatskin; but no, it was not a woman, it was a chauffeur who, enveloped in his ponyskin, was proceeding on foot to his garage. Escaped from the big hotels, their winged messengers, of variegated hue, were speeding towards the termini, bent over their handlebars, to meet the arrivals by the morning trains. The throb of a violin was due at one time to the passing of a motor-car, at another to my not having put enough water in my electric kettle. In the middle of the symphony there rang out an old-fashioned \u2018air\u2019; replacing the sweet seller, who generally accompanied her song with a rattle, the toy seller, to whose pipe was attached a jumping jack which he sent flying in all directions, paraded similar puppets for sale, and without heeding the ritual declamation of Gregory the Great, the reformed declamation of Palestrina or the lyrical declamation of the modern composers, entoned at the top of his voice, a belated adherent of pure melody: \u201cAllons les papas, allons les mamans, contentez vos petits enfants, c\u2019est moi qui les jais, c\u2019est moi qui les vends, et c\u2019est moi qui boulotte l\u2019argent. Tra la la la. Tra la la la laire, tra la la la la la la. Allons les petits!\u201d Some Italian boys in felt b\u00e9rets made no attempt to compete with this lively aria, and it was without a word that they offered their little statuettes. Soon, however, a young fifer compelled the toy merchant to move on and to chant more inaudibly, though in brisk time: \u201cAllons les papas, allons les mamans.\u201d This young fifer, was he one of the dragoons whom I used to hear in the mornings at Donci\u00e8res? No, for what followed was: \u201cVoil\u00e0 le r\u00e9parateur de fa\u00efence et de porcelaine. Je r\u00e9pare le verre, le marbre, le cristal, l\u2019os, l\u2019ivoire et objets d\u2019antiquit\u00e9. Voil\u00e0 le r\u00e9parateur.\u201d In a butcher\u2019s shop, between an aureole of sunshine on the left and a whole ox suspended from a hook on the right, an assistant, very tall and slender, with fair hair and a throat that escaped above his sky-blue collar, was displaying a lightning speed and a religious conscientiousness in putting on one side the most exquisite fillets of beef, on the other the coarsest parts of the rump, placed them upon glittering scales surmounted by a cross, from which hung down a number of beautiful chains, and \u2014 albeit he did nothing afterwards but arrange in the window a display of kidneys, steaks, ribs \u2014 was really far more suggestive of a handsome angel who, on the day of the Last Judgment, will prepare for God, according to their quality, the separation of the good and the evil and the weighing of souls. And once again the thin crawling music of the fife rose in the air, herald no longer of the destruction that Fran\u00e7oise used to dread whenever a regiment of cavalry filed past, but of \u2018repairs\u2019 promised by an \u2018antiquary,\u2019 simpleton or rogue, who, in either case highly eclectic, instead of specialising, applied his art to the most diverse materials. The young bread carriers hastened to stuff into their baskets the long rolls ordered for some luncheon party, while the milk girls attached the bottles of milk to their yokes. The sense of longing with which my eyes followed these young damsels, ought I to consider it quite justified? Would it not have been different if I had been able to detain for a few moments at close quarters one of those whom from the height of my window I saw only inside her shop or in motion. To estimate the loss that I suffered by my seclusion, that is to say the wealth that the day held in store for me, I should have had to intercept in the long unrolling of the animated frieze some girl carrying her linen or her milk, make her pass for a moment, like a silhouette from some mobile scheme of decoration, from the wings to the stage, within the proscenium of my bedroom door, and keep her there under my eye, not without eliciting some information about her which would enable me to find her again some day, like the inscribed ring which ornithologists or ichthyologists attach before setting them free to the legs or bellies of the birds or fishes whose migrations they are anxious to trace\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I asked Fran\u00e7oise, since I had a message that I wished taken, to be good enough to send up to my room, should any of them call, one or other of those girls who were always coming to take away the dirty or bring back the clean linen, or with bread, or bottles of milk, and whom she herself used often to send on errands. In doing so I was like Elstir, who, obliged to remain closeted in his studio, on certain days in spring when the knowledge that the woods were full of violets gave him a hunger to gaze at them, used to send his porter\u2019s wife out to buy him a bunch; then it was not the table upon which he had posed the little vegetable model, but the whole carpet of the underwoods where he had seen in other years, in their thousands, the serpentine stems, bowed beneath the weight of their blue beaks, that Elstir would fancy that he had before his eyes, like an imaginary zone defined in his studio by the limpid odour of the sweet, familiar flower\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of a laundry girl, on a Sunday, there was not the slightest prospect. As for the girl who brought the bread, as ill luck would have it, she had rung the bell when Fran\u00e7oise was not about, had left her rolls in their basket on the landing, and had made off. The fruit girl would not call until much later. Once I had gone to order a cheese at the dairy, and, among the various young assistants, had remarked one girl, extravagantly fair, tall in stature though still little more than a child, who, among the other errand girls, seemed to be dreaming, in a distinctly haughty attitude. I had seen her in the distance only, and for so brief an instant that I could not have described her appearance, except to say that she must have grown too fast and that her head supported a fleece that gave the impression far less of capillary details than of a sculptor\u2019s conventional rendering of the separate channels of parallel drifts of snow upon a glacier. This was all that I had been able to make out, apart from a nose sharply outlined (a rare thing in a child) upon a thin face which recalled the beaks of baby vultures. Besides, this clustering of her comrades round about her had not been the only thing that prevented me from seeing her distinctly, there was also my uncertainty whether the sentiments which I might, at first sight and subsequently, inspire in her would be those of injured pride, or of irony, or of a scorn which she would express later on to her friends. These alternative suppositions which I had formed, in an instant, with regard to her, had condensed round about her the troubled atmosphere in which she disappeared, like a goddess in the cloud that is shaken by thunder. For moral uncertainty is a greater obstacle to an exact visual perception than any defect of vision would be. In this too skinny young person, who moreover attracted undue attention, the excess of what another person would perhaps have called her charms was precisely what was calculated to repel me, but had nevertheless had the effect of preventing me from perceiving even, far more from remembering anything about the other young dairymaids, whom the hooked nose of this one and her gaze \u2014 how unattractive it was! \u2014 pensive, personal, with an air of passing judgment, had plunged in perpetual night, as a white streak of lightning darkens the landscape on either side of it. And so, of my call to order a cheese, at the dairy, I had remembered (if we can say \u2018remember\u2019 in speaking of a face so carelessly observed that we adapt to the nullity of the face ten different noses in succession), I had remembered only this girl who had not attracted me. This is sufficient to engender love. And yet I should have forgotten the extravagantly fair girl and should never have wished to see her again, had not Fran\u00e7oise told me that, child as she was, she had all her wits about her and would shortly be leaving her employer, since she had been going too fast and owed money among the neighbours. It has been said that beauty is a promise of happiness. Inversely, the possibility of pleasure may be a beginning of beauty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I began to read Mamma\u2019s letter. Beneath her quotations from Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cIf my thoughts are not entirely black at Combray, they are at least dark grey, I think of you at every moment; I long for you; your health, your affairs, your absence, what sort of cloud do you suppose they make in my sky?\u201d I felt that my mother was vexed to find Albertine\u2019s stay in the house prolonged, and my intention of marriage, although not yet announced to my mistress, confirmed. She did not express her annoyance more directly because she was afraid that I might leave her letters lying about. Even then, veiled as her letters were, she reproached me with not informing her immediately, after each of them, that I had received it: \u201cYou remember how Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 said: \u2018When we are far apart, we no longer laugh at letters which begin with I have received yours.\u2019\u201d Without referring to what distressed her most, she said that she was annoyed by my lavish expenditure: \u201cWhere on earth does all your money go? It is distressing enough that, like Charles de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, you do not know what you want and are \u2018two or three people at once,\u2019 but do try at least not to be like him in spending money so that I may never have to say of you: \u2018he has discovered how to spend and have nothing to shew, how to lose without staking and how to pay without clearing himself of debt.\u2019\u201d I had just finished Mamma\u2019s letter when Fran\u00e7oise returned to tell me that she had in the house that very same slightly overbold young dairymaid of whom she had spoken to me. \u201cShe can quite well take Monsieur\u2019s note and bring back the answer, if it\u2019s not too far. Monsieur shall see her, she\u2019s just like a Little Red Ridinghood.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise withdrew to fetch the girl, and I could hear her leading the way and saying: \u201cCome along now, you\u2019re frightened because there\u2019s a passage, stuff and nonsense, I never thought you would be such a goose. Have I got to lead you by the hand?\u201d And Fran\u00e7oise, like a good and honest servant who means to see that her master is respected as she respects him herself, had draped herself in that majesty with ennobles the matchmaker in a picture by an old master where, in comparison with her, the lover and his mistress fade into insignificance. But Elstir when he gazed at them had no need to bother about what the violets were doing. The entry of the young dairymaid at once robbed me of my contemplative calm; I could think only of how to give plausibility to the fable of the letter that she was to deliver and I began to write quickly without venturing to cast more than a furtive glance at her, so that I might not seem to have brought her into my room to be scrutinised. She was invested for me with that charm of the unknown which I should not discover in a pretty girl whom I had found in one of those houses where they come to meet one. She was neither naked nor in disguise, but a genuine dairymaid, one of those whom we imagine to be so pretty, when we have not time to approach them; she possessed something of what constitutes the eternal desire, the eternal regret of life, the twofold current of which is at length diverted, directed towards us. Twofold, for if it is a question of the unknown, of a person who must, we guess, be divine, from her stature, her proportions, her indifferent glance, her haughty calm, on the other hand we wish this woman to be thoroughly specialised in her profession, allowing us to escape from ourselves into that world which a peculiar costume makes us romantically believe different. If for that matter we seek to comprise in a formula the law of our amorous curiosities, we should have to seek it in the maximum of difference between a woman of whom we have caught sight and one whom we have approached and caressed. If the women of what used at one time to be called the closed houses, if prostitutes themselves (provided that we know them to be prostitutes) attract us so little, it is not because they are less beautiful than other women, it is because they are ready and waiting; the very object that we are seeking to attain they offer us already; it is because they are not conquests. The difference there is at a minimum. A harlot smiles at us already in the street as she will smile when she is in our room. We are sculptors. We are anxious to obtain of a woman a statue entirely different from that which she has presented to us. We have seen a girl strolling, indifferent, insolent, along the seashore, we have seen a shop-assistant, serious and active, behind her counter, who will answer us stiffly, if only so as to escape the sarcasm of her comrades, a fruit seller who barely answers us at all. Well, we know no rest until we can discover by experiment whether the proud girl on the seashore, the shop-assistant on her high horse of \u2018What will people say?\u2019, the preoccupied fruit seller cannot be made, by skilful handling on our part, to relax their rectangular attitude, to throw about our neck their fruit-laden arms, to direct towards our lips, with a smile of consent, eyes hitherto frozen or absent \u2014 oh, the beauty of stern eyes \u2014 in working hours when the worker was so afraid of the gossip of her companions, eyes that avoided our beleaguering stare and, now that we have seen her alone and face to face, make their pupils yield beneath the sunlit burden of laughter when we speak of making love. Between the shopgirl, the laundress busy with her iron, the fruit seller, the dairymaid on the one hand, and the same girl when she is about to become our mistress, the maximum of difference is attained, stretched indeed to its extreme limits, and varied by those habitual gestures of her profession which make a pair of arms, during the hours of toil, something as different as possible (regarded as an arabesque pattern) from those supple bonds that already every evening are fastened about our throat while the mouth shapes itself for a kiss. And so we pass our whole life in uneasy advances, incessantly renewed, to respectable girls whom their calling seems to separate from us. Once they are in our arms, they are no longer anything more than they originally were, the gulf that we dreamed of crossing has been bridged. But we begin afresh with other women, we devote to these enterprises all our time, all our money, all our strength, our blood boils at the too cautious driver who is perhaps going to make us miss our first assignation, we work ourself into a fever. That first meeting, we know all the same that it will mean the vanishing of an illusion. It does not so much matter that the illusion still persists; we wish to see whether we can convert it into reality, and then we think of the laundress whose coldness we remarked. Amorous curiosity is like that which is aroused in us by the names of places; perpetually disappointed, it revives and remains for ever insatiable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! As soon as she stood before me, the fair dairymaid with the ribbed tresses, stripped of all that I had imagined and of the desire that had been aroused in me, was reduced to her own proportions. The throbbing cloud of my suppositions no longer enveloped her in a shimmering haze. She acquired an almost beggarly air from having (in place of the ten, the score that I recalled in turn without being able to fix any of them in my memory) but a single nose, rounder than I had thought, which made her appear rather a fool and had in any case lost the faculty of multiplying itself. This flyaway caught on the wing, inert, crushed, incapable of adding anything to its own paltry appearance, had no longer my imagination to collaborate with it. Fallen into the inertia of reality, I sought to rebound; her cheeks, which I had not seen in the shop, appeared to me so pretty that I became alarmed, and, to put myself in countenance, said to the young dairymaid: \u201cWould you be so kind as to pass me the Figaro which is lying there, I must make sure of the address to which I am going to send you.\u201d Thereupon, as she picked up the newspaper, she disclosed as far as her elbow the red sleeve of her jersey and handed me the conservative sheet with a neat and courteous gesture which pleased me by its intimate rapidity, its pliable contour and its scarlet hue. While I was opening the Figaro, in order to say something and without raising my eyes, I asked the girl: \u201cWhat do you call that red knitted thing you\u2019re wearing? It is very becoming.\u201d She replied: \u201cIt\u2019s my golf.\u201d For, by a slight downward tendency common to all fashions, the garments and styles which, a few years earlier, seemed to belong to the relatively smart world of Albertine\u2019s friends, were now the portion of working girls. \u201cAre you quite sure it won\u2019t be giving you too much trouble,\u201d I said, while I pretended to be searching the columns of the Figaro, \u201cif I send you rather a long way?\u201d As soon as I myself appeared to find the service at all arduous that she would be performing by taking a message for me, she began to feel that it would be a trouble to her. \u201cThe only thing is, I have to be going out presently on my bike. Good lord, you know, Sunday\u2019s the only day we\u2019ve got.\u201d \u201cBut won\u2019t you catch cold, going bare-headed like that?\u201d \u201cOh, I shan\u2019t be bare-headed, I shall have my polo, and I could get on without it with all the hair I have.\u201d I raised my eyes to the blaze of curling tresses and felt myself caught in their swirl and swept away, with a throbbing heart, amid the lightning and the blasts of a hurricane of beauty. I continued to study the newspaper, but albeit this was only to keep myself in countenance and to gain time, while I merely pretended to read, I took in nevertheless the meaning of the words that were before my eyes, and my attention was caught by the following: \u201cTo the programme already announced for this afternoon in the great hall of the Trocad\u00e9ro must be added the name of Mlle. Lea who has consented to appear in Les Fourberies de N\u00e9rine. She will of course sustain the part of N\u00e9rine, in which she is astounding in her display of spirit and bewitching gaiety.\u201d It was as though a hand had brutally torn from my heart the bandage beneath which its wound had begun since my return from Balbec to heal. The flood of my anguish escaped in torrents, Lea, that was the actress friend of the two girls at Balbec whom Albertine, without appearing to see them, had, one afternoon at the Casino, watched in the mirror. It was true that at Balbec Albertine, at the name of Lea, had adopted a special tone of compunction in order to say to me, almost shocked that anyone could suspect such a pattern of virtue: \u201cOh no, she is not in the least that sort of woman, she is a very respectable person.\u201d Unfortunately for me, when Albertine made a statement of this sort, it was never anything but the first stage towards other, divergent statements. Shortly after the first, came this second: \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d In the third phase, after Albertine had spoken to me of somebody who was \u2018above suspicion\u2019 and whom (in the second place) she did not know, she first of all forgot that she had said that she did not know her and then, in a speech in which she contradicted herself unawares, informed me that she did know her. This first act of oblivion completed, and the fresh, statement made, a second oblivion began, to wit that the person was above suspicion. \u201cIsn\u2019t So-and-So,\u201d I would ask, \u201cone of those women?\u201d \u201cWhy, of course, everybody knows that!\u201d Immediately the note of compunction was sounded afresh to utter a statement which was a vague echo, greatly reduced, of the first statement of all. \u201cI\u2019m bound to say that she has always behaved perfectly properly with me. Of course, she knows that I would send her about her business if she tried it on. Still, that makes no difference. I am obliged to give her credit for the genuine respect she has always shewn for me. It is easy to see she knew the sort of person she had to deal with.\u201d We remember the truth because it has a name, is rooted in the past, but a makeshift lie is quickly forgotten. Albertine forgot this latest lie, her fourth, and, one day when she was anxious to gain my confidence by confiding in me, went so far as to tell me, with regard to the same person who at the outset had been so respectable and whom she did not know. \u201cShe took quite a fancy to me at one time. She asked me, three or four times, to go home with her and to come upstairs to her room. I saw no harm in going home with her, where everybody could see us, in broad daylight, in the open air. But when we reached her front door I always made some excuse and I never went upstairs.\u201d Shortly after this, Albertine made an allusion to the beautiful things that this lady had in her room. By proceeding from one approximation to another, I should no doubt have arrived at making her tell me the truth which was perhaps less serious than I had been led to believe, for, although perhaps easy going with women, she preferred a male lover, and now that she had myself would not have given a thought to L\u00e9a. In any case, with regard to this person, I was still at the first stage of revelation and was not aware whether Albertine knew her. Already, in the case of many women at any rate, it would have been enough for me to collect and present to my mistress, in a synthesis, her contradictory statements, in order to convict her of her misdeeds (misdeeds which, like astronomical laws, it is a great deal easier to deduce by a process of reasoning than to observe, to surprise in the act). But then she would have preferred to say that one of her statements had been a lie, the withdrawal of which would thus bring about the collapse of my whole system of evidence, rather than admit that everything which she had told me from the start was simply a tissue of falsehood. There are similar tissues in the Thousand and One Nights, which we find charming. They pain us, coming from a person whom we love, and thereby enable us to penetrate a little deeper in our knowledge of human nature instead of being content to play upon the surface. Grief penetrates into us and forces us out of painful curiosity to penetrate other people. Whence emerge truths which we feel that we have no right to keep hidden, so much so that a dying atheist who has discovered them, certain of his own extinction, indifferent to fame, will nevertheless devote his last hours on earth to an attempt to make them known\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, I was still at the first stage of enlightenment with regard to L\u00e9a. I was not even aware whether Albertine knew her. No matter, it all came to the same thing. I must at all costs prevent her from \u2014 at the Troca-d\u00e9ro \u2014 renewing this acquaintance or making the acquaintance of this stranger. I have said that I did not know whether she knew L\u00e9a; I ought, however, to have learned it at Balbec, from Albertine herself. For defective memory obliterated from my mind as well as from Albertine\u2019s a great many of the statements that she had made to me. Memory, instead of being a duplicate always present before our eyes of the various events of our life, is rather an abyss from which at odd moments a chance resemblance enables us to draw up, restored to life, dead impressions; but even then there are innumerable little details which have not fallen into that potential reservoir of memory, and which will remain for ever beyond our control. To anything that we do not know to be related to the real life of the person whom we love we pay but scant attention, we forget immediately what she has said to us about some incident or people that we do not know, and her expression while she was saying it. And so when, in due course, our jealousy is aroused by these same people, and seeks to make sure that it is not mistaken, that it is they who are responsible for the haste which our mistress shews in leaving the house, her annoyance when we have prevented her from going out by returning earlier than usual; our jealousy ransacking the past in search of a clue can find nothing; always retrospective, it is like a historian who has to write the history of a period for which he has no documents; always belated, it dashes like a mad bull to the spot where it will not find the proud and brilliant creature who is infuriating it with his darts and whom the crowd admire for his splendour and his cunning. Jealousy fights the empty air, uncertain as we are in those dreams in which we are distressed because we cannot find in his empty house a person whom we have known well in life, but who here perhaps is really another person and has merely borrowed the features of our friend, uncertain as we are even more after we awake when we seek to identify this or that detail of our dream. What was our mistress\u2019s expression when she told us this; did she not look happy, was she not actually whistling, a thing that she never does unless there is some amorous thought in her mind? In the time of our love, if our presence teased her and irritated her a little, has she not told us something that is contradicted by what she now affirms, that she knows or does not know such and such a person? We do not know, we shall never find out; we strain after the unsubstantial fragments of a dream, and all the time our life with our mistress continues, our life indifferent to what we do not know to be important to us, attentive to what is perhaps of no importance, hagridden by people who have no real connexion with us, full of lapses of memory, gaps, vain anxieties, our life as fantastic as a dream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I realised that the young dairymaid was still in the room. I told her that the place was certainly a long way off, that I did not need her. Whereupon she also decided that it would be too much trouble: \u201cThere\u2019s a fine match coming off, I don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d I felt that she must already be devoted to sport and that in a few years\u2019 time she would be talking about \u2018living her own life.\u2019 I told her that I certainly did not need her any longer, and gave her five francs. Immediately, having little expected this largesse, and telling herself that if she earned five francs for doing nothing she would have a great deal more for taking my message, she began to find that her match was of no importance. \u201cI could easily have taken your message. I can always find time.\u201d But I thrust her from the room, I needed to be alone, I must at all costs prevent Albertine from any risk of meeting Lea\u2019s girl friends at the Trocad\u00e9ro. I must try, and I must succeed; to tell the truth I did not yet see how, and during these first moments I opened my hands, gazed at them, cracked my knuckles, whether because the mind which cannot find what it is seeking, in a fit of laziness allows itself to halt for an instant at a spot where the most unimportant things are distinctly visible to it, like the blades of grass on the embankment which we see from the carriage window trembling in the wind, when the train halts in the open country \u2014 an immobility that is not always more fertile than that of the captured animal which, paralysed by fear or fascinated, gazes without moving a muscle \u2014 or that I might hold my body in readiness \u2014 with my mind at work inside it and, in my mind, the means of action against this or that person \u2014 as though it were no more than a weapon from which would be fired the shot that was to separate Albertine from L\u00e9a and her two friends. It is true that earlier in the morning, when Fran\u00e7oise had come in to tell me that Albertine was going to the Trocad\u00e9ro, I had said to myself: \u201cAlbertine is at liberty to do as she pleases\u201d and had supposed that until evening came, in this radiant weather, her actions would remain without any perceptible importance to myself; but it was not only the morning sun, as I had thought, that had made me so careless; it was because, having obliged Albertine to abandon the plans that she might perhaps have initiated or even completed at the Verdurins\u2019, and having restricted her to attending a performance which I myself had chosen, so that she could not have made any preparations, I knew that whatever she did would of necessity be innocent. Just as, if Albertine had said a few moments later: \u201cIf I kill myself, it\u2019s all the same to me,\u201d it would have been because she was certain that she would not kill herself. Surrounding myself and Albertine there had been this morning (far more than the sunlight in the air) that atmosphere which we do not see, but by the translucent and changing medium of which we do see, I her actions, she the importance of her own life, that is to say those beliefs which we do not perceive but which are no more assimilable to a pure vacuum than is the air that surrounds us; composing round about us a variable atmosphere, sometimes excellent, often unbreathable, they deserve to be studied and recorded as carefully as the temperature, the barometric pressure, the weather, for our days have their own singularity, physical and moral. My belief, which I had failed to remark this morning, and yet in which I had been joyously enveloped until the moment when I had looked a second time at the Figaro, that Albertine would do nothing that was not harmless, this belief had vanished. I was living no longer in the fine sunny day, but in a day carved out of the other by my anxiety lest Albertine might renew her acquaintance with L\u00e9a and more easily still with the two girls, should they go, as seemed to me probable, to applaud the actress at the Trocad\u00e9ro where it would not be difficult for them, in one of the intervals, to come upon Albertine. I no longer thought of Mlle. Vinteuil, the name of L\u00e9a had brought back to my mind, to make me jealous, the image of Albertine in the Casino watching the two girls. For I possessed in my memory only series of Albertines, separate from one another, incomplete, outlines, snapshots; and so my jealousy was restricted to an intermittent expression, at once fugitive and fixed, and to the people who had caused that expression to appear upon Albertine\u2019s face. I remembered her when, at Balbec, she received undue attention from the two girls or from women of that sort; I remembered the distress that I used to feel when I saw her face subjected to an active scrutiny, like that of a painter preparing to make a sketch, entirely covered by them, and, doubtless on account of my presence, submitting to this contact without appearing to notice it, with a passivity that was perhaps clandestinely voluptuous. And before she recovered herself and spoke to me there was an instant during which Albertine did not move, smiled into the empty air, with the same air of feigned spontaneity and concealed pleasure as if she were posing for somebody to take her photograph; or even seeking to assume before the camera a more dashing pose \u2014 that which she had adopted at Donci\u00e8res when we were walking with Saint-Loup, and, laughing and passing her tongue over her lips, she pretended to be teasing a dog. Certainly at such moments she was not at all the same as when it was she that was interested in little girls who passed us. Then, on the contrary, her narrow velvety gaze fastened itself upon, glued itself to the passer-by, so adherent, so corrosive, that you felt that when she removed it it must tear away the skin. But at that moment this other expression, which did at least give her a serious air, almost as though she were in pain, had seemed to me a pleasant relief after the toneless blissful expression she had worn in the presence of the two girls, and I should have preferred the sombre expression of the desire that she did perhaps feel at times to the laughing expression caused by the desire which she aroused. However she might attempt to conceal her consciousness of it, it bathed her, enveloped her, vaporous, voluptuous, made her whole face appear rosy. But everything that Albertine held at such moments suspended in herself, that radiated round her and hurt me so acutely, how could I tell whether, once my back was turned, she would continue to keep it to herself, whether to the advances of the two girls, now that I was no longer with her, she would not make some audacious response. Indeed, these memories caused me intense grief, they were like a complete admission of Albertine\u2019s failings, a general confession of her infidelity against which were powerless the various oaths that she swore to me and I wished to believe, the negative results of my incomplete researches, the assurances, made perhaps in connivance with her, of Andr\u00e9e. Albertine might deny specified betrayals; by words that she let fall, more emphatic than her declarations to the contrary, by that searching gaze alone, she had made confession of what she would fain have concealed, far more than any specified incident, what she would have let herself be killed sooner than admit: her natural tendency. For there is no one who will willingly deliver up his soul. Notwithstanding the grief that these memories were causing me, could I have denied that it was the programme of the matin\u00e9e at the Trocad\u00e9ro that had revived my need of Albertine? She was one of those women in whom their misdeeds may at a pinch take the place of absent charms, and no less than their misdeeds the kindness that follows them and restores to us that sense of comfort which in their company, like an invalid who is never well for two days in succession, we are incessantly obliged to recapture. And then, even more than their misdeeds while we are in love with them, there are their misdeeds before we made their acquaintance, and first and foremost: their nature. What makes this sort of love painful is, in fact, that there preexists a sort of original sin of Woman, a sin which makes us love them, so that, when we forget it, we feel less need of them, and to begin to love afresh we must begin to suffer afresh. At this moment, the thought that she must not meet the two girls again and the question whether or not she knew L\u00e9a were what was chiefly occupying my mind, in spite of the rule that we ought not to take an interest in particular facts except in relation to their general significance, and notwithstanding the childishness, as great as that of longing to travel or to make friends with women, of shattering our curiosity against such elements of the invisible torrent of painful realities which will always remain unknown to us as have happened to crystallise in our mind. But, even if we should succeed in destroying that crystallisation, it would at once be replaced by another. Yesterday I was afraid lest Albertine should go to see Mme. Verdurin. Now my only thought was of L\u00e9a. Jealousy, which wears a bandage over its eyes, is not merely powerless to discover anything in the darkness that enshrouds it, it is also one of those torments where the task must be incessantly repeated, like that of the Danaids, or of Ixion. Even if her friends were not there, what impression might she not form of L\u00e9a, beautified by her stage attire, haloed with success, what thoughts would she leave in Albertine\u2019s mind, what desires which, even if she repressed them, would in my house disgust her with a life in which she was unable to gratify them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, how could I tell that she was not acquainted with L\u00e9a, and would not pay her a visit in her dressing-room; and, even if L\u00e9a did not know her, who could assure me that, having certainly seen her at Balbec, she would not recognise her and make a signal to her from the stage that would entitle Albertine to seek admission behind the scenes? A danger seems easy to avoid after it has been conjured away. This one was not yet conjured, I was afraid that it might never be, and it seemed to me all the more terrible. And yet this love for Albertine which I felt almost vanish when I attempted to realise it, seemed in a measure to acquire a proof of its existence from the intensity of my grief at this moment. I no longer cared about anything else, I thought only of how I was to prevent her from remaining at the Trocad\u00e9ro, I would have offered any sum in the world to L\u00e9a to persuade her not to go there. If then we prove our choice by the action that we perform rather than by the idea that we form, I must have been in love with Albertine. But this renewal of my suffering gave no further consistency to the image that I beheld of Albertine. She caused my calamities, like a deity that remains invisible. Making endless conjectures, I sought to shield myself from suffering without thereby realising my love. First of all, I must make certain that L\u00e9a was really going to perform at the Trocad\u00e9ro. After dismissing the dairymaid, I telephoned to Bloch, whom I knew to be on friendly terms with L\u00e9a, in order to ask him. He knew nothing about it and seemed surprised that the matter could be of any importance to me. I decided that I must set to work immediately, remembered that Fran\u00e7oise was ready to go out and that I was not, and as I rose and dressed made her take a motor-car; she was to go to the Trocad\u00e9ro, engage a seat, look high and low for Albertine and give her a note from myself. In this note I told her that I was greatly upset by a letter which I had just received from that same lady on whose account she would remember that I had been so wretched one night at Balbec. I reminded her that, on the following day, she had reproached me for not having sent for her. And so I was taking the liberty, I informed her, of asking her to sacrifice her matin\u00e9e and to join me at home so that we might take a little fresh air together, which might help me to recover from the shock. But as I should be a long time in getting ready, she would oblige me, seeing that she had Fran\u00e7oise as an escort, by calling at the Trois-Quartiers (this shop, being smaller, seemed to me less dangerous than the Bon March\u00e9) to buy the scarf of white tulle that she required. My note was probably not superfluous. To tell the truth, I knew nothing that Albertine had done since I had come to know her, or even before. But in her conversation (she might, had I mentioned it to her, have replied that I had misunderstood her) there were certain contradictions, certain embellishments which seemed to me as decisive as catching her red-handed, but less serviceable against Albertine who, often caught out in wrongdoing like a child, had invariably, by dint of sudden, strategic changes of front, stultified my cruel onslaught and reestablished her own position. Cruel, most of all, to myself. She employed, not from any refinement of style, but in order to correct her imprudences, abrupt breaches of syntax not unlike that figure which the grammarians call anacoluthon or some such name. Having allowed herself, while discussing women, to say: \u201cI remember, the other day, I . . .,\u201d she would at once catch her breath, after which \u2018I\u2019 became \u2018she\u2019: it was something that she had witnessed as an innocent spectator, not a thing that she herself had done. It was not herself that was the heroine of the anecdote. I should have liked to recall how, exactly, the sentence began, so as to conclude for myself, since she had broken off in the middle, how it would have ended. But as I had heard the end, I found it hard to remember the beginning, from which perhaps my air of interest had made her deviate, and was left still anxious to know what she was really thinking, what she really remembered. The first stages of falsehood on the part of our mistress are like the first stages of our own love, or of a religious vocation. They take shape, accumulate, pass, without our paying them any attention. When we wish to remember in what manner we began to love a woman, we are already in love with her; when we dreamed about her before falling in love, we did not say to ourself: This is the prelude to a love affair, we must pay attention! \u2014 and our dreams took us by surprise, and we barely noticed them. So also, except in cases that are comparatively rare, it is only for the convenience of my narrative that I have frequently in these pages confronted one of Albertine\u2019s false statements with her previous assertion upon the same subject. This previous assertion, as often as not, since I could not read the future and did not at the time guess what contradictory affirmation was to form a pendant to it, had slipped past unperceived, heard it is true by my ears, but without my isolating it from the continuous flow of Albertine\u2019s speech. Later on, faced with the self-evident lie, or seized by an anxious doubt, I would fain have recalled it; but in vain; my memory had not been warned in time, and had thought it unnecessary to preserve a copy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I urged Fran\u00e7oise, when she had got Albertine out of the hall, to let me know by telephone, and to bring her home, whether she was willing or not. \u201cThat would be the last straw, that she should not be willing to come and see Monsieur,\u201d replied Fran\u00e7oise. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s as fond as all that of seeing me.\u201d \u201cThen she must be an ungrateful wretch,\u201d went on Fran\u00e7oise, in whom Albertine was renewing after all these years the same torment of envy that Eulalie used at one time to cause her in my aunt\u2019s sickroom. Unaware that Albertine\u2019s position in my household was not of her own seeking but had been decided by myself (a fact which, from motives of self-esteem and to make Fran\u00e7oise angry, I preferred to conceal from her), she admired and execrated the girl\u2019s dexterity, called her when she spoke of her to the other servants a \u2018play-actress,\u2019 a wheedler who could twist me round her little finger. She dared not yet declare open war against her, shewed her a smiling countenance and sought to acquire merit in my sight by the services which she performed for her in her relations with myself, deciding that it was useless to say anything to me and that she would gain nothing by doing so; but if the opportunity ever arose, if ever she discovered a crack in Albertine\u2019s armour, she was fully determined to enlarge it, and to part us for good and all. \u201cUngrateful? No, Fran\u00e7oise, I think it is I that am ungrateful, you don\u2019t know how good she is to me.\u201d (It was so soothing to give the impression that I was loved.) \u201cBe as quick as you can.\u201d \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll get a move on.\u201d Her daughter\u2019s influence was beginning to contaminate Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s vocabulary. So it is that all languages lose their purity by the admission of new words. For this decadence of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s speech, which I had known in its golden period, I was myself indirectly responsible. Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s daughter would not have made her mother\u2019s classic language degenerate into the vilest slang, had she been content to converse with her in dialect. She had never given up the use of it, and when they were both in my room at once, if they had anything private to say, instead of shutting themselves up in the kitchen, they armed themselves, right in the middle of my room, with a screen more impenetrable than the most carefully shut door, by conversing in dialect. I supposed merely that the mother and daughter were not always on the best of terms, if I was to judge by the frequency with which they employed the only word that I could make out: m\u2019esasperate (unless it was that the object of their exasperation was myself). Unfortunately the most unfamiliar tongue becomes intelligible in time when we are always hearing it spoken. I was sorry that this should be dialect, for I succeeded in picking it up, and should have been no less successful had Fran\u00e7oise been in the habit of expressing herself in Persian. In vain might Fran\u00e7oise, when she became aware of my progress, accelerate the speed of her utterance, and her daughter likewise, it was no good. The mother was greatly put out that I understood their dialect, then delighted to hear me speak it. I am bound to admit that her delight was a mocking delight, for albeit I came in time to pronounce the words more or less as she herself did, she found between our two ways of pronunciation an abyss of difference which gave her infinite joy, and she began to regret that she no longer saw people to whom she had not given a thought for years but who, it appeared, would have rocked with a laughter which it would have done her good to hear, if they could have heard me speaking their dialect so badly. In any case, no joy came to mitigate her sorrow that, however badly I might pronounce it, I understood well. Keys become useless when the person whom we seek to prevent from entering can avail himself of a skeleton key or a jemmy. Dialect having become useless as a means of defence, she took to conversing with her daughter in a French which rapidly became that of the most debased epochs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was now ready, but Fran\u00e7oise had not yet telephoned; I ought perhaps to go out without waiting for a message. But how could I tell that she would find Albertine, that the latter would not have gone behind the scenes, that even if Fran\u00e7oise did find her, she would allow herself to be taken away? Half an hour later the telephone bell began to tinkle and my heart throbbed tumultuously with hope and fear. There came, at the bidding of an operator, a flying squadron of sounds which with an instantaneous speed brought me the words of the telephonist, not those of Fran\u00e7oise whom an inherited timidity and melancholy, when she was brought face to face with any object unknown to her fathers, prevented from approaching a telephone receiver, although she would readily visit a person suffering from a contagious disease. She had found Albertine in the lobby by herself, and Albertine had simply gone to warn Andr\u00e9e that she was not staying any longer and then had hurried back to Fran\u00e7oise. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t angry? Oh, I beg your pardon; will you please ask the person whether the young lady was angry?\u201d \u201cThe lady asks me to say that she wasn\u2019t at all angry, quite the contrary, in fact; anyhow, if she wasn\u2019t pleased, she didn\u2019t shew it. They are starting now for the Trois-Quartiers, and will be home by two o\u2019clock.\u201d I gathered that two o\u2019clock meant three, for it was past two o\u2019clock already. But Fran\u00e7oise suffered from one of those peculiar, permanent, incurable defects, which we call maladies; she was never able either to read or to announce the time correctly. I have never been able to understand what went on in her head. When Fran\u00e7oise, after consulting her watch, if it was two o\u2019clock, said: \u201cIt is one\u201d or \u201cit is three o\u2019clock,\u201d I have never been able to understand whether the phenomenon that occurred was situated in her vision or in her thought or in her speech; the one thing certain is that the phenomenon never failed to occur. Humanity is a very old institution. Heredity, cross-breeding have given an irresistible force to bad habits, to vicious reflexes. One person sneezes and gasps because he is passing a rosebush, another breaks out in an eruption at the smell of wet paint, has frequent attacks of colic if he has to start on a journey, and grandchildren of thieves who are themselves millionaires and generous cannot resist the temptation to rob you of fifty francs. As for knowing in what consisted Francoise\u2019s incapacity to tell the time correctly, she herself never threw any light upon the problem. For, notwithstanding the anger that I generally displayed at her inaccurate replies, Fran\u00e7oise never attempted either to apologise for her mistake or to explain it. She remained silent, pretending not to hear, and thereby making me lose my temper altogether. I should have liked to hear a few words of justification, were it only that I might smite her hip and thigh; but not a word, an indifferent silence. In any case, about the timetable for to-day there could be no doubt; Albertine was coming home with Fran\u00e7oise at three o\u2019clock, Albertine would not be meeting L\u00e9a or her friends. Whereupon the danger of her renewing relations with them, having been averted, at once began to lose its importance in my eyes and I was amazed, seeing with what ease it had been averted, that I should have supposed that I would not succeed in averting it. I felt a keen impulse of gratitude to Albertine, who, I could see, had not gone to the Trocad\u00e9ro to meet L\u00e9a\u2019s friends, and shewed me, by leaving the performance and coming home at a word from myself, that she belonged to me more than I had imagined. My gratitude was even greater when a bicyclist brought me a line from her bidding me be patient, and full of the charming expressions that she was in the habit of using. \u201cMy darling, dear Marcel, I return less quickly than this cyclist, whose machine I would like to borrow in order to be with you sooner. How could you imagine that I might be angry or that I could enjoy anything better than to be with you? It will be nice to go out, just the two of us together; it would be nicer still if we never went out except together. The ideas you get into your head! What a Marcel! What a Marcel! Always and ever your Albertine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The frocks that I bought for her, the yacht of which I had spoken to her, the wrappers from Fortuny\u2019s, all these things having in this obedience on Albertine\u2019s part not their recompense but their complement, appeared to me now as so many privileges that I was enjoying; for the duties and expenditure of a master are part of his dominion, and define it, prove it, fully as much as his rights. And these rights which she recognised in me were precisely what gave my expenditure its true character: I had a woman of my own, who, at the first word that I sent to her unexpectedly, made my messenger telephone humbly that she was coming, that she was allowing herself to be brought home immediately. I was more of a master than I had supposed. More of a master, in other words more of a slave. I no longer felt the slightest impatience to see Albertine. The certainty that she was at this moment engaged in shopping with Fran\u00e7oise, or that she would return with her at an approaching moment which I would willingly have postponed, illuminated like a calm and radiant star a period of time which I would now have been far better pleased to spend alone. My love for Albertine had made me rise and get ready to go out, but it would prevent me from enjoying my outing. I reflected that on a Sunday afternoon like this little shopgirls, midinettes, prostitutes must be strolling in the Bois. And with the words midinettes, little shopgirls (as had often happened to me with a proper name, the name of a girl read in the account of a ball), with the image of a white bodice, a short skirt, since beneath them I placed a stranger who might perhaps come to love me, I created out of nothing desirable women, and said to myself: \u201cHow charming they must be!\u201d But of what use would it be to me that they were charming, seeing that I was not going out alone. Taking advantage of the fact that I still was alone, and drawing the curtains together so that the sun should not prevent me from reading the notes, I sat down at the piano, turned over the pages of Vinteuil\u2019s sonata which happened to be lying there, and began to play; seeing that Albertine\u2019s arrival was still a matter of some time but was on the other hand certain, I had at once time to spare and tranquillity of mind. Floating in the expectation, big with security, of her return escorted by Fran\u00e7oise and in my confidence in her docility as in the blessedness of an inward light as warming as the light of the sun, I might dispose of my thoughts, detach them for a moment from Albertine, apply them to the sonata. In the latter, indeed, I did not take pains to remark how the combinations of the voluptuous and anxious motives corresponded even more closely now to my love for Albertine, from which jealousy had been absent for so long that I had been able to confess to Swann my ignorance of that sentiment. No, taking the sonata from another point of view, regarding it in itself as the work of a great artist, I was carried back upon the tide of sound to the days at Combray \u2014 I do not mean at Montjouvain and along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, but to walks along the Guermantes way \u2014 when I had myself longed to become an artist. In definitely abandoning that ambition, had I forfeited something real? Could life console me for the loss of art, was there in art a more profound reality, in which our true personality finds an expression that is not afforded it by the activities of life? Every great artist seems indeed so different from all the rest, and gives us so strongly that sensation of individuality for which we seek in vain in our everyday existence. Just as I was thinking thus, I was struck by a passage in the sonata, a passage with which I was quite familiar, but sometimes our attention throws a different light upon things which we have long known, and we remark in them what we have never seen before. As I played the passage, and for all that in it Vinteuil had been trying to express a fancy which would have been wholly foreign to Wagner, I could not help murmuring \u2018Tristan,\u2019 with the smile of an old friend of the family discovering a trace of the grandfather in an intonation, a gesture of the grandson who never set eyes on him. And as the friend then examines a photograph which enables him to estimate the likeness, so, in front of Vinteuil\u2019s sonata, I set up on the music-rest the score of Tristan, a selection from which was being given that afternoon, as it happened, at the Lamoureux concert. I had not, in admiring the Bayreuth master, any of the scruples of those people whom, like Nietzsche, their sense of duty bids to shun in art as in life the beauty that tempts them, and who, tearing themselves from Tristan as they renounce Parsifal, and, in their spiritual asceticism, progressing from one mortification to another, arrive, by following the most bloody of viae Cruets, at exalting themselves to the pure cognition and perfect adoration of Le Postillon de Longjumeau. I began to perceive how much reality there is in the work of Wagner, when I saw in my mind\u2019s eye those insistent, fleeting themes which visit an act, withdraw only to return, and, sometimes distant, drowsy, almost detached, are at other moments, while remaining vague, so pressing and so near, so internal, so organic, so visceral, that one would call them the resumption not so much of a musical motive as of an attack of neuralgia\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Music, very different in this respect from Albertine\u2019s society, helped me to descend into myself, to make there a fresh discovery: that of the difference that I had sought in vain in life, in travel, a longing for which was given me, however, by this sonorous tide which sent its sunlit waves rolling to expire at my feet. A twofold difference. As the spectrum makes visible to us the composition of light, so the harmony of a Wagner, the colour of an Elstir enable us to know that essential quality of another person\u2019s sensations into which love for another person does not allow us to penetrate. Then there is diversity inside the work itself, by the sole means that it has of being effectively diverse, to wit combining diverse individualities. Where a minor composer would pretend that he was portraying a squire, or a knight, whereas he would make them both sing the same music, Wagner on the contrary allots to each denomination a different reality, and whenever a squire appears, it is an individual figure, at once complicated and simplified, that, with a joyous, feudal clash of warring sounds, inscribes itself in the vast, sonorous mass. Whence the completeness of a music that is indeed filled with so many different musics, each of which is a person. A person or the impression that is given us by a momentary aspect of nature. Even what is most independent of the sentiment that it makes us feel preserves its outward and entirely definite reality; the song of a bird, the ring of a hunter\u2019s horn, the air that a shepherd plays upon his pipe, cut out against the horizon their silhouette of sound. It is true that Wagner had still to bring these together, to make use of them, to introduce them into an orchestral whole, to make them subservient to the highest musical ideals, but always respecting their original nature, as a carpenter respects the grain, the peculiar essence of the wood that he is carving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But notwithstanding the richness of these works in which the contemplation of nature has its place by the side of action, by the side of persons who are something more than proper names, I thought how markedly, all the same, these works participate in that quality of being \u2014 albeit marvellously \u2014 always incomplete, which is the peculiarity of all the great works of the nineteenth century, with which the greatest writers of that century have stamped their books, but, watching themselves at work as though they were at once author and critic, have derived from this self-contemplation a novel beauty, exterior and superior to the work itself, imposing upon it retrospectively a unity, a greatness which it does not possess. Without pausing to consider him who saw in his novels, after they had appeared, a Human Comedy, nor those who entitled heterogeneous poems or essays The Legend of the Ages or The Bible of Humanity, can we not say all the same of the last of these that he is so perfect an incarnation of the nineteenth century that the greatest beauties in Michelet are to be sought not so much in his work itself as in the attitudes that he adopts when he is considering his work, not in his History of France nor in his History of the Revolution, but in his prefaces to his books? Prefaces, that is to say pages written after the books themselves, in which he considers the books, and with which we must include here and there certain phrases beginning as a rule with a: \u201cShall I say?\u201d which is not a scholar\u2019s precaution but a musician\u2019s cadence. The other musician, he who was delighting me at this moment, Wagner, retrieving some exquisite scrap from a drawer of his writing-table to make it appear as a theme, retrospectively necessary, in a work of which he had not been thinking at the moment when he composed it, then having composed a first mythological opera, and a second, and afterwards others still, and perceiving all of a sudden that he had written a tetralogy, must have felt something of the same exhilaration as Balzac, when, casting over his works the eye at once of a stranger and of a father, finding in one the purity of Raphael, in another the simplicity of the Gospel, he suddenly decided, as he shed a retrospective illumination upon them, that they would be better brought together in a cycle in which the same characters would reappear, and added to his work, in this act of joining it together, a stroke of the brush, the last and the most sublime. A unity that was ulterior, not artificial, otherwise it would have crumbled into dust like all the other syst\u00e9matisations of mediocre writers who with the elaborate assistance of titles and sub-titles give themselves the appearance of having pursued a single and transcendent design. Not fictitious, perhaps indeed all the more real for being ulterior, for being born of a moment of enthusiasm when it is discovered to exist among fragments which need only to be joined together. A unity that has been unaware of itself, therefore vital and not logical, that has not banned variety, chilled execution. It emerges (only applying itself this time to the work as a whole) like a fragment composed separately, born of an inspiration, not required by the artificial development of a theme, which comes in to form an integral part of the rest. Before the great orchestral movement that precedes the return of Yseult, it is the work itself that has attracted to it the half-forgotten air of a shepherd\u2019s pipe. And, no doubt, just as the swelling of the orchestra at the approach of the ship, when it takes hold of these notes on the pipe, transforms them, infects them with its own intoxication, breaks their rhythm, clarifies their tone, accelerates their movement, multiplies their instrumentation, so no doubt Wagner himself was filled with joy when he discovered in his memory a shepherd\u2019s air, incorporated it in his work, gave it its full wealth of meaning. This joy moreover never forsakes him. In him, however great the melancholy of the poet, it is consoled, surpassed \u2014 that is to say destroyed, alas, too soon \u2014 by the delight of the craftsman. But then, no less than by the similarity I had remarked just now between Vinteuil\u2019s phrase and Wagner\u2019s, I was troubled by the thought of this Vulcan-like craftsmanship. Could it be this that gave to great artists the illusory appearance of a fundamental originality, incommensurable with any other, the reflexion of a more than human reality, actually the result of industrious toil? If art be no more than that, it is not more real than life and I had less cause for regret. I went on playing Tristan. Separated from Wagner by the wall of sound, I could hear him exult, invite me to share his joy, I could hear ring out all the louder the immortally youthful laugh and the hammer-blows of Siegfried, in which, moreover, more marvellously struck were those phrases, the technical skill of the craftsman serving merely to make it easier for them to leave the earth, birds akin not to Lohengrin\u2019s swan but to that aeroplane which I had seen at Balbec convert its energy into vertical motion, float over the sea and lose itself in the sky. Perhaps, as the birds that soar highest and fly most swiftly have a stronger wing, one required one of these frankly material vehicles to explore the infinite, one of these 120 horsepower machines, marked Mystery, in which nevertheless, however high one flies, one is prevented to some extent from enjoying the silence of space by the overpowering roar of the engine!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For some reason or other the course of my musings, which hitherto had wandered among musical memories, turned now to those men who have been the best performers of music in our day, among whom, slightly exaggerating his merit, I included Morel. At once my thoughts took a sharp turn, and it was Morel\u2019s character, certain eccentricities of his nature that I began to consider. As it happened \u2014 and this might be connected though it should not be confused with the neurasthenia to which he was a prey \u2014 Morel was in the habit of talking about his life, but always presented so shadowy a picture of it that it was difficult to make anything out. For instance, he placed himself entirely at M. de Charlus\u2019s disposal on the understanding that he must keep his evenings free, as he wished to be able after dinner to attend a course of lectures on algebra. M. de Charlus conceded this, but insisted upon seeing him after the lectures. \u201cImpossible, it\u2019s an old Italian painting\u201d (this witticism means nothing when written down like this; but M. de Charlus having made Morel read l\u2019\u00c9ducation sentimentale, in the penultimate chapter of which Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Moreau uses this expression, it was Morel\u2019s idea of a joke never to say the word \u2018impossible\u2019 without following it up with \u201cit\u2019s an old Italian painting\u201d) \u201cthe lectures go on very late, and I\u2019ve already given a lot of trouble to the lecturer, who naturally would be annoyed if I came away in the middle.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s no need to attend lectures, algebra is not a thing like swimming, or even English, you can learn it equally well from a book,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, who had guessed from the first that these algebra lectures were one of those images of which it was impossible to make out anything. It was perhaps some affair with a woman, or, if Morel was seeking to earn money in shady ways and had attached himself to the secret police, a nocturnal expedition with detectives, or possibly, what was even worse, an engagement as one of the young men whose services may be required in a brothel. \u201cA great deal easier, from a book,\u201d Morel assured M. de Charlus, \u201cfor it\u2019s impossible to make head or tail of the lectures.\u201d \u201cThen why don\u2019t you study it in my house, where you would be far more comfortable?\u201d M. de Charlus might have answered, but took care not to do so, knowing that at once, preserving only the same essential element that the evening hours must be set apart, the imaginary algebra course would change to a compulsory lesson in dancing or in drawing. In which M. de Charlus might have seen that he was mistaken, partially at least, for Morel did often spend his time at the Baron\u2019s in solving equations. M. de Charlus did raise the objection that algebra could be of little use to a violinist. Morel replied that it was a distraction which helped him to pass the time and to conquer his neurasthenia. No doubt M. de Charlus might have made inquiries, have tried to find out what actually were these mysterious and ineluctable lectures on algebra that were delivered only at night. But M. de Charlus was not qualified to unravel the tangled skein of Morel\u2019s occupations, being himself too much caught in the toils of social life. The visits he received or paid, the time he spent at his club, dinner-parties, evenings at the theatre prevented him from thinking about the problem, or for that matter about the violent and vindictive animosity which Morel had (it was reported) indulged and at the same time sought to conceal in the various environments, the different towns in which his life had been spent, and where people still spoke of him with a shudder, with bated breath, never venturing to say anything definite about him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was unfortunately one of the outbursts of this neurotic irritability that I was privileged to hear that day when, rising from the piano, I went down to the courtyard to meet Albertine, who still did not appear. As I passed by Jupien\u2019s shop, in which Morel and the girl who, I supposed, was shortly to become his wife were by themselves, Morel was screaming at the top of his voice, thereby revealing an accent that I had never heard in his speech, a rustic tone, suppressed as a rule, and very strange indeed. His words were no less strange, faulty from the point of view of the French language, but his knowledge of everything was imperfect. \u201cWill you get out of here, grand pied de grue, grand pied de grue, grand pied de grue,\u201d he repeated to the poor girl who at first had certainly not understood what he meant, and now, trembling and indignant, stood motionless before him. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to get out of here, grand pied de grue, grand pied de grue; go and fetch your uncle till I tell him what you are, you whore.\u201d Just at that moment the voice of Jupien who was coming home talking to one of his friends was heard in the courtyard, and as I knew that Morel was an utter coward, I decided that it was unnecessary to join my forces with those of Jupien and his friend, who in another moment would have entered the shop, and I retired upstairs again to escape Morel, who, for all his having pretended to be so anxious that Jupien should be fetched (probably in order to frighten and subjugate the girl, an act of blackmail which rested probably upon no foundation), made haste to depart as soon as he heard his voice in the courtyard. The words I have set down here are nothing, they would not explain why my heart throbbed so as I went upstairs. These scenes of which we are witnesses in real life find an incalculable element of strength in what soldiers call, in speaking of a military offensive, the advantage of surprise, and however agreeably I might be soothed by the knowledge that Albertine, instead of remaining at the Trocad\u00e9ro, was coming home to me, I still heard ringing in my ears the accent of those words ten times repeated: \u201cGrand pied de grue, grand pied de grue,\u201d which had so appalled me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gradually my agitation subsided. Albertine was on her way home. I should hear her ring the bell in a moment. I felt that my life was no longer what it might have become, and that to have a woman in the house like this with whom quite naturally, when she returned home, I should have to go out, to the adornment of whose person the strength and activity of my nature were to be ever more and more diverted, made me as it were a bough that has blossomed, but is weighed down by the abundant fruit into which all its reserves of strength have passed. In contrast to the anxiety that I had been feeling only an hour earlier, the calm that I now felt at the prospect of Albertine\u2019s return was more ample than that which I had felt in the morning before she left the house. Anticipating the future, of which my mistress\u2019s docility made me practically master, more resistant, as though it were filled and stabilised by the imminent, importunate, inevitable, gentle presence, it was the calm (dispensing us from the obligation to seek our happiness in ourselves) that is born of family feeling and domestic bliss. Family and domestic: such was again, no less than the sentiment that had brought me such great peace while I was waiting for Albertine, that which I felt later on when I drove out with her. She took off her glove for a moment, whether to touch my hand, or to dazzle me by letting me see on her little finger, next to the ring that Mme. Bontemps had given her, another upon which was displayed the large and liquid surface of a clear sheet of ruby. \u201cWhat! Another ring, Albertine. Your aunt is generous!\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t get this from my aunt,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cIt was I who bought it, now that, thanks to you, I can save up ever so much money. I don\u2019t even know whose it was before. A visitor who was short of money left it with the landlord of an hotel where I stayed at Le Mans. He didn\u2019t know what to do with it, and would have let it go for much less than it was worth. But it was still far too dear for me. Now that, thanks to you, I\u2019m becoming a smart lady, I wrote to ask him if he still had it. And here it is.\u201d \u201cThat makes a great many rings, Albertine. Where will you put the one that I am going to give you? Anyhow, it is a beautiful ring, I can\u2019t quite make out what that is carved round the ruby, it looks like a man\u2019s head grinning. But my eyes aren\u2019t strong enough.\u201d \u201cThey might be as strong as you like, you would be no better off. I can\u2019t make it out either.\u201d In the past it had often happened, as I read somebody\u2019s memoirs, or a novel, in which a man always goes out driving with a woman, takes tea with her, that I longed to be able to do likewise. I had thought sometimes that I was successful, as for instance when I took Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress out with me, or went to dinner with her. But in vain might I summon to my assistance the idea that I was at that moment actually impersonating the character that I had envied in the novel, that idea assured me that I ought to find pleasure in Rachel\u2019s society, and afforded me none. For, whenever we attempt to imitate something that has really existed, we forget that this something was brought about not by the desire to imitate but by an unconscious force which itself also is real; but this particular impression which I had been unable to derive from all my desire to taste a delicate pleasure in going out with Rachel, behold I was now tasting it without having made the slightest effort to procure it, but for quite different reasons, sincere, profound; to take a single instance, for the reason that my jealousy prevented me from letting Albertine go out of my sight, and, the moment that I was able to leave the house, from letting her go anywhere without me. I tasted it only now, because our knowledge is not of the external objects which we try to observe, but of involuntary sensations, because in the past a woman might be sitting in the same carriage as myself, she was not really by my side, so long as she was not created afresh there at every moment by a need of her such as I felt of Albertine, so long as the constant caress of my gaze did not incessantly restore to her those tints that need to be perpetually refreshed, so long as my senses, appeased it might be but still endowed with memory, did not place beneath those colours savour and substance, so long as, combined with the senses and with the imagination that exalts them, jealousy was not maintaining the woman in equilibrium by my side by a compensated attraction as powerful as the law of gravity. Our motor-car passed swiftly along the boulevards, the avenues whose lines of houses, a rosy congelation of sunshine and cold, reminded me of calling upon Mme. Swann in the soft light of her chrysanthemums, before it was time to ring for the lamps\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had barely time to make out, being divided from them by the glass of the motor-car as effectively as I should have been by that of my bedroom window, a young fruit seller, a dairymaid, standing in the doorway of her shop, illuminated by the sunshine like a heroine whom my desire was sufficient to launch upon exquisite adventures, on the threshold of a romance which I might never know. For I could not ask Albertine to let me stop, and already the young women were no longer visible whose features my eyes had barely distinguished, barely caressed their fresh complexions in the golden vapour in which they were bathed. The emotion that I felt grip me when I caught sight of a wine-merchant\u2019s girl at her desk or a laundress chatting in the street was the emotion that we feel on recognising a goddess. Now that Olympus no longer exists, its inhabitants dwell upon the earth. And when, in composing a mythological scene, painters have engaged to pose as Venus or Ceres young women of humble birth, who follow the most sordid callings, so far from committing sacrilege, they have merely added, restored to them the quality, the various attributes which they had forfeited. \u201cWhat did you think of the Trocad\u00e9ro, you little gadabout?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m jolly glad I came away from it to go out with you. As architecture, it\u2019s pretty measly, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s by Davioud, I fancy.\u201d \u201cBut how learned my little Albertine is becoming! Of course it was Davioud who built it, but I couldn\u2019t have told you offhand.\u201d \u201cWhile you are asleep, I read your books, you old lazybones.\u201d \u201cListen, child, you are changing so fast and becoming so intelligent\u201d (this was true, but even had it not been true I was not sorry that she should have the satisfaction, failing any other, of saying to herself that at least the time which she spent in my house was not being entirely wasted) \u201cthat I don\u2019t mind telling you things that would generally be regarded as false and which are all on the way to a truth that I am seeking. You know what is meant by impressionism?\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d \u201cVery well then, this is what I mean: you remember the church at Marcouville l\u2019Orgueilleuse which Elstir disliked because it was new. Isn\u2019t it rather a denial of his own impressionism when he subtracts such buildings from the general impression in which they are contained to bring them out of the light in which they are dissolved and scrutinise like an archaeologist their intrinsic merit? When he begins to paint, have not a hospital, a school, a poster upon a hoarding the same value as a priceless cathedral which stands by their side in a single indivisible image? Remember how the fa\u00e7ade was baked by the sun, how that carved frieze of saints swam upon the sea of light. What does it matter that a building is new, if it appears to be old, or even if it does not. All the poetry that the old quarters contain has been squeezed out to the last drop, but if you look at some of the houses that have been built lately for rich tradesmen, in the new districts, where the stone is all freshly cut and still quite white, don\u2019t they seem to rend the torrid air of noon in July, at the hour when the shopkeepers go home to luncheon in the suburbs, with a cry as harsh as the odour of the cherries waiting for the meal to begin in the darkened dining-room, where the prismatic glass knife-rests project a multicoloured fire as beautiful as the windows of Chartres?\u201d \u201cHow wonderful you are! If I ever do become clever, it will be entirely owing to you.\u201d \u201cWhy on a fine day tear your eyes away from the Trocad\u00e9ro, whose giraffe-neck towers remind one of the Charterhouse of Pavia?\u201d \u201cIt reminded me also, standing up like that on its hill, of a Mantegna that you have, I think it\u2019s of Saint Sebastian, where in the background there\u2019s a city like an amphitheatre, and you would swear you saw the Trocad\u00e9ro.\u201d \u201cThere, you see! But how did you come across my Mantegna? You are amazing!\u201d We had now reached a more plebeian quarter, and the installation of an ancillary Venus behind each counter made it as it were a suburban altar at the foot of which I would gladly have spent the rest of my life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As one does on the eve of a premature death, I drew up a mental list of the pleasures of which I was deprived by Albertine\u2019s setting a full stop to my freedom. At Passy it was in the open street, so crowded were the footways, that a group of girls, their arms encircling one another\u2019s waist, left me marvelling at their smile. I had not time to see it clearly, but it is hardly probable that I exaggerated it; in any crowd after all, in any crowd of young people, it is not unusual to come upon the effigy of a noble profile. So that these assembled masses on public holidays are to the voluptuary as precious as is to the archaeologist the congested state of a piece of ground in which digging will bring to light ancient medals. We arrived at the Bois. I reflected that, if Albertine had not come out with me, I might at this moment, in the enclosure of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, have been hearing the Wagnerian tempest set all the rigging of the orchestra ascream, draw to itself, like a light spindrift, the tune of the shepherd\u2019s pipe which I had just been playing to myself, set it flying, mould it, deform it, divide it, sweep it away in an ever-increasing whirlwind. I was determined, at any rate, that our drive should be short, and that we should return home early, for, without having mentioned it to Albertine, I had decided to go that evening to the Verdurins\u2019. They had recently sent me an invitation which I had flung into the waste-paper basket with all the rest. But I changed my mind for this evening, for I meant to try to find out who the people were that Albertine might have been hoping to meet there in the afternoon. To tell the truth, I had reached that stage in my relations with Albertine when, if everything remains the same, if things go on normally, a woman ceases to serve us except as a starting point towards another woman. She still retains a corner in our heart, but a very small corner; we hasten out every evening in search of unknown women, especially unknown women who are known to her and can tell us about her life. Herself, after all, we have possessed, have exhausted everything that she has consented to yield to us of herself. Her life is still herself, but that part of herself which we do not know, the things as to which we have questioned her in vain and which we shall be able to gather from fresh lips\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If my life with Albertine was to prevent me from going to Venice, from travelling, at least I might in the meantime, had I been alone, have made the acquaintance of the young midinettes scattered about in the sunlight of this fine Sunday, in the sum total of whose beauty I gave a considerable place to the unknown life that animated them. The eyes that we see, are they not shot through by a gaze as to which we do not know what images, memories, expectations, disdains it carries, a gaze from which we cannot separate them? The life that the person who passes by is living, will it not impart, according to what it is, a different value to the knitting of those brows, to the dilatation of those nostrils? Albertine\u2019s presence debarred me from going to join them and perhaps also from ceasing to desire them. The man who would maintain in himself the desire to go on living, and his belief in something more delicious than the things of daily life, must go out driving; for the streets, the avenues are full of goddesses. But the goddesses do not allow us to approach them. Here and there, among the trees, at the entrance to some caf\u00e9, a waitress was watching like a nymph on the edge of a sacred grove, while beyond her three girls were seated by the sweeping arc of their bicycles that were stacked beside them, like three immortals leaning against the clouds or the fabulous coursers upon which they perform their mythological journeys. I remarked that, whenever Albertine looked for a moment at these girls, with a profound attention, she at once turned to gaze at myself. But I was not unduly troubled, either by the intensity of this contemplation, or by its brevity for which its intensity compensated; as for the latter, it often happened that Albertine, whether from exhaustion, or because it was an intense person\u2019s way of looking at other people, used to gaze thus in a sort of brown study at my father, it might be, or at Fran\u00e7oise; and as for the rapidity with which she turned to look at myself, it might be due to the fact that Albertine, knowing my suspicions, might prefer, even if they were not justified, to avoid giving them any foothold. This attention, moreover, which would have seemed to me criminal on Albertine\u2019s part (and quite as much so if it had been directed at young men), I fastened, without thinking myself reprehensible for an instant, almost deciding indeed that Albertine was reprehensible for preventing me, by her presence, from stopping the car and going to join them, upon all the midinettes. We consider it innocent to desire a thing and atrocious that the other person should desire it. And this contrast between what concerns ourselves on the one hand, and on the other the person with whom we are in love, is not confined only to desire, but extends also to falsehood. What is more usual than a lie, whether it is a question of masking the daily weakness of a constitution which we wish to be thought strong, of concealing a vice, or of going off, without offending the other person, to the thing that we prefer? It is the most necessary instrument of conversation, and the one that is most widely used. But it is this which we actually propose to banish from the life of her whom we love; we watch for it, scent it, detest it everywhere. It appalls us, it is sufficient to bring about a rupture, it seems to us to be concealing the most serious faults, except when it does so effectively conceal them that we do not suspect their existence. A strange state this in which we are so inordinately sensitive to a pathogenic agent which its universal swarming makes inoffensive to other people and so serious to the wretch who finds that he is no longer immune to it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The life of these pretty girls (because of my long periods of seclusion, I so rarely met any) appeared to me as to everyone in whom facility of realisation has not destroyed the faculty of imagination, a thing as different from anything that I knew, as desirable as the most marvellous cities that travel holds in store for us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The disappointment that I had felt with the women whom I had known, in the cities which I had visited, did not prevent me from letting myself be caught by the attraction of others or from believing in their reality; thus, just as seeing Venice \u2014 that Venice for which the spring weather too filled me with longing, and which marriage with Albertine would prevent me from knowing \u2014 seeing Venice in a panorama which Ski would perhaps have declared to be more beautiful in tone than the place itself, would to me have been no substitute for the journey to Venice the length of which, determined without any reference to myself, seemed to me an indispensable preliminary; similarly, however pretty she might be, the midinette whom a procuress had artificially provided for me could not possibly be a substitute for her who with her awkward figure was strolling at this moment under the trees, laughing with a friend. The girl that I might find in a house of assignation, were she even better-looking than this one, could not be the same thing, because we do not look at the eyes of a girl whom we do not know as we should look at a pair of little discs of opal or agate. We know that the little ray which colours them or the diamond dust that makes them sparkle is all that we can see of a mind, a will, a memory in which is contained the home life that we do not know, the intimate friends whom we envy. The enterprise of taking possession of all this, which is so difficult, so stubborn, is what gives its value to the gaze far more than its merely physical beauty (which may serve to explain why the same young man can awaken a whole romance in the imagination of a woman who has heard somebody say that he is the Prince of Wales, whereas she pays no more attention to him after learning that she is mistaken); to find the midinette in the house of assignation is to find her emptied of that unknown life which permeates her and which we aspire to possess with her, it is to approach a pair of eyes that have indeed become mere precious stones, a nose whose quivering is as devoid of meaning as that of a flower. No, that unknown midinette who was passing at that moment, it seemed to me as indispensable, if I wished to continue to believe in her reality, to test her resistance by adapting my behaviour to it, challenging a rebuff, returning to the charge, obtaining an assignation, waiting for her as she came away from her work, getting to know, episode by episode, all that composed the girl\u2019s life, traversing the space that, for her, enveloped the pleasure which I was seeking, and the distance which her different habits, her special mode of life, set between me and the attention, the favour which I wished to attain and capture, as making a long journey in the train if I wished to believe in the reality of Venice which I should see and which would not be merely a panoramic show in a World Exhibition. But this very parallel between desire and travel made me vow to myself that one day I would grasp a little more closely the nature of this force, invisible but as powerful as any faith, or as, in the world of physics, atmospheric pressure, which exalted to such a height cities and women so long as I did not know them, and slipped away from beneath them as soon as I had approached them, made them at once collapse and fall flat upon the dead level of the most commonplace reality\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farther along another girl was kneeling beside her bicycle, which she was putting to rights. The repair finished, the young racer mounted her machine, but without straddling it as a man would have done. For a moment the bicycle swerved, and the young body seemed to have added to itself a sail, a huge wing; and presently we saw dart away at full speed the young creature half-human, half-winged, angel or peri, pursuing her course\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was what a life with Albertine prevented me from enjoying. Prevented me, did I say? Should I not have thought rather: what it provided for my enjoyment. If Albertine had not been living with me, had been free, I should have imagined, and with reason, every woman to be a possible, a probable object of her desire, of her pleasure. They would have appeared to me like those dancers who, in a diabolical ballet, representing the Temptations to one person, plunge their darts in the heart of another. Midinettes, schoolgirls, actresses, how I should have hated them all! Objects of horror, I should have excepted them from the beauty of the universe. My bondage to Albertine, by permitting me not to suffer any longer on their account, restored them to the beauty of the world. Inoffensive, having lost the needle that stabs the heart with jealousy, I was able to admire them, to caress them with my eyes, another day more intimately perhaps. By secluding Albertine, I had at the same time restored to the universe all those rainbow wings which sweep past us in public gardens, ballrooms, theatres, and which became tempting once more to me because she could no longer succumb to their temptation. They composed the beauty of the world. They had at one time composed that of Albertine. It was because I had beheld her as a mysterious bird, then as a great actress of the beach, desired, perhaps won, that I had thought her wonderful. As soon as she was a captive in my house, the bird that I had seen one afternoon advancing with measured step along the front, surrounded by the congregation of the other girls like seagulls alighted from who knows whence, Albertine had lost all her colours, with all the chances that other people had of securing her for themselves. Gradually she had lost her beauty. It required excursions like this, in which I imagined her, but for my presence, accosted by some woman, or by some young man, to make me see her again amid the splendour of the beach, albeit my jealousy was on a different plane from the decline of the pleasures of my imagination. But notwithstanding these abrupt reversions in which, desired by other people, she once more became beautiful in my eyes, I might very well divide her visit to me in two periods, an earlier in which she was still, although less so every day, the glittering actress of the beach, and a later period in which, become the grey captive, reduced to her dreary self, I required those flashes in which I remembered the past to make me see her again in colour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, in the hours in which I felt most indifferent towards her, there came back to me the memory of a far-off moment when upon the beach, before I had made her acquaintance, a lady being near her with whom I was on bad terms and with whom I was almost certain now that she had had relations, she burst out laughing, staring me in the face in an insolent fashion. All round her hissed the blue and polished sea. In the sunshine of the beach, Albertine, in the midst of her friends, was the most beautiful of them all. She was a splendid girl, who in her familiar setting of boundless waters, had \u2014 precious in the eyes of the lady who admired her \u2014 inflicted upon me this unpardonable insult. It was unpardonable, for the lady would perhaps return to Balbec, would notice perhaps, on the luminous and echoing beach, that Albertine was absent. But she would not know that the girl was living with me, was wholly mine. The vast expanse of blue water, her forgetfulness of the fondness that she had felt for this particular girl and would divert to others, had closed over the outrage that Albertine had done me, enshrining it in a glittering and unbreakable casket. Then hatred of that woman gnawed my heart; of Albertine also, but a hatred mingled with admiration of the beautiful, courted girl, with her marvellous hair, whose laughter upon the beach had been an insult. Shame, jealousy, the memory of my earliest desires and of the brilliant setting had restored to Albertine the beauty, the intrinsic merit of other days. And thus there alternated with the somewhat oppressive boredom that I felt in her company a throbbing desire, full of splendid storms and of regrets; according to whether she was by my side in my bedroom or I set her at liberty in my memory upon the front, in her gay seaside frocks, to the sound of the musical instruments of the sea \u2014 Albertine, now extracted from that environment, possessed and of no great value, now plunged back into it, escaping from me into a past which I should never be able to know, hurting me, in her friend\u2019s presence, as much as the splash of the wave or the heat of the sun \u2014 Albertine restored to the beach or brought back again to my room, in a sort of amphibious love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farther on, a numerous band were playing ball. All these girls had come out to make the most of the sunshine, for these days in February, even when they are brilliant, do not last long and the splendour of their light does not postpone the hour of its decline. Before that hour drew near, we passed some time in twilight, because after we had driven as far as the Seine, where Albertine admired, and by her presence prevented me from admiring the reflexions of red sails upon the wintry blue of the water, a solitary house in the distance like a single red poppy against the clear horizon, of which Saint-Cloud seemed, farther off again, to be the fragmentary, crumbling, rugged p\u00e9trification, we left our motor-car and walked a long way together; indeed for some moments I gave her my arm, and it seemed to me that the ring which her arm formed round it united our two persons in a single self and linked our separate destinies together\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At our feet, our parallel shadows, where they approached and joined, traced an exquisite pattern. No doubt it already seemed to me a marvellous thing at home that Albertine should be living with me, that it should be she that came and lay down on my bed. But it was so to speak the transportation of that marvel out of doors, into the heart of nature, that by the shore of that lake in the Bois, of which I was so fond, beneath the trees, it should be her and none but her shadow, the pure and simplified shadow of her leg, of her bust, that the sun had to depict in monochrome by the side of mine upon the gravel of the path. And I found a charm that was more immaterial doubtless, but no less intimate, than in the drawing together, the fusion of our bodies, in that of our shadows. Then we returned to our car. And it chose, for our homeward journey, a succession of little winding lanes along which the wintry trees, clothed, like ruins, in ivy and brambles, seemed to be pointing the way to the dwelling of some magician. No sooner had we emerged from their dusky cover than we found, upon leaving the Bois, the daylight still so bright that I imagined that I should still have time to do everything that I wanted to do before dinner, when, only a few minutes later, at the moment when our car approached the Arc de Triomphe, it was with a sudden start of surprise and dismay that I perceived, over Paris, the moon prematurely full, like the face of a clock that has stopped and makes us think that we are late for an engagement. We had told the driver to take us home. To Albertine, this meant also coming to my home. The company of those women, however dear to us, who are obliged to leave us and return home, does not bestow that peace which I found in the company of Albertine seated in the car by my side, a company that was conveying us not to the void in which lovers have to part but to an even more stable and more sheltered union in my home, which was also hers, the material symbol of my possession of her. To be sure, in order to possess, one must first have desired. We do not possess a line, a surface, a mass unless it is occupied by our love. But Albertine had not been for me during our drive, as Rachel had been in the past, a futile dust of flesh and clothing. The imagination of my eyes, my lips, my hands had at Balbec so solidly built, so tenderly polished her body that now in this car, to touch that body, to contain it, I had no need to press my own body against Albertine, nor even to see her; it was enough to hear her, and if she was silent to know that she was by my side; my interwoven senses enveloped her altogether and when, as we arrived at the front door, she quite naturally alighted, I stopped for a moment to tell the chauffeur to call for me later on, but my gaze enveloped her still while she passed ahead of me under the arch, and it was still the same inert, domestic calm that I felt as I saw her thus, solid, flushed, opulent and captive, returning home quite naturally with myself, as a woman who was my own property, and, protected by its walls, disappearing into our house. Unfortunately, she seemed to feel herself a prisoner there, and to share the opinion of that Mme. de La Rochefoucauld who, when somebody asked her whether she was not glad to live in so beautiful a home as Liancourt, replied: \u201cThere is no such thing as a beautiful prison\u201d; if I was to judge by her miserable, weary expression that evening as we dined together in my room. I did not notice it at first; and it was I that was made wretched by the thought that, if it had not been for Albertine (for with her I should have suffered too acutely from jealousy in an hotel where all day long she would have been exposed to contact with a crowd of strangers), I might at that moment be dining in Venice in one of those little restaurants, barrel-vaulted like the hold of a ship, from which one looks out on the Grand Canal through arched windows framed in Moorish mouldings\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ought to add that Albertine greatly admired in my room a big bronze by Barbedienne which with ample justification Bloch considered extremely ugly. He had perhaps less reason to be surprised at my having kept it. I had never sought, like him, to furnish for artistic effect, to compose my surroundings, I was too lazy, too indifferent to the things that I was in the habit of seeing every day. Since my taste was not involved, I had a right not to harmonise my interior. I might perhaps, even without that, have discarded the bronze. But ugly and expensive things are of great use, for they enjoy, among people who do not understand us, who have not our taste and with whom we cannot fall in love, a prestige that would not be shared by some proud object that does not reveal its beauty. Now the people who do not understand us are precisely the people with regard to whom alone it may be useful to us to employ a prestige which our intellect is enough, to assure us among superior people. Albertine might indeed be beginning to shew taste, she still felt a certain respect for the bronze, and this respect was reflected upon myself in a consideration which, coming from Albertine, mattered infinitely more to me than the question of keeping a bronze which was a trifle degrading, since I was in love with Albertine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the thought of my bondage ceased of a sudden to weigh upon me and I looked forward to prolonging it still further, because I seemed to perceive that Albertine was painfully conscious of her own. True that whenever I had asked her whether she was not bored in my house, she had always replied that she did not know where it would be possible to have a happier time. But often these words were contradicted by an air of nervous exhaustion, of longing to escape\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly if she had the tastes with which I had credited her, this inhibition from ever satisfying them must have been as provoking to her as it was calming to myself, calming to such an extent that I should have decided that the hypothesis of my having accused her unjustly was the most probable, had it not been so difficult to fit into this hypothesis the extraordinary pains that Albertine was taking never to be alone, never to be disengaged, never to stop for a moment outside the front door when she came in, to insist upon being accompanied, whenever she went to the telephone, by some one who would be able to repeat to me what she had said, by Fran\u00e7oise or Andr\u00e9e, always to leave me alone (without appearing to be doing so on purpose) with the latter, after they had been out together, so that I might obtain a detailed report of their outing. With this marvellous docility were contrasted certain quickly repressed starts of impatience, which made me ask myself whether Albertine was not planning to cast off her chain. Certain subordinate incidents seemed to corroborate my supposition. Thus, one day when I had gone out by myself, in the Passy direction, and had met Gis\u00e8le, we began to talk about one thing and another. Presently, not without pride at being able to do so, I informed her that I was constantly seeing Albertine. Gis\u00e8le asked me where she could find her, since there was something that she simply must tell her. \u201cWhy, what is it?\u201d \u201cSomething to do with some young friends of hers.\u201d \u201cWhat friends? I may perhaps be able to tell you, though that need not prevent you from seeing her.\u201d \u201cOh, girls she knew years ago, I don\u2019t remember their names,\u201d Gis\u00e8le replied vaguely, and beat a retreat. She left me, supposing herself to have spoken with such prudence that the whole story must seem to me perfectly straightforward. But falsehood is so unexacting, needs so little help to make itself manifest! If it had been a question of friends of long ago, whose very names she no longer remembered, why must she speak about them to Albertine? This \u2018must,\u2019 akin to an expression dear to Mme. Cottard: \u2018in the nick of time,\u2019 could be applicable only to something particular, opportune, perhaps urgent, relating to definite persons. Besides, something about her way of opening her mouth, as though she were going to yawn, with a vague expression, as she said to me (almost drawing back her body, as though she began to reverse her engine at this point in our conversation): \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t remember their names,\u201d made her face, and in harmony with it her voice, as clear a picture of falsehood as the wholly different air, tense, excited, of her previous \u2018must\u2018 was of truth. I did not question Gis\u00e8le. Of what use would it have been to me? Certainly, she was not lying in the same fashion as Albertine. And certainly Albertine\u2019s lies pained me more. But they had obviously a point in common: the fact of the lie itself, which in certain cases is self-evident. Not evidence of the truth that the lie conceals. We know that each murderer in turn imagines that he has arranged everything so cleverly that he will not be caught, and so it is with liars, particularly the woman with whom we are in love. We do not know where she has been, what she has been doing. But at the very moment when she speaks, when she speaks of something else beneath which lies hidden the thing that she does not mention, the lie is immediately perceived, and our jealousy increased, since we are conscious of the lie, and cannot succeed in discovering the truth. With Albertine, the impression that she was lying was conveyed by many of the peculiarities which we have already observed in the course of this narrative, but especially by this, that, when she was lying, her story broke down either from inadequacy, omission, improbability, or on the contrary from a surfeit of petty details intended to make it seem probable. Probability, notwithstanding the idea that the liar has formed of it, is by no means the same as truth. Whenever, while listening to something that is true, we hear something that is only probable, which is perhaps more so than the truth, which is perhaps too probable, the ear that is at all sensitive feels that it is not correct, as with a line that does not scan or a word read aloud in mistake for another. Our ear feels this, and if we are in love our heart takes alarm. Why do we not reflect at the time, when we change the whole course of our life because we do not know whether a woman went along the Rue de Berri or the Rue Washington, why do we not reflect that these few hundred yards of difference, and the woman herself, will be reduced to the hundred millionth part of themselves (that is to say to dimensions far beneath our perception), if we only have the wisdom to remain for a few years without seeing the woman, and that she who has out-Gullivered Gulliver in our eyes will shrink to a Lilliputian whom no microscope \u2014 of the heart, at least, for that of the disinterested memory is more powerful and less fragile \u2014 can ever again perceive! However it may be, if there was a point in common \u2014 the lie itself \u2014 between Albertine\u2019s lies and Gis\u00e8le\u2019s, still Gis\u00e8le did not lie in the same fashion as Albertine, nor indeed in the same fashion as Andr\u00e9e, but their respective lies dovetailed so neatly into one another, while presenting a great variety, that the little band had the impenetrable solidity of certain commercial houses, booksellers\u2019 for example or printing presses, where the wretched author will never succeed, notwithstanding the diversity of the persons employed in them, in discovering whether he is being swindled or not. The editor of the newspaper or review lies with an attitude of sincerity all the more solemn in that he is frequently obliged to conceal the fact that he himself does exactly the same things and indulges in the same commercial practices that he denounced in other editors or theatrical managers, in other publishers, when he chose as his battle-cry, when he raised against them the standard of Sincerity. The fact of a man\u2019s having proclaimed (as leader of a political party, or in any other capacity) that it is wicked to lie, obliges him as a rule to lie more than other people, without on that account abandoning the solemn mask, doffing the august tiara of sincerity. The \u2018sincere\u2019 gentleman\u2019s partner lies in a different and more ingenuous fashion. He deceives his author as he deceives his wife, with tricks from the vaudeville stage. The secretary of the firm, a blunt and honest man, lies quite simply, like an architect who promises that your house will be ready at a date when it will not have been begun. The head reader, an angelic soul, flutters from one to another of the three, and without knowing what the matter is, gives them, by a brotherly scruple and out of affectionate solidarity, the precious support of a word that is above suspicion. These four persons live in a state of perpetual dissension to which the arrival of the author puts a stop. Over and above their private quarrels, each of them remembers the paramount military duty of rallying to the support of the threatened \u2018corps.\u2019 Without realising it, I had long been playing the part of this author among the little band. If Gis\u00e8le had been thinking, when she used the word \u2018must,\u2019 of some one of Albertine\u2019s friends who was proposing to go abroad with her as soon as my mistress should have found some pretext or other for leaving me, and had meant to warn Albertine that the hour had now come or would shortly strike, she, Gis\u00e8le, would have let herself be torn to pieces rather than tell me so; it was quite useless therefore to ply her with questions. Meetings such as this with Gis\u00e8le were not alone in accentuating my doubts. For instance, I admired Albertine\u2019s sketches. Albertine\u2019s sketches, the touching distractions of the captive, moved me so that I congratulated her upon them. \u201cNo, they\u2019re dreadfully bad, but I\u2019ve never had a drawing lesson in my life.\u201d \u201cBut one evening at Balbec you sent word to me that you had stayed at home to have a drawing lesson.\u201d I reminded her of the day and told her that I had realised at the time that people did not have drawing lessons at that hour in the evening. Albertine blushed. \u201cIt is true,\u201d she said, \u201cI was not having drawing lessons, I told you a great many lies at first, that I admit. But I never lie to you now.\u201d I would so much have liked to know what were the many lies that she had told me at first, but I knew beforehand that her answers would be fresh lies. And so I contented myself with kissing her. I asked her to tell me one only of those lies. She replied: \u201cOh, well; for instance when I said that the sea air was bad for me.\u201d I ceased to insist in the face of this unwillingness to reveal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To make her chain appear lighter, the best thing was no doubt to make her believe that I was myself about to break it. In any case, I could not at that moment confide this mendacious plan to her, she had been too kind in returning from the Trocad\u00e9ro that afternoon; what I could do, far from distressing her with the threat of a rupture, was at the most to keep to myself those dreams of a perpetual life together which my grateful heart kept forming. As I looked at her, I found it hard to restrain myself from pouring them out to her, and she may perhaps have noticed this. Unfortunately the expression of such dreams is not contagious. The case of an affected old woman like M. de Charlus who, by dint of never seeing in his imagination anything but a stalwart young man, thinks that he has himself become a stalwart young man, all the more so the more affected and ridiculous he becomes, this case is more general, and it is the tragedy of an impassioned lover that he does not take into account the fact that while he sees in front of him a beautiful face, his mistress is seeing his face which is not made any more beautiful, far from it, when it is distorted by the pleasure that is aroused in it by the sight of beauty. Nor indeed does love exhaust the whole of this case; we do not see our own body, which other people see, and we \u2018follow\u2019 our own thought, the object invisible to other people which is before our eyes. This object the artist does sometimes enable us to see in his work. Whence it arises that the admirers of his work are disappointed in its author, upon whose face that internal beauty is imperfectly reflected\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every person whom we love, indeed to a certain extent every person is to us like Janus, presenting to us the face that we like if that person leaves us, the repellent face if we know him or her to be perpetually at our disposal. In the case of Albertine, the prospect of her continued society was painful to me in another fashion which I cannot explain in this narrative. It is terrible to have the life of another person attached to our own like a bomb which we hold in our hands, unable to get rid of it without committing a crime. But let us take as a parallel the ups and downs, the dangers, the anxieties, the fear of seeing believed in time to come false and probable things which one will not be able then to explain, feelings that one experiences if one lives in the intimate society of a madman. For instance, I pitied M. de Charlus for living with Morel (immediately the memory of the scene that afternoon made me feel the left side of my breast heavier than the other); leaving out of account the relations that may or may not have existed between them, M. de Charlus must have been unaware at the outset that Morel was mad. Morel\u2019s beauty, his stupidity, his pride must have deterred the Baron from exploring so deeply, until the days of melancholy when Morel accused M. de Charlus of responsibility for his sorrows, without being able to furnish any explanation, abused him for his want of confidence, by the aid of false but extremely subtle reasoning, threatened him with desperate resolutions, while throughout all this there persisted the most cunning regard for his own most immediate interests But all this is only a comparison. Albertine was not mad\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I learned that a death had occurred during the day which distressed me greatly, that of Bergotte. It was known that he had been ill for a long time past. Not, of course, with the illness from which he had suffered originally and which was natural. Nature hardly seems capable of giving us any but quite short illnesses. But medicine has annexed to itself the art of prolonging them. Remedies, the respite that they procure, the relapses that a temporary cessation of them provokes, compose a sham illness to which the patient grows so accustomed that he ends by making it permanent, just as children continue to give way to fits of coughing long after they have been cured of the whooping cough. Then remedies begin to have less effect, the doses are increased, they cease to do any good, but they have begun to do harm thanks to that lasting indisposition. Nature would not have offered them so long a tenure. It is a great miracle that medicine can almost equal nature in forcing a man to remain in bed, to continue on pain of death the use of some drug. From that moment the illness artificially grafted has taken root, has become a secondary but a genuine illness, with this difference only that natural illnesses are cured, but never those which medicine creates, for it knows not the secret of their cure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For years past Bergotte had ceased to go out of doors. Anyhow, he had never cared for society, or had cared for it for a day only, to despise it as he despised everything else and in the same fashion, which was his own, namely to despise a thing not because it was beyond his reach but as soon as he had reached it. He lived so simply that nobody suspected how rich he was, and anyone who had known would still have been mistaken, for he would have thought him a miser, whereas no one was ever more generous. He was generous above all towards women \u2014 girls, one ought rather to say \u2014 who were ashamed to receive so much in return for so little. He excused himself in his own eyes because he knew that he could never produce such good work as in an atmosphere of amorous feelings. Love is too strong a word, pleasure that is at all deeply rooted in the flesh is helpful to literary work because it cancels all other pleasures, for instance the pleasures of society, those which are the same for everyone. And even if this love leads to disillusionment, it does at least stir, even by so doing, the surface of the soul which otherwise would be in danger of becoming stagnant. Desire is therefore not without its value to the writer in detaching him first of all from his fellow men and from conforming to their standards, and afterwards in restoring some degree of movement to a spiritual machine which, after a certain age, tends to become paralysed. We do not succeed in being happy but we make observation of the reasons which prevent us from being happy and which would have remained invisible to us but for these loopholes opened by disappointment. Dreams are not to be converted into reality, that we know; we would not form any, perhaps, were it not for desire, and it is useful to us to form them in order to see them fail and to be instructed by their failure. And so Bergotte said to himself: \u201cI am spending more than a multimillionaire would spend upon girls, but the pleasures or disappointments that they give me make me write a book which brings me money.\u201d Economically, this argument was absurd, but no doubt he found some charm in thus transmuting gold into caresses and caresses into gold. We saw, at the time of my grandmother\u2019s death, how a weary old age loves repose. Now in society, there is nothing but conversation. It may be stupid, but it has the faculty of suppressing women who are nothing more than questions and answers. Removed from society, women become once more what is so reposeful to a weary old man, an object of contemplation. In any case, it was no longer a question of anything of this sort. I have said that Bergotte never went out of doors, and when he got out of bed for an hour in his room, he would be smothered in shawls, plaids, all the things with which a person covers himself before exposing himself to intense cold or getting into a railway train. He would apologise to the few friends whom he allowed to penetrate to his sanctuary, and, pointing to his tartan plaids, his travelling-rugs, would say merrily: \u201cAfter all, my dear fellow, life, as Anaxagoras has said, is a journey.\u201d Thus he went on growing steadily colder, a tiny planet that offered a prophetic image of the greater, when gradually heat will withdraw from the earth, then life itself. Then the resurrection will have come to an end, for if, among future generations, the works of men are to shine, there must first of all be men. If certain kinds of animals hold out longer against the invading chill, when there are no longer any men, and if we suppose Bergotte\u2019s fame to have lasted so long, suddenly it will be extinguished for all time. It will not be the last animals that will read him, for it is scarcely probable that, like the Apostles on the Day of Pentecost, they will be able to understand the speech of the various races of mankind without having learned it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the months that preceded his death, Bergotte suffered from insomnia, and what was worse, whenever he did fall asleep, from nightmares which, if he awoke, made him reluctant to go to sleep again. He had long been a lover of dreams, even of bad dreams, because thanks to them and to the contradiction they present to the reality which we have before us in our waking state, they give us, at the moment of waking if not before, the profound sensation of having slept. But Bergotte\u2019s nightmares were not like that. When he spoke of nightmares, he used in the past to mean unpleasant things that passed through his brain. Latterly, it was as though proceeding from somewhere outside himself that he would see a hand armed with a damp cloth which, passed over his face by an evil woman, kept scrubbing him awake, an intolerable itching in his thighs, the rage \u2014 because Bergotte had murmured in his sleep that he was driving badly \u2014 of a raving lunatic of a cabman who flung himself upon the writer, biting and gnawing his fingers. Finally, as soon as in his sleep it had grown sufficiently dark, nature arranged a sort of undress rehearsal of the apoplectic stroke that was to carry him off: Bergotte arrived in a carriage beneath the porch of Swann\u2019s new house, and tried to alight. A stunning giddiness glued him to his seat, the porter came forward to help him out of the carriage, he remained seated, unable to rise \u2014 to straighten his legs. He tried to pull himself up with the help of the stone pillar that was by his side, but did not find sufficient support in it to enable him to stand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He consulted doctors who, flattered at being called in by him, saw in his virtue as an incessant worker (it was twenty years since he had written anything), in his overstrain, the cause of his ailments. They advised him not to read thrilling stories (he never read anything), to benefit more by the sunshine, which was \u2018indispensable to life\u2019 (he had owed a few years of comparative health only to his rigorous seclusion indoors), to take nourishment (which made him thinner, and nourished nothing but his nightmares). One of his doctors was blessed with the spirit of contradiction, and whenever Bergotte consulted him in the absence of the others, and, in order not to offend him, suggested to him as his own ideas what the others had advised, this doctor, thinking that Bergotte was seeking to have prescribed for him something that he himself liked, at once forbade it, and often for reasons invented so hurriedly to meet the case that in face of the material objections which Bergotte raised, this argumentative doctor was obliged in the same sentence to contradict himself, but, for fresh reasons, repeated the original prohibition. Bergotte returned to one of the first of these doctors, a man who prided himself on his cleverness, especially in the presence of one of the leading men of letters, and who, if Bergotte insinuated: \u201cI seem to remember, though, that Dr. X\u2014\u2014-told me \u2014 long ago, of course \u2014 that that might congest my kidneys and brain . . . \u201d would smile sardonically, raise his finger and enounce: \u201cI said use, I did not say abuse. Naturally every remedy, if one takes it in excess, becomes a two-edged sword.\u201d There is in the human body a certain instinct for what is beneficial to us, as there is in the heart for what is our moral duty, an instinct which no authorisation by a Doctor of Medicine or Divinity can replace. We know that cold baths are bad for us, we like them, we can always find a doctor to recommend them, not to prevent them from doing us harm. From each of these doctors Bergotte took something which, in his own wisdom, he had forbidden himself for years past. After a few weeks, his old troubles had reappeared, the new had become worse. Maddened by an unintermittent pain, to which was added insomnia broken only by brief spells of nightmare, Bergotte called in no more doctors and tried with success, but to excess, different narcotics, hopefully reading the prospectus that accompanied each of them, a prospectus which proclaimed the necessity of sleep but hinted that all the preparations which induce it (except that contained in the bottle round which the prospectus was wrapped, which never produced any toxic effect) were toxic, and therefore made the remedy worse than the disease. Bergotte tried them all. Some were of a different family from those to which we are accustomed, preparations for instance of amyl and ethyl. When we absorb a new drug, entirely different in composition, it is always with a delicious expectancy of the unknown. Our heart beats as at a first assignation. To what unknown forms of sleep, of dreams, is the newcomer going to lead us? He is inside us now, he has the control of our thoughts. In what fashion are we going to fall asleep? And, once we are asleep, by what strange paths, up to what peaks, into what unfathomed gulfs is he going to lead us? With what new grouping of sensations are we to become acquainted on this journey? Will it bring us in the end to illness? To blissful happiness? To death? Bergotte\u2019s death had come to him overnight, when he had thus entrusted himself to one of these friends (a friend? or an enemy, rather?) who proved too strong for him. The circumstances of his death were as follows. An attack of uraemia, by no means serious, had led to his being ordered to rest. But one of the critics having written somewhere that in Vermeer\u2019s Street in Delft (lent by the Gallery at The Hague for an Exhibition of Dutch painting), a picture which he adored and imagined that he knew by heart, a little patch of yellow wall (which he could not remember) was so well painted that it was, if one looked at it by itself, like some priceless specimen of Chinese art, of a beauty that was sufficient in itself, Bergotte ate a few potatoes, left the house, and went to the exhibition. At the first few steps that he had to climb he was overcome by giddiness. He passed in front of several pictures and was struck by the stiffness and futility of so artificial a school, nothing of which equalled the fresh air and sunshine of a Venetian palazzo, or of an ordinary house by the sea. At last he came to the Vermeer which he remembered as more striking, more different from anything else that he knew, but in which, thanks to the critic\u2019s article, he remarked for the first time some small figures in blue, that the ground was pink, and finally the precious substance of the tiny patch of yellow wall. His giddiness increased; he fixed his eyes, like a child upon a yellow butterfly which it is trying to catch, upon the precious little patch of wall. \u201cThat is how I ought to have written,\u201d he said. \u201cMy last books are too dry, I ought to have gone over them with several coats of paint, made my language exquisite in itself, like this little patch of yellow wall.\u201d Meanwhile he was not unconscious of the gravity of his condition. In a celestial balance there appeared to him, upon one of its scales, his own life, while the other contained the little patch of wall so beautifully painted in yellow. He felt that he had rashly surrendered the former for the latter. \u201cAll the same,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cI have no wish to provide the \u2018feature\u2019 of this exhibition for the evening papers.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He repeated to himself: \u201cLittle patch of yellow wall, with a sloping roof, little patch of yellow wall.\u201d While doing so he sank down upon a circular divan; and then at once he ceased to think that his life was in jeopardy and, reverting to his natural optimism, told himself: \u201cIt is just an ordinary indigestion from those potatoes; they weren\u2019t properly cooked; it is nothing.\u201d A fresh attack beat him down; he rolled from the divan to the floor, as visitors and attendants came hurrying to his assistance. He was dead. Permanently dead? Who shall say? Certainly our experiments in spiritualism prove no more than the dogmas of religion that the soul survives death. All that we can say is that everything is arranged in this life as though we entered it carrying the burden of obligations contracted in a former life; there is no reason inherent in the conditions of life on this earth that can make us consider ourselves obliged to do good, to be fastidious, to be polite even, nor make the talented artist consider himself obliged to begin over again a score of times a piece of work the admiration aroused by which will matter little to his body devoured by worms, like the patch of yellow wall painted with so much knowledge and skill by an artist who must for ever remain unknown and is barely identified under the name Vermeer. All these obligations which have not their sanction in our present life seem to belong to a different world, founded upon kindness, scrupulosity, self-sacrifice, a world entirely different from this, which we leave in order to be born into this world, before perhaps returning to the other to live once again beneath the sway of those unknown laws which we have obeyed because we bore their precepts in our hearts, knowing not whose hand had traced them there \u2014 those laws to which every profound work of the intellect brings us nearer and which are invisible only \u2014 and still! \u2014 to fools. So that the idea that Bergotte was not wholly and permanently dead is by no means improbable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They buried him, but all through the night of mourning, in the lighted windows, his books arranged three by three kept watch like angels with outspread wings and seemed, for him who was no more, the symbol of his resurrection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I learned, I have said, that day that Bergotte was dead. And I marvelled at the carelessness of the newspapers which \u2014 each of them reproducing the same paragraph \u2014 stated that he had died the day before. For, the day before, Albertine had met him, as she informed me that very evening, and indeed she had been a little late in coming home, for she had stopped for some time talking to him. She was doubtless the last person to whom he had spoken. She knew him through myself who had long ceased to see him, but, as she had been anxious to make his acquaintance, I had, a year earlier, written to ask the old master whether I might bring her to see him. He had granted my request, a trifle hurt, I fancy, that I should be visiting him only to give pleasure to another person, which was a proof of my indifference to himself. These cases are frequent: sometimes the man or woman whom we implore to receive us not for the pleasure of conversing with them again, but on behalf of a third person, refuses so obstinately that our prot\u00e9g\u00e9e concludes that we have boasted of an influence which we do not possess; more often the man of genius or the famous beauty consents, but, humiliated in their glory, wounded in their affection, feel for us afterwards only a diminished, sorrowful, almost contemptuous attachment. I discovered long after this that I had falsely accused the newspapers of inaccuracy, since on the day in question Albertine had not met Bergotte, but at the time I had never suspected this for a single instant, so naturally had she told me of the incident, and it was not until much later that I discovered her charming skill in lying with simplicity. The things that she said, the things that she confessed were so stamped with the character of formal evidence \u2014 what we see, what we learn from an unquestionable source \u2014 that she sowed thus in the empty spaces of her life episodes of another life the falsity of which I did not then suspect and began to perceive only at a much later date. I have used the word \u2018confessed,\u2019 for the following reason. Sometimes a casual meeting gave me a jealous suspicion in which by her side there figured in the past, or alas in the future, another person. In order to appear certain of my facts, I mentioned the person\u2019s name, and Albertine said: \u201cYes, I met her, a week ago, just outside the house. I had to be polite and answer her when she spoke to me. I walked a little way with her. But there never has been anything between us. There never will be.\u201d Now Albertine had not even met this person, for the simple reason that the person had not been in Paris for the last ten months. But my mistress felt that a complete denial would sound hardly probable. Whence this imaginary brief encounter, related so simply that I could see the lady stop, bid her good day, walk a little way with her. The evidence of my senses, if I had been in the street at that moment, would perhaps have informed me that the lady had not been with Albertine. But if I had knowledge of the fact, it was by one of those chains of reasoning in which the words of people in whom we have confidence insert strong links, and not by the evidence of my senses. To invoke this evidence of the senses I should have had to be in the street at that particular moment, and I had not been. We may imagine, however, that such an hypothesis is not improbable: I might have gone out, and have been passing along the street at the time at which Albertine was to tell me in the evening (not having seen me there) that she had gone a little way with the lady, and I should then have known that Albertine was lying. But is that quite certain even then? A religious obscurity would have clouded my mind, I should have begun to doubt whether I had seen her by herself, I should barely have sought to understand by what optical illusion I had failed to perceive the lady, and should not have been greatly surprised to find myself mistaken, for the stellar universe is not so difficult of comprehension as the real actions of other people, especially of the people with whom we are in love, strengthened as they are against our doubts by fables devised for their protection. For how many years on end can they not allow our apathetic love to believe that they have in some foreign country a sister, a brother, a sister-in-law who have never existed!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The evidence of the senses is also an operation of the mind in which conviction creates the evidence. We have often seen her sense of hearing convey to Fran\u00e7oise not the word that was uttered but what she thought to be its correct form, which was enough to prevent her from hearing the correction implied in a superior pronunciation. Our butler was cast in a similar mould. M. de Charlus was in the habit of wearing at this time \u2014 for he was constantly changing \u2014 very light trousers which were recognisable a mile off. Now our butler, who thought that the word pissoti\u00e8re (the word denoting what M. de Rambuteau had been so annoyed to hear the Duc de Guermantes call a Rambuteau stall) was really pisti\u00e8re, never once in the whole of his life heard a single person say pissoti\u00e8re, albeit the word was frequently pronounced thus in his hearing. But error is more obstinate than faith and does not examine the grounds of its belief. Constantly the butler would say: \u201cI\u2019m sure M. le Baron de Charlus must have caught a disease to stand about as long as he does in a pisti\u00e8re. That\u2019s what comes of running after the girls at his age. You can tell what he is by his trousers. This morning, Madame sent me with a message to Neuilly. As I passed the pisti\u00e8re in the Rue de Bourgogne I saw M. le Baron de Charlus go in. When I came back from Neuilly, quite an hour later, I saw his yellow trousers in the same pisti\u00e8re, in the same place, in the middle stall where he always goes so that people shan\u2019t see him.\u201d I can think of no one more beautiful, more noble or more youthful than a certain niece of Mme. de Guermantes. But I have heard the porter of a restaurant where I used sometimes to dine say as she went by: \u201cJust look at that old trollop, what a style! And she must be eighty, if she\u2019s a day.\u201d As far as age went, I find it difficult to believe that he meant what he said. But the pages clustered round him, who tittered whenever she went past the hotel on her way to visit, at their house in the neighbourhood, her charming great-aunts, Mmes. de Fezensac and de Bellery, saw upon the face of the young beauty the four-score years with which, seriously or in jest, the porter had endowed the \u2018old trollop.\u2019 You would have made them shriek with laughter had you told them that she was more distinguished than one of the two cashiers of the hotel, who, devoured by eczema, ridiculously stout, seemed to them a fine-looking woman. Perhaps sexual desire alone would have been capable of preventing their error from taking form, if it had been brought to bear upon the passage of the alleged old trollop, and if the pages had suddenly begun to covet the young goddess. But for reasons unknown, which were most probably of a social nature, this desire had not come into play. There is moreover ample room for discussion. The universe is true for us all and dissimilar to each of us. If we were not obliged, to preserve the continuity of our story, to confine ourselves to frivolous reasons, how many more serious reasons would permit us to demonstrate the falsehood and flimsiness of the opening pages of this volume in which, from my bed, I hear the world awake, now to one sort of weather, now to another. Yes, I have been forced to whittle down the facts, and to be a liar, but it is not one universe, there are millions, almost as many as the number of human eyes and brains in existence, that awake every morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to Albertine, I have never known any woman more amply endowed than herself with the happy aptitude for a lie that is animated, coloured with the selfsame tints of life, unless it be one of her friends \u2014 one of my blossoming girls also, rose-pink as Albertine, but one whose irregular profile, concave in one place, then convex again, was exactly like certain clusters of pink flowers the name of which I have forgotten, but which have long and sinuous concavities. This girl was, from the point of view of story-telling, superior to Albertine, for she never introduced any of those painful moments, those furious innuendoes, which were frequent with my mistress. I have said, however, that she was charming when she invented a story which left no room for doubt, for one saw then in front of her the thing \u2014 albeit imaginary \u2014 which she was saying, using it as an illustration of her speech. Probability alone inspired Albertine, never the desire to make me jealous. For Albertine, without perhaps any material interest, liked people to be polite to her. And if in the course of this work I have had and shall have many occasions to shew how jealousy intensifies love, it is the lover\u2019s point of view that I have adopted. But if that lover be only the least bit proud, and though he were to die of a separation, he will not respond to a supposed betrayal with a courteous speech, he will turn away, or without going will order himself to assume a mask of coldness. And so it is entirely to her own disadvantage that his mistress makes him suffer so acutely. If, on the contrary, she dispels with a tactful word, with loving caresses, the suspicions that have been torturing him for all his show of indifference, no doubt the lover does not feel that despairing increase of love to which jealousy drives him, but ceasing in an instant to suffer, happy, affectionate, relieved from strain as one is after a storm when the rain has ceased and one barely hears still splash at long intervals from the tall horse-chestnut trees the clinging drops which already the reappearing sun has dyed with colour, he does not know how to express his gratitude to her who has cured him. Albertine knew that I liked to reward her for her kindnesses, and this perhaps explained why she used to invent, to exculpate herself, confessions as natural as these stories the truth of which I never doubted, one of them being that of her meeting with Bergotte when he was already dead. Previously I had never known any of Albertine\u2019s lies save those that, at Balbec for instance, Fran\u00e7oise used to report to me, which I have omitted from these pages albeit they hurt me so sorely: \u201cAs she didn\u2019t want to come, she said to me: \u2018Couldn\u2019t you say to Monsieur that you didn\u2019t find me, that I had gone out?\u2019\u201d But our \u2018inferiors,\u2019 who love us as Fran\u00e7oise loved me, take pleasure in wounding us in our self-esteem1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/134468", "artist_names": "Neal Stephenson", "full_title": "Cryptonomicon by\u00a0Neal\u00a0Stephenson", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "id": 134468, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 271820, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1622734920, "path": "/Neal-stephenson-cryptonomicon-annotated", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Neal-stephenson-cryptonomicon-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 2, "hot": false, "pageviews": 9563}, "title": "Cryptonomicon", "title_with_featured": "Cryptonomicon", "updated_by_human_at": 1666840692, "url": "https://genius.com/Neal-stephenson-cryptonomicon-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/43884", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d2e1321ecfe1389e38f2f40337c5c870.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 43884, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d2e1321ecfe1389e38f2f40337c5c870.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "n", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Neal Stephenson", "slug": "Neal-stephenson", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Neal-stephenson"}, "artist": "Neal Stephenson", "lyrics": "Cryptonomicon LyricsPROLOGUE\n\nTwo tires fly. Two wail.\n\nA bamboo grove, all chopped down\n\nFrom it, warring songs\n\n....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is ``tires'' one syllable or two? How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line!\n\n\"Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:\nShanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people.\n\nNow these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer.\n\nBut the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender.\n\nAs every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange.\n\nNow if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks.\n\nHere's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step.\n\nSo ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day.\n\n``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers.\n\n\"The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C.\n\nShaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it:\n\nAntenna searches\n\nRetriever's nose in the wind\n\nEther's far secrets\nThis was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it.\n\nBut in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers.\n\n``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront.\n\nThe leaves of Shanghai:\n\nPale doorways in a steel sky.\n\nWinter has begun.\n\n\nBARRENS\n\nLet's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.\n\n\n\nAs nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.\n\n\n\nThe boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears.\n\n\nOne noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced.\n\nNevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal.\n\nWhen Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys.\n\nFor each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity.\n\nThe pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out.\n\nMechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity.\n\nStops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres.\n\nThe next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died.\n\nLawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school.\n\nAt this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled.\n\nThe Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers.\n\nWhen not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations.\n\nThe basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him.\n\nConsequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around.\n\nAt the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton.\n\nNow Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department.\n\nThere was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence.\n\nQuite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.\n\n\ncertain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.\n\n[equation cannot be rendered in text]\n\nwhere s is a complex number.\n\nLawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles.\n\nLawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands.\n\nBut Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view.\n\nAl delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind.\n\nOne day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing.\n\nLawrence decided that he was probably one of those people.\n\nAlan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other.\n\nAlan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker.\n\nIt got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it.\n\nThe only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful.\n\nAlan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him.\n\n``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically.\n\n``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused.\n\nThere was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle.\n\n``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered.\n\nBy this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed.\n\n``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said.\n\n``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.''\n\nLawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?''\n\n\n``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.''\n\n``Very well,'' Alan said.\n\nBut later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math.\n\n\nAlan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...''\n\n\n``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.''\n\n\n``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.''\n\n\n``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?''\n\n\n``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--''\n\n\n``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said.\n\n\n``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!''\n\n\n``Hmmm?''\n\n\n``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!''\n\n\n``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.''\n\n\n``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said.\n\n\n``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.''\n\n``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy.\n\n``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--''\n\n``I'm not talking about zat!''\n\n``And he invented matrices, but--''\n\n``I'm not talking about zat eezer!''\n\n``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--''\n\n``Zat is completely different!''\n\n``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?''\n\n``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.''\n\n``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--''\n\n``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!''\n\n``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?''\n\n``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.''\n\nAlan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....''\n\n``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began.\n\n``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.''\n\n``All right, Alan.''\n\n``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.''\n\n``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.''\n\n``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.''\n\n``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly.\n\n``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.''\n\n``But he's not German! He's Austrian!''\n\n``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?''\n\n``Ze Anschluss wasn't my idea, you don't have to look at me that way, I think Hitler is appalling.''\n\n``I've heard of Godel,'' Waterhouse put in helpfully. ``But could we back up just a sec?''\n\n``Of course Lawrence.''\n\n``Why bother? Why did Russell do it? Was there something wrong with math? I mean, two plus two equals four, right?''\n\nAlan picked up two bottlecaps and set them down on the ground. ``Two. One-two. Plus--'' He set down two more. ``Another two. One-two. Equals four. One-two-three-four.''\n\n``What's so bad about that?'' Lawrence said.\n\n``But Lawrence--when you really do math, in an abstract way, you're not counting bottlecaps, are you?''\n\n``I'm not counting anything.''\n\nRudy broke the following news: ``Zat is a very modern position for you to take.''\n\n``It is?''\n\nAlan said, ``There was this implicit belief, for a long time, that math was a sort of physics of bottlecaps. That any mathematical operation you could do on paper, no matter how complicated, could be reduced--in theory, anyway--to messing about with actual physical counters, such as bottlecaps, in the real world.''\n\n``But you can't have two point one bottlecaps.''\n\n``All right, all right, say we use bottlecaps for integers, and for real numbers like two point one, we use physical measurements, like the length of this stick.'' Alan tossed the stick down next to the bottlecaps.\n\n``Well what about pi, then? You can't have a stick that's exactly pi inches long.''\n\n``Pi is from geometry--ze same story,'' Rudy put in.\n\n``Yes, it was believed that Euclid's geometry was really a kind of physics, that his lines and so on represented properties of the physical world. But--you know Einstein?''\n\n``I'm not very good with names.''\n\n``That white-haired chap with the big mustache?''\n\n``Oh, yeah,'' Lawrence said dimly, ``I tried to ask him my sprocket question. He claimed he was late for an appointment or something.''\n\n``That fellow has come up with a general relativity theory, which is sort of a practical application, not of Euclid's, but of Riemann's geometry--''\n\n``The same Riemann of your zeta function?''\n\n``Same Riemann, different subject. Now let's not get sidetracked here Lawrence--''\n\n``Riemann showed you could have many many different geometries that were not the geometry of Euclid but that still made sense internally,'' Rudy explained.\n\n``All right, so back to P.M. then,'' Lawrence said.\n\n``Yes! Russell and Whitehead. It's like this: when mathematicians began fooling around with things like the square root of negative one, and quaternions, then they were no longer dealing with things that you could translate into sticks and bottlecaps. And yet they were still getting sound results.''\n\n``Or at least internally consistent results,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Okay. Meaning that math was more than a physics of bottlecaps.''\n\n``It appeared that way, Lawrence, but this raised the question of was mathematics really true or was it just a game played with symbols? In other words--are we discovering Truth, or just wanking?''\n\n``It has to be true because if you do physics with it, it all works out! I've heard of that general relativity thing, and I know they did experiments and figured out it was true.''\n\n``Ze great majority of mathematics does not lend itself to experimental testing,'' Rudy said.\n\n``The whole idea of this project is to sever the ties to physics,'' Alan said.\n\n``And yet not to be vanking ourselves.''\n\n``That's what P.M. was trying to do?''\n\n``Russell and Whitehead broke all mathematical concepts down into brutally simple things like sets. From there they got to integers, and so on.''\n\n``But how can you break something like pi down into a set?''\n\n``You can't,'' Alan said, ``but you can express it as a long string of digits. Three point one four one five nine, and so on.''\n\n``And digits are integers,'' Rudy said.\n\n``But no fair! Pi itself is not an integer!''\n\n``But you can calculate the digits of pi, one at a time, by using certain formulas. And you can write down the formulas like so!'' Alan scratches this in the dirt:\n\n\n\n``I have used the Leibniz series in order to placate our friend. See, Lawrence? It is a string of symbols.''\n\n``Okay. I see the string of symbols,'' Lawrence said reluctantly.\n\n``Can we move on? Godel said, just a few years ago, `Say! If you buy into this business about mathematics being just strings of symbols, guess what?' And he pointed out that any string of symbols--such as this very formula, here--can be translated into integers.''\n\n``How?''\n\n``Nothing fancy, Lawrence--it's just simple encryption. Arbitrary. The number `538' might be written down instead of this great ugly \u00a3, and so on.''\n\n``Seems pretty close to wanking, now.''\n\n``No, no. Because then Godel sprang the trap! Formulas can act on numbers, right?''\n\n``Sure. Like 2x.''\n\n``Yes. You can substitute any number for x and the formula 2x will double it. But if another mathematical formula, such as this one right here, for calculating pi, can be encoded as a number, then you can have another formula act on it. Formulas acting on formulas!''\n\n``Is that all?''\n\n``No. Then he showed, really through a very simple argument, that if formulas really can refer to themselves, it's possible to write one down saying `this statement cannot be proved.' Which was tremendously startling to Hilbert and everyone else, who expected the opposite result.''\n\n``Have you mentioned this Hilbert guy before?''\n\n``No, he is new to this discussion, Lawrence.''\n\n``Who is he?''\n\n``A man who asks difficult questions. He asked a whole list of them once. Go[audel answered one of them.''\n\n``And Turing answered another,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Who's that?''\n\n``It's me,'' Alan said. ``But Rudy's joking. `Turing' doesn't really have an umlaut in it.''\n\n``He's going to have an umlaut in him later tonight,'' Rudy said, looking at Alan in a way that, in retrospect, years later, Lawrence would understand to have been smoldering.\n\n``Well, don't keep me in suspense. Which one of his questions did you answer?''\n\n``The Entscheidungsproblem,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Meaning?''\n\nAlan explained, ``Hilbert wanted to know whether any given statement could, in principle, be found true or false.''\n\n``But after Godel got finished, it changed,'' Rudy pointed out.\n\n``That's true--after Godel it became `Can we determine whether any given statement is provable or non-provable?' In other words, is there some sort of mechanical process we could use to separate the provable statements from the nonprovable ones?''\n\n`` `Mechanical process' is supposed to be a metaphor, Alan....''\n\n``Oh, stop it, Rudy! Lawrence and I are quite comfortable with machinery.''\n\n``I get it,'' Lawrence said.\n\n``What do you mean, you get it?'' Alan said.\n\n``Your machine--not the zeta-function calculator, but the other one. The one we've been talking about building--''\n\n``It is called Universal Turing Machine,'' Rudy said.\n\n``The whole point of that gizmo is to separate provable from nonprovable statements, isn't it?''\n\n``That's why I came up with the basic idea for it,'' Alan said. ``So Hilbert's question has been answered. Now I just want to actually build one so that I can beat Rudy at chess.''\n\n``You haven't told poor Lawrence the answer yet!'' Rudy protested.\n\n``Lawrence can figure it out,'' Alan said. ``It'll give him something to do.''\n\nSoon it became clear that Alan really meant: It'll give him something to do while we're fucking. Lawrence shoved a notebook into the waistband of his trousers and rode his bicycle a few hundred yards to the fire tower, then climbed up the stairs to the platform at the top and sat down, back to the setting sun, notebook propped up on his knees to catch the light.\n\nHe could not collect his thoughts, and then he was distracted by a false sunrise that lit up the clouds off to the northeast. He thought at first that some low clouds were bouncing fragments of the sunset back to him, but it was too concentrated and flickering for that. Then he thought it was lightning. But the color of the light was not blue enough. It fluctuated sharply, modulated by (one had to assume) great, startling events that were occulted by the horizon. As the sun went down on the opposite side of the world, the light on the New Jersey horizon focused to a steady, lambent core the color of a flashlight when you shine it through the palm of your hand under the bedsheets.\n\nLawrence climbed down the stairs and got on his bicycle and rode through the Pine Barrens. Before long he came to a road that led in the general direction of the light. Most of the time he could not see anything, not even the road, but after a couple of hours the glow bouncing off the low cloud layer lit up flat stones in the road, and turned the barrens' wandering rivulets into glowing crevices.\n\nThe road began to tend in the wrong direction and so Lawrence cut directly into the woods, because he was very close now, and the light in the sky was strong enough that he could see it through the sparse carpet of scrubby pines--black sticks that appeared to have been burned, though they hadn't. The ground had turned into sand, but it was damp and compacted, and his bicycle had fat tires that rode over it well. At one point he had to stop and throw the bike over a barbed-wire fence. Then he broke out of the sticks and onto a perfectly flat expanse of white sand, stitched down with tufts of beach grass, and just then he was dazzled by a low fence of quiet steady flames that ran across a part of the horizon about as wide as the harvest moon when it sinks into the sea. Its brightness made it difficult to see anything else--Lawrence kept riding into little ditches and creeks that meandered across the flats. He learned not to stare directly at the flames. Looking off to the sides was more interesting anyway: the table-land was marked at wide intervals by the largest buildings he had ever seen, cracker-box structures built by Pharaohs, and in the mile-wide plazas between them, gnomons of triangulated steel were planted in wide stances: the internal skeletons of pyramids. The largest of these pierced the center of a perfectly circular railway line a few hundred feet in diameter: two argent curves scored on the dull ground, interrupted in one place where the tower's shadow, a stopped sundial, told the time. He rode by a building smaller than the others, with oval tanks standing next to it. Steam murmured from valves on the tops of the tanks, but instead of rising into the air it dribbled down the sides and struck the ground and spread out, coating the sea-grass with jackets of silver.\n\nA thousand sailors in white were standing in a ring around the long flame. One of them held up his hand and waved Lawrence down. Lawrence came to a stop next to the sailor and planted one foot on the sand to steady himself. He and the sailor stared at each other for a moment and then Lawrence, who could not think of anything else, said, ``I am in the Navy also.'' Then the sailor seemed to make up his mind about something. He saluted Lawrence through, and pointed him towards a small building off to the side of the fire.\n\nThe building looked only like a wall glowing in the firelight, but sometimes a barrage of magnesium blue light made its windowframes jump out of the darkness, a rectangular lightning-bolt that echoed many times across the night. Lawrence started pedaling again and rode past that building: a spiraling flock of alert fedoras, prodding at slim terse notebooks with stately Ticonderogas, crab-walking photogs turning their huge chrome daisies, crisp rows of people sleeping with blankets over their faces, a sweating man with Brilliantined hair chalking umlauted names on a blackboard. Finally coming around this building he smelled hot fuel oil, felt the heat of the flames on his face and saw beach-glass curled toward it and desiccated.\n\nHe stared down upon the world's globe, not the globe fleshed with continents and oceans but only its skeleton: a burst of meridians, curving backwards to cage an inner dome of orange flame. Against the light of the burning oil those longitudes were thin and crisp as a draftsman's ink-strokes. But coming closer he saw them resolve into clever works of rings and struts, hollow as a bird's bones. As they spread away from the pole they sooner or later began to wander, or split into bent parts, or just broke off and hung in the fire oscillating like dry stalks. The perfect geometry was also mottled, here and there, by webs of cable and harnesses of electrical wiring. Lawrence almost rode over a broken wine bottle and decided he should now walk, to spare his bicycle's tires, so he laid the bike down, the front wheel covering an aluminum vase that appeared to have been spun on a lathe, with a few charred roses hanging out of it. Some sailors had joined their hands to form a sort of throne, and were bearing along a human-shaped piece of charcoal dressed in a coverall of immaculate asbestos. As they walked the toes of their shoes caught in vast, ramified snarls of ropes and piano-wires, cables and wires, creative furtive movements in the grass and the sand dozens of yards every direction. Lawrence began planting his feet very thoughtfully one in front of the other, trying to measure the greatness of what he had come and seen. A rocket-shaped pod stuck askew from the sand, supporting an umbrella of bent-back propellers. The duralumin struts and catwalks rambled on above him for miles. There was a suitcase spilled open, with a pair of women's shoes displayed as if in the window of a downtown store, and a menu that had been charred to an oval glow, and then some tousled wall-slabs, like a whole room that had dropped out of the sky--these were decorated, one with a giant map of the world, great circles arcing away from Berlin to pounce on cities near and far, and another with a photograph of a famous, fat German in a uniform, grinning on a flowered platform, the giant horizon of a new Zeppelin behind him.\n\nAfter a while he stopped seeing new things. Then he got on his bicycle and rode back through the Pine Barrens. He got lost in the dark and so didn't find his way back to the fire tower until dawn. But he didn't mind being lost because while he rode around in the dark he thought about the Turing machine. Finally he came back to the shore of the pond where they had camped. The dawn-light shining on the saucer of calm reddish water made it look like a pool of blood. Alan Mathison Turing and Rudolf von Hacklheber were lying together like spoons on the shore, still smudged a little bit from their swim yesterday. Lawrence started a little fire and made some tea and they woke up eventually.\n\n``Did you solve the problem?'' Alan asked him.\n\n``Well you can turn that Universal Turing Machine of yours into any machine by changing the presets--''\n\n``Presets?''\n\n``Sorry, Alan, I think of your U.T.M. as being kind of like a pipe organ.''\n\n``Oh.''\n\n``Once you've done that, anyway, you can do any calculation you please, if the tape is long enough. But gosh, Alan, making a tape that's long enough, and that you can write symbols on, and erase them, is going to be sort of tricky--Atanasoff's capacitor drum would only work up to a certain size--you'd have to--''\n\n``This is a digression,'' Alan said gently.\n\n``Yeah, okay, well--if you had a machine like that, then any given preset could be represented by a number--a string of symbols. And the tape that you would feed into it to start the calculation would contain another string of symbols. So it's Go[audel's proof all over again--if any possible combination of machine and data can be represented by a string of numbers, then you can just arrange all of the possible strings of numbers into a big table, and then it turns into a Cantor diagonal type of argument, and the answer is that there must be some numbers that cannot be computed.''\n\n``And ze Entscheidungsproblem?'' Rudy reminded him.\n\n``Proving or disproving a formula--once you've encrypted the formula into numbers, that is--is just a calculation on that number. So it means that the answer to the question is, no! Some formulas cannot be proved or disproved by any mechanical process! So I guess there's some point in being human after all!''\n\nAlan looked pleased until Lawrence said this last thing, and then his face collapsed. ``Now there you go making unwarranted assumptions.''\n\n``Don't listen to him, Lawrence!'' Rudy said. ``He's going to tell you that our brains are Turing machines.''\n\n``Thank you, Rudy,'' Alan said patiently. ``Lawrence, I submit that our brains are Turing machines.''\n\n``But you proved that there's a whole lot of formulas that a Turing machine can't process!''\n\n``And you have proved it too, Lawrence.''\n\n``But don't you think that we can do some things that a Turing machine couldn't?''\n\n``Godel agrees with you, Lawrence,'' Rudy put in, ``and so does Hardy.''\n\n``Give me one example,'' Alan said.\n\n``Of a noncomputable function that a human can do, and a Turing machine can't?''\n\n``Yes. And don't give me any sentimental nonsense about creativity. I believe that a Universal Turing Machine could show behaviors that we would construe as creative.''\n\n``Well, I don't know then... I'll try to keep my eye out for that kind of thing in the future.''\n\nBut later, as they were riding back towards Princeton, he said, ``What about dreams?''\n\n``Like those angels in Virginia?''\n\n``I guess so.''\n\n``Just noise in the neurons, Lawrence.''\n\n``Also I dreamed last night that a zeppelin was burning.''\n\n\n\nSoon, Alan got his Ph.D. and went back to England. He wrote Lawrence a couple of letters. The last of these stated, simply, that he would not be able to write Lawrence any more letters ``of substance'' and that Lawrence should not take it personally. Lawrence perceived right away that Alan's society had put him to work doing something useful--probably figuring out how to keep it from being eaten alive by certain of its neighbors. Lawrence wondered what use America would find for him.\n\nHe went back to Iowa State, considered changing his major to mathematics, but didn't. It was the consensus of all whom he consulted that mathematics, like pipe-organ restoration, was a fine thing, but that one needed some way to put bread on the table. He remained in engineering and did more and more poorly at it until the middle of his senior year, when the university suggested that he enter a useful line of work, such as roofing. He walked straight out of college into the waiting arms of the Navy.\n\nThey gave him an intelligence test. The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?\n\nLawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would?\n\nThen the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.\n\nLawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.\n\nThe sack of mail carrying Lawrence's contribution to the mathematical literature arrived just in the nick of time. Lawrence's ship, and quite a few of her sisters, had until then been based in California. But at just this moment, all of them were transferred to some place called Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in order to show the Nips who was boss.\n\nLawrence had never really known what he wanted to do with his life, but he quickly decided that being glockenspiel player on a battleship in Hawaii during peacetime was a long way from the worst life you could possibly have. The harshest part of the job was sometimes having to sit or march in very warm conditions, and enduring occasional fluffed notes by other band members. He had abundant free time, which he spent working on a series of new theorems in the field of information theory. The field had been invented and pretty much encompassed by his friend Alan, but there was much detail work to be done. He and Alan and Rudy had sketched out a general plan of what needed to be proved or disproved. Lawrence tore through the list. He wondered what Alan and Rudy were up to in Britain and Germany, but he couldn't write to them and find out, so he kept his work to himself. When he wasn't playing the glockenspiel or working out theorems, there were bars and dances to go to. Waterhouse did some penis work of his own, got the clap, had it cured,* bought condoms. All of the sailors did this. They were like three-year olds who shove pencils in their ears, discover that it hurts, and stop doing it. Lawrence's first year went by almost instantly. Time just blazed by. Nowhere could be sunnier, more relaxing, than Hawaii.\n\n*1940 being a good year to begin experimenting with venereal diseases in that the new injectable penicillin was just becoming available\n\n\n\nNOVUS ORDO SECLORUM\n\n``Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people,'' avi says, ``which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons.''\n\nRandy is in Tokyo's airport, ambling down a concourse with a slowness that is infuriating to his fellow travelers. They have all spent the last half-day strapped into bad chairs, stuffed into an aluminum tube aslosh with jet fuel. Over the safety-engineered nubs molded into the jetway floor, their rolling suitcases drone like fighter planes. They graze the backs of his knees as they bank around his husky columnar body. Randy is holding his new GSM phone to the side of his head. Supposedly it works anywhere in the world, except for the United States. This is his first chance to try it out.\n\n``You sound clear as a bell,'' Avi says. ``How was the flight over?''\n\n``All right,'' Randy says. ``They had one of those animated maps up on the video screen.''\n\nAvi sighs. ``All the airlines have those now,'' he announces monotonically.\n\n``The only feature between San Francisco and Tokyo was Midway Island.''\n\n``So?''\n\n``It kind of hung there for hours. MIDWAY. Mute embarrassment all around.''\n\nRandy reaches the departure gate for Manila, and pauses to admire a five-foot-wide high-definition TV set bearing the logo of a major Nipponese consumer-electronics company. It is running a video in which a wacky cartoon professor and his adorable canine sidekick cheerfully tick off the three transmission routes of the AIDS virus.\n\n``I have a fingerprint for you,'' Randy says.\n\n``Shoot.''\n\nRandy stares at the palm of his hand, on which he has written a string of numbers and letters in ballpoint pen. ``AF 10 06 E9 99 BA 11 07 64 C1 89 E3 40 8C 72 55.''\n\n``Got it,'' Avi says. ``That's from Ordo, right?''\n\n``Right. I e-mailed you the key from SFO.''\n\n``The apartment situation is still resolving,'' Avi says. ``So I just reserved you a suite at the Manila Hotel.''\n\n``What do you mean, it's still resolving?''\n\n``The Philippines is one of those post-Spanish countries with no clear boundaries between business and personal relationships,'' Avi says. ``I don't think you can secure lodgings there without marrying into a family with a major street named after it.''\n\nRandy takes a seat in the departure area. Perky gate attendants in jaunty, improbable hats zero in on Filipinos with too many carry-ons, and subject them to a public ritual of filling out little tags and surrendering their possessions. The Filipinos roll their eyes and stare longingly out the windows. But most of the waiting passengers are Nipponese--some businessmen, mostly vacationers. They are watching an educational video about how to get mugged in foreign countries.\n\n``Huh,'' Randy says, looking out the window, ``got another 747 down to Manila.''\n\n``In Asia, no decent airline bothers to dick around anything smaller than a 747,'' Avi snaps. ``If someone tries to pack you on board a 737 or god forbid an Airbus, run, don't walk, away from the boarding lounge, and call me on my Sky Pager and I'll send in a chopper to evacuate you.''\n\nRandy laughs.\n\nAvi continues. ``Now, listen. This hotel you're going to is very old, very grand, but it's in the middle of nowhere.''\n\n``Why would they build a grand hotel in the middle of nowhere?''\n\n``It used to be a happening place--it's on the waterfront, right on the edge of Intramuros.''\n\nRandy's high-school Spanish is enough to translate that: Inside the Walls.\n\n``But Intramuros was annihilated by the Nipponese in 1945,'' Avi continues. ``Systematically. All of the business hotels and office buildings are in a new neighborhood called Makati, much closer to the airport.''\n\n``So you want to put our office in Intramuros.''\n\n``How'd you guess?'' Avi says, sounding a little spooked. He prides himself on unpredictability.\n\n``I'm not an intuitive guy generally,'' Randy says, ``but I've been on a plane for thirteen hours and my brain has been turned inside out and hung up to dry.''\n\nAvi rattles off canned justifications: office space is much cheaper in Intramuros. Government ministries are closer. Makati, the gleaming new business district, is too isolated from the real Philippines. Randy pays no attention to it.\n\n``You want to work out of Intramuros because it was systematically annihilated, and because you're obsessed with the Holocaust,'' Randy finally says, quietly and without rancor.\n\n``Yeah. So?'' Avi says.\n\nRandy stares out the window of the Manila-bound 747, sipping on a fluorescent green Nipponese soft drink made from bee extracts (at least, it has pictures of bees on it) and munching on something that a flight attendant handed him called Japanese Snack. Sky and ocean are the same color, a shade of blue that makes his teeth freeze. The plane is so high that, whether he looks up or down, he sees foreshortened views of boiling cumulonimbus stacks. The clouds erupt from the hot Pacific as if immense warships were exploding all over the place. The speed and power of their growth is alarming, the forms they adopt as bizarre and varied as those of deep-sea organisms, and all of them, he supposes, are as dangerous to an airplane as punji stakes to a barefoot pedestrian. The red-orange meatball painted on the wingtip startles him when he notices it. He feels like he's been thrown into an old war film.\n\nHe turns on his laptop. Electronic mail from Avi, encrypted to a fare-thee-well, has been piling up in his in-box. It is a gradual accumulation of tiny files, thrown at him by Avi whenever a thought popped into his head over the last three days; it would be obvious, even if Randy didn't know it, that Avi owns a portable e-mail machine that talks to the Internet by radio. Randy fires up a piece of software that is technically called Novus Ordo Seclorum but that everyone calls Ordo for short. It is a fairly strained pun based on the fact that Ordo's job, as a piece of cryptographic software, is to put a message's bits in a New Order and that it will take Centuries for nosy governments to decrypt it. A scanned image of a Great Pyramid appears in the middle of his screen, and a single eye gradually materializes at its apex.\n\nOrdo can handle this in one of two ways. The obvious way is to decrypt all of the messages and convert them into plaintext files on his hard disk, which he can then read any time he wants. The problem with this (if you are paranoid) is that anyone who gets his hands on Randy's hard disk can then read the files. For all he knows, the customs officials in Manila will decide to ransack his computer for child pornography. Or, fogged by jet lag, he'll leave his laptop in a taxi. So instead he puts Ordo into a streaming mode where it will decrypt the files just long enough for him to read them and then, when he closes the windows, expunge the plaintext from the computer's memory and from its hard drive.\n\nThe subject heading of Avi's first message is: ``Guideline 1.''\n\nWe look for places where the math is right. Meaning what? Meaning that pop. is about to explode---we can predict that just by looking at age histogram---and per capita income is about to take off the way it did in Nippon, Taiwan, Singapore. Multiply those two things together and you get the kind of exponential growth that should get us all into fuck-you money before we turn forty.\n\nThis is an allusion to a Randy/Avi conversation of two years ago wherein Avi actually calculated a specific numerical value for ``fuck-you money.'' It was not a fixed constant, however, but rather a cell in a spreadsheet linked to any number of continually fluctuating economic indicators. Sometimes when Avi is working at his computer he will leave the spreadsheet running in a tiny window in the corner so that he can see the current value of ``fuck-you money'' at a glance.\n\nThe second message, sent a couple of hours later, is called ``Guideline 2.''\n\nTwo: pick a tech where no one can compete with us. Right now, that=networking. We're kicking the crap out of everyone else in the world when it comes to networking. It's not even funny.\n\nThe next day, Avi sent a message called, simply, ``More.'' Perhaps he had lost track of the number of guidelines he'd issued so far.\n\nAnother principle: this time we retain control of the corporation. That means that we keep at least fifty percent of the shares---which means little to no outside investment until we've built up some value.\n\n``You don't have to convince me,'' Randy mumbles to himself, as he reads this.\n\nThis shapes the kinds of businesses we can get into. Forget anything that requires a big initial investment.\n\nLuzon is green-black jungle mountains gouged with rivers that would appear to be avalanches of silt. As the navy-blue ocean verges on its khaki beaches, the water takes on the shocking iridescent hue of a suburban swimming pool. Farther south, the mountains are swidden-scarred--the soil beneath is bright red and so these parts look like fresh lacerations. But most is covered with foliage that looks like the nubby green stuff that model railroaders put over their papier-mache hills, and in vast stretches of the mountains there are no signs whatsoever that human beings have ever existed. Closer to Manila, some of the slopes are deforested, sprinkled with structures, ribboned with power-line cuts. Rice paddies line the basins. The towns are accretions of shanties, nucleated around large cross-shaped churches with good roofs.\n\nThe view gets blurry as they belly down into the pall of sweaty smog above the city. The plane begins to sweat like a giant glass of iced tea. The water streams off in sheets, collects in crevices, whips off the flaps' trailing edges.\n\nSuddenly they are banking over Manila Bay, which is marked with endless streaks of brilliant red--some kind of algal bloom. Oil tankers trail long time-delayed rainbows that flourish in their wakes. Every cove is jammed with long skinny boats with dual outriggers, looking like brightly painted water skaters.\n\nAnd then they are down on the runway at NAIA, Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Guards and cops of various stripes are ambling around with M-16s or pistol-handled pump shotguns, wearing burnooses fashioned from handkerchiefs clamped to the head with American baseball caps. A man dressed in a radiant white uniform stands below the ragged maw of the jetway holding his hands downwards with fluorescent orange sticks in them, like Christ dispensing mercy on a world of sinners. Sulfurous, fulminating tropical air begins to leak in through the jumbo's air vents. Everything moistens and wilts.\n\nHe is in Manila. He takes his passport out of his shirt pocket. It says, RANDALL LAWRENCE WATERHOUSE.\n\n\n\nThis is how Epiphyte Corporation came into existence:\n\n``I am channeling the bad shit!'' Avi said.\n\nThe number came through on Randy's pager while he was sitting around a table in a grubhouse along the coast with his girlfriend's crowd. A place where, every day, they laser-printed fresh menus on 100% recycled imitation parchment, where oscilloscope tracings of neon-colored sauces scribbled across the plates, and the entrees were towering, architectonic stacks of rare ingredients carved into gemlike prisms. Randy had spent the entire meal trying to resist the temptation to invite one of Charlene's friends (any one of them, it didn't matter) out on the sidewalk for a fistfight.\n\nHe glanced at his pager expecting to see the number of the Three Siblings Computer Center, which was where he worked (technically, still does). The fell digits of Avi's phone number penetrated the core of his being in the same way that 666 would a fundamentalist's.\n\nFifteen seconds later, Randy was out on the sidewalk, swiping his card through a pay phone like an assassin drawing a single-edged razor blade across the throat of a tubby politician.\n\n``The power is coming down from On High,'' Avi continued. ``Tonight, it happens to be coming through me--you poor bastard.''\n\n``What do you want me to do?'' Randy asked, adopting a cold, almost hostile tone to mask sick excitement.\n\n``Buy a ticket to Manila,'' Avi said.\n\n``I have to talk it over with Charlene first,'' Randy said.\n\n``You don't even believe that yourself,'' Avi said.\n\n``Charlene and I have a long-standing relationsh--''\n\n``It's been ten years. You haven't married her. Fill in the fucking blanks.''\n\n(Seventy-two hours later, he would be in Manila, looking at the One-Note Flute.)\n\n``Everyone in Asia is wondering when the Philippines is finally going to get its shit together,'' Avi said, ``it's the question of the nineties.''\n\n(The One-Note Flute is the first thing you see when you make it through passport control.)\n\n``I flashed on this when I was standing in line at Passport Control at Ninoy Aquino International Airport,'' Avi said, compressing that entire name into a single, sharply articulated burst. ``You know how they have different lanes?''\n\n``I guess so,'' Randy said. A parallelpiped of seared tuna did a barrel roll in his gullet. He felt a perverse craving for a double ice-cream cone. He did not travel as much as Avi, and had only a vague idea of what he meant by lanes.\n\n``You know. One lane for citizens. One for foreigners. Maybe one for diplomats.''\n\n(Now, standing there waiting to have his passport stamped, Randy can see it clearly. For once he doesn't mind the wait. He gets in a lane next to the OCW lane and studies them. They are Epiphyte Corp.'s market. Mostly young women, many of them fashionably dressed, but still with a kind of Catholic boarding-school demureness. Exhausted from long flights, tired of the wait, they slump, then suddenly straighten up and elevate their fine chins, as if an invisible nun were making her way up the line whacking their manicured knuckles with a ruler.)\n\nBut seventy-two hours ago he hadn't really understood what Avi meant by lanes, so he just said, ``Yeah, I've seen the lane thing.''\n\n``At Manila, they have a whole lane just for returning OCWs!''\n\n``OCWs?''\n\n``Overseas Contract Workers. Filipinos working abroad--because the economy of the Philippines is so lame. As maids and nannies in Saudi. Nurses and anesthesiologists in the States. Singers in Hong Kong, whores in Bangkok.''\n\n``Whores in Bangkok?'' Randy had been there, at least, and his mind reeled at the concept of importing prostitutes to Thailand.\n\n``The Filipino women are more beautiful,'' Avi said quietly, ``and have a ferocity that makes them more interesting, to the innately masochistic business traveler, than all those grinning Thai bimbos.'' Both of them knew that this was complete bullshit; Avi was a family man and had no firsthand experience whereof he spoke. Randy didn't call him on it, though. As long as Avi retained this extemporaneous bullshitting ability there was a better than even chance of all of them making fuck-you money.\n\n(Now that he's here, it is tempting to speculate as to which of the girls in the OCW lane are hustlers. But he can't see that going anywhere but wrong, so he squares his shoulders and marches toward the yellow line.\n\nThe government has set up glass display cases in the concourse leading from passport control to the security barrier. The cases contain artifacts demonstrating the glories of pre-Magellan Filipino culture. The first one of these contains the piece de resistance: a rustic hand-carved musical instrument labeled with a long and unreadable name in Tagalog. Underneath that, in smaller letters, is the English translation: ONE-NOTE FLUTE.)\n\n``See? The Philippines is innately hedged,'' Avi said. ``You know how rare that is? When you find an innately hedged environment, Randy, you lunge into it like a rabid ferret going into a pipe full of raw meat.''\n\nA word about Avi: his father's people had just barely gotten out of Prague. As Central European Jews went, they were fairly typical. The only thing about them that was really anomalous was that they were still alive. But his mother's people were unbelievably peculiar New Mexican crypto-Jews who had been living on mesas, dodging Jesuits, shooting rattlesnakes and eating jimson weed for three hundred years; they looked like Indians and talked like cowboys. In his relations with other people, therefore, Avi dithered. Most of the time he was courtly and correct in a way that was deeply impressive to businesspeople--Nipponese ones expecially--but there were these eruptions, from time to time, as if he'd been dipping into the loco weed. Randy had learned to deal with it, which is why Avi called him at times like this.\n\n``Oh, calm down!'' Randy said. He watched a tanned girl rollerblade past him, on her way up from the beach. ``Innately hedged?''\n\n``As long as the Philippines don't have their shit together, there'll be plenty of OCWs. They will want to communicate with their families--the Filipinos are incredibly family-oriented. They make Jews look like a bunch of alienated loners.''\n\n``Okay. You know more about both groups than I do.''\n\n``They are sentimental and affectionate in a way that's very easy for us to sneer at.''\n\n``You don't have to be defensive,'' Randy said, ``I'm not sneering at them.''\n\n``When you hear their song dedications on the radio, you'll sneer,'' Avi said. ``But frankly, we could take some pointers from the Pinoys on this front.''\n\n``You are so close to being sanctimonious right now--''\n\n``I apologize,'' Avi said, with absolute sincerity. Avi's wife had been pregnant almost continuously for the four years they'd been married. He was getting more religiously observant daily and couldn't make it through a conversation without mentioning the Holocaust. Randy was a bachelor who was just about to break up with the chick he'd been living with.\n\n``I believe you, Avi,'' Randy said. ``Is it a problem with you if I buy a business-class ticket?''\n\nAvi didn't hear him, so Randy assumed that meant yes. ``As long as that's the case, there will be a big market for Pinoy-grams.''\n\n``Pinoy-grams?''\n\n``For god's sake, don't say it out loud! I'm filling out the trademark application as we speak,'' Avi said. Randy could hear a rattling sound in the background, computer keys impacting so rapidly it sounded like Avi was simply holding the keyboard between his pale, spindly hands and shaking it violently up and down. ``But if the Filipinos do get their shit together, then we see explosive growth in telecoms, as in any other Arday.''\n\n``Arday?''\n\n``R-D-A-E. Rapidly Developing Asian Economy. Either way, we win.''\n\n``I gather you want to do something with telecoms?''\n\n``Bingo.'' In the background, a baby began to cough and cry. ``Gotta go,'' Avi said, ``Shlomo's asthma is spiking again. Take down this fingerprint.''\n\n``Fingerprint?''\n\n``For my encryption key. For e-mail.''\n\n``Ordo?''\n\n``Yeah.''\n\nRandy took out a ballpoint pen and, finding no paper in his pocket, poised it over the palm of his hand. ``Shoot.''\n\n``67 81 A4 AE FF 40 25 9B 43 0E 29 8D 56 60 E3 2F.'' Then Avi hung up the phone.\n\nRandy went back into the restaurant. On his way back, he asked the waiter to bring him a half-bottle of good red wine. Charlene heard him, and glowered. Randy was still thinking about innate ferocity, and did not see it in her face; only a schoolmarmishness common among all of her friends. My god! I have to get out of California, he realized.\n\n\nSEAWEED\n\nWoman holds baby\n\nEyes pale as a muzzle flash\n\nBand chimes frozen tears\n\nThe fourth marines is marching downhill to the strains of John Philip Sousa, which ought to be second nature to a Marine. But the Fourth Marines have been in Shanghai (which ain't no halls of Montezuma nor shores of Tripoli) for too long, longer than Marines should ever stay in one place, and Bobby's already seen his sergeant, one Frick, throw up from opium withdrawal.\n\nA Marine band is several Shanghai blocks ahead. Bobby's platoon can hear the thumpity-thump of the big drums and the piercing noises from piccolos and glockenspiels but he can't follow the tune. Corporal Shaftoe is effectively their leader, because Sergeant Frick is useless.\n\nShaftoe marches alongside the formation, supposedly to keep an eye on his men, but mostly he's just staring at Shanghai.\n\nShanghai stares back, and mostly gives them a standing ovation. Of course there is a type of young street rowdy who makes it a point of honor to let the Marines know he isn't scared of them, and they are jeering the Marines from a safe distance, and setting off strings of firecrackers, which does nothing to steady anyone's nerves. The Europeans are applauding--a whole chorus line of Russian dancing girls from Delmonte's is showing thigh and blowing kisses. But most of the Chinese look pretty stonefaced, which--Bobby suspects--means they're scared shitless.\n\nThe worst thing is the women carrying half-white babies. A few of these women are rabid, hysterical, throwing themselves into formations of massed Marines, undeterred by rifle butts. But most of them are stoic: they stand with their light-eyed babies and glare, searching the ranks and files for the guilty party. They've all heard about what happened upriver in Nanjing when the Nips came there, and they know that when it's all over, the only trace that they and their babies ever existed may be a really bad memory in the mind of some American Marine.\n\nIt works for Shaftoe: he has hunted deer in Wisconsin and seen them limping across the snow, bleeding to death. He saw a man die in basic training at Parris Island. He has seen whole tangles of bodies in the Yangtze, downstream of where the Nipponese were prosecuting the China Incident, and he has seen refugees from places like Nanjing starve to death in the gutters of Shanghai. He has himself killed people who were trying to storm the riverboats it was his duty to protect. He thinks that he has never seen, and will never see, anything as terrible as those stone-faced Chinese women holding their white babies, not even blinking as the firecrackers explode all around them.\n\nUntil, that is, he looks into the faces of certain Marines who stare into that crowd and see their own faces looking back at them, pudgy with baby fat and streaked with tears. Some of them seem to think it's all a joke. But many of the Marines who march out of their empty barracks that morning sane and solid men, have, by the time they reach the gunboats waiting for them at the Bund, gone mad. They don't show it. But Shaftoe can see in their eyes that something has given way inside.\n\nThe very best men in the regiment are in a foul mood. The ones like Shaftoe, who didn't get involved with the Chinese women, are still leaving plenty behind: houses with maids and shoeshine boys and coolies, with women and opium for almost nothing. They don't know where they are being shipped off to, but it's safe to say that their twenty-one dollars a month won't go as far. They'll be in barracks and they'll have to learn to polish their own boots again. When the gangplanks are drawn in from the stone edge of the Bund, they are cut off from a whole world that they'll never see again, a world where they were kings. Now they are Marines again. It's okay with Shaftoe, who wants to be a Marine. But many of the men have become middle-aged here, and don't.\n\nThe guilty men duck belowdecks. Shaftoe remains on the deck of the gunboat, which casts off from the Bund, headed for the cruiser Augusta, which awaits in mid-channel.\n\nThe Bund is jammed with onlookers in a riot of differently colored clothing, so one patch of uniform drab catches his eye: a group of Nip soldiers who've come down to bid their Yank counterparts a sarcastic farewell. Shaftoe scans the group looking for someone tall and bulky, and picks him out easily. Goto Dengo's waving to him.\n\nShaftoe takes his helmet off and waves back. Then, on impulse, just for the hell of it, he winds up and flings the helmet directly at Goto Dengo's head. The throw goes awry and Goto Dengo has to knock down about a dozen of his comrades in order to catch it. All of them seem to think that it is a high honor, as well as tremendously amusing, to be knocked down by Goto Dengo.\n\nTwenty seconds later, a comet sails up out of the flesh cosmos of the Bund and bounces on the wooden deck of the gunboat--a hell of a throw. Goto Dengo is showing off his follow-through. The projectile is a rock with a white streamer wrapped around it. Shaftoe runs over and snatches it. The streamer is one of those thousand-stitch headbands (supposedly; he's taken a few off of unconscious Nips, but he's never bothered to count the stitches) that they tie around their heads as a good-luck charm; it has a meatball in the center and some Nip writing to either side. He unties it from around the rock. In so doing he realizes, suddenly, that it's not a rock after all; it is a hand grenade! But good old Goto Dengo was just joking--he didn't pull the pin. A nice souvenir for Bobby Shaftoe.\n\nShaftoe's first haiku (December 1940) was a quick and dirty adaptation of the Marine Creed:\n\nThis is my rifle\n\nThere are many like it but\n\nThis rifle is mine.\n\nHe wrote it under the following circumstances: Shaftoe and the rest of Fourth Marines were stationed in Shanghai so that they could guard the International Settlement and work as muscle on the gunboats of the Yangtze River Patrol. His platoon had just come back from the Last Patrol: a thousand-mile reconnaissance-in-force all the way up past what was left of Nanjing, to Hankow, and back. Marines had been doing this ever since the Boxer Rebellion, through civil wars and everything else. But towards the end of 1940, what with the Nips basically running all of northeast China now, the politicians back in D.C. had finally thrown in the towel and told the China Marines not to steam up the Yangtze any more.\n\nNow, the Old Breed Marines like Frick claimed they could tell the difference between organized brigands; armed mobs of starving peasants; rogue Nationalists; Communist guerrillas; and the irregular forces in the pay of warlords. But to Bobby Shaftoe they were all just crazy, armed slopes who wanted a piece of the Yangtze River Patrol. The Last Patrol had been a wild trip. But it was over and they were back in Shanghai now, the safest place you could be in China, and about a hundred times more dangerous than the most dangerous place you could be in America. They had climbed off the gunboat six hours ago, gone to a bar, and not come out until just now, when they had decided it was high time they went to a whorehouse. On their way, they happened to pass this Nip restaurant.\n\nBobby Shaftoe had looked in the windows of the place before, and watched the man with the knife, trying to figure out what the hell he was doing. It looked a hell of a lot like he was cutting up uncooked fish and putting the raw meat on bullets of rice and handing it over to the Nips on the other side of the counter, who were wolfing it down.\n\nIt had to be some kind of optical illusion. The fish must have been precooked in the back room.\n\nThis had been nagging at Shaftoe for about a year. As he and the other horny drunk Marines went by the place, he slowed down to peer through the window, trying to gather more evidence. He could swear that some of that fish looked ruby red, which it wouldn't have been if it were cooked.\n\nOne of his buddies, Rhodes from Shreveport, noticed him looking. He dared Shaftoe to go in there and sit down at that bar. Then another private, Gowicki from Pittsburgh, double-dared him!\n\nShaftoe sucked his teeth and considered the matter. He had already made up his mind that he was going to do it. He was a sniper scout, and it was in his nature to do crazy shit like this; but it was also part of his training to scan the terrain carefully before venturing in.\n\nThe restaurant was three-quarters full, and everyone in the place was a uniformed member of the Nipponese military. At the bar where the man was cutting up the apparently raw fish, there was a marked concentration of officers; if you only had one grenade, that's where you'd throw it. Most of the place was filled with long tables where enlisted men sat, drinking noodle soup from steaming urns. Shaftoe paid particular attention to these, because they were the ones who were going to be beating the shit out of him in about sixty seconds. Some were there alone, with reading material. A cluster of them, back in one corner, were paying attention to one fellow who was apparently telling a joke or story.\n\nThe longer Shaftoe spent reconnoitering the place, the more convinced Rhodes and Gowicki became that he was actually going to do it. They became excited and called for the other Marines, who had gone ahead of them down the block, headed for that whorehouse.\n\nShaftoe saw the others coming back--his tactical reserve. ``What the fuck,'' he said, and went into the restaurant. Behind him, he could hear the others shouting excitedly; they couldn't believe he was doing it. When Shaftoe stepped over the threshold of that Nip restaurant, he passed into the realm of legend.\n\nAll the Nips looked up at him when he came in the door. If they were surprised, they didn't show it. The chef behind the counter began to holler out some kind of ritual greeting, which faltered and trailed off as he got a look at what had just come in. The fellow in the back of the room--a husky, pink-cheeked Nip--continued telling his joke or story or whatever it was.\n\nShaftoe nodded to no one in particular, then stepped to the nearest empty chair at the bar and sat down.\n\nOther Marines would have waited until the whole squad had assembled. Then they would have invaded the restaurant en masse, knocked over a few chairs, spilled some soup. But Shaftoe had seized the initiative before the others could do any such thing and gone in by himself, as a sniper scout was supposed to do. It was not just because he was a sniper scout, though. It was also because he was Bobby Shaftoe, and he was sincerely curious about this place, and if he could, he wanted to spend a few calm minutes in here and learn a few things about it before the fun started.\n\nIt helped, of course, that Shaftoe was a quiet and contemplative drunk, not a dangerous explosive drunk. He must have reeked of beer (those Krauts in Tsingtao cranked out a brew whose taste took him right back to Wisconsin, and he was homesick). But he wasn't hollering or knocking things over.\n\nThe chef was busy crafting one of his little morsels and pretended to ignore Shaftoe. The other men at the counter stared coldly at Shaftoe for a while, then turned their attentions back to their food. Shaftoe looked at the array of raw fish laid out on shaved ice behind the bar, then looked around the room. The guy back in the corner was talking in short bursts, reading from a notebook. He would speak maybe ten or twenty words, and then his little audience would turn to one another and grin, or grimace, or sometimes even make a patter of applause. He wasn't delivering his material like a dirty joke. He spoke precisely and expressively.\n\nFuck! He was reading poetry! Shaftoe had no idea what he was saying, but he could tell, by the sound of it, that it must be poetry. Didn't rhyme though. But the Nips did everything queerly.\n\nHe noticed that the chef was glaring at him. He cleared his throat, which was useless since he couldn't speak Nip. He looked at some of that ruby red fish behind the bar, pointed to it, held up two fingers.\n\nEveryone was startled that the American had actually placed an order. The tension was broken, only a little. The chef went to work and produced two morsels, which he served up on a wooden pedestal.\n\nShaftoe had been trained to eat insects, and to bite the heads off chickens, so he figured he could handle this. He picked the morsels up in his fingers, just like the Nips were doing, and ate them. They were good. He ordered two more, of another variety. The guy in the corner kept reading poetry. Shaftoe ate his morsels and then ordered some more. For perhaps ten seconds, between the taste of the fish and the sound of the poetry, he actually felt comfortable here, and forgot that he was merely instigating a vicious racial brawl.\n\nThe third order looked different: laid over the top of the raw fish were thin translucent sheets of some kind of moist, glistening material. It looked sort of like butcher paper soaked in oil. Shaftoe gawked at it for a while, trying to identify it, but it looked like no foodstuff he knew of. He glanced left and right, hoping that one of the Nips had ordered the same stuff, so that he could watch and learn the right way to eat it. No luck.\n\nHell, they were officers. Maybe one of them spoke a little English. `` 'Scuse me. What's this?'' Shaftoe said, peeling up one corner of the eerie membrane.\n\nThe chef looked up at him nervously, then scanned the bar, polling the customers. Discussion ensued. Finally, a Nip officer at the end of the bar, a naval lieutenant, stood up and spoke to Bobby Shaftoe.\n\n``Seaweed.''\n\nShaftoe did not particularly like the lieutenant's tone of voice--hostile and sullen. This, combined with the look on his face, seemed to say, You'll never understand it, you farmer, so why don't you just think of it as seaweed.\n\nShaftoe folded his hands primly in his lap, regarded the seaweed for a few moments, and then looked up at the lieutenant, who was still gazing at him expressionlessly. ``What kind of seaweed, sir?'' he said.\n\nSignificant glances began flying around the restaurant, like semaphores before a naval engagement. The poetry reading seemed to have stopped, and a migration of enlisted men had begun from the back of the room. Meanwhile the lieutenant translated Shaftoe's inquiry to the others, who discussed it in some detail, as if it were a major policy initiative from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nThe lieutenant and the chef exchanged words. Then the lieutenant looked at Shaftoe again. ``He say, you pay now.'' The chef held up one hand and rubbed his fingers and thumb together.\n\nA year of working the Yangtze River Patrol had given Bobby Shaftoe nerves of titanium, and unlimited faith in his comrades, and so he resisted the impulse to turn his head and look out the window. He already knew exactly what he would see: Marines, shoulder to shoulder, ready to die for him. He scratched the new tattoo on his forearm: a dragon. His dirty fingernails, passing over the fresh scabs, made a rasping sound in the utterly silent restaurant.\n\n``You didn't answer my question,'' Shaftoe said, pronouncing the words with a drunk's precision.\n\nThe lieutenant translated this into Nipponese. More discussion. But this time it was curt and decisive. Shaftoe could tell that they were about to bounce him. He squared his shoulders.\n\nThe Nips were good; they mounted an organized charge out the door, onto the sidewalk, and engaged the Marines, before anyone actually laid a hand on Shaftoe. This spoiling attack prevented the Marines from invading the restaurant proper, which would have disturbed the officers' meal and, with any luck, led to untold property damage. Shaftoe then felt himself being grabbed from behind by at least three people and hoisted into the air. He made eye contact with the lieutenant while this was happening, and shouted: ``Are you bullshitting me about the seaweed?''\n\nAs brawls went, the only remarkable part of this one was the way he was carried out to the street before he could actually get started. Then it was like all the other street fights he'd been in with Nip soldiers in Shanghai. These all came down to American brawn (you didn't get picked for the Fourth Regiment unless you were an impressive-looking six-footer) versus that Nipponese chop-socky.\n\nShaftoe wasn't a boxer. He was a wrestler. This was to his advantage. The other Marines would put up their dukes and try to fight it out--Marquis of Queensberry style--no match for chop-socky. Shaftoe had no illusions about his boxing, so he would just put his head down and charge like a bull, take a few blows to the face on his way in, but usually get a solid hold on his opponent and slam him into the cobblestones. Usually that shook the Nip up enough that Shaftoe could get him in a full-nelson or a hammerlock and get him to cry uncle.\n\nThe guys who were carrying him out of the restaurant got jumped by Marines as soon as they were in the open. Shaftoe found himself going up against an opponent who was at least as tall as he was, which was unusual. This one had a solid build, too. Not like a sumo wrestler. More like a football player--a lineman, with a bit of a gut. He was a strong S.O.B. and Shaftoe knew right away that he was in for a real scrape. The guy had a different style of wrestling from the American, which (as Shaftoe learned the hard way) included some illegal maneuvers: partial strangulation and powerful, short punches to major nerve centers. The gulf between Shaftoe's mind and body, already wedged open by alcohol, was yanked open to a chasm by these techniques. He ended up lying on the sidewalk, helpless and paralyzed, staring up into the chubby face of his opponent. This was (he realized) the same guy who'd been sitting in the corner of the restaurant reading poetry. He was a good wrestler for a poet. Or maybe vice versa.\n\n``It is not seaweed,'' said the big Nip. He had a look on his face like a naughty schoolkid getting away with something. ``The English word is maybe calabash?'' Then he turned and walked back into the restaurant.\n\nSo much for legend. What none of the other Marines knows is that this was not the last encounter between Bobby Shaftoe and Goto Dengo. The incident left Shaftoe with any number of nagging questions about subjects as diverse as seaweed, poetry, and chop-socky. He sought out Goto Dengo after that, which was not that hard--he just paid some Chinese boys to follow the conspicuous Nip around town and file daily reports. From this he learned that Goto Dengo and some of his comrades gathered every morning in a certain park to practice their chop-socky. After making sure that his will was in order and writing a last letter to his parents and siblings in Oconomowoc, Shaftoe went to that park one morning, reintroduced himself to the surprised Goto Dengo, and made arrangements to serve as human punching bag. They found his self-defense skills hilariously primitive but admired his resilience, and so, for the small cost of a few broken ribs and digits, Bobby Shaftoe got a preliminary course in the particular type of chop-socky favored by Goto Dengo, which is called judo. Over time, this even led to a few social engagements in bars, and restaurants, where Shaftoe learned to recognize four types of seaweed, three types of fish eggs, and several flavors of Nip poetry. Of course he had no idea what the fuck they were saying, but he could count syllables, which, as far as he could tell, is about all there is to Nip poetry appreciation.\n\nNot that this--or any other knowledge of their culture--is going to do him any good now that it will soon be his job to kill them.\n\nIn return, Shaftoe taught Goto Dengo how not to throw like a girl. A lot of the Nips are good at baseball and so it was hilarious, even to them, to see their burly friend pushing ineffectually at a baseball. But it was Shaftoe who taught Goto Dengo to stand sideways, to rotate his shoulders, and to follow through. He's paid a lot of attention to the big Nip's throwing form during the last year, and maybe that's why the image of Goto Dengo planting his feet on the ashlars of the Bund, winding up, throwing the streamer-wrapped grenade, and following through almost daintily on one combat-booted foot stays in Shaftoe's mind all the way to Manila and beyond.\n\n\n\nA couple of days into the voyage it becomes apparent that Sergeant Frick has forgotten how to shine his boots. Every night he puts them on the deck beside his bunk, like he's expecting a coolie to come around and shine them up during the night. Every morning he wakes up and finds them in a sorrier state than before. After a few days he starts to draw reprimands from On High, starts to get a lot of potato-peeling duty.\n\nNow in and of itself this is forgivable. Frick started out his career chasing bandolier-draped desperadoes away from mail trains on the High Chaparral, for God's sake. In '27 he got shipped off to Shanghai on very short notice, and no doubt had to display some adaptability. Fine. And now he's on this miserable pre-Great War cruiser and it's a little hard on him. Fine. But he does not take all of this with the dignity that is demanded of Marines by Marines. He whines about it. He lets himself get humiliated. He gets angry. A lot of the other old China Marines see things his way.\n\nOne day Bobby Shaftoe is up on the deck of the destroyer tossing the old horsehide around with a couple of the other young Marines when he sees a few of these older guys accumulating into a sort of human booger on the afterdeck. He can tell by the looks on their faces and by their gestures that they are bellyaching.\n\nShaftoe hears a couple of the ship's crew talking to each other nearby. ``What the hell is wrong with those Marines?'' one of them says. The other one shakes his head sadly, like a doctor who has just seen a patient's eyeballs roll up into their sockets. ``Those poor bastards have gone Asiatic,'' he says.\n\nAnd then they turn and look at Shaftoe.\n\nThat evening, at mess, Bobby Shaftoe gulps his food down double-time, then stands up and approaches the table where those Old Breed Marines are sullenly gathered. ``Begging your pardon, Sergeant!'' he hollers. ``Request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''\n\nFrick's mouth drops open, revealing a half-chewed plug of boiled beef. ``Whud you say, Corporal?''\n\nThe mess has gone silent. ``Respectfully request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''\n\nFrick is not the quickest guy in the world even when he's sober, and it's pretty obvious, just from looking at his pupils, that he and his comrades have brought some opium aboard. ``Wull, uh, I guess so,'' he says. He looks around at his crew of gripers, who are a little confused and a little amused. He unlaces his boots. Bobby Shaftoe takes those disgraceful things away and returns a bit later with them resplendently shined. By this time, Frick has gotten high and mighty. ``Wull, those boots look real good, Corporal Shaftoe,'' he says in a brassy voice. ``Darned if you ain't as good a shoe-shiner as my coolie boy was.''\n\nAt lights out, Frick and crew are short-sheeted. Various other, ruder practical jokes ensue during the nighttime. One of them gets jumped in his bunk and beaten by unspecified attackers. The brass call a surprise inspection the next morning and cuss them out. The ``gone Asiatic'' crew spend most of the next day gathered in a cluster, watching each other's backs.\n\nAround midday, Frick finally gets it through his head that all of this was triggered by Shaftoe's gesture, and that Shaftoe knew, all along, what was going to happen. So he rushes Bobby Shaftoe up on the deck and tries to throw him over the rail.\n\nShaftoe's warned at the last minute by one of his compadres, and spins around just enough to throw off Frick's attack. Frick caroms off the rail, turns around, and tries to grab Shaftoe's nuts. Shaftoe pokes him in the eye, which straightens him right up. They back away from each other. The opening formalities having been finished; they put up their dukes.\n\nFrick and Shaftoe box for a couple of rounds. A large crowd of Marines gathers. On most of their cards, Frick is winning the fight. Frick was always dim-witted, and is now crazy to boot, but he knows his way around a boxing ring, and he has forty pounds on Shaftoe.\n\nShaftoe puts up with it until Frick socks him pretty hard in the mouth and gives him a bloody lip.\n\n``How far are we from Manila?'' Shaftoe hollers. This question, as usual, leaves Sergeant Frick confused and bewildered, and straightens him up for a moment.\n\n``Two days,'' answers one of the ship's officers.\n\n``Well, goddamn,'' Bobby Shaftoe says. ``How'm I gonna kiss my girl with this fat lip?''\n\nFrick answers, ``Just go out and find a cheaper one.''\n\nThat's all he needs. Shaftoe puts his head down and charges in on Frick, hollering like a Nip. Before Frick can get his brain in gear, Bobby Shaftoe has him wrapped up in one of those chop-socky holds that Goto Dengo taught him in Shanghai. He works his way up Frick's body to a choke-hold and then clamps down until Sergeant Frick's lips turn the color of the inside of an oyster shell. Then he hangs Frick over the rail, holding him upside-down by the ankles, until Frick recovers enough to shout, ``Uncle!''\n\nA disciplinary proceeding is hastily called. Shaftoe is found guilty of being courteous (by shining Frick's boots) and defending the life of a Marine (himself) from a crazed attacker. The crazed attacker goes straight to the brig. Within a few hours, the noises Frick makes lets all of the Marines know what opium withdrawal feels like.\n\nSo Sergeant Frick does not get to see their entrance into Manila Bay. Shaftoe almost feels sorry for the poor bastard.\n\nThe island of Luzon lies to port all day long, a black hulk barely visible through the haze, with glimpses of palm trees and beaches down below. All of the Marines have been this way before and so they can pick out the Cordillera Central up north, and later the Zambales Mountains, which eventually plunge down to meet the sea near Subic Bay. Subic triggers a barrage of salty anecdotes. The ship does not put in there, but continues to swing southward around Bata'an, turning inland toward the entrance of Manila Bay. The ship reeks of shoe polish, talcum powder, and after-shave lotion; the Fourth Marines may have specialized in whoring and opium abuse, but they've always been known as the best-looking Marines in the Corps.\n\nThey pass by Corregidor. An island shaped like a bead of water on a waxed boot, it is gently rounded in the middle but steeply sloping into the water. It has a long, bony, dry tail that trails off at one end. The Marines know that the island is riddled with tunnels and bristling with terrible guns, but the only sign of these fortifications is the clusters of concrete barracks up in the hills, housing the men who serve the weapons. A tangle of antennas rises up above Topside. Their shapes are familiar to Shaftoe, because many of the same antennas rose above Station Alpha in Shanghai, and he had to take them apart and load them into the truck.\n\nThere is a giant limestone cliff descending nearly into the sea, and at the base of it is the entrance to the tunnel where all the spooks and radio men have their hideaway. Nearby is a dock, quite busy at the moment, with supplies being offloaded from civilian transports and stacked right there on the beach. This detail is noticed by all of the Marines as a positive sign of approaching war. Augusta drops anchor in the cove, and all of that tarp-wrapped radio stuff is unloaded into launches and taken to that dock, along with all of the odd pencil-necked Navy men who tended that gear in Shanghai.\n\nThe swell dies as they pass Corregidor and enter the bay. Greenish-brown algae floats in swirls and curlicues near the surface. Navy ships lay brown ropes of smoke across the still sea. Undisturbed by wind, these unfold into rugged shapes like translucent mountain ranges. They pass the big military base at Cavite--a sheet of land so low and flat that its boundary with the water would be invisible except for the picket line of palm trees. A few hangars and water towers rise from it, and low dark clusters of barracks farther inland. Manila is dead ahead of them, still veiled in haze. It is getting on toward evening.\n\nThen the haze dissolves, the atmosphere suddenly becomes as limpid as a child's eyes, and for about an hour they can see to infinity. They are steaming into an arena of immense thunderheads with lightning corkscrewing down through them all around. Flat grey clouds like shards of broken slate peek out between anvils. Behind them are higher clouds vaulting halfway to the moon, glowing pink and salmon in the light of the setting sun. Behind that, more clouds nestled within banks of humidity like Christmas ornaments wrapped in tissue paper, expanses of blue sky, more thunderheads exchanging bolts of lightning twenty miles long. Skies nested within skies nested within skies.\n\nIt was cold up there in Shanghai, and it's gotten warmer every day since. Some days it's even been hot and muggy. But around the time Manila heaves into view, a warm breeze springs up over the deck and all of the Marines sigh, as if they have all ejaculated in unison.\n\nManila's perfume\n\nFanned by the coconut palms\n\nThe thighs of Glory\n\nManila's spreading tile roofs have a mestizo shape about them, half-Spanish and half-Chinese. The city has a concave seawall with a flat promenade on the top. Strollers turn and wave to the Marines; some of them blow kisses. A wedding party is gushing down the steps of a church and across the boulevard to the seawall, where they are getting their pictures taken in the flattering peach-colored light of the sunset. The men are in their fancy, gauzy Filipino shirts, or in U.S. military uniforms. The women are in spectacular gowns and dresses. The Marines holler and whistle at them and the women turn towards them, hitching up their skirts slightly so that they won't trip, and wave enthusiastically. The Marines get woozy and practically fall overboard.\n\nAs their ship is easing into its dock, a crescent-shaped formation of flying fish erupts from the water. It moves away like a dune being blown across the desert. The fish are silver and leaf-shaped. Each one strikes the water with a metallic click, and the clicks merge into a crisp ripping noise. The crescent glides beneath a pier, flowing around its pilings, and disappears in the shadows underneath.\n\nManila, the Pearl of the Orient, early on a Sunday evening, the 7th of December, 1941. In Hawaii, on the other side of the Date Line, it is only just past midnight. Bobby Shaftoe and his comrades have a few hours of freedom. The city is modern, prosperous, English-speaking, and Christian, by far the wealthiest and most advanced city in Asia, practically like being back home in the States. For all its Catholicity, it has areas that seem to have been designed, from the foundation-stones upwards, to the specifications of horny sailors. You get to those parts of town by turning right once your feet are on dry land.\n\nBobby Shaftoe turns left, politely excuses himself past a legion of excited prostitutes, and sets his course on the looming walls of Intramuros. He stops only to buy a sheaf of roses from a vendor in the park, who is doing land-office business. The park and the walls above it are crowded with strolling lovers, the men mostly in uniforms and the women in demure but stunning dresses, twirling parasols on their shoulders.\n\nA couple of fellows driving horse-drawn taxis want to do business with Bobby Shaftoe but he turns them down. A taxi will only get him there faster, and he is too nervous to get there fast. He walks through a gate in the wall and into the old Spanish city.\n\nIntramuros is a maze of buff-colored stone walls rising abruptly from narrow streets. The first-floor windows along the sidewalks are guarded by black ironwork cages. The bars swell, swirl, and sprout finedly hammered leaves. The second stories hang out overhead, sporting gas lights that are just now being lit by servants with long, smoking poles. The sound of laughter and music drifts out of the windows above, and when he passes by the archways that open into the inner courtyards, he can smell flowers back in the gardens.\n\nDamned if he can tell these places apart. He remembers the street name of Magallanes, because Glory told him once it was the same thing as ``Magellan.'' And he remembers the view of the cathedral from the Pascuals' window. He wanders around a block a couple of times, certain that he is close. Then he hears an exaltation of girlish laughter coming from a second-story window, and moves toward it like a jellyfish sucked into an intake pipe. It all comes together. This is the place. The girls are all gossiping, in English, about one of their instructors. He does not hear Glory's voice but he thinks he hears her laughter.\n\n``Glory!'' he says. Then he says it louder. If they hear him, they pay him no mind. Finally he winds up and flings the bouquet of roses like a potato-masher grenade over the wooden railing, through a narrow gap between the mother-of-pearl shutters, and into the room.\n\nMiraculous silence from within the room, and then gales of laughter. The nacre shutters part with slow, agonizing coyness. A girl of nineteen steps out onto the balcony. She is dressed in the uniform of a nursing student. It is as white as starlight shining on the North Pole. She has let her long black hair down to brush it, and it stirs languidly in the evening breeze. The last ruddy light of the sunset makes her face glow like a coal. She hides behind the bouquet for a moment, buries her nose in it, inhales deeply, peeking out at him over the blossoms with her black eyes. Then she lowers the bouquet gradually to reveal her high cheeks, her perfect little nose, the fantastic sculpture of her lips, and teeth, white but fetchingly crooked, barely visible. She is smiling.\n\n``Jesus H. Christ,'' Bobby Shaftoe says, ``your cheekbones are like a fucking snowplow.''\n\nShe puts her finger to her lips. The gesture of anything touching Glory's lips puts an invisible spear through Shaftoe's chest. She eyes him for a while, establishing, in her own mind, that she has the boy's attention and that he is not going anywhere. Then she turns her back on him. The light grazes her buttocks, showing nothing but suggesting cleavage. She goes back inside and the shutter glides shut behind her.\n\nSuddenly the room full of girls becomes quiet, except for occasional ripples of suppressed laughter. Shaftoe bites his tongue. They are screwing it all up. Mr. or Mrs. Pascual will notice their silence and become suspicious.\n\nIronwork clangs and a big gate swings open. The porter beckons him inside. Shaftoe follows the old fellow down the black, arched tunnel of the porte-cochere. The hard soles of his shiny black shoes skid on the cobblestones. A horse back in the stable whinnies at the smell of his aftershave. Sleepy American music, slow-dance stuff from the Armed Forces station, spills tinnily from a radio in the porter's nook.\n\nFlowering vines grow up the stone walls of the courtyard. It is a tidy, quiet, enclosed world, almost like being indoors. The porter waves him in the direction of one of the stairways that lead up to the second floor. Glory calls it the entresuelo and says that it's really a floor between the floors, but it looks like a full-fledged, regular floor to Bobby Shaftoe. He mounts the steps and looks up to see Mr. Pascual standing there, a tiny bald man with glasses and a trim little mustache. He is wearing a short-sleeved shirt, American style, and khaki trousers, and slippers, and is holding a glass of San Miguel in one hand and a cigarette in the other. ``Private Shaftoe! Welcome back,'' he says.\n\nSo. Glory has decided to play this one by the book. The Pascuals have been alerted. A few hours of socializing now stand between Bobby Shaftoe and his girl. But a Marine is never fazed by such setbacks.\n\n``Begging your pardon, Mr. Pascual, but I am a corporal now.''\n\nMr. Pascual puts his cigarette in his mouth and shakes Corporal Shaftoe's hand. ``Well, congratulations! I just saw your uncle Jack last week. I don't think he had any idea you were on your way back.''\n\n``It was a surprise to everyone, sir,'' Bobby Shaftoe says.\n\nNow they are on a raised walkway that runs around the courtyard. Only livestock and servants live at ground level. Mr. Pascual leads them around to a door that takes them into the entresuelo. The walls here are rough stone, the ceilings are simple painted planks. They pass through a dark, somber office where Mr. Pascual's father and grandfather used to receive the managers of the family's haciendas and plantations. For a moment, Bobby Shaftoe gets his hopes up. This level has a few rooms that back in the old days were apartments for high-ranking servants, bachelor uncles, and spinster aunts. Now that the hacienda business ain't what it used to be, the Pascuals are renting them out to female students. Perhaps Mr. Pascual is leading him directly to Glory.\n\nBut this goes the way of all foolish, horny illusions as Shaftoe finds himself at the foot of a vast staircase of polished nara wood. He can see pressed-tin ceiling up there, chandeliers, and the imposing superstructure of Mrs. Pascual, contained within a mighty bodice that looks like something dreamed up by naval engineers. They ascend the stairs into the antesala, which according to Glory is strictly for casual, drop-in visitors but is fancier than any room Bobby Shaftoe has ever seen. There are big vases and pots all over the place, supposedly old, and supposedly from Japan and China. A fresh breeze runs through; he looks out a window and sees, neatly framed in it, the green dome of the cathedral with its Celtic cross on top, just as he remembered it. Mrs. Pascual holds out her hand and Shaftoe clasps it. ``Mrs. Pascual,'' he says, ``thank you for welcoming me into your home.''\n\n``Please sit down,'' she says, ``we want to hear everything.''\n\nShaftoe sits in a fancy chair next to the piano, adjust his trousers a bit so that they will not cramp his erect penis, checks his shave. It probably has a few good hours left. A wing of airplanes drones overhead. Mrs. Pascual is giving instructions to the maid in Tagalog. Shaftoe examines the crusted lacerations on his knuckles and wonders whether Mrs. Pascual has the slightest idea of what she would be in for if he really told her everything. Perhaps a little anecdote about hand-to-hand combat with Chinese river pirates on the banks of the Yangtze would break the ice. Through a door and down the hall, he can see a corner of the family chapel, all Gothic arches, a gilded altar, and in front of it an embroidered kneeler worn threadbare by the patellas of Mrs. Pascual.\n\nCigarettes are brought round, stacked in a large lacquer box like artillery shells in a crate. They drink tea and exchange small talk for what seems like about thirty-six hours. Mrs. Pascual wants to be reassured, over and over again, that everything is fine and that there will not be a war. Mr. Pascual obviously believes that war is just around the corner, and mostly broods. Business has been good lately. He and Jack Shaftoe, Bobby's uncle, have been shipping a lot of stuff between here and Singapore. But business will get a lot worse soon, he thinks.\n\nGlory appears. She has changed out of her student's uniform and into a dress. Bobby Shaftoe nearly topples backward out of the window. Mrs. Pascual formally reintroduces them. Bobby Shaftoe kisses Glory's hand in what he thinks is more than likely a very gallant gesture. He's glad he did, because Glory is palming a tiny wadded-up note which ends up in his hand.\n\nGlory takes a seat and is duly issued her own teacup. Another eternity of small talk. Mr. Pascual asks him for the eighty-seventh time whether he has touched base with Uncle Jack yet, and Shaftoe reiterates that he literally just stepped off the boat and will certainly see Uncle Jack tomorrow morning. He excuses himself to the bathroom, which is an old-fashioned two-holer mounted above deep shafts that must descend all the way to hell. He unwads and reads Glory's note, memorizes the instructions, tears it up and sprinkles it down the hole.\n\nMrs. Pascual allows the two young lovers a full half hour of ``private'' time together, meaning that the Pascuals leave the room and only come back every five minutes or so to check up on them. There is a painfully elaborate and lengthy good-bye ceremony which ends in Shaftoe returning to the street and Glory waving to him from her balcony.\n\nHalf an hour later, they are doing tongue judo in the back of a horse-drawn taxi galloping over the cobblestones toward the nightclubs of Malate. The extraction of Glory from the Pascual residence was a simple matter for a highly motivated China Marine and a squadron of saucy nursing students.\n\nBut Glory must be kissing him with her eyes open because all of a sudden she wriggles loose and says to the taxi driver, ``Stop! Please stop, sir!''\n\n``What is it?'' Shaftoe says blurrily. He looks around and sees nothing but a great big old stone church looming up above them. This brings a preliminary stab of fear. But the church is dark, there's no Filipinas in long dresses, no Marines in dress uniforms, it can't be his wedding.\n\n``I want to show you something,'' Glory says, and clambers down out of the taxi. Shaftoe has to pursue her into the place--the Church of San Augustin. He's gone by this pile many times but he never reckoned he would come inside--on a date.\n\nShe stands at the bottom of a huge staircase and says, ``See?''\n\nShaftoe looks up into darkness, thinks there might be a stained-glass window or two up there, maybe a Laceration of Christ or an Impalement of the Blessed Thorax, but--\n\n``Look down,'' Glory says, and taps one miniature foot against the first tread of the staircase. It is a single great big huge slab of granite.\n\n``Looks like ten or twenty tons of rock there I'd estimate,'' he says authoritatively.\n\n``It came from Mexico.''\n\n``Ah, go on!''\n\nGlory smiles at him. ``Carry me up the stairs.'' And in case Shaftoe's thinking of refusing, she sort of falls into him, and he has no choice but to catch her up in his arms. She traps his nape in the crook of her arm, the better to pull her face close to his, but what he remembers is how the silk of her sleeve feels against the freshly shaved skin of his neck. He begins the ascent. Glory doesn't weigh much, but after four steps he has broken a fine sweat. She is watching him, from four inches away, for signs of fatigue, and he feels himself blushing. Good thing that the whole staircase is lit up by about two candles. There's a lovely bust of a thorn-crowned Jesus with long parallel blood-drops running down his face, and on the right--\n\n``These giant stones you are walking on were quarried in Mexico, centuries and centuries ago, before America was even a country. They were brought over in the bottoms of the Manila Galleons, as ballast.'' She pronounces it bayast.\n\n``I'll be damned.''\n\n``When those galleons arrived, the stones were brought out of their bellies, one by one, and taken here to the Church of San Agustin, and piled up. Each stone on top of the last year's stone. Until finally after many, many years this staircase was finished.''\n\nAfter a while it seems to Shaftoe as though it's going to take at least that many years to reach the top of the damn thing. The summit is adorned with a life-sized Jesus carrying a cross that appears to be at least as heavy as one of those stair-treads. So who's he to complain? Then Glory says, ``Now carry me down, so you will remember the story.''\n\n``You think I'm some horny jarhead who won't remember a story unless it's got a pretty girl in it?''\n\n``Yes,'' Glory says, and laughs in his face. He carries her down to the bottom again. Then, before she goes off on some other tangent, he carries her straight out the door and into the taxi.\n\nBobby Shaftoe is not one to lose his cool in the heat of action, but the rest of the evening is a blurry fever dream to him. Only a few impressions penetrate the haze: alighting from the taxi in front of a waterfront hotel; all of the other boys gaping at Glory; Bobby Shaftoe glaring at them, threatening to teach them some manners. Slow dancing with Glory in the ballroom, Glory's silk-clad thigh gradually slipping between his legs, her firm body pressing harder and harder against his. Strolling along the seawall, hand in hand beneath the starlight. Noticing that the tide is out. Exchanging a look. Carrying her down from the seawall to the thin strip of rocky beach beneath it.\n\nBy the time he is actually fucking her, he has more or less lost consciousness, he is off in some fantastic, libidinal dream. He and Glory fuck without the slightest hesitation, without any doubts, without any troublesome thinking whatsoever. Their bodies have spontaneously merged, like a pair of drops running together on a windowpane. If he is thinking anything at all, it is that his entire life has culminated in this moment. His upbringing in Oconomowoc, high school prom night, deer hunting in the Upper Peninsula, Parris Island boot camp, all of the brawls and struggles in China, his duel with Sergeant Frick, they are wood behind the point of a spear.\n\nSirens are blowing somewhere. He startles back to awareness. Has he been here all night long, holding Glory up against the seawall, her thighs wrapped around his waist? That would not be possible. The tide hasn't come in at all.\n\n``What is it?'' she says. Her hands are clasped around the back of his neck. She lets go and runs them down his chest.\n\nStill holding her up, his hands making a sling under her warm and flawless ass, Shaftoe backs away from the seawall and turns around on the beach, looking at the sky. He sees searchlights beginning to come on. And it ain't no Hollywood premiere.\n\n``It's war, baby,'' he says.\n\n\n\nFORAYS\n\nThe lobby of the manila hotel is about the size of a football field. It smells like last year's perfume, rare tropical orchids, and bug spray. There is a metal detector set up at the front door, because the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe happens to be staying here for a couple of days. Big Africans in good suits stand around the place in clusters of two and three. Mini-throngs of Nipponese tourists, in their Bermuda shorts, sandals and white socks, have lodged themselves in the deep, thick, wide sofas and sit quietly, waiting for a prearranged signal. Upper-class Filipino children brandish cylindrical potato chip canisters like tribal chieftains carrying ceremonial maces. A dignified old bellman carrying a hand-pumped tank circulates around the defensive perimeter and silently sprays insecticide against the baseboard. Enter Randall Lawrence Waterhouse, in a turquoise polo shirt embroidered with the logo of one of the bankrupt high-tech companies that he and Avi have founded, and relaxed-fit blue jeans held up with suspenders, and bulky athletic shoes that once were white.\n\nAs soon as he got through the formalities at the airport, he perceived that the Philippines are, like Mexico, one of those countries where Shoes Matter. He approaches the registration counter quickly so that the ravishing young woman in the navy-blue uniform will not see his feet. A couple of bellhops are engaged in a pathetic, Sisyphean contest with his bag, which has roughly the dimensions and mass of a two-drawer filing cabinet. ``You will not be able to find technical books there,'' Avi told him, ``bring anything you might conceivably need.''\n\nRandy's suite is a bedroom and living room, both with fourteen-foot ceilings, and a corridor along one side containing several closets and various plumbing-related technologies. The entire thing is lined in some kind of tropical hardwood stained to a lovely glowing auburn, which would be dismal in the northern latitudes but, here, gives it a cozy and cool feeling. The two main rooms each have huge windows with tiny signs by the latch handles warning of tropical insects. Each room is defended from its windows by a multilayered system of interlocking barriers: incredibly massive wooden shutters that rumble back and forth on tracks, like freight trains maneuvering in a switching yard; a second layer of shutters consisting of two-inch squares of nacre held in a polished wooden grid, sliding on its own set of tracks; window sheers, and finally, heavy-gauge blackout curtains, each suspended from its own set of clanging industrial rails.\n\nHe orders up a large pot of coffee, which barely keeps him awake long enough to unpack. It is late afternoon. Purple clouds tumble out of the surrounding mountains with the palpable momentum of volcanic mudflows and turn half of the sky into a blank wall striped with vertical bolts of lightning; the walls of the hotel room flash with it as though paparazzi are working outside the window. Below, food vendors in Rizal Park run up and down the sidewalks to get out of the rain, which falls, as it has been doing for about half a millennium, on the sloping black walls of Intramuros. If those walls did not run in straight lines they could be mistaken for a natural freak of geology: ridges of bare, dark volcanic rock erupting from the grass like teeth from gums. The walls have dovetail-shaped notches that converge to old gun emplacements, providing interlocking fields of fire across a dry moat.\n\nLiving in the States, you never see anything older than about two and a half centuries, and you have to visit the eastern fringe of the country to see that. The business traveler's world of airports and taxicabs looks the same everywhere. Randy never really believes he's in a different country until he sees something like Intramuros, and then he has to stand there like an idiot for a long time, ruminating.\n\nRight now, across the Pacific Ocean, in a small, tasteful Victorian town located a third of the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles, computers are seizing up, crucial files are disappearing, and e-mail is careening into intergalactic space, because Randy Waterhouse is not there to keep an eye on things. The town in question sports three small colleges: one founded by the State of California and two founded by Protestant denominations that are now actively reviled by the majority of their faculty. Taken together these colleges--the Three Siblings--comprise an academic center of middling importance. Their computer systems are linked into one. They exchange teachers and students. From time to time they host academic conferences. This part of California has beaches, mountains, redwood forests, vineyards, golf courses, and sprawling penal facilities all over the place. There are plenty of three- and four-star hotel rooms, and the Three Siblings, taken together, have enough auditoria and meeting rooms to host a conference of several thousand.\n\nAvi's telephone call, some eighty hours ago, arrived in the middle of a major interdisciplinary conference called ``The Intermediate Phase (1939\u203a45) of the Global Hegemony Struggle of the Twentieth Century (Common Era).'' This is a bit of a mouthful and so it has been given a pithy nickname: ``War as Text.''\n\nPeople are coming from places like Amsterdam and Milan. The conference's organizing committee--which includes Randy's girlfriend, Charlene, who actually gives every indication of being his ex-girlfriend now--hired an artist in San Francisco to come up with a poster. He started with a black-and-white halftone photo of a haggard World War Two infantryman with a cigarette dangling from his lower lip. He worked this image over using a photocopier, blowing the halftone dots up into rough lumps, like rubber balls chewed by a dog, and wreaking any number of other distortions on it until it had an amazingly stark, striking, jagged appearance; the soldier's pale eyes turned an eerie white. Then he added a few elements in color: red lipstick, blue eyeshadow, and a trace of a red brassiere strap peeking out from the soldier's unbuttoned uniform shirt.\n\nThe poster won some kind of an award almost the moment it came out. This led to a press release, which in turn led to the poster's being enshrined by the news media as an Official Object of Controversy. An enterprising journalist managed to track down the soldier depicted in the original photograph--a decorated combat veteran and retired tool-and-die maker who, as it happened, was not merely alive but in excellent health, and, since the death of his wife from breast cancer, had spent his retirement roaming around the Deep South in his pickup truck, helping to rebuild black churches that had been torched by drunken yahoos.\n\nThe artist who had designed the poster then confessed that he had simply copied it from a book and had made no effort whatsoever to obtain permission--the entire concept of getting permission to use other people's work was faulty, since all art was derivative of other art. High-powered trial lawyers converged, like dive bombers, on the small town in Kentucky where the aggrieved veteran was up on the roof of a black church with a mouthful of nails, hammering down slabs of A/D exterior plywood and mumbling ``no comment'' to a horde of reporters down on the lawn. After a series of conferences in a room at the town's Holiday Inn, the veteran emerged, accompanied by one of the five most famous lawyers on the face of the planet, and announced that he was filing a civil suit against the Three Siblings that would, if it succeeded, turn them and their entire community into a flat, smoking abrasion in the earth's crust. He promised to split the proceeds between the black churches and various disabled veterans' and breast cancer research groups.\n\nThe organizing committee pulled the poster from circulation, which caused thousands of bootleg copies to go up on the World Wide Web and, in general, brought it to the attention of millions who never would have seen it otherwise. They also filed suit against the artist, whose net worth could be tallied up on the back of a ticket stub: he had assets of about a thousand dollars and debts (mostly student loans) amounting to sixty-five thousand.\n\nAll of this happened before the conference even began. Randy was aware of it only because Charlene had roped him into providing computer support for the conference, which meant setting up a Web site and e-mail access for the attendees. When all of this hit the news, e-mail began to flood in, and quickly jammed up all of the lines and filled up all of the disk capacity that Randy had spent the last month setting up.\n\nConferees began to arrive. A lot of them seemed to be sleeping in the house where Randy and Charlene had been living together for seven years. It was a big old Victorian house and there was plenty of room. They stumbled in from Heidelberg and Paris and Berkeley and Boston, then sat around Randy and Charlene's kitchen table drinking coffee and talking at great length about the Spectacle. Randy inferred that the Spectacle meant the poster furor, but as they went on and on about it, he sensed that they were using the word not in a conventional sense but as part of some academic jargon; that it carried a heavy load of shadings and connotations to them, none of which Randy would ever understand unless he became one of them.\n\nTo Charlene, and to all of the people attending War as Text, it was self-evident that the veteran who filed the lawsuit was the very worst kind of human being--just the sort they had gathered together to debunk, burn in effigy, and sweep into the ash-bin of posthistorical discourse. Randy had spent a lot of time around these people, and thought he'd gotten used to them, but during those days he had a headache all the time, from clenching his teeth, and he kept jumping to his feet in the middle of meals or conversations and going out for solitary walks. This was partly to keep himself from saying something undiplomatic, and partly as a childish but fruitless tactic to get the attention he craved from Charlene.\n\nHe knew the whole poster saga was going to be a disaster from early on. He kept warning Charlene and the others. They listened coolly, clinically, as if Randy were a test subject on the wrong side of a one-way mirror.\n\n\n\nRandy forces himself to stay awake long enough for it to get dark. Then he lies in bed for a few hours trying to sleep. The container port is just north of the hotel, and all night long, Rizal Boulevard, along the base of the old Spanish wall, is jammed from one end to the other with container-carrying semis. The whole city is a cauldron of internal combustion. Manila seems to have more pistons and exhaust pipes than the rest of the world combined. Even at two in the morning the hotel's seemingly unshakable mass hums and rattles from the seismic energy pouring from all of those motors. The noise detonates car alarms down in the hotel's lot. The noise of one alarm triggers others, and so on. It is not the noise that keeps Randy awake so much as the insane stupidity of this chain reaction. It is an object lesson: the kind of nightmarish, snowballing technological fuck-up that keeps hackers awake at night even when they can't hear the results.\n\nHe paws open a Heineken from his minibar and stands in front of the window, looking. Many of the trucks are adorned with brilliant displays of multicolored lights--not quite as flashy as those of the few jeepneys that scurry and jostle among them. Seeing so many people awake and working puts sleep out of the question.\n\nHe is too jet-lagged to accomplish anything that requires actual thought--but there is one important job he can do, which requires no thinking whatsoever. He starts up his laptop again. Seeming to levitate in the center of his dark room, the screen is a perfect rectangle of light the color of diluted milk, of a Nordic dawn. This light originates in small fluorescent tubes imprisoned in the polycarbonate coffin of his computer's display. It can only escape through a pane of glass, facing Randy, which is entirely covered by small transistors arranged in a grid, which let photons through, or don't, or let through only those of a particular wavelength, cracking the pale light into colors. By turning those transistors on and off according to some systematic plan, meaning is conveyed to Randy Waterhouse. A good filmmaker could convey a whole story to Randy by seizing control of those transistors for a couple of hours.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot more laptop computers floating around than there are filmmakers worth paying attention to. The transistors are almost never put into the hands of human beings. They are controlled, instead, by software. Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't. It's hard enough to find human beings who are interesting.\n\nThe pyramid and the eyeball appear. Randy spends so much time using Ordo now that he has his machine boot it up automatically.\n\nNowadays the laptop has only one function for Randy: he uses it to communicate with other people, through e-mail. When he communicates with Avi, he has to use Ordo, which is a tool for taking his ideas and converting them into streams of bits that are almost indistinguishable from white noise, so that they can be sent to Avi in privacy. In exchange, it receives noise from Avi and converts it into Avi's thoughts. At the moment, Epiphyte has no assets other than information--it is an idea, with some facts and data to back it up. This makes it eminently stealable. So encryption is definitely a good idea. The question is: how much paranoia is really appropriate?\n\nAvi sent him encrypted e-mail:\n\nWhen you get to Manila I would like you to generate a 4096-bit key pair and keep it on a floppy disk that you carry on your person at all times. Do not keep it on your hard disk. Anyone could break into your hotel room while you're out and steal that key.\n\nNow, Randy pulls down a menu and picks an item labeled: ``New key. . . . ''\n\nA box pops up giving him several KEY LENGTH options: 768 bits, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, or Custom. Randy picks the latter option and then, wearily, types in 4096.\n\nEven a 768-bit key requires vast resources to break. Add one bit, to make it 769 bits long, and it becomes twice as difficult. A 770-bit key is twice as difficult yet, and so on. By using 768-bit keys, Randy and Avi could keep their communications secret from nearly every entity in the world for at least the next several years. A 1024-bit key would be vastly, astronomically more difficult to break.\n\nSome people go so far as to use keys 2048 or even 3072 bits in length. These will stop the very best codebreakers on the face of the earth for astronomical periods of time, barring the invention of otherworldly technologies such as quantum computers. Most encryption software--even stuff written by extremely security-conscious cryptography experts--can't even handle keys larger than that. But Avi insists on using Ordo, generally considered the best encryption software in the world, because it can handle keys of unlimited length--as long as you don't mind waiting for it to crunch all the numbers.\n\nRandy begins typing. He is not bothering to look at the screen; he is staring out the window at the lights on the trucks and the jeepneys. He is only using one hand, just flailing away loosely at the keyboard.\n\nInside Randy's computer is a precise clock. Whenever he strikes a key, Ordo uses that clock to record the current time, down to microseconds. He hits a key at 03:05:56.935788 and he hits another one at 03:05:57.290664, or about .354876 seconds later. Another .372307 seconds later, he hits another one. Ordo keeps track of all of these intervals and discards the more significant digits (in this example the .35 and the .37) because these parts will tend to be similar from one event to the next.\n\nOrdo wants randomness. It only wants the least significant digits--say, the 76 and the 07 at the very ends of these numbers. It wants a whole lot of random numbers, and it wants them to be very, very random. It is taking somewhat random numbers and feeding them through hash functions that make them even more random. It is running statistical routines on the results to make sure that they contain no hidden patterns. It has breathtakingly high standards for randomness, and it will not stop asking Randy to whack on the keyboard until those standards are met.\n\nThe longer the key you are trying to generate, the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi, in an encrypted e-mail message, that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer, and this computer was put to work trying to break a 4096-bit encryption key, it would take longer than the lifespan of the universe.\n\n``Using today's technology,'' Avi shot back, ``that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large prime numbers?''\n\n``How long do you want these messages to remain secret?'' Randy asked, in his last message before leaving San Francisco. ``Five years? Ten years? Twenty-five years?''\n\nAfter he got to the hotel this afternoon, Randy decrypted and read Avi's answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes, like the afterimage of a strobe:\n\nI want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.\n\nThe computer finally beeps. Randy rests his tired hand. Ordo politely warns him that it may be busy for a while, and then goes to work. It is searching the cosmos of pure numbers, looking for two big primes that can be multiplied by each other to produce a number 4096 bits long.\n\nIf you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large prime numbers.\n\nSo the length of the key that you use is, in and of itself, a code of sorts. A knowledgeable government eavesdropper, noting Randy's and Avi's use of a 4096-bit key, will conclude one of the following:\n\n--Avi doesn't know what he's talking about. This can be ruled out with a bit of research into his past accomplishments. Or,\n\n--Avi is clinically paranoid. This can also be ruled out with some research. Or,\n\n--Avi is extremely optimistic about the future development of computer technology, or pessimistic about the political climate, or both. Or,\n\n--Avi has a planning horizon that extends over a period of at least a century.\n\nRandy paces around his room while his computer soars through number space. The shipping containers on the backs of those trucks bear exactly the same logos as the ones that used to fill the streets of South Seattle when a ship was unloading. To Randy this is oddly satisfying, as if, by making this crazy lunge across the Pacific, he has brought some kind of antipodal symmetry to his life. He has gone from the place where things are consumed to where they are produced, from a land where onanism has been enshrined at the highest levels of the society to one where cars have ``NO to contraception!'' stickers in their windows. It feels bizarrely right. He has not felt this way since Avi and he founded their first doomed business venture twelve years ago.\n\n\n\nRandy grew up in a college town in eastern Washington State, graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, and landed a Clerk Typist II job at the library there--specifically the Interlibrary Loan Department--where his job was to process incoming loan requests mailed in from smaller libraries all over the region and, conversely, to mail out requests to other libraries. If nine-year-old Randy Waterhouse had been able to look into the future and see himself in this career, he would have been delighted beyond measure: the primary tool of the Interlibrary Loan Department was the Staple Remover. Young Randy had seen one of these devices in the hands of his fourth-grade teacher and been enthralled by its cunning and deadly appearance, so like the jaws of some futuristic robot dragon. He had, in fact, gone out of his way to staple things incorrectly just so he could prevail on his teacher to unstaple them, giving him another glimpse of the blood-chilling mandibles in action. He had gone so far as to steal a staple remover from an untended desk at church and then incorporate it into an Erector-set robot hunter-killer device with which he terrorized much of the neighborhood; its pit-viper yawn separated many a cheap plastic toy from its parts and accessories before the theft was discovered and Randy made an example of before God and man. Now, in the Interlibrary Loan office, Randy had not just one but several staple removers in his desk drawer and was actually obligated to use them for an hour or two a day.\n\nSince the UW library was well-endowed, its patrons didn't request books from other libraries unless they had been stolen from their own or were, in some way, peculiar. The ILL office (as Randy and his coworkers affectionately called it) had its regulars--people who had a whole lot of peculiar books on their wish lists. These people tended to be either tedious or scary or both. Randy always ended up dealing with the ``both'' subgroup, because Randy was the only Clerk Typist in the office who was not a lifer. It seemed clear that Randy, with his astronomy degree and his extensive knowledge of computers, would one day move on, whereas his coworkers did not harbor further ambitions. His larger sphere of interests, his somewhat broader concept of normalcy, was useful when certain patrons came into the office.\n\nBy the standards of many, Randy was himself a tedious, scary, obsessed character. He was not merely obsessed with science but also with fantasy role-playing games. The only way he could tolerate working at such a stupid job for a couple of years was that his off time was completely occupied with enacting fantasy scenarios of a depth and complexity that exercised all of the cranial circuitry that was so conspicuously going to waste in the ILL office. He was part of a group that would meet every Friday night and play until sometime on Sunday. The other stalwarts in the group were a computer science/music double major named Chester, and a history grad student named Avi.\n\nWhen a new master's degree candidate named Andrew Loeb walked into the ILL office one day, with a certain glint in his eye, and produced a three-inch-thick stack of precisely typed request forms from his shitty old knapsack, he was recognized immediately as being of a particular type, and shunted in the direction of Randy Waterhouse. It was an instant meeting of minds, though Randy did not fully realize this until the books that Loeb had requested began to arrive on the trolley from the mail room.\n\nAndy Loeb's project was to figure out the energy budgets of the local Indian tribes. A human body has to expend a certain amount of energy just to keep breathing and to maintain its body temperature. This figure goes up when it gets cold or when the body in question is doing work. The only way to obtain that energy is by eating food. Some foods have a higher energy content than others. For example, trout is highly nutritious but so low in fat and carbohydrates that you can starve to death eating it three times a day. Other foods might have lots of energy, but might require so much work to obtain and prepare that eating them would be a losing proposition, BTU-wise. Andy Loeb was trying to figure out what foods had historically been eaten by certain Northwest Indian tribes, how much energy they expended to get these foods and how much they obtained by eating them. He wanted to do this calculation for coastal Indians like the Salish (who had easy access to seafood) and for inland ones like the Cayuse (who didn't) as part of an extremely convoluted plan to prove some sort of point about the relative standards of living of these tribes and how this affected their cultural development (coastal tribes made lots of fantastically detailed art and inland ones occasionally scratched stick figures on rocks).\n\nTo Andrew Loeb it was an exercise in meta-historical scholarship. To Randy Waterhouse, it sounded like the beginnings of a pretty cool game. Strangle a muskrat and you get 136 Energy Points. Lose the muskrat and your core temp drops another degree.\n\nAndy was nothing if not methodical and so he had simply looked up every book that had ever been written on such topics, and every book mentioned in those books' bibliographies, yea, even unto four or five generations; checked out all of them that were available locally; and ordered the rest from ILL. All of the latter passed across Randy's desk. Randy read some and skimmed all. He got to learn about how much blubber the Arctic explorers had to eat in order to keep from starving to death. He perused detailed specifications for Army C-rations. After a while, he actually began sneaking into the photocopy room and making copies of key data.\n\nIn order to run a realistic fantasy role-playing game, you had to keep track of how much food the imaginary characters were getting and how much trouble was involved in getting it. Characters passing across the Gobi desert in November of the year 5000 B.C. would have to spend more time worrying about food than, say, ones who were traveling across central Illinois in 1950.\n\nRandy was hardly the first game designer to notice this. There were a few incredibly stupid games in which you didn't have to think about food, but Randy and his friends disdained them. In all of the games that he participated in, or that he himself designed, you had to devote a realistic amount of effort to getting food for your character. But it was not easy to determine what was realistic. Like most designers, Randy got over the problem by slapping together a few rudimentary equations that he basically just pulled out of thin air. But in the books, articles, and dissertations that Andrew Loeb was borrowing through ILL, he found exactly the raw data that a mathematically inclined person would need to come up with a sophisticated rules system based on scientific fact.\n\nStimulating all of the physical processes going on in each character's body was out of the question, especially in a game where you might be dealing with armies of a hundred thousand men. Even a crude simulation, tracking only a few variables and using simple equations, would involve a nightmarish amount of paperwork if you did it all by hand. But all of this was happening in the mid-1980s, when personal computers had become cheap and ubiquitous. A computer could automatically track a large database and tell you whether each character was well-fed or starving. There was no reason not to do it on a computer.\n\nUnless, like Randy Waterhouse, you had such a shitty job that you couldn't afford a computer.\n\nOf course, there's a way to dodge any problem. The university had lots of computers. If Randy could get an account on one of them, he could write his program there and run it for free.\n\nUnfortunately, accounts were only available to students or faculty members, and Randy was neither.\n\nFortunately, he started dating a grad student named Charlene at just about this time.\n\nHow the hell did a generally keg-shaped guy, a hard scientist, working a dead-end Clerk Typist job, and spending all his spare time in the consummately nerdy pastime of fantasy role-playing games, end up in a relationship with a slender and not unattractive young liberal arts student who spent her spare time sea kayaking and going to foreign films? It must have been one of those opposites-attract kind of deals, a complementary relationship. They met, naturally, in the ILL office, where the highly intelligent but steady and soothing Randy helped the highly intelligent but scattered and flighty Charlene organize a messy heap of loan requests. He should have asked her out then and there, but he was shy. Second and third opportunities came along when the books she'd requested began to filter up from the mailroom, and finally he asked her out and they went to see a film together. Both of them turned out to be not just willing but eager, and possibly even desperate. Before they knew it, Randy had given Charlene a key to his apartment, and Charlene had given Randy the password to her free university computer account, and everything was just delightful.\n\nThe university computer system was better than no computer at all. But Randy was humiliated. Like every other high-powered academic computing network, this one was based on an industrial-strength operating system called UNIX, which had a learning curve like the Matterhorn, and lacked the cuddly and stylish features of the personal computers then coming into vogue. Randy had used it quite a bit as an undergraduate and knew his way around. Even so, learning how to write good code on the thing required a lot of time. His life had changed when Charlene had come along, and now it changed more: he dropped out of the fantasy role-playing game circuit altogether, stopped going to meetings of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and began to spend all of his free time either with Charlene or in front of a computer terminal. All in all, this was probably a change for the better. With Charlene, he did things he wouldn't have done otherwise, like getting exercise, or going to see live music. And at the computer, he was learning new skills, and he was creating something. It might be something completely useless, but at least he was creating.\n\nHe spent a lot of time talking to Andrew Loeb, who actually went out and did the stuff he was writing programs for; he'd disappear for a few days and come back all wobbly and haggard, with fish scales caught in his whiskers or dried animal blood under his fingernails. He'd ram down a couple of Big Macs, sleep for twenty-four hours, then meet Randy in a bar (Charlene wasn't comfortable with having him in the house) and talk learnedly of the difficulties of day-to-day life, aboriginal style. They argued about whether aborigines would eat the more disgusting parts of certain animals or throw them away. Andrew voted for yes. Randy disagreed--just because they were primitive didn't mean they couldn't have taste. Andrew accused him of being a romantic. Finally, to settle it, they went up into the mountains together, armed with nothing but knives and Andrew's collection of exquisitely crafted vermin snares. By the third night, Randy found himself seriously thinking about eating some insects. ``Q.E.D.,'' Andrew said.\n\nAnyway, Randy finished his software after a year and a half. It was a success; Chester and Avi liked it. Randy was moderately pleased at having built something so complicated that actually worked, but he had no illusions about its being good for anything. He was sort of embarrassed at having wasted so much time and mental energy on the project. But he knew that if he hadn't been writing code, he'd have spent the same amount of time playing games or going to Society for Creative Anachronism meetings in medieval drag, so it all zeroed out in the end. Spending the time in front of the computer was arguably better, because it had honed his programming skills, which had been pretty sharp to begin with. On the other hand, he'd done it all on the UNIX system, which was for scientists and engineers--not a savvy move in an age when all the money was in personal computers.\n\nChester and Randy had nicknamed Avi ``Avid,'' because he really, really liked fantasy games. Avi had always claimed that he played them as a way of understanding what it was really like to live in ancient times, and he was a maniac about historical authenticity. That was okay; they all had half-assed excuses, and Avi's historical acumen frequently came in handy.\n\nNot long after this, Avi graduated and disappeared, and popped up a few months later in Minneapolis, where he had gotten a job with a major publisher of fantasy role-playing games. He offered to buy Randy's game software for the astonishingly large sum of $1000 plus a small cut of future profits. Randy accepted the offer in its general outlines, asked Avi to send him a contract, then went out and found Andrew boiling some fish guts in a birchbark kettle atop a Weber grill on the roof of the apartment building where he lived. He wanted to give Andrew the good news, and to cut him in on the proceeds. What ensued was a really unpleasant conversation, standing up there in a pelting, spitting, wind-blown rain.\n\nTo begin with, Andrew took this deal far more seriously than Randy did. Randy saw it as a windfall, a lark. Andrew, who was the son of a lawyer, treated it as if it were a major corporate merger, and asked many tedious and niggling questions about the contract, which did not exist yet and which would probably cover a single piece of paper when it did. Randy didn't realize it at the time, but by asking so many questions for which Randy had no answers, Andrew was, in effect, arrogating to himself the role of Business Manager. He was implicitly forming a business partnership with Randy that did not, in fact, exist.\n\nFurthermore, Andrew didn't have the first notion of how much time and effort Randy had put into writing the code. Or (as Randy was to realize later) maybe he did. In any case, Andrew assumed from the get-go that he would share a fifty-fifty split with Randy, which was wildly out of proportion to the work he'd actually done on the project. Basically, Andrew acted as if all of the work he'd ever done on the subject of aboriginal dining habits was a part of this undertaking, and that it entitled him to an equal split.\n\nBy the time Randy extricated himself from this conversation, his mind was reeling. He had gone in with one view of reality and been radically challenged by another one that was clearly preposterous; but after an hour of Andrew's browbeating he was beginning to doubt himself. After two or three sleepless nights, he decided to call the whole thing off. A paltry few hundred dollars wasn't worth all of this agony.\n\nBut Andrew (who was, by now, represented by an associate of his father's Santa Barbara law firm) vehemently objected. He and Randy had, according to his lawyer, jointly created something that had economic value, and a failure on Randy's part to sell it at market value amounted to taking money out of Andrew's pocket. It had become an unbelievable Kafkaesque nightmare, and Randy could only withdraw to a corner table at his favorite pub, drink pints of stout (frequently in the company of Chester) and watch this fantastic psychodrama unfold. He had, he now realized, blundered into some serious domestic weirdness involving Andrew's family. It turned out that Andrew's parents were divorced and, long ago, had fought savagely over custody of him, their only child. Mom had turned into a hippie and joined a religious cult in Oregon and taken Andrew with her. It was rumored that this cult engaged in sexual abuse of children. Dad had hired private dicks to kidnap Andrew back and then showered him with material possessions to demonstrate his superior love. There had followed an interminable legal battle in which Dad had hired some rather fringey psychotherapists to hypnotize Andrew and get him to dredge up repressed memories of unspeakable and improbable horrors.\n\nThis was just the executive summary of a weird life that Randy only learned about in bits and pieces as the years went on. Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the whole thing in its entirety.\n\nAnyway Randy had blundered into this life and become enveloped in the weirdness. One of the young eager beavers in Andrew's dad's law firm decided, as a preemptive move, to obtain copies of all of Randy's computer files, which were still stored on the UW computer system. Needless to say, he went about it in a heavy-handed way, and when the university's legal department began to receive his sullen letters, it responded by informing both Andrew's lawyer, and Randy, that anyone who used the university's computer system to create a commercial product had to split the proceeds with the university. So now Randy was getting ominous letters from not one but two groups of deadly lawyers. Andrew then threatened to sue him for having made this blunder, which had halved the value of Andrew's share!\n\nIn the end, just to cut his losses and get out of it clean, Randy had to hire a lawyer of his own. The final cost to him was a hair more than five thousand dollars. The software was never sold to anyone, and indeed could not have been; it was so legally encumbered by that point that it would have been like trying to sell someone a rusty Volkswagen that had been dismantled and its parts hidden in attack dog kennels all over the world.\n\nIt was the only time in his life when he had ever thought about suicide. He did not think about it very hard, or very seriously, but he did think about it.\n\nWhen it was all over, Avi sent him a handwritten letter saying, ``I enjoyed doing business with you and look forward to continuing our relationship both as friends and, should opportunities arise, as creative partners.''\n\n\nINDIGO\n\n\n\nLawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the band are up on the deck of the Nevada one morning, playing the national anthem and watching the Stars and Stripes ratchet up the mast, when they are startled to find themselves in the midst of one hundred and ninety airplanes of unfamiliar design. Some of them are down low, traveling horizontally, and others are up high, plunging nearly straight down. The latter are going so fast that they appear to be falling apart; little bits are dropping off of them. It is terrible to see--some training exercise gone miserably awry. But they pull out of their suicidal trajectories in plenty of time. The bits that have fallen off of them plunge smoothly and purposefully, not tumbling and fluttering as chunks of debris would. They are coming down all over the place. Perversely, they all seem to be headed for the berthed ships. It is incredibly dangerous--they might hit someone! Lawrence is outraged.\n\nThere is a short-lived phenomenon taking place in one of the ships down the line. Lawrence turns to look at it. This is the first real explosion he's ever seen and so it takes him a long time to recognize it as such. He can play the very hardest glockenspiel parts with his eyes closed, and The Star Spangled Banner is much easier to ding than to sing.\n\nHis scanning eyes fasten, not on the source of the explosion, but on a couple of airplanes that are headed right toward them, skimming just above the water. Each drops a long skinny egg and then their tailplanes visibly move and they angle upwards and pass overhead. The rising sun shines directly through the glass of their canopies. Lawrence is able to look into the eyes of the pilot of one of the planes. He notes that it appears to be some sort of Asian gentleman.\n\nThis is an incredibly realistic training exercise--even down to the point of using ethnically correct pilots, and detonating fake explosives on the ships. Lawrence heartily approves. Things have just been too lax around this place.\n\nA tremendous shock comes up through the deck of the ship, making his feet and legs feel as if he had just jumped off a ten-foot precipice onto solid concrete. But he's just standing there flatfooted. It makes no sense at all.\n\nThe band have finished playing the national anthem and are looking about at the spectacle. Sirens and horns are speaking up all over the place, from the Nevada, from the Arizona in the next berth, from buildings onshore. Lawrence doesn't see any antiaircraft fire going up, doesn't see any familiar planes in the air. The explosions just keep coming. Lawrence wanders over to the rail and stares across a few yards of open water towards the Arizona.\n\nAnother one of those plunging airplanes drops a projectile that shoots straight down onto Arizona's deck but then, strangely, vanishes. Lawrence blinks and sees that it has left a neat bomb-shaped hole in the deck, just like a panicky Warner Brothers cartoon character passing at high speed through a planar structure such as a wall or ceiling. Fire jets from that hole for about a microsecond before the whole deck bulges up, disintegrating, and turns into a burgeoning globe of fire and blackness. Waterhouse is vaguely aware of a lot of stuff coming at him really fast. It is so big that he feels more like he is falling into it. He freezes up. It goes by him, over him, and through him. A terrible noise pierces his skull, a chord randomly struck, discordant but not without some kind of deranged harmony. Musical qualities aside, it is so goddamned loud that it almost kills him. He claps his hands over his ears.\n\nStill the noise is there, like red-hot knitting needles through the eardrums. Hell's Bells. He spins away from it, but it follows him. He has this big thick strap around his neck, sewn together at groin level where it supports a cup. Thrust into the cup is the central support of his glockenspiel, which stands in front of him like a lyre-shaped breastplate, huge fluffy tassels dangling gaily from the upper corners. Oddly, one of the tassels is burning. That isn't the only thing now wrong with the glockenspiel, but he can't quite make it out because his vision keeps getting obscured by something that must be wiped away every few moments. All he knows is that the glockenspiel has eaten a huge quantum of pure energy and been kicked up to some incredibly high state never before achieved by such an instrument; it is a burning, glowing, shrieking, ringing, radiating monster, a comet, an archangel, a tree of flaming magnesium, strapped to his body, standing on his groin. The energy is transmitted down its humming, buzzing central axis, through the cup, and into his genitals, which would be tumescing in other circumstances.\n\nLawrence spends some time wandering aimlessly around the deck. Eventually he has to help open a hatch for some men, and then he realizes that his hands are still clapped over his ears, and have been for a long time except for when he was wiping stuff out of his eyes. When he takes them off, the ringing has stopped, and he no longer hears airplanes. He was thinking that he wanted to go belowdecks, because the bad things are coming from the sky and he would like to get some big heavy permanent-seeming stuff between him and it, but a lot of sailors are taking the opposite view. He hears that they have been hit by one and maybe two of something that rhymes with ``torpedoes,'' and that they are trying to raise steam. Officers and noncoms, black and red with smoke and blood, keep deputizing him for different, extremely urgent tasks that he doesn't quite understand, not least because he keeps putting his hands over his ears.\n\nProbably half an hour goes by before he hits upon the idea of discarding his glockenspiel, which is, after all, just getting in the way. It was issued to him by the Navy with any number of stern warnings about the consequences of misusing it. Lawrence is conscientious about this kind of thing, dating back to when he was first given organ-playing privileges in West Point, Virginia. But at this point, for the first time in his life, as he stands there watching the Arizona burn and sink, he just says to himself: Well, to heck with it! He takes that glockenspiel out of its socket and has one last look at it, it is the last time in his life he will ever touch a glockenspiel. There is no point in saving it now anyway, he realizes; several of the bars have been bent. He flips it around and discovers that chunks of blackened, distorted metal have been impact-welded onto several of the bars. Really throwing caution to the winds now, he flings it overboard in the general direction of the Arizona, a military lyre of burnished steel that sings a thousand men to their resting places on the bottom of the harbor.\n\nAs it vanishes into a patch of burning oil, the second wave of attacking airplanes arrives. The Navy's antiaircraft guns finally open up and begin to rain shells down into the surrounding community and blow up occupied buildings. He can see human-shaped flames running around in the streets, pursued by people with blankets.\n\nThe rest of the day is spent, by Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the Navy, grappling with the fact that many two-dimensional structures on this and other ships, which were put into place to prevent various fluids from commingling (e.g. fuel and air) have holes in them, and not only that but a lot of shit is on fire too and things are more than a little smoky. Certain objects that are supposed to (a) remain horizontal and (b) support heavy things have ceased to do either.\n\nNevada's engineering section manages to raise steam in a couple of boilers and the captain tries to get the ship out of the harbor. As soon as she gets underway, she comes under concerted attack, mostly by dive bombers who are eager to sink her in the channel and block the harbor altogether. Eventually, the captain runs her aground rather than see this happen. Unfortunately, what Nevada has in common with most other naval vessels is that she is not really engineered to work from a stationary position, and consequently she is hit three more times by dive bombers. So it is a pretty exciting morning overall. As a member of the band who does not even have his instrument any more, Lawrence's duties are quite poorly defined, and he spends more time than he should watching the airplanes and the explosions. He has gone back to his earlier train of thought regarding societies and their efforts to outdo each other. It is very clear to him, as wave after wave of Nipponese dive bombers hurl themselves, with calligraphic precision, at the ship he is standing on, and as the cream of his society's navy burns and explodes and sinks, putting up virtually no resistance, that his society is going to have to rethink a thing or two.\n\n\n\nAt some point he burns his hand on something. It is his right hand, which is preferable--he is left-handed. Also, he becomes more clearly aware that a portion of Arizona has tried to take his scalp off. These are minor injuries by Pearl Harbor standards and he does not stay long in the hospital. The doctor warns him that the skin on his hand might contract and limit his fingers' range of motion. As soon as he can withstand the pain, Lawrence begins to play Bach's Art of Fugue in his lap whenever he is not otherwise occupied. Most of those tunes start out simple; you can easily picture old Johann Sebastian sitting there on the bench on a cold morning in Leipzig, one or two blockflote stops yanked out, left hand in his lap, a fat choirboy or two over in the corner heaving away on the bellows, faint gasping noises coming from all the leaks in the works, and Johann's right hand wandering aimlessly across the forbidding simplicity of the Great manual, stroking those cracked and yellowed elephant tusks, searching for some melody he hadn't already invented. That is good stuff for Lawrence right now, and so he makes his right hand go through the same motions as Johann's, even though it is a gauze-wrapped hand and he is using an upside-down dinner tray as a substitute for the keyboard, and he has to hum the music under his breath. When he really gets into it, his feet skid around and piston under the sheets, playing imaginary pedals, and his neighbors complain.\n\nHe is out of the hospital in a few days, just in time for him and the rest of Nevada's band to begin their new, wartime assignment. This was evidently something of a poser for the Navy's manpower experts. These musicians were (from a killing-Nips point of view) completely useless to begin with. As of 7 December, they no longer have even a functioning ship and most of them have lost their clarinets.\n\nStill, it isn't all about loading shells and pulling triggers. No large organization can kill Nips in any kind of systematic way without doing a nearly unbelievable amount of typing and filing. It is logical to suppose that men who can play the clarinet will not botch that kind of work any worse than anyone else. And so Waterhouse and his bandmates receive orders assigning them to what would appear to be one of the typing-and-filing branches of the Navy.\n\nThis is located in a building, not a ship. There are quite a few Navy people who sneer at the whole idea of working in a building, and Lawrence and some of the other recent recruits, eager to fit in, have gotten into the habit of copping the same attitude. But now that they have seen what happens to a ship when you detonate hundreds of pounds of high explosive on, in, and around it, Waterhouse and many others are reassessing their feelings about working in buildings. They report to their new post with high morale.\n\nTheir new commanding officer is not so cheerful, and his feelings appear to be shared by everyone in the entire section. The musicians are greeted without being welcomed and saluted without being honored. The people who have been working in this building--far from being overawed by their status as guys who not only worked on an actual ship until recently but furthermore have been very close to things that were exploding, burning, etc., and not as the result of routine lapses in judgment but because bad men deliberately made it happen--do not seem to feel that Lawrence and his bandmates deserve to be entrusted with this new work, whatever the hell it is.\n\nGlumly, almost despairingly, the commanding officer and his subordinates get the musicians squared away. Even if they don't have enough desks to go around, each man can at least have a chair at a table or counter. Some ingenuity is displayed in finding places for all the new arrivals. It is clear that these people are trying their best at what they considered to be a hopeless task.\n\nThen there is some talk about secrecy. A great deal of talk about it. They run through drills intended to test their ability to throw things away properly. This goes on for a long time and the longer it continues, without an explanation as to why, the more mysterious it becomes. The musicians, who were at first a little put out by their chilly reception, start to speculate amongst themselves as to what kind of an operation they have gotten themselves into now.\n\nFinally, one morning, the musicians are assembled in a classroom in front of the cleanest chalkboard Waterhouse has ever seen. The last few days have imbued him with just enough paranoia that he suspects it is that clean for a reason--erasing chalkboards is not to be taken lightly during wartime.\n\nThey are seated in little chairs with desks attached to them, desks designed for right-handers. Lawrence puts his notepad in his lap, then rests his bandaged right hand on the desk and begins to play a ditty from Art of Fugue, grimacing and even grunting with pain as his burned skin stretches and slides over his knuckles.\n\nSomeone chucks him on the shoulder. He opens his eyes to see that he is the only person in the room sitting down; an officer is on the deck. He stands up and his weak leg nearly buckles. When he finally gets himself fully to his feet, he sees that the officer (if he even is an officer) is out of uniform. Way out of uniform. He's wearing a bathrobe and smoking a pipe. The bathrobe is extraordinarily worn, and not in the sense of, say, a hospital or hotel bathrobe that gets laundered frequently. This thing hasn't been laundered in a long time, but boy has it seen some use. The elbows are worn out and the bottom of the right sleeve is ashy grey and slippery with graphite from being dragged back and forth, tens of thousands of times, across sheets of paper dense with number-two pencil work. The terrycloth has a dandruffy appearance, but it has nothing to do with exfoliation of the scalp; these flakes are way too big, and too geometric: rectangles and circular dots of oaktag, punched out of cards and tape respectively. The pipe went out a long time ago and the officer (or whatever he is) is not even pretending to worry about getting it relit. It is there just to give him something to bite down on, which he does as vigorously as a civil war infantryman having a leg sawed off.\n\nSome other fellow--one who actually bothered to shave, shower, and put on a uniform--introduces bathrobe man as Commander Shane-spelled-s-c-h-o-e-n, but Schoen is having none of it; he turns his back on them, exposing the back side of his bathrobe, which around the buttocks is worn transparent as a negligee. Reading from a notebook, he writes out the following in block letters:\n\n19 17 17 19 14 20 23 18 19 8 12 16 19 8 3\n\n21 8 25 18 14 18 6 3 18 8 15 18 22 18 11\n\nAround the time that the fourth or fifth number is going up on the chalkboard, Waterhouse feels the hairs standing up on the back of his neck. By the time the third group of five numbers is written out, he has not failed to notice that none of them is larger than 26--that being the number of letters in the alphabet. His heart is pounding more wildly than it did when Nipponese bombs were tracing parabolic trajectories toward the deck of the grounded Nevada. He pulls a pencil out of his pocket. Finding no paper handy, he writes down the numbers from 1 to 26 on the surface of his little writing desk.\n\nBy the time the man in the bathrobe is done writing out the last group of numbers, Waterhouse is already well into his frequency count. He wraps it up as Bathrobe Man is saying something along the lines of ``this might look like a meaningless sequence of numbers to you, but to a Nip naval officer it might look like something entirely different.'' Then the man laughs nervously, shakes his head sadly, squares his jaw resolutely, and runs through a litany of other emotion-laden expressions not a single one of which is appropriate here.\n\nWaterhouse's frequency count is simply a tally of how frequently each number appears on the blackboard. It looks like this:\n\n1  14 ||\n2  15 |\n3 ||  16 |\n4  17 ||\n5  18 ||||||\n6 |  19 ||||\n7  20 |\n8 ||||  21 |\n9  22 |\n10  23 |\n11 |  24\n12 |  25 |\n13  26\n\nThe most interesting thing about this is that ten of the possible symbols (viz. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 24, and 26) are not even used. Only sixteen different numbers appear in the message. Assuming each of those sixteen represents one and only one letter of the alphabet, this message has (Lawrence reckons in his head) 111136315345735680000 possible meanings. This is a funny number because it begins with four ones and ends with four zeroes; Lawrence snickers, wipes his nose, and gets on with it.\n\nThe most common number is 18. It probably represents the letter E. If he substitutes E into the message everywhere he sees an 18, then--\n\nWell, to be honest, then he'll have to write out the whole message again, substituting Es for 18s, and it will take a long time, and it might be time wasted because he might have guessed wrong. On the other hand, if he just restrains his mind to construe 18s as Es--an operation that he thinks of as being loosely analogous to changing the presets on a pipe organ's console--then what he sees in his mind's eye when he looks at the blackboard is\n\n19 17 17 19 14 20 23 E 19 8 12 16 19 8 3\n\n21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\nwhich only has 10103301395066880000 possible meanings. This is a funny number too because of all those ones and zeroes--but it is an absolutely meaningless coincidence.\n\n``The science of making secret codes is called cryptography,'' Commander Schoen says, ``and the science of breaking them is cryptanalysis.'' Then he sighs, grapples visibly with some more widely divergent emotional states, and resignedly plods into the mandatory exercise of breaking these words down into their roots, which are either Latin or Greek (Lawrence isn't paying attention, doesn't care, only glimpses the stark word CRYPTO written in handsized capitals).\n\nThe opening sequence ``19 17 17 19'' is peculiar. 19, along with 8, is the second most common number in the list. 17 is only half as common. You can't have four vowels or four consonants in a row (unless the words are German) so either 17 is a vowel and 19 a consonant or the other way round. Since 19 appears more frequently (four times) in the message, it is more likely to be the vowel than 17 (which only appears twice). A is the most common vowel after E, so if he assumes that 19 is A, he gets\n\nA 17 17 A 14 20 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3\n\n21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\n\nThis narrows it down quite a bit, to a mere 841941782922240000 possible answers. He's already reduced the solution space by a couple of orders of magnitude!\n\nSchoen has talked himself up into a disturbingly heavy sweat, now, and is almost bodily flinging himself into a historical overview of the science of CRYPTOLOGY, as the union of cryptography and cryptanalysis is called. There's some talk about an English fellow name of Wilkins, and book called Cryptonomicon that he wrote hundreds of years ago, but (perhaps because he doesn't rate the intelligence of his audience too highly) he goes very easy on the historical background, and jumps directly from Wilkins to Paul Revere's ``one if by land, two if by sea'' code. He even makes a mathematics in-joke about this being one of the earliest practical applications of binary notation. Lawrence dutifully brays and snorts, drawing an appalled look from the saxophonist seated in front of him.\n\nEarlier in his talk, the Schoen mentioned that this message was (in what's obviously a fictional scenario ginned up to make this mathematical exercise more interesting to a bunch of musicians who are assumed not to give a shit about math) addressed to a Nip naval officer. Given that context, Lawrence cannot but guess that the first word of the message is ATTACK. This would mean that 17 represented T, 14 C, and 20 K. When he fills these in, he gets\n\nA T T A C K 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3\n\n21 T 25 E C E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\n\nand then the rest is so obvious he doesn't bother to write it out. He cannot restrain himself from jumping to his feet. He's so excited he forgets about the weak legs and topples over across a couple of his neighbors' desks, which makes a lot of noise.\n\n``Do you have a problem, sailor?'' says one of the officers in the corner, one who actually bothered to wear a uniform.\n\n``Sir! The message is, `Attack Pearl Harbor December Seven!' Sir!'' Lawrence shouts, and then sits down. His whole body is quivering with excitement. Adrenalin has taken over his body and mind. He could strangle twenty sumo wrestlers on the spot.\n\nCommander Schoen is completely impassive except that he blinks once, very slowly. He turns to one of his subordinates, who is standing against the wall with his hands clasped behind his back, and says, ``Get this one a copy of the Cryptonomicon. And a desk--as close to the coffee machine as possible. And why don't you promote the son of a bitch as long as you're at it.''\n\nThe part about the promotion turns out to be either military humor or further evidence of Commander Schoen's mental instability. Other than that small bit of drollery, the story of Waterhouse past this point, for the next ten months, is not much more complicated than the story of a bomb that has just been released from the belly of a plunging airplane. The barriers placed in his path (working his way through the Cryptonomicon, breaking the Nipponese Air Force Meteorological Code, breaking the Coral naval attache machine cipher, breaking Unnamed Nipponese Army Water Transport Code 3A, breaking the Greater East Asia Ministry Code) present about as much resistance as successive decks of a worm-eaten wooden frigate. Within a couple of months he is actually writing new chapters of the Cryptonomicon. People speak of it as though it were a book, but it's not. It is basically a compilation of all of the papers and notes that have drifted up in a particular corner of Commander Schoen's office over the roughly two-year period that he's been situated at Station Hypo, as this place is called.* It is everything that Commander Schoen knows about breaking codes, which amounts to everything that the United States of America knows. At any moment it could have been annihilated if a janitor had stepped into the room for a few minutes and tidied the place up. Understanding this, Commander Schoen's colleagues in the officers' ranks of Station Hypo have devised strenuous measures to prevent any type of tidying or hygienic operations, of any description, in the entire wing of the building that contains Commander Schoen's office. They know enough, in other words, to understand that the Cryptonomicon is terribly important, and they have the wit to take the measures necessary to keep it safe. Some of them actually consult it from time to time, and use its wisdom to break Nipponese messages, or even solve whole cryptosystems. But Waterhouse is the first guy to come along who is good enough to (at first) point out errors in what Schoen has written, and (soon) assemble the contents of the pile into something like an orderly work, and (eventually) add original material onto it.\n\n*``Hypo'' is a military way of saying the letter H. Bright boy Waterhouse infers that there must be at least seven others: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.\n\nAt some point Schoen takes him downstairs and leads him to the end of a long windowless corridor to a slab of a door guarded by hulking Myrmidons and lets him see the second coolest thing they've got at Pearl Harbor, a roomful of machinery from the Electrical Till Corporation that they use mainly for doing frequency counts on Nip intercepts.\n\nThe most remarkable machine* at Station Hypo, however--and the first coolest thing in Pearl Harbor--is even deeper in the cloaca of the building. It is contained in something that might be likened to a bank vault if it weren't all wired up with explosives so that its contents can be vaporized in the event of a total Nip invasion.\n\n*Assuming, provisionally, that Alan is wrong and that human brains are not machines.\n\nThis is the machine that Commander Schoen made, more than a year ago, for breaking the Nipponese cipher called Indigo. Apparently, as of the beginning of 1940, Schoen was a well-adjusted and mentally healthy young man into whose lap was dumped some great big long lists of numbers compiled from intercept stations around the Pacific (perhaps, Waterhouse thinks, Alpha, Bravo, etc.). These numbers were Nipponese messages that had been encrypted somehow--circumstantial evidence suggested that it had been done by some kind of machine. But absolutely nothing was known about the machine: whether it used gears or rotary switches or plugboards, or some combination thereof, or some other kind of mechanism that hadn't even been thought of by white people yet; how many such mechanisms it did or didn't use; specific details of how it used them. All that could be said was that these numbers, which seemed completely random, had been transmitted, perhaps even incorrectly. Other than that, Schoen had nothing--nothing--to work on.\n\nAs of the middle of 1941, then, this machine existed in this vault, here at Station Hypo. It existed because Schoen had built it. The machine perfectly decrypted every Indigo message that the intercept stations picked up, and was, therefore, necessarily an exact functional duplication of the Nipponese Indigo code machine, though neither Schoen nor any other American had ever laid eyes on one. Schoen had built the thing simply by looking at those great big long lists of essentially random numbers, and using some process of induction to figure it out. Somewhere along the line he had become totally debilitated psychologically, and begun to suffer nervous breakdowns at the rate of about one every week or two.\n\nAs of the actual outbreak of war with Nippon, Schoen is on disability, and taking lots of drugs. Waterhouse spends as much time with Schoen as he is allowed to, because he's pretty sure that whatever happened inside of Schoen's head, between when the lists of apparently random numbers were dumped into his lap and when he finished building his machine, is an example of a noncomputable process.\n\nWaterhouse's security clearance is upgraded about once a month, until it reaches the highest conceivable level (or so he thinks) which is Ultra/Magic. Ultra is what the Brits call the intelligence they get from having broken the German Enigma machine. Magic is what the Yanks call the intelligence they get from Indigo. In any case, Lawrence now gets to see the Ultra/Magic summaries, which are bound documents with dramatic, alternating red and black paragraphs printed on the front cover. Paragraph number three states:\n\nNO ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN ON INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED, REGARDLESS OF TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE, IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY.\n\nSeems clear enough, right? But Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is not so damn sure.\n\n. . . IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING . . .\n\nAt about the same time, Waterhouse has made a realization about himself. He has found that he works best when he is not horny, which is to say in the day or so following ejaculation. So as a part of his duty to the United States he has begun to spend a lot of time in whorehouses. But he can't have that much actual sex on what is still a glockenspiel player's pay and so he limits himself to what are euphemistically called massages.\n\n. . . ACTION. . . EFFECT . . .REVEALING . . .\n\nThe words stay with him like the clap. He lies on his back during these massages, arms crossed over his eyes, mumbling the words to himself. Something bothers him. He has learned that when something bothers him in this particular way it usually leads to his writing a new paper. But first he has to do a lot of hard mental pick-and-shovel work.\n\nIt all comes to him, explosively, during the Battle of Midway, while he and his comrades are spending twenty-four hours a day down among those ETC machines, decrypting Yamamoto's messages, telling Nimitz exactly where to find the Nip fleet.\n\nWhat are the chances of Nimitz finding that fleet by accident? That's what Yamamoto must be asking himself.\n\nIt is all a question (oddly enough!) of information theory.\n\n. . .ACTION . . .\n\nWhat is an action? It might be anything. It might be something obvious like bombing a Nipponese military installation. Everyone would agree that this would constitute an action. But it might also be something like changing the course of an aircraft carrier by five degrees--or not doing so. Or having exactly the right package of forces off Midway to hammer the Nipponese invasion fleet. It could mean something much less dramatic, like canceling plans for an action. An action, in a certain sense, might even be the total absence of activity. Any of these might be rational responses, on the part of some commander, to INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED. But any of them might be observable by the Nipponese--and hence any of them would impart information to the Nipponese. How good might those Nips be at abstracting information from a noisy channel? Do they have any Schoens?\n\n. . . EFFECT . . .\n\nSo what if the Nips did observe it? What would the effect be exactly? And under what circumstances might the effect be REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY?\n\nIf the action is one that could never have happened unless the Americans were breaking Indigo, then it will constitute proof, to the Nipponese, that the Americans have broken it. The existence of the source--the machine that Commander Schoen built--will be revealed.\n\nWaterhouse trusts that no Americans will be that stupid. But what if it isn't that clear-cut? What if the action is one that would merely be really improbable unless the Americans were breaking the code? What if the Americans, in the long run, are just too damn lucky?\n\nAnd how closely can you play that game? A pair of loaded dice that comes up sevens every time is detected in a few throws. A pair that comes up sevens only one percent more frequently than a straight pair is harder to detect--you have to throw the dice many more times in order for your opponent to prove anything.\n\nIf the Nips keep getting ambushed--if they keep finding their own ambushes spoiled--if their merchant ships happen to cross paths with American subs more often than pure probability would suggest--how long until they figure it out?\n\nWaterhouse writes papers on the subject, keeps pestering people with them. Then, one day, Waterhouse receives a new set of orders.\n\nThe orders arrive encrypted into groups of five random-looking letters, printed out on the blue tissue paper that is used for top-secret cablegrams. The message has been encrypted in Washington using a one-time pad, which is a slow and awkward but, in theory, perfectly unbreakable cipher used for the most important messages. Waterhouse knows this because he is one of the only two persons in Pearl Harbor who has clearance to decrypt it. The other one is Commander Schoen, and he is under sedation today. The duty officer opens up the appropriate safe and gives him the one-time pad for the day, which is basically a piece of graph paper covered with numbers printed in groups of five. The numbers have been chosen by secretaries in a basement in Washington by shuffling cards or drawing chits out of a hat. They are pure noise. One copy of the pure noise is in Waterhouse's hands, and the other copy is used by the person who encrypted this message in Washington.\n\nWaterhouse sits down and gets to work, subtracting noise from ciphertext to produce plaintext.\n\nThe first thing he sees is that this message's classification is not merely Top Secret, or even Ultra, but something entirely new: ULTRA MEGA.\n\nThe messages states that after thoroughly destroying this message, he--Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse--is to proceed to London, England, by the fastest available means. All ships, trains, and airplanes, even submarines, will be made available to him. Though a member of the U.S. Navy, he is even to be provided with an extra uniform--an Army uniform--in case it simplifies matters for him.\n\nThe one thing he must never, ever do is place himself in a situation where he could be captured by the enemy. In this sense, the war is suddenly over for Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1194727", "artist_names": "Dion", "full_title": "Havin' Fun by\u00a0Dion", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/2a0c0e055adf8cb3aaf4ae8aba7ff1bd.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2a0c0e055adf8cb3aaf4ae8aba7ff1bd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1194727, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429689807, "path": "/Dion-havin-fun-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Dion-havin-fun-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1961, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1961", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1961", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/2a0c0e055adf8cb3aaf4ae8aba7ff1bd.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2a0c0e055adf8cb3aaf4ae8aba7ff1bd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Havin\u2019 Fun", "title_with_featured": "Havin' Fun", "updated_by_human_at": 1625744453, "url": "https://genius.com/Dion-havin-fun-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/2825", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ec4210ecddfcfaa9313786ab1e6fce57.999x999x1.jpg", "id": 2825, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ec4210ecddfcfaa9313786ab1e6fce57.999x999x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Dion", "slug": "Dion", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Dion"}, "artist": "Dion", "lyrics": "Havin\u2019 Fun LyricsLife is so strange\nWith it's up and downs\nAnd today's hero\nMay be tomorrow's clown\n\nFriends keep on telling me\nThat I'm a fool to be\nSo in love while\nYou're just having fun\n\nI'll spend each lonely night\nLonging to hold you tight\nMorning finds me\nCrying to the sun\nBut I'll find somebody new\nAnd I'll get over you\nThen my broken heart\nWill hurt no more\n\nSomeday you'll realize\nI was the one\nThen you'll be crying\nWhile I'm having fun\n\nYou know\nSomeday you're gonna realize\nThat I was the one\nThen you'll be crying\nWhile I'm having funYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/871484", "artist_names": "Pat Boone", "full_title": "The Exodus Song (This Land Is Mine) by\u00a0Pat\u00a0Boone", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/4c0b6c386026590ee9354a65b684680b.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4c0b6c386026590ee9354a65b684680b.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 871484, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1624564678, "path": "/Pat-boone-the-exodus-song-this-land-is-mine-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Pat-boone-the-exodus-song-this-land-is-mine-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/4c0b6c386026590ee9354a65b684680b.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4c0b6c386026590ee9354a65b684680b.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 5, "hot": false, "pageviews": 14889}, "title": "The Exodus Song (This Land Is Mine)", "title_with_featured": "The Exodus Song (This Land Is Mine)", "updated_by_human_at": 1668631755, "url": "https://genius.com/Pat-boone-the-exodus-song-this-land-is-mine-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/65638", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d202abf87fc86bbae3e4814513421c4c.380x260x1.jpg", "id": 65638, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/16b3a35ec61815a30944b7bb9ce7f4a5.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "p", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Pat Boone", "slug": "Pat-boone", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Pat-boone"}, "artist": "Pat Boone", "lyrics": "The Exodus Song (This Land Is Mine) LyricsThis land is mine, God gave this land to me\nThis brave and ancient land to me\nAnd when the morning sun reveals her hills and plain\nThen I see a land where children can run free\nSo take my hand and walk this land with me\nAnd walk this lovely land with me\nThough I am just a man, when you are by my side\nWith the help of God, I know I can be strong\n\nThough I am just a man, when you are by my side\nWith the help of God, I know I can be strong\nTo make this land our home\nIf I must fight, I'll fight to make this land our own\nUntil I die, this land is mineYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/214996", "artist_names": "Cliff White (Ft.

Cliff White examines the output of the sex machine inch by inch.Cathy McGowan, reminiscing on BBC's 'The Story of Pop':\n\n\"When he came here he was hailed as the great James Brown \u2013 and the show was awful. I mean he just couldn't produce the sound. It was terrible. I mean it was really awful. It was a bad, bad show. A disaster. And the only reason that they devoted the whole show to Brown was because of the following that he'd got here built up because of the hysteria on the part of the mods. You know, it was like everything else. It was like everybody's-gotta- say-you-like-James-Brown-week. So, of course, the demand for James Brown records was such that everyone was writing into the programme saying James Brown. Every mod you asked would say James Brown. So you imagined that he was so big that if you could just get this James Brown... And that's really where Ready Steady Go! fell flat on their face \u2013 because it was awful. And the worst thing of all was that when he actually did his numbers the mods didn't like him. When he actually came into the studio they didn't like him. The music and the records were so fantastic, but when they actually came there to the studio to do it live... something went.\"\n\nNow then, if you're the perceptive kind of reader that the editor like to thinks you are, you'll have begun to realize that Ms. McGowan and her mohair-suited friends were just a teeny bit disappointed with James Brown. What was that again? \"...when they actually came to the studio...something went.\" What \"went\", of course, on that memorable Friday evening in March 1966, was the cosy notion that here was simply another harmless jigaboo with a trendy kind of rhythm and a humble smile.\n\nThere were a lot of them about at the time. In return for the legion of guitar-playing boys next door that were flocking across the Atlantic, we were receiving an amazing array of American talent. Rockers (black and white assorted, some famous, some not so), bluesmen (rural and urban, old and ancient), and a diverse selection of \"soul\" singers were all suddenly turning up on our shores. And it was the soul stars who were the darlings of the young and hip.\n\nIn truth, they were a mixed bunch. Some, like Solomon Burke and Ben E. King, proved to be even greater than their records had suggested, others (choose your own) would have done better to stay home and be admired from afar. But at least they were all greeted warmly at RSG where things were super and smashing so long as they loved our wonderful country and performed their hit(s) adequately. And then came James Brown.\n\nBrown didn't so much appear on RSG as dominate an hour of television that just happened to fill the program's regular spot. He strutted and stamped and screamed, he sweated and grunted and fell on his knees (and screamed), he danced across the stage like he had skates on and then charged around the studio, through the audience, and back again (screaming). In short, he was quite uncontrollable, and he kept it up for the entire show, pouring out barely intelligible lyrics while his bloody great band hit chords that fractured nerves and hammered relentless riffs without mercy.\nAll in all, he was quite magnificent. Little old ladies in faraway places were moved to bombard TV Times with outraged invective, including, as I recall (although this may possibly be my fancy), a cry of \"why are these monkeys allowed on TV instead of our own great stars like Helen Shapiro?\" Even the oh-so-hipsters retreated behind a screen of confusion from where they still hurl the occasional brickbat. Yes indeed, Brown stirred reactions that had lain dormant since the hey-day of rock 'n' roll. Two years earlier Little Richard had perpetrated an hour of similar mayhem without any fuss, because even by 1964 rock had become comfortably old-hat, and anyway somehow it was always clear that really he was a sweet boy who just got carried away with himself. As far as the Ray Charles spectacular, screened shortly after \u2013 he was so acceptable, he was respectable. Brown was altogether more menacing. In fact, judging by the hysterical backlash you'd have thought he was some kind of revolutionary, bent on smashing the status quo. In a way, you'd have been right.\n\nFor the most part Brown has always been portrayed by the mass (i.e. predominantly white) media as a cunning opportunist. Energetic, certainly, sometimes even astute, but basically a musical bore who has achieved his success by understanding and using the mechanics of the industry to his great advantage. Part of this assessment is true enough \u2013 Brown has indeed skillfully manipulated his way to fame and fortune. It's the conclusion that this necessarily indicated musical poverty that's at fault.\n\nBefore Brown, black performers could either be true to themselves and accept the limited recognition/rewards that came their way, or bend to suit the mores of white establishment controlled show-biz. To a greater extent than is generally admitted this is still true, but at least black music and musicians are now an influential slice of the industry rather than an exploited sub-culture. It would be silly to promote Brown as the sole architect of this upheaval, there are too many other socio-political factors involved, but his has been the extreme example that defines the whole change. He has achieved more than any other single back entertainer, while continuing to produce music that is so intensely personal that it irritates many sensitive black souls, let alone white audiences.\n\nI'm not, here, going to attempt to examine how he achieved the hitherto impossible. Instead I urge you to take a fresh listen to the aural evidence of his defiant independence, for Brown's music has always been the clearest expression of the complex tangle of angry frustration, determination, raw energy and pride with which he has forged his career. Now, with other black bands beginning to break through with updated spin-offs from various Brown themes \u2013 and the Average White Band creating waves with a remarkably clever pastiche of what he was doing several years ago \u2013 there seem to be grounds for a calmer assessment than the old tooth 'n' nail \"he's fantastic/no he's trash\" arguments.\n\nAfter always deliberately vetoing any Greatest Hits/Best Of albums (because he's forever insisting that \"the best is yet to come\"), in the last couple of years Brown finally compromised by allowing American Polydor to put together two unsatisfactory compilations from his extensive repertoire, under the title Soul Classics. Malcolm Jones at British Polydor seized the opportunity to squeeze an extra four tracks onto each of the original volumes, and is now extending the series with a third album already issued and at least one more on the way.\n\nCompared to, say, Atlantic's Ray Charles Story or the recent Tamla Motown Anthology series, the Brown albums are a frustrating disappointment. The tracks have been drawn at random from all points of his long and complex career and jumbled illogically together without regard to recording dates or continuity of style and atmosphere; all of his extended performances have been issued in truncated form (usually 'Part One' only); and, perhaps the greatest sin, there has been no attempt to sketch in even the simplest of background details. The only sleevenote (500 words on Volume Three) suggests that Brown is probably \"the most important artist in the history of R&B music\" but does nothing about the packaging to contradict the usual impression of a prolific but shallow hit machine.\n\nHaving said that, it must be emphasised that there is far greater evidence of his talent in the grooves. With hardly a dud track amongst the 42 so far used, for the first time it's possible to obtain a meaty selection of Brown\u2019s important recordings without forking out for 20 or 30 albums or a shelf full of singles. Assuming that we'll have to wait until his death before someone takes the trouble to collate a better sampling of the man's work, I wholeheartedly recommend Soul Classics and offer the following notes as a guide around his maze of recordings.\n\nAlthough cut-and-dried divisions are necessarily an over-simplification, there have been several distinct phases in the revolution of Brown's music reflecting parallel changes I his career. Using these as a base, I have suffixed the album tracks A to F and then summarized the six ages of Brown, craftily headed by appropriate song titles from the relevant period. Included are some generalisations which ardent discographers may wish to pick holes. Don't write and tell me \u2013 I'm just trying to make an awkward job less difficult. The additional suffix 'X' indicates bastard tracks recorded without his own band.\n\nSoul Classics \u2013 Volume I\n\n(Polydor 2391.057)\n\nSex Machine (E), My Part/ Make It Funky \u2013 Part 3 (F), Cold Sweat (D) , Superbad (E), I Got You (I Feel Good) (C), Money Won't Change You (C), Night Train (B), Make It Funky \u2013 Part I (F), Papa's Got A Brand New Bag (C).

In case you don't and were about to be confused, here's a bit of background detail: At the beginning of 1956, Brown (and The Famous Flames) were signed by King Records of Cincinnati who issued his records on their subsidary, Fedral, until November 1960 when they were transferred to the parent label. By the end of 1963 Brown had clashed so often with his producers and King's boss Syd Nathan that he ignored his contract and sent his own recordings to Smash, a division of Mercury. Although he was eventually forced to return to Kind until 1971 when he joined Polydor, he retained complete control of his own recordings. He'd stopped using the Famous Flames on record by mid-1964, but kept them as part of the stage show for a couple more years.\n\nWhat d'ya mean you're still confused?\n\nAnd now, to the music....\n\n(A) Messing With The Blues (Feb 1956 \u2013 Jan. 1959)\n\nThe sharp-eyed among you will have noticed that there are no tracks suffixed (A). Brown's first eight sessions yielded 32 tracks with vocal group the Famous Flames, using studio musicians mainly supervised by King's A&R man Gene Redd. With the exception of the very first release 'Please, Please, Please', a beautifully adapted gospel song 'Try Me', and the last side from these sessions 'Bewildered', they were a commercial disaster. Stylistically they were nothing new, borrowing from earlier gospel-based R&B groups like the Dominoes and, in particular, the Five Royales. However Brown was never much of a singer in the accepted sense of the word so the overall sound was much rawer than the predecessors. As American writer Alan Leeds once observed, it was \"rather like Little Richard leading The Drifters\". When you consider that these are the only sides by Brown that year average '50s vocal group specialist deigns to collect, you'll realise how far removed they are from his later work.\n\nSo far Soul Classics ignores these formative sessions, but as well as the three tracks mentioned there are several other interesting examples of Brown's/the group's/the company's search for identity which ought to be aired again, including a frantic rocker 'Chonnie-On-Chon', a novelty song 'That Dood It', and an intense blues 'Why Does Everything Happen To Me'. Collectors who want to hear these and more should look out for Brown's first two LP's. Please, Please, Please (King 610, reissued 909) and Try Me/The Unbeatable JB (King 635, reissued 919), released here on London HA8231 and HA 8203 respectively. Long deleted, they still occasionally turn up in discount stores and oldies lists.\n\n(B) I Got The Money (June 1959 \u2013 Oct. 1963)\n\nIn the strength of his first national hit ('Try Me'), Brown was signed by a major booking agency, assembled a permanent road band, and began recording highly original, exciting hits. With each success he increased the size of his band and stage-show; by 1962 he'd become America's foremost R&B star. The following year he was awarded million dollar sales for Live At The Apollo, gained his first pop Top 20 entry ('Prisoner Of Love'), and prepared to divorce himself from King.\n\nWith a well-rehearsed tight little band punching in and around his unorthodox phrasing, each new record took him further away from his contemporaries and closer to a realistic expression of his own emotions. Unexpected changes of tempo; sudden stops between verses, or even within verses; and a three-sided interplay between Brown, the band, and the Famous Flames, were used on both the fast numbers \u2013 the foundation of his intricate dance routines \u2013 and the pleading love songs which he extended into hysterical sermons.\nSoul Classics includes a few of the best known uptempo tracks (although they've missed the finest of the lot, 'I Got Money'), but all the great wailers are omitted, including 'You've Got The Power', 'The Bells', 'I Don't Mind', 'Baby You're Right', 'Like A Baby', and the superb 'Lost Someone'. Hopefully, future volumes will do something about this. In the meantime Polydor are going one better by reissuing Live At The Apollo. A historic recording by anybody's standards, it captures the young emergent Brown at the precise moment of fruition, when all of his energy and ideas gelled in one cataclysmic performance. Never known to be self-effacing, Brown refers to it simply as \"a masterpiece\". I'm inclined to agree. BUY IT.\n\n(C) Brand New Bag (Jan. 1964 \u2013 Jan. 1967).\n\nThe triumphant expression of independent success. From now on Brown is solely responsible for his own recordings and cuts sides all over America, wherever he happens to be at the moment of inspiration. Results are erratic, not only artistically but technically (for instance, 'Money Won't Change You', cut at the Talent-Master studios in New York, is so badly mixed it's liable to shatter your stylus. Live At The Garden, recorded six months later in New Jersey, is even worse. It should never have been issued). But the best are by far the most unique recordings ever made by a \"rhythm & blues\" singer. Aided by his bandleader Nat Jones, Brown begins to break down traditional forms of song construction. Hits like 'Out Of Sight' (cut in Chicago), 'Papa's got a Brand New Bag (Charlotte, North Carolina), and 'I Got You' (Miami) introduce new concepts in rhythmic progression which owe nothing to King Records or indeed anyone else except Brown and his alter ego, the band.\n\nThis was JB's peak period of white acceptance; the years in which he scored his biggest \"pop\" hits. Although this was partly due to the compulsive attraction of his new style for dancers, it was as much a mood of the times, for this was during the first \"R&B boom\" when all black entertainers were suddenly the in thing. Being the most flamboyant, Brown got the lion's share of attention \u2013 until it was realised just how disturbing he really was. His most widely acclaimed hit from this time, 'It's A Man's, Man's Man's World' had little to do with the overall development of his music, being an intensely performed ballad, written by someone else and recorded with a large orchestra.\n\n(D) It's A New Day (May 1967 \u2013 Nov. 1969)\n\nAlfred Ellis takes over from Jones to help Brown complete his rejection of conventional music. The hits become loose two-part improvisations over which Brown is virtually scat singing. White audiences get confused and begin to lose interest, but his impact on black music is immense and can be heard today in a wide range of derivations, from street funk bands to calmer recordings like Ben E. King's 'Supernatural Thing'. At the same time, many of his lyrics reflect his involvement in social programmes and political manoeuvring.\n\nIn many ways this was Brown's peak. His music had become so individualistic that it defied categorization; personally he radiated the charisma of a crusading politician; he was expanding his small autonomous corporation to include various other business ventures; and there was seemingly nothing on the horizon to threaten him. In fact his conflicting, and often na\u00efve, political assertions started to backfire; some of his projects (a night club and a chain of restaurants) soon collapsed, and younger black musicians (Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone) were already making waves that would rock his boat.\n\nAlthough Soul Classics includes most of the essential tracks from the period, they destroy much of the evidence of his creativity by using Part One's only. A great many extended records, including some of Brown's, are indeed totally unnecessary \u2013 often just an easy alternative to finding a flip side. However, performances like \u2018Cold Sweat\u2019, \u2018Mother Popcorn\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s A New Day\u2019 have got to be heard in toto to be fully appreciated. You wouldn\u2019t expect to find the first couple of minutes of \u2018Sad Eyed Lady\u2019 on a Best Of Dylan album would you? Well Brown shouldn\u2019t have suffered similar treatment here. I realise that time is at a premium on a multi-track compilation; nevertheless, these were arguably some of the most important and influential black records of the '60s, and it\u2019s a pity Polydor haven\u2019t shown than appropriate respect.\n\n(E) Superbad (April 1970 - May 1971)\n\nA short but vital period when Brown employed younger black musicians to recover from political ambiguity and the sudden loss of the band that had supported him through the sixties. (They left to try for a solo career as Maceo & All The King\u2019s Men). In just over a year he recorded some of his finest sides \u2013 all dynamic Afro-rhythmic hits that reaffirmed his commitment to black roots and enhanced his, by then, legendary reputation.\n\nThe driving force behind this rejuvenation were the two Collins brothers (Phelps \"Cat Fish\" \u2013 gtr, William \" Bootsy\" \u2013 bass) who were groomed by Brown as part of the New Dapps, transferred to the major league in his own JB\u2019s, and then left to form their own group the House Guests before doing a stint with Funkadelic. Although they only appeared on about half a dozen sides, their fresh approach left its mark on many of Brown\u2019s subsequent recordings.\n\n(F) Make It Funky (July 1971 \u2013 present day)\n\nWith many new bands building successful careers on the styles that Brown introduced in the '60s, he adopts his \u2018Godfather\u2019 image. But although, as a personality, he has become something of a grand old man of black music, he has so far refused to abandon young black audiences and continues to aim his records at that market. Obviously aware that he is no longer ahead of the field, his music has become erratic again in search for a new direction. At his best he is still unapproachable: often he is just an imitation of younger musicians.\n\nPart of the trouble is that Brown got bored. After a decade and a half of challenge during which, step by determined step, he achieved more or less everything he could have hoped for, he had nothing left to fight \u2013 so his music reflected dulled emotions. Finding that he could still sell records without any greater effort he started playing games, including calling a nondescript flipside 'Parts 15 & 16' and issuing two versions of the same song as consecutive singles.\n\nAlso, modern techniques in recording have done nothing for the man whose greatest performances have stemmed from \"live-in-studio\" sessions with his own band. Increasing use of pre-recorded backing tracks, multi-overdubs, and various electronic gadgets have proved a poor substitute for spontaneous creativity.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t believe that Brown is about to fade gracefully away. Now that his box-office receipts are down, record sales are becoming unpredictable, and other bands are carrying on where he left off, he has something to prove again. I\u2019d hazard a guess that in another ten years someone else will be writing a similar piece about Soul Classics that have yet to be recorded.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,

well\n\nThen came act two\nHeh, I've never changed\nThere was a misunderstanding\nI know now that I shouldn't have you listen to a so-called friend\n\nThe truth is, my love\nThat she wanted you for her own\nYou don't really have to doubt me\nNor must you go on without me\nYou might also likeYes, the stage is bare\nBut please wait there\nBecause I'm coming to you darling\nAnd we'll be

Lyrics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Along the leaguer'd wall, and bristling bank,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the arm'd river; while with straggling light,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The stars peep through the vapor, dim and dank.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BYRON.\n\nA few hours later Mabel Dunham was on the bastion that overlooked the river and the lake, seemingly in deep thought. The evening was calm and soft, and the question had arisen whether the party for the Thousand Islands would be able to get out that night or not, on account of the total absence of wind. The stores, arms, and ammunition were already shipped, and even Mabel's effects were on board; but the small draft of men that was to go was still ashore, there being no apparent prospect of the cutter's getting under way. Jasper had warped the Scud out of the cove, and so far up the stream as to enable him to pass through the outlet of the river whenever he chose; but there he still lay, riding at single anchor. The drafted men were lounging about the shore of the cove, undecided whether or not to pull off.\n\nThe sports of the morning had left a quiet in the garrison which was in harmony with the whole of the beautiful scene, and Mabel felt its influence on her feelings, though probably too little accustomed to speculate on such sensations to be aware of the cause. Everything near appeared lovely and soothing, while the solemn grandeur of the silent forest and placid expanse of the lake lent a sublimity that other scenes might have wanted. For the first time, Mabel felt the hold that the towns and civilization had gained on her habits sensibly weakened; and the warm-hearted girl began to think that a life passed amid objects such as those around her might be happy. How far the experience of the last days came in aid of the calm and holy eventide, and contributed towards producing that young conviction, may be suspected, rather than affirmed, in this early portion of our legend.\n\n\"A charming sunset, Mabel!\" said the hearty voice of her uncle, so close to the ear of our heroine as to cause her to start,\u2014\"a charming sunset, girl, for a fresh-water concern, though we should think but little of it at sea.\"\n\"And is not nature the same on shore or at sea\u2014on a lake like this or on the ocean? Does not the sun shine on all alike, dear uncle; and can we not feel gratitude for the blessings of Providence as strongly on this remote frontier as in our own Manhattan?\"\n\n\"The girl has fallen in with some of her mother's books. Is not nature the same, indeed! Now, Mabel, do you imagine that the nature of a soldier is the same as that of a seafaring man? You've relations in both callings, and ought to be able to answer.\"\n\n\"But uncle, I mean human nature.\"\n\n\"So do I, girl; the human nature of a seaman, and the human nature of one of these fellows of the 55th, not even excepting your own father. Here have they had a shooting-match\u2014target-firing I should call it\u2014this day, and what a different thing has it been from a target-firing afloat! There we should have sprung our broadside, sported with round shot, at an object half a mile off, at the very nearest; and the potatoes, if there happened to be any on board, as very likely would not have been the case, would have been left in the cook's coppers. It may be an honorable calling, that of a soldier, Mabel; but an experienced hand sees many follies and weaknesses in one of these forts. As for that bit of a lake, you know my opinion of it already, and I wish to disparage nothing. No real seafarer disparages anything; but, d\u2014-me, if I regard this here Ontario, as they call it, as more than so much water in a ship's scuttle-butt. Now, look you here, Mabel, if you wish to understand the difference between the ocean and a lake, I can make you comprehend it with a single look: this is what one may call a calm, seeing that there is no wind; though, to own the truth, I do not think the calms are as calm as them we get outside\u2014\"\n\n\"Uncle, there is not a breath of air. I do not think it possible for the leaves to be more immovably still than those of the entire forest are at this very moment.\"\n\n\"Leaves! what are leaves, child? there are no leaves at sea. If you wish to know whether it is a dead calm or not, try a mould candle,\u2014your dips flaring too much,\u2014and then you may be certain whether there is or is not any wind. If you were in a latitude where the air was so still that you found a difficulty in stirring it to draw it in in breathing, you might fancy it a calm. People are often on a short allowance of air in the calm latitudes. Here, again, look at that water! It is like milk in a pan, with no more motion now than there is in a full hogshead before the bung is started. On the ocean the water is never still, let the air be as quiet as it may.\"\n\n\"The water of the ocean never still, Uncle Cap? not even in a calm?\"\n\n\"Bless your heart, no, child! The ocean breathes like a living being, and its bosom is always heaving, as the poetizers call it, though there be no more air than is to be found in a siphon. No man ever saw the ocean still like this lake; but it heaves and sets as if it had lungs.\"\n\n\"And this lake is not absolutely still, for you perceive there is a little ripple on the shore, and you may even hear the surf plunging at moments against the rocks.\"\n\n\"All d\u2014\u2014d poetry! Lake Ontario is no more the Atlantic than a Powles Hook periagila is a first-rate. That Jasper, notwithstanding, is a fine lad, and wants instruction only to make a man of him.\"\n\n\"Do you think him ignorant, uncle?\" answered Mabel, prettily adjusting her hair, in order to do which she was obliged, or fancied she was obliged, to turn away her face. \"To me Jasper Eau-douce appears to know more than most of the young men of his class. He has read but little, for books are not plenty in this part of the world; but he has thought much, as least so it seems to me, for one so young.\"\n\n\"He is ignorant, as all must be who navigate an inland water like this. No, no, Mabel; we both owe something to Jasper and the Pathfinder, and I have been thinking how I can best serve them, for I hold ingratitude to be the vice of a hog; for treat the animal to your own dinner, and he would eat you for the dessert.\"\n\n\"Very true, dear uncle; we ought indeed to do all we can to express our proper sense of the services of both these brave men.\"\n\"Spoken like your mother's daughter, girl, and in a way to do credit to the Cap family. Now, I've hit upon a traverse that will just suit all parties; and, as soon as we get back from this little expedition down the lake among them there Thousand Islands, and I am ready to return, it is my intention to propose it.\"\n\n\"Dearest uncle! this is so considerate in you, and will be so just! May I ask what your intentions are?\"\n\n\"I see no reason for keeping them a secret from you, Mabel, though nothing need be said to your father about them; for the Sergeant has his prejudices, and might throw difficulties in the way. Neither Jasper nor his friend Pathfinder can ever make anything hereabouts, and I propose to take both with me down to the coast, and get them fairly afloat. Jasper would find his sea-legs in a fortnight, and a twelvemonth's v'y'ge would make him a man. Although Pathfinder might take more time, or never get to be rated able, yet one could make something of him too, particularly as a look-out, for he has unusually good eyes.\"\n\n\"Uncle, do you think either would consent to this?\" said Mabel smiling.\n\n\"Do I suppose them simpletons? What rational being would neglect his own advancement? Let Jasper alone to push his way, and the lad may yet die the master of some square-rigged craft.\"\n\n\"And would he be any the happier for it, dear uncle? How much better is it to be the master of a square-rigged craft than to be master of a round-rigged craft?\"\n\n\"Pooh, pooh, Magnet! You are just fit to read lectures about ships before some hysterical society; you don't know what you are talking about; leave these things to me, and they'll be properly managed. Ah! Here is the Pathfinder himself, and I may just as well drop him a hint of my benevolent intentions as regards himself. Hope is a great encourager of our exertions.\"\n\nCap nodded his head, and then ceased to speak, while the hunter approached, not with his usual frank and easy manner, but in a way to show that he was slightly embarrassed, if not distrustful of his reception.\n\n\"Uncle and niece make a family party,\" said Pathfinder, when near the two, \"and a stranger may not prove a welcome companion?\"\n\n\"You are no stranger, Master Pathfinder,\" returned Cap, \"and no one can be more welcome than yourself. We were talking of you but a moment ago, and when friends speak of an absent man, he can guess what they have said.\"\n\n\"I ask no secrets. Every man has his enemies, and I have mine, though I count neither you, Master Cap, nor pretty Mabel here among the number. As for the Mingos, I will say nothing, though they have no just cause to hate me.\"\n\n\"That I'll answer for, Pathfinder! for you strike my fancy as being well-disposed and upright. There is a method, however, of getting away from the enmity of even these Mingos; and if you choose to take it, no one will more willingly point it out than myself, without a charge for my advice either.\"\n\n\"I wish no enemies, Saltwater,\" for so the Pathfinder had begun to call Cap, having, insensibly to himself, adopted the term, by translating the name given him by the Indians in and about the fort,\u2014\"I wish no enemies. I'm as ready to bury the hatchet with the Mingos as with the French, though you know that it depends on One greater than either of us so to turn the heart as to leave a man without enemies.\"\n\"By lifting your anchor, and accompanying me down to the coast, friend Pathfinder, when we get back from this short cruise on which we are bound, you will find yourself beyond the sound of the war-whoop, and safe enough from any Indian bullet.\"\n\n\"And what should I do on the salt water? Hunt in your towns? Follow the trails of people going and coming from market, and ambush dogs and poultry? You are no friend to my happiness, Master Cap, if you would lead me out of the shades of the woods to put me in the sun of the clearings.\"\n\n\"I did not propose to leave you in the settlements, Pathfinder, but to carry you out to sea, where a man can only be said to breathe freely. Mabel will tell you that such was my intention, before a word was said on the subject.\"\n\n\"And what does Mabel think would come of such a change? She knows that a man has his gifts, and that it is as useless to pretend to others as to withstand them that come from Providence. I am a hunter, and a scout, or a guide, Saltwater, and it is not in me to fly so much in the face of Heaven as to try to become anything else. Am I right, Mabel, or are you so much a woman as to wish to see a natur' altered?\"\n\n\"I would wish to see no change in you, Pathfinder,\" Mabel answered, with a cordial sincerity and frankness that went directly to the hunter's heart; \"and much as my uncle admires the sea, and great as is all the good that he thinks may come of it, I could not wish to see the best and noblest hunter of the woods transformed into an admiral. Remain what you are, my brave friend, and you need fear nothing short of the anger of God.\"\n\n\"Do you hear this, Saltwater? do you hear what the Sergeant's daughter is saying, and she is much too upright, and fair-minded, and pretty, not to think what she says. So long as she is satisfied with me as I am, I shall not fly in the face of the gifts of Providence, by striving to become anything else. I may seem useless here in a garrison; but when we get down among the Thousand Islands, there may be an opportunity to prove that a sure rifle is sometimes a Godsend.\"\n\n\"You are then to be of our party?\" said Mabel, smiling so frankly and so sweetly on the guide that he would have followed her to the end of the earth. \"I shall be the only female, with the exception of one soldier's wife, and shall feel none the less secure, Pathfinder, because you will be among our protectors.\"\n\n\"The Sergeant would do that, Mabel, though you were not of his kin. No one will overlook you. I should think your uncle here would like an expedition of this sort, where we shall go with sails, and have a look at an inland sea?\"\n\n\"Your inland sea is no great matter, Master Pathfinder, and I expect nothing from it. I confess, however, I should like to know the object of the cruise; for one does not wish to be idle, and my brother-in-law, the Sergeant, is as close-mouthed as a freemason. Do you know, Mabel, what all this means?\"\n\n\"Not in the least, uncle. I dare not ask my father any questions about his duty, for he thinks it is not a woman's business; and all I can say is, that we are to sail as soon as the wind will permit, and that we are to be absent a month.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Master Pathfinder can give me a useful hint; for a v'y'ge without an object is never pleasant to an old sailor.\"\n\n\"There is no great secret, Saltwater, concerning our port and object, though it is forbidden to talk much about either in the garrison. I am no soldier, however, and can use my tongue as I please, though as little given as another to idle conversation, I hope; still, as we sail so soon, and you are both to be of the party, you may as well be told where you are to be carried. You know that there are such things as the Thousand Islands, I suppose, Master Cap?\"\n\n\"Ay, what are so called hereaway, though I take it for granted that they are not real islands, such as we fall in with on the ocean; and that the thousand means some such matter as two or three.\"\n\n\"My eyes are good, and yet have I often been foiled in trying to count them very islands.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, I've known people who couldn't count beyond a certain number. Your real land-birds never know their own roosts, even in a landfall at sea. How many times have I seen the beach, and houses, and churches, when the passengers have not been able to see anything but water! I have no idea that a man can get fairly out of sight of land on fresh water. The thing appears to me to be irrational and impossible.\"\n\n\"You don't know the lakes, Master Cap, or you would not say that. Before we get to the Thousand Islands, you will have other notions of what natur' has done in this wilderness.\"\n\n\"I have my doubts whether you have such a thing as a real island in all this region.\"\n\n\"We'll show you hundreds of them; not exactly a thousand, perhaps, but so many that eye cannot see them all, nor tongue count them.\"\n\n\"I'll engage, when the truth comes to be known, they'll turn out to be nothing but peninsulas, or promontories; or continents; though these are matters, I daresay, of which you know little or nothing. But, islands or no islands, what is the object of the cruise, Master Pathfinder?\"\n\"There can be no harm in giving you some idea of what we are going to do. Being so old a sailor, Master Cap, you've heard, no doubt, of such a port as Frontenac?\"\n\n\"Who hasn't? I will not say I've ever been inside the harbor, but I've frequently been off the place.\"\n\n\"Then you are about to go upon ground with which you are acquainted. These great lakes, you must know, make a chain, the water passing out of one into the other, until it reaches Erie, which is a sheet off here to the westward, as large as Ontario itself. Well, out of Erie the water comes, until it reaches a low mountain like, over the edge of which it passes.\"\n\n\"I should like to know how the devil it can do that?\"\n\n\"Why, easy enough, Master Cap,\" returned Pathfinder, laughing, \"seeing that it has only to fall down hill. Had I said the water went up the mountain, there would have been natur' ag'in it; but we hold it no great matter for water to run down hill\u2014that is, fresh water.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, but you speak of the water of a lake's coming down the side of a mountain; it's in the teeth of reason, if reason has any teeth.\"\n\n\"Well, well, we will not dispute the point; but what I've seen I've seen. After getting into Ontario, all the water of all the lakes passes down into the sea by a river; and in the narrow part of the sheet, where it is neither river nor lake, lie the islands spoken of. Now Frontenac is a post of the Frenchers above these same islands; and, as they hold the garrison below, their stores and ammunition are sent up the river to Frontenac, to be forwarded along the shores of this and the other lakes, in order to enable the enemy to play his devilries among the savages, and to take Christian scalps.\"\n\n\"And will our presence prevent these horrible acts?\" demanded Mabel, with interest.\n\n\"It may or it may not, as Providence wills. Lundie, as they call him, he who commands this garrison, sent a party down to take a station among the islands, to cut off some of the French boats; and this expedition of ours will be the second relief. As yet they've not done much, though two bateaux loaded with Indian goods have been taken; but a runner came in last week, and brought such tidings that the Major is about to make a last effort to circumvent the knaves. Jasper knows the way, and we shall be in good hands, for the Sergeant is prudent, and of the first quality at an ambushment; yes, he is both prudent and alert.\"\n\n\"Is this all?\" said Cap contemptuously; \"by the preparations and equipments, I had thought there was a forced trade in the wind, and that an honest penny might be turned by taking an adventure. I suppose there are no shares in your fresh-water prize-money?\"\n\n\"Anan?\"\n\n\"I take it for granted the king gets all in these soldiering parties, and ambushments, as you call them.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about that, Master Cap. I take my share of the lead and powder if any falls into our hands, and say nothing to the king about it. If any one fares better, it is not I; though it is time I did begin to think of a house and furniture and a home.\"\n\nAlthough the Pathfinder did not dare to look at Mabel while he made this direct allusion to his change of life, he would have given the world to know whether she was listening, and what was the expression of her countenance. Mabel little suspected the nature of the allusion, however; and her countenance was perfectly unembarrassed as she turned her eyes towards the river, where the appearance of some movement on board the Scud began to be visible.\n\n\"Jasper is bringing the cutter out,\" observed the guide, whose look was drawn in the same direction by the fall of some heavy article on the deck. \"The lad sees the signs of wind, no doubt, and wishes to be ready for it.\"\n\n\"Ay, now we shall have an opportunity of learning seamanship,\" returned Cap, with a sneer. \"There is a nicety in getting a craft under her canvas that shows the thoroughbred mariner as much as anything else. It's like a soldier buttoning his coat, and one can see whether he begins at the top or the bottom.\"\n\n\"I will not say that Jasper is equal to your seafarers below,\" observed Pathfinder, across whose upright mind an unworthy feeling of envy or of jealousy never passed; \"but he is a bold boy, and manages his cutter as skillfully as any man can desire, on this lake at least. You didn't find him backwards at the Oswego Falls, Master Cap, where fresh water contrives to tumble down hill with little difficulty.\"\n\nCap made no other answer than a dissatisfied ejaculation, and then a general silence followed, all on the bastion studying the movements of the cutter with the interest that was natural to their own future connection with the vessel. It was still a dead calm, the surface of the lake literally glittering with the last rays of the sun. The Scud had been warped up to a kedge that lay a hundred yards above the points of the outlet, where she had room to manoeuvre in the river which then formed the harbor of Oswego. But the total want of air prevented any such attempt, and it was soon evident that the light vessel was to be taken through the passage under her sweeps. Not a sail was loosened; but as soon as the kedge was tripped, the heavy fall of the sweeps was heard, when the cutter, with her head up stream, began to sheer towards the centre of the current; on reaching which, the efforts of the men ceased, and she drifted towards the outlet. In the narrow pass itself her movement was rapid, and in less than five minutes the Scud was floating outside of the two low gravelly points which intercepted the waves of the lake. No anchor was let go, but the vessel continued to set off from the land, until her dark hull was seen resting on the glossy surface of the lake, full a quarter of a mile beyond the low bluff which formed the eastern extremity of what might be called the outer harbor or roadstead. Here the influence of the river current ceased, and she became, virtually, stationary.\n\n\"She seems very beautiful to me, uncle,\" said Mabel, whose gaze had not been averted from the cutter for a single moment while it had thus been changing its position; \"I daresay you can find faults in her appearance, and in the way she is managed; but to my ignorance both are perfect.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay; she drops down with a current well enough, girl, and so would a chip. But when you come to niceties, all old tar like myself has no need of spectacles to find fault.\"\n\n\"Well, Master Cap,\" put in the guide, who seldom heard anything to Jasper's prejudice without manifesting a disposition to interfere, \"I've heard old and experienced saltwater mariners confess that the Scud is as pretty a craft as floats. I know nothing of such matters myself; but one may have his own notions about a ship, even though they be wrong notions; and it would take more than one witness to persuade me Jasper does not keep his boat in good order.\"\n\n\"I do not say that the cutter is downright lubberly, Master Pathfinder; but she has faults, and great faults.\"\n\n\"And what are they, uncle? If he knew them, Jasper would be glad to mend them.\"\n\n\"What are they? Why, fifty; ay, for that matter a hundred. Very material and manifest faults.\"\n\n\"Do name them, sir, and Pathfinder will mention them to his friend.\"\n\n\"Name them! it is no easy matter to call off the stars, for the simple reason that they are so numerous. Name them, indeed! Why, my pretty niece, Miss Magnet, what do you think of that main-boom now? To my ignorant eyes, it is topped at least a foot too high; and then the pennant is foul; and\u2014and\u2014ay, d\u2014-me, if there isn't a topsail gasket adrift; and it wouldn't surprise me at all if there should be a round turn in that hawser, if the kedge were to be let go this instant. Faults indeed! No seaman could look at her a moment without seeing that she is as full of faults as a servant who has asked for his discharge.\"\n\n\"This may be very true, uncle, though I much question if Jasper knows of them. I do not think he would suffer these things, Pathfinder, if they were once pointed out to him.\"\n\n\"Let Jasper manage his own cutter, Mabel. His gift lies that-a-way, and I'll answer for it, no one can teach him how to keep the Scud out of the hands of the Frontenackers or their devilish Mingo friends. Who cares for round turns in kedges, and for hawsers that are topped too high, Master Cap, so long as the craft sails well, and keeps clear of the Frenchers? I will trust Jasper against all the seafarers of the coast, up here on the lakes; but I do not say he has any gift for the ocean, for there he has never been tried.\"\n\nCap smiled condescendingly, but he did not think it necessary to push his criticisms any further just as that moment. By this time the cutter had begun to drift at the mercy of the currents of the lake, her head turning in all directions, though slowly, and not in a way to attract particular attention. Just at this moment the jib was loosened and hoisted, and presently the canvas swelled towards the land, though no evidences of air were yet to be seen on the surface of the water. Slight, however, as was the impulsion, the light hull yielded; and in another minute the Scud was seen standing across the current of the river with a movement so easy and moderate as to be scarcely perceptible. When out of the stream, she struck an eddy and shot up towards the land, under the eminence where the fort stood, when Jasper dropped his kedge.\n\n\"Not lubberly done,\" muttered Cap in a sort of soliloquy,\u2014\"not over lubberly, though he should have put his helm a-starboard instead of a-port; for a vessel ought always to come-to with her head off shore, whether she is a league from the land or only a cable's length, since it has a careful look, and looks are something in this world.\"\n\n\"Jasper is a handy lad,\" suddenly observed Sergeant Dunham at his brother-in-law's elbow; \"and we place great reliance on his skill in our expeditions. But come, one and all, we have but half an hour more of daylight to embark in, and the boats will be ready for us by the time we are ready for them.\"\n\nOn this intimation the whole party separated, each to find those trifles which had not been shipped already. A few taps of the drum gave the necessary signal to the soldiers, and in a minute all were in motion.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 269, "api_path": "/songs/749884", "artist_names": "Genius Users", "full_title": "Genius Users Summer Playlist by\u00a0Genius\u00a0Users", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/be92085c3e5b4ba0e7ac256ba00a1ab0.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/be92085c3e5b4ba0e7ac256ba00a1ab0.999x1000x1.jpg", "id": 749884, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 6180006, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1666618513, "path": "/Genius-users-genius-users-summer-playlist-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 34, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-users-genius-users-summer-playlist-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/be92085c3e5b4ba0e7ac256ba00a1ab0.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/be92085c3e5b4ba0e7ac256ba00a1ab0.999x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 17384}, "title": "Genius Users Summer Playlist", "title_with_featured": "Genius Users Summer Playlist", "updated_by_human_at": 1666618513, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-users-genius-users-summer-playlist-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/226635", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/24d1831aec98c8a94b5006f4714dab59.1000x439x1.jpg", "id": 226635, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/572b51ce3c79ecabece7c4a976ba915f.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Genius Users", "slug": "Genius-users", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius-users"}, "artist": "Genius Users", "lyrics": "Genius Users Summer Playlist LyricsHgsCa\n\nDubbelquatrin om tennis\n\n---\n\nZenith9\n\nSummer 2016\nD.R.A.M ft Lil Yachty - Broccoli\nKano - T-shirt Weather in The Manor\nJamie xx ft Young Thug -  I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)\nBlood Orange - You're Not Good Enough\nFrancis and the Lights ft Bon Iver - Friends\nHONNE - Good Together\nThe Avalanches ft Danny Brown & MF DOOM - Frankie Sinatra\nDrake- Controlla\nFrank Ocean- Forrest Gump\nAnderson.

It may not be the most difficult challenge but it would be formidable. However, like any challenge I have faced it will be crushed.\n\nI\u2019ll have to learn new concepts that are at least new to me. I might be perplexed by the way the system functions. However, I have a general idea of how college will operate. I just don\u2019t have all the details. Will I like the professor? Will I not? I don\u2019t know much about it. I will have to find out.\nI know the expectations will be different than any typical high school. Also, some high schools are more challenging than college. I\u2019ll have to adapt to the new environment and change my study habits. College could also be easy. I don\u2019t know. I still have many questions and I\u2019ll assume that they will be answered. I guess it will be a new adventure. I still don\u2019t really know. It\u2019s just another step up.\n\nEven if I\u2019m entering strange territory, I\u2019m still confident; I\u2019ll see what they throw at me. I know that we can request are classes to be spread out and if this is the case it will be easier because of the extra time per class. Whether it\u2019s challenging or easy I\u2019ll finish it.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\n\u201cMy mama always used to tell me: \u2018If you can\u2019t find somethin\u2019 to live for, you best find somethin' to die for,\u201d \u2013 Tupac Shakur. My greatest influence is Tupac Shakur. His words have always resonated with me. I\u2019ve looked up to him since I was a young boy. I credit my father for introducing me to my greatest role model outside of my family.\n\u201cA coward dies a thousand times, a soldier dies but once.\u201d The best influence I gained from Mr. Shakur was to have a strong heart, will, and mind. With these things intact no way you can be deterred by anyone else. Letting someone break your down your heart to fight to can break your will. If you lose your will you can become weak minded and you need all three to survive. It\u2019s like he always said, \u201cIf you can make it through the night, there\u2019s a brighter day.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a natural-born leader. I know how to bow down to authority if it\u2019s authority that I respect.\u201d Another lesson I learned was to never give in to anyone and say what\u2019s on your mind. The first amendment is the right to freedom of speech. Shakur believed that we all should exercise this right. He also believed that no badge of authority is just given respect but, it is earned just as anyone else will have to earn it. \u201cSh*t, I like to think that at every opportunity I\u2019ve ever been threatened with resistance, it\u2019s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s in my veins to fight back.\u201d It was in his blood to fight back that\u2019s why he\u2019ll never bow down to just any authority.\n\n\u201cI see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin\u2019, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I\u2019m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it\u2019s time to make millions for myself; you know what I\u2019m saying. I made millions for the record companies; I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us\u201d here he says he worked and earned every penny he has and gained his respect along with it. Hard work gives you everything you deserve.Prompt: What makes you, you?\n\nMy life had many ups and downs, when I was a baby I was filled with smiles, laughed all the time, but that soon changed. I became an angry child or waterfalls of tears would run off may face during my child hood. Over time I learned to accept life, and then I learned to be happy. And I became a rosy cheek kid that tries to live an easy going life.\n\nwhen I was a kid with a face as red as a burring flame on the sun and sad, it all seem to be tied to how my life was going, my father was arrested and I could only see him for short times compared to when I spent entire days with him. I started living with people I barely knew but my mom new quite well, these people where called grandparents. And the things I always knew where changing for the rest of my life and it was a lot for a kid of four to take in and, caused pain for many years.\n\nLater in my life the streams if tears flowed so rapidly that soon I tried to make dams of rope at the line of the neck. My grandfather that I did not know as I child I learned to love like a second father had passed. So with the dames at a brake I knew it was time for a change. Whenever I would feel down I would search the ends of the earth to find the good in what is happening so that helped me learn how to except the negative thing that happen in my life. Once my grandfather passed who we depended on with most of our lives, poverty had soon come. We struggled to feed our self\u2019s and we ended up having to move to a house a third of the size of what we once had. With that I learned to enjoy a loaf of bread instead of wanting a five course meal.\n\nWith all the challenges that happened in my life I grew to a bigger, stronger, and better person. Through my whole life the warmth of a mother hug and the kiss from the heart a grandmother gives when times seem blue helped me adapt the love and care I try to share with others. In the past I was a heated person temper as strong as an ox. But there is only so much anger a person can handle in their life and over time I became to be where only the biggest things can makes my blood boil. After having a past of anger and people who said I was weird and a nut, I decided to let it roll off the cheek and became determined to still be that nut but be the best I can, I adapted determination from that point on.\n\nThrough the roller coaster of my life I\u2019ve lived hard painful times, with loss of love ones and massive changes. And I\u2019ve had good times as well with love and happiness. People would think on how I was as a child I would be this miserable adult but they were wrong. I am living proof that challenges as hard as they may come can make a better person. I was a dark souled being that changed into a great, loving and, caring person. Who is determined and fallows my dreams.Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life.\n\nSince we were born we were told how important college is, we were told that we should already know what we want to do, and what college we want to attend. Even though we really don\u2019t have any fore knowledge on what college really is, we are still expected to go. This, to me is the hardest transition anyone can face, making it the most important.\n\nFiguring out what you want to be when you grow up, we have been asked this question ever since the beginning of public school, kindergarten. Isn\u2019t it ridiculous? Asking a five year what he/she wants to do when she/he is 20. Back then we all were oblivious to how fast life really moves; we didn\u2019t know that outside of crayons and story time, there was a world waiting to be explored. Even though we had no idea where money comes from, or how a government works, we were still asked, \u201cwhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d Present day, that question triggers anxiety, and pent up confusion, because the answer isn\u2019t as simple as \u201crock star\u201d anymore, now you need a real answer.\n\nPeople say that high school is the best years of school you will ever have, because we can\u2019t go back to it. Make your friends now, keep up with your grades, join school clubs, and get a part time job, pay your dues, graduate. It\u2019s either now or never, go big or get a GED.\nBeing pressured into going to college is probably the worst thing that can happen to anyone, it isn\u2019t the 1960\u2019s anymore, and we have other options. With tuition rising and employment decreasing, graduating college and getting a job is harder than ever, not to mention student loans.\n\nThat\u2019s why I feel this transition is so important, it opens the eyes of our generation, and things aren\u2019t easy. We\u2019ve all been handed a crystal clear picture of going to college being the only thing we can do. Growing up happens fast, and this still goes for the lucky ones that already have an idea of what they want to do after high school. For us, graduation will be the strangest feeling, no more school, no more summer break, no more standardized tests, we will all be floating around in our cap and gown trying to grasp the fact that we are done. I think that\u2019s when you actually become an adult, because; isn\u2019t that what adulthood is? Just a bunch of kids trying to figure everything out. That\u2019s what makes this transition an important one, because it\u2019s the hardest one we will face.Prompt: Discuss some issue of personal, local, or national concern and its importance to you\n\nPolice Brutality is a national concern we need to put an end to. The people who are supposed to be protecting us are killing us! We the people must eliminate this racism and brutality in our police force. There is no time to waste action must be takin now.\nBrutality is not the way anyone should go. Our right as a citizen must be protected at all times. Nobody is above our rights or laws. Black minorities are the main people targeted by this threat. Most people would\u2019ve thought we\u2019ve move passed this racism. Equality is what needs to be seen in the eyes of not just officers but everyone.\n\nIn my own experience I\u2019ve seen white cops treat other races (Mainly Blacks) as if they were animals. We are no different than anyone else. Cops need to accept the fact that we are all the same on the inside. People are getting shot and killed for no reason. In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police.Prompt:  \u201cDescribe a Person who has Influenced Your Life- Grandpa\u201d\n\nAs the sun began to peak through the fine curtains, I clenched my eyes and inhale the sweet odor of homemade biscuits and smoky sausages specially made by my pleasurable grand-mama. My limps felt detached and strained but my stomach was roaring another tune, soon became in debate with worn-out body. I eased to the edge of the bed leisurely took a quick glance at the clock. I didn\u2019t bother reading the time though; I just know it was too early to hear that faint bussing outside. It was Saturday morning and the routine remained the same as always, I shimmied over to the one window facing the back yard already knowing what I was searching for, my grand-daddy.\n\nMy grand-daddy wore a plaid red and black shirt, faded blue jean overalls and some dusty old work boot to mow the lawn in the early morning as, he rode his lawn mower from side to side and every few seconds he would briefly slowed down to spit his burnt sienna colored chewing tobacco, wipe his mouth with a bright white handkerchief and continue his journey.\n\nMy grand-daddy is the chief of the Totten family. Born and raised in Yanceyville, North Carolina. He received only a 5th grade education and from there worked in the family business of farmers. He is the second youngest of four brothers and a sister. Out of all of his siblings except his sister he was the only one to ever go to school and come out with a work ethic of devotion.

The one person who has changed my life the most has to be both of my brother\u2019s for good and bad.\n\nMy brothers have had the most influence on me because I don\u2019t want to be anything like at all. They both have been in and out of jail not for anything big like rape or murder but for dumb things like weed. But it\u2019s not the fact that they went to jail that scary me and makes me not want to be anything like them but it the fact I seen everything that my mother has gone through because of brother\u2019s and that\u2019s what makes me want to be nothing like them fools.\n\nSo yea that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to be anything like my bothers they are good for nothing that just mess things up in my life and everyone else life there even messing up your life right now you don\u2019t even know it. But for real if anyone how had impacted my life it would be them for the fact that I don\u2019t want to be like them. But then you could look at it for another point of view and say they actually are good because of their massive mistake now I wound not make the same mistake they did.Topic: The Place That I Know Well\n\nTexas is the place that I know well. I have been to Texas lots of times in my life. Texas is a great place to be at. There are lots of things that you can do in Texas. It is a place that you ca have a great time and also relaxes. It is the place that I know bather than anything else in the world.\n\nTexas is where most of the things happen. You can feel the heat thrower your skin as you get closer to Texas. You can see lots of different things happening at the same time. Lots of cars passing by you as you go thrower the highway. There are lots of restaurant where you can eat at. You can small the different foods once you go inside the restaurant. Texas is as big as the United States.\n\nEvery time I go to Texas I just can just relaxes all day. I feel happy every time I go there. It is the place that can make you feel safe at all times. It is where I can see lots of things that can make you feel happy. For example every time I go to the beach I have a great time there. Also when I go to see family members and have a great time with them.Prompt: If you offered the role of the villain or the hero in a movie, which role would you accept and why?\n\nHere come Jaeblast!! As the crowd would scream as I enter a nearby metropolis to save the day from evil. The role of a super hero is one role I would consider a choice of picking. Having superpower would be insane for me to decline that role because I would see myself as a protagonist and I believe I\u2019m a good person by heart and soul.\n\nI believe in superhero\u2019s since the day I could open my eyes. As the year passed my inspiration for the famous superhero Flash has grown over time. Flash has been Favorable to me due to the fact that he was a scientist in his own field in which I\u2019m going to college to study/Major in. Whenever I see or watch Flash I think of myself in a scientific/energetic way of thinking. The flash was a scientist before he was even notice as a hero of the comic books.Prompt: \u201cAdvice you can give to students just starting their high school career\u201d\n\nThere are many advantages of going to high school and staying there for the full time that you should be there. At the same time there are many pitfalls and students can become confuse by the many decisions that we are forced to make. In most cases high school students want to make the best decisions about their future, and so it is important to learn of the various resources available to help make the right decisions as they will make an impact on life after high school.\nThere are many advantages of going to high school. High school will provide you with many opportunities that will help to develop life-long skills such as learning, social and mental development. High school helped me to lay down foundations for growth and development so that I can become a productive and good member of the community. The knowledge presented in high school can help build the necessary foundations for a career you may be interested in. Students can learn various subjects such as business, health, sciences, trades, skills and technology, all of which can be apply to knowledge needed for careers in these fields or other fields. Experiences in high school can also provide you with opportunities for career development. In high school students can meet partners in business, science, technology and other fields and they can learn about these careers and professions from experts in the field. In some high schools, experts come in on career day and talk to the students about the various careers and professions. I always love when they come in. These events can also help students to decide what careers they want to get into when the leave high school.\n\nAnother benefit is that going to high school helps students to build relationships with people such as teachers and other professionals in the fields already. When these professionals come in on career day, students can build professional relationships. You can get the experts as mentors and preceptors in the field. In high school you will also build relationships with each other and agree to go to college together. For me, I have very few friends that I can continue to be friendly with and hopefully go to college with. Some students would go to the same college and enter into the same or similar fields and in doing so long lasting friendly and work career relationships can be created. Another advantage in attending high school is that you get to learn about new methods and new technology in the workplace so that they can be more prepared when they leave school.\n\nThere are many resources in high schools that with help benefit students. High school will prepare students to make better decisions about careers and about colleges where they can advance and go into careers, or further studies that they may want to do. Sometimes, I am not sure what job or profession I want to do after I leave school. The guidance counselors in high school will hopefully help to guide and direct my career paths. Resources such as libraries, career centers, and academies like science academy or technology academy can help me to learn about these specific fields. Schools have resources such as the internet that I can use to learn more about colleges and careers. There are also many resources such as books, brochures and pamphlets that will tell me about careers and colleges.\n\nWhile there are many advantages of going to high school and many resources to guide you, there are just as many pitfalls that can be misleading and dangerous. The large amounts of decisions that confront students can be overwhelming. Students may find pressure to make decisions and may rush into making decisions that they are not comfortable making. You might also rush and make decisions to please your parents. Sometimes I feel like I am being rushed by my mother to make a decision, but I have to remind her that I need to make my mind up. Another pitfall is that students could just be following their friends. Peer pressure could push students to make the wrong decisions for college, or peer pressure may force students to drop out of school. In high school you cannot cave into peer pressure. I had to make a personal decision for myself. High school students must be strong and make decisions best for themselves and their families. Another pitfall in high school is that students may become overwhelm by the many resources offered in school and that may result in the student not making the best and most timely decision.\n\nTo help with the pitfall that may occur in high school, I need to remain positive and seek the resources that will help me to do well and stay in school. Students should go to school and learn the school work. You should also do your homework and ask for help when needed. Students should go to their guidance counselors, or their teachers for additional help when necessary. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable asking for help. You need learn important skills like asking for help, talking with the teachers, being responsible and respecting to the teachers. These simple skills can help you to stay in school, do assignments and home work so you can get good grades, a good grade point average and meet all graduation requirements.\n\nYou should stay in school, so that you can graduate with good grades and then go on to further your education. Failure to remain in high school will result in poor grades, poor skills. If this happens, you will not get good grades, skills or knowledge that will help you to become a good person in the community. Therefore it is important to stay in school, use the resources, avoid the pitfalls and make the best decisions to stay in school.Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has special meaning to you.\n\nGoing to a different elementary school s every year or every other year wasn\u2019t always easy. Living with that transition as a kid wasn\u2019t easy at all to make friends. Events like birthday parties and having people over were always difficult to set up because I didn\u2019t really have a group of base friends that I grew up with. Plus my parents are the type that they have to meet the others kids\u2019 parents for me to even come to a sleepover.\n\nImagine being eight years old , walking into a new elementary school , not knowing a face in the school with butterflies in your stomach wondering how it\u2019s all going to turnout . That was me at least four different times back in my elementary days. I would say the hardest task was to try and fit in. Every day was a new challenge to face because everyone knew each other and it was like I was the only crumbled cookie in a fresh new pack of opened Oreos. My teacher did try and make it better by doing all the introductions and trying to fit me in but I was still the odd ball in the pack. Plus as a kid was very timid, some would say anti-social, so that definitely didn\u2019t help me. Honestly sometimes I even tried not to make friends because I knew I was going to end up moving.Prompt: Greatest challenge I have ever faced\n\nMoving away from the place I was raised in and lived the most of my life was very hard for me and my family. It was scary, but at the same time it\u2019s exciting to explore the new beginning of our life. My mind was thinking that if I move away from all my loved one and friends, I won\u2019t be able to see them again and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to make any new friends in United States.\n\nAfter living in the Philippines for almostPrompt: \u201cDiscuss what makes you uniquely qualified for college\u201d\n\nCollege is the next essential step; it is also the most talked about after you finish high school. The reason college is known for being so hard is because high school graduates don\u2019t really know what they want to be. People their age rarely know what they want to be. Myself I have spent countless hours discovering what I would like to accomplish. Anyone can say they want to do something; it takes some drive and execution to pursue something you enjoy. There are many cases where I could have quit and people would have loved to see me fail. At the end of all that I just had to remember why I was doing it, and was it worth fighting for. To prove them wrong I work hard for whatever it took a months or years. I just had to stay determined and put all my essential qualities to use.\n\nHigh School is a rough time for some students. Students are figuring out what they want to become and finding out who they are. 50% \u2013 70% of students change their majors at least once; most will change majors at least 3 times before they graduate. Not only knowing what you want to do is important, finding out whom you are necessary as well. Why is this important as a college student? Many students when they get to college don\u2019t have the hard work and will power to continue. Students don\u2019t know what works for them to be successful. I have spent many methods on how to plan and make myself successful.\n\nSomeone once told me that they\u2019re a difference between listening and learning. Anyone can listen but only some can learn. It is the same concept on having idea/dream, and someone who peruses their aspirations. I had teachers before that told me that \u201cYou would not go anywhere\u201d. The only thing the teachers didn\u2019t know was I did not take their \u201cadvice\u201d into consideration. I kept myself from going the wrong way. The steps I took were I did all I could do, and if I was failing behind I made up the work. I continuing doing well and showed my teachers wrong. I could have quit and not cared but I was motivated because I had a goal to achieve.\n\nHard work over weights anything I notice that hard work is like practice. Everyone knows the saying that \u201cPractice makes perfect\u201d. No matter how bad you are at something the amount of time I\u2019ve practice takes an effect. I have put so much hard work into school. That I\u2019m ready for a new challenge college is that next step. I have prepared my whole life to get this opportunity. With all the knowledge I have learn from preparing and my high school practice college I am ready for college.\n\nWith all the things I have learned during my school years and my life lessons. I have learn a lot of new thing and will look forward to learning new things in college.Prompt: \u201cDescribe an important transition in your life\u201d\n\nIt was my first year of high school. I was excited and nervous at the same time I was excited because it was a new beginning for me. It what significant to me because it was a big change for me. I was going from middle school to high school.\n\nThe alarm goes off it is now 5:00 a.m. it is time for me to get ready for school. I get off my bed and go brush my teeth then go into in to the shower. The water was freezing cold. When I got out the shower I rushed to my room and start getting ready. The time flew by so quickly. I got ready on time. I had few minutes before I had to go to the bus stop. I ate some cereal before leaving. Once, I left to bus stop I was walking with my sister. I arrived at the bus stop it was near the road where the cars were passing. The wind was blowing in my face because of the cars racing in the road. I could see the red lights flashing on the bus. The bus is getting near I start shaking and my hands are getting sweaty. I get on the bus and it feels as if I was walking into an oven it was hot.\n\nFurthermore, we are getting near the school and I get afraid. I don\u2019t know what is it like to be in high school and it will be a new experience for me. We finally arrive at school. There are many buses there also. Suddenly, they yell out \u201cunload\u201d when they say that it means to open the door and let us out of the bus. Everyone starts rushing off the bus and I am patiently waiting for my turn. I get off the bus and start walking into the school. I walk in the school and there are lots of people. I am squeezing in between the crowd. I finally walk through everyone and it is time to look for my classes. I think to myself I don\u2019t know where my classes are the good thing is that there were teachers in mostly each corner. I got to all my classes. I would look around to see if I had any friends in that class. Luckily, I had at least one friend in each class. I just wanted the day to be over as soon as possible. The thing that got me nervous was that my sister would always tell me, \u201chigh school is not easy.\u201d The first day isn\u2019t that bad because the only thing we do is get informed of what we will expect and our expectations and what we will learn during the year.\n\nAdditionally, for me the transition from middle school to high school was a big change for me. The reason being is because I was already getting use to walking up later like around 7:00 a.m. Then, the following year having to wake up at 5:00 a.m. was a change. I had to get use to waking up at that time. It was hard because the first days I would wake up at the right time then, I would go back to sleep. I missed the bus a few times. I managed to get over that with time. The only thing I didn\u2019t like is that I had seven classes. The other thing was that the classes were very apart from each other. For example, I had to walk from one building to another one in five minutes. Overall, I liked all my classes. For me high school was easy as long as I did my work. They start getting us ready for college.Prompt: \u201cDiscuss the greatest challenge you have face or expect to face\u201d\n\nChallenge? What is a challenge? It\u2019s something that you have to accomplish or something you have to face. Well everyone has challenges. Small ones, big ones but I never thought I would face the biggest one ever. That is my dad death. I had no idea it was going to happen that fast. So that\u2019s the biggest challenge I have to face in my life. It was so unexpected I have to face. My life has change since that day.\n\nIt began on June 30, 2014 that afternoon. I was hanging out with my friend Stefany. It was a great day. She left to go home. I went inside to my room. Then my mom got a call from my aunt. She told her that my dad had passed away. She came to my room. She told me and my sister that my dad has passed away. When I heard the bad news tears where rolling down my face. I had to call my older brother to tell him the news. He answers and when I told him. He was like your lying I\u2019m like no I\u2019m not. It was grandma all over. We went to see him in the hospital. It was the hardest thing I have to face to see. I almost fell to the ground and one of my aunts caught me. All the family was full of sadness and we couldn\u2019t accept it. Later on that week it was his funeral. It was on Wednesday July 2, 2014. In the memorial service we were crying our tears out. When my family saw him it was horrible that we have to see him like that. During the service the ladies sung this song call \u201cYo Te Extranare\u201d which it means I\u2019ll miss you. That song is a dialogue of me and my dad talking. Every time listen to that song I always cry and be in pain, because it reminds me of him. Ever since the funeral nothing would make be happy.\n\nOn that Saturday that week. We had this church event which took place in the park that my dad would always take me. That was also the park behind where my grandma and dad work. That day memories just came to me and tears came out too. So I walk around and cry my eyes out. When I was walking around. My mom was telling the people from church that my dad died that week. And she also told them that I was the most effected about it. Anyways ever since my dad passed away my life change a lot. All my friends ask me how you can live life still without your dad. I\u2019m like I just don\u2019t think about as much. Ever since then I haven\u2019t been the same girl that I used to be. My religious beliefs change and so has my personalities. I\u2019ve suffering for my dad death and for something else I can\u2019t say. Every time I\u2019m going somewhere. Something always reminds me of him and my memories come back. Oh also when I go to my grandpa house. I always think my dad is going to be there even though I should know he\u2019s not there. I just can\u2019t accept that he\u2019s gone. My family and my friends say \u201cIt\u2019s okay [...] your dad is now in peace and not suffering\u201d. I\u2019m like \u201cNo now I\u2019m the one suffering \u201c. I wanted him to see me graduate and see I made it. He saw my brother graduate and now he won\u2019t see me. He would always tell me when he was here. \u201cYa me voy a morir\u201d Which means I\u2019m going to die. I hated that he would always say that. I would tell him \u201cPa no tengas eso\u201d which means \u201cDad don\u2019t say that\u201d. So my life has complete became a suffering life.\nAs can be seen life is so short. I want to live my life. Since my dad is no longer here I want him to know I\u2019m doing everything so I would be successful. I want to become a writer, singer, and also an actress. He\u2019s the only person that supported me on what I wanted to do with my life. So when I become one of those dreams of mine. I own it all to my dad. He made me what I am now and I want to accomplish everything I need to do. Now I\u2019m not suffering as much for his death because I know he\u2019s not suffering. And soon I would be with him. So this was the greatest challenge I have to face and still facing.Prompt: What are the three specific things you plan to do in Florida?\n\nThe three specific things I plan to do at Florida is focusing on class, basketball, and wanting on to become a more responsible person. I want to build the best educate for me. Be known as one of the best student \u2013athlete who came to Florida State. To be known to teachers on my skills of focus. To be remember as an elite player that played the game. To be one of the best player on and off the court.\n\nMy focus is coming to Florida with a good mindset. My study habits would be up to par while in the hot steaming room with no A/C. my sweat would fall off my forehead like bullet shells. As I try to write a perfect paper. As I am proof reading the paper for the professor to receive the fulfilling grade of success.\n\nAs I\u2019m done with my work for class I head to the gym with coach and the guys. As we practice on our plays for the games. While me and the team breathe hard with exhaustion. The coaches would let us take a break and drink a cold bottle of Gatorade. While we drink and take a break we discussed about getting the sunny beach college sate a championship.\n\nAs we end practice I\u2019ll go off campus to go work and find a way to stay productive. To stay on the right path and let others go on the wrong. As I drive on the smooth road with the bright glowing sun hits my face. I would go out to find a job and make some more money to pay for books and food to live on. Then after work I\u2019ll go to the donation and give the clothes that I don\u2019t wear any more. I would clean up the streets of Florida to help the community out with a place to claim for good and clean areas.Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to you.\n\nMany people have achieved different things in their lives. Some have achieved to get scholarships. Other where able to go pro in a sport they loved. There are a lot of achievements that people have been able to accomplish. A significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to me is when I made it to Varsity Cross-Country.\n\nThe first time that I joined Cross-Country I saw that there were many good runners. That inspired me to try to be the best runner for the team. I attended practice every day and gave it all I had. But one of my biggest obstacles that was stopping me from being the best was my knee pain. My knee pain was really bad and that was slowing me down big time. Therefore my sophomore season wasn\u2019t the best; I wasn\u2019t able to become the best runner for Berkmar.\n\nAfter I did therapy for my knee and I relaxed my joins I went back to running. But this time I did something different that I dint do the first time, I went to summer conditioning. Summer conditioning helped me out big time to become better and achieve my goal. I ran all summer long with the team; luckily I wasn\u2019t having any knee pain. After summer conditioning finished our Cross-Country season started again. I was determined to achieve my goal that year. Two weeks into the season and we had our first race of the year. After getting an 18:29 for a 3.1 mile race I knew I was on track to achieving my goal. I kept working hard to get even better and by the time you know it I was top varsity for Berkmar High School. I finished that year with my best time of 17:52.\n\nThis year I am setting a new goal. That goal is to beat my personal record that I set last year. I\u2019m going to put even more work in and I\u2019m going to try more hard to achieve that goal. I know that I focus on my goal I\u2019ll be able to reach it. The goal I am setting for this season it to run a 17:00 flat or less if possible.\n\nMy main goal that I had was been to become a varsity runner. That goal has been accomplished, now I have to set new goals so I can keep making accomplishments in life. A new goal I have is to beat my personal record of 17:52 and hopefully get a Cross-Country scholarship. Overall the achievement that has a special meaning to me is the fact I was able to become varsity for Berkmar High School.Prompt: \u201dEvaluate a significant experience or achievement that that has special meaning to you.\u201d\n\nOne of the greatest achievements is to graduate and fulfill all the dreams and goals that I have set for myself. This world is full of people that had set goals, and dreams but never did anything to make them come true. I don\u2019t want to be one more of those people that don\u2019t do anything to not make them; I will do whatever it takes just to make it happen. I want these not only for myself but I part for my family. They have been there sense day one and I appreciate all their support.\n\nWhy do I say that I don\u2019t only want it for me but for my family? Because, my family has been there for me without thinking about it twice, they have had my back, no matter what they will always be there. They push me to do my very best all the time, and tell me every time that I should never stop fighting for what I want, if I want it to go for it. Even when the get too pushy and very stressful I know they don\u2019t do it to frustrate me they do it because they care and want me to do good in life and even though I feel like they pressure me sometimes I know it\u2019s because they care.\n\nBy me graduating and entering college, would be the best achievement ever not only because I prove myself that I could do but because I would be making my mom prude, and for all of those people that didn\u2019t have faith in me or never believe that I could have done it. I want to give the best I have and be successful. My mother is one thing that push me the most to do good, and I want to make her proud and show her that I can do it, and by that I will be giving her back a little out of all that she has gave me.\n\nThat is the main achievement that I have in mind, the one that is going to take me far in life the one that I\u2019m going to be proud to say that I made it and that I did it all by myself, with hard effort but I made it. Everybody is born with a purpose in life, I know mine. Now the only thing I have left is to get to it and do anything it takes to get it done.Think of a place you know well. Describe the place and include feelings about it.\n\nHave you ever wanted to go back in time, and visit that one place that brings a smile to your face? Meanwhile that exact place is so far from your reach, and on the other hand it\u2019s extremely close to your heart. When I think of that place I only imagine Guatemala. There are three areas in Guatemala that I enjoy tremendously which are in some ways very different and similar at the same time.\nVenecia, Guatemala is one of these areas that I adore to stay at. Primarily I\u2019m fondled at the fact that my mom was born around this district. Also her parents and my grandparents still live there to this day. Every time I go spend time over there I fancy walking through the high stalks of green corn and getting lost for hours with my little cousin Yasmin. Another thing I\u2019m delighted by is the morning breeze hugging my skin so tight that goose bumps appear throughout by body. Evenings were even better; my grandmother would stir up a cup of coco for my sister and me and included bread on the side to make the experience even more outstanding. I won\u2019t ever forget the time when my sister and I put ten baby chicks in a circle and surrounded them with something. After a few seconds we would lift that something and the chicks would run in every direction. The place was to collect each one of the chicks until we got ten again. This specific moment made me feel butterflies and fireworks inside my tummy. Every single time I go to visit the moment is extremely pleasant and unforgettable. My heart speeds up every time I am able to go to Guatemala.\n\nAnother place I\u2019m exited in Guatemala to spend time at is chela. Chela is located near the city. It\u2019s three hours from the city but a hot sweaty three hours in the car. My mom\u2019s little brother Rudy lives there in a two story home. I love going there because I get to share moments with my baby cousin. I remember once my brother, sister and I went to a water park like thirty minutes away. My eyes almost popped out of my head once I saw the price of each ticket. Each one of us had to pay one hundred quetzals, which is the name of the currency in Guatemala. In U.S currency it would vary from fourteen to fifteen dollars. The money didn\u2019t really bother me at the end of the day. I saw huge slide with people shouting and screaming. The one ride that is unforgettable to me was the one where all three of us got into one float and were pushed in a giant swirling slide and we at got wet and at the end of the slide was a pool where we fell into. My heart was racing the entire time we were there. After the water park we headed back to my uncle\u2019s house where we ate a fish that was whole and looking at me. This started to make my stomach to move from the smile on my face. After a few weeks my other grandparents, my dad\u2019s parents came to pick my sister and I up to go stay with them until the day we had to come back to Georgia.\n\nMy father\u2019s parents live the closest to the city. Its one and a half hours away. The interesting part of Chimaltenango, Guatemala is that it\u2019s always mid-warm there and I love the sun beating against my skin. I adore helping out in my grandfather\u2019s store where he basically sells everybody\u2019s needs. The benefit of being his granddaughter was that I basically owned his store as well. What I mean by that was I could take anything and pig out on whatever I craved. Luckily that wasn\u2019t the only thing to do at their house. At times I would help my grandma water all her crops such as bananas,plantans,mangosPrompt: A person that who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nThey say \u2018Never Judge A book by Its Cover \u201c, but why does everyone still judge me because of the carrier I want to take or the job I would love to have. People are always telling me what to do and what is best for me, but I don\u2019t want what happen to my cousin happening to me. I really want to be a doctor\u2019s assistants and I will be because I have the skills for it.\n\nMy cousin always wanted to travel the world, but her parents never let her do what she wanted to do with her life, since they were the ones who were paying her college and her books. People and family members would always judge her because they thought she would never get to that level since most of us were poor. She knew that one day she was going to be traveling to many countries, and luckily the United States government sent a letter to her school asking for a voluntary helper to go to out the country and help others. When everyone doubt it her, she always believed in herself.\n\nFrom the time I was able to realize that the U.C (University Of California) was the best for me and my future, I decide to do my research on it.2nd PeriodPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nThrough out the good and the bad and the ugly she has been there. When i was sick feeling like i was on my death bed,she was there. When i just plainly need someone to talk to or a friend she was always there. That person is my mom. My mother has made the greatest influence on my life out of everyone i have know to this day. Throughout all the struggle she, me and my family as a whole she has been there and she was the one to keep it all together and kept a smile on her face even when she felt like she could just leave ,she stayed and fought through it all. She was my mother.\n\nMy moms name is Yezzet Lewis Thomas. She is a Licensed Practical Nurses or LPN and she is working on her RN degree (Registered Nurses). Born in France moved to the United States when she was 2 and has 9 brothers and sisters her family was a military family with her dad serving in the military. One reason i chose her to be my biggest influence on me is the fact she was always there for me. when i was younger from Elementary to Middle school I had a really hard time making friends and had lots of issues with me being bullied and my constant stutter did not make it any better from my point of view, It just gave others more ammo to fire at me day after day and i struggled with life. But i always knew i could come home and wait to 8 o'clock the time she gets off of work and just talk to her about it like she was my best friend. She was always on my side and when i needed stuff done school wise she would stay up late to help me even if she had to go back to work at 6 in the AM.Describe an important transition in your life.\n\nMy name was not called to participate in the 2014-2015 Peachtree Ridge, three day soccer tryouts. The coach said, \u201cwe do not have your physical on file\u201d, but yet I turned mine in to the lady soccer adviser and she said she will put it in the day I gave it to her a week before. The JV coach told me to ask Coach Sutton, the Varsity coach, to see if I can still tryout. When I walked over to him, and informed him on the situation, he looked me up and down looking at how I was dressed, I am new to the soccer world so I had some; black vans, shorts and two hoodies on, that day was the day it started to snow, and he said, \u201cwell if it is not on file then I will not let you tryout.\u201d I was outside for hours just practicing in the cold after school, from 2:10 to 5:00.\nBeing told in front of the whole soccer team and new comers, that you can\u2019t tryout, is embarrassing, and it really hurts you. I knew I turned in my Physical Form but they \u201cdid not have it\u201d. Later on that day of the tryouts, my mom emailed Coach Sutton, and informed him that I did turn it in to the Soccer Lady. So the Coach replies saying that I am able to come to the second day tryout and I will be evaluated closely during the tryout. I told my mom no, I will not go to the tryout because I will feel the pressure and know they are watching me closely, I also did not want not meet their standers and still not make the team. Plus, I did not have much experience to the game of soccer, so I thought it would be best of me to not go and work on my skills for the game till next year.\n\nSo from the day after the second tryout, I was practicing soccer left and right, outside working on ball control, my touches, juggling, and at parks working on my shooting. I have improved a lot from the tryouts. I am glad that I decided to go off and improve my skills, I am more confident to tryout now, but still will be nervous and feel the pressure. I moved schools my last year of high school, to Berkmar High school and I am trying out this year, I will be attending Conditioning, did not do it at Peachtree Ridge, but I will now. Seniors have to try out for Varsity and juniors too and then sophomores and freshman have to try out for JV. So I will be preparing myself for Varsity tryouts, and the Varsity Coach, is also my Psychology teacher. He knows I am trying out for soccer and has been informing me the updates on soccer. I got my physical done and now I am just getting myself ready for conditioning.\n\nMy future career goals with soccer, is to make it to an MLS (Major League Soccer) Team. MLS is only teams held in The United States, so American Teams. I have a few teams in mind, for example; Orlando FC, New York City, New York City Red Bulls and LA Galaxy. In 2017, Georgia will have their own MLS team, I would like to try them out first.\n\nSo ever since that day after tryouts, I have opened my mind to soccer, learned more about soccer and would to take it up a notch in my life. I may not be much good but all I can do from then and to the future is practice.Prompt: Discuss What Makes You Uniquely qualified for This Position\n\nNot everyone is qualified for every job or career. I know I have the potential to be a police officer. Wearing the blue is not the easiest or most popular position right now but I am motivated to do it. Having the dream is the first step to a goal. However, having certain capabilities is also key to success in performing specific tasks. I am very perceptive so I can notice elements that are out of the ordinary that may disrupt society and I also possess a sense of justice to act out this role. I can see myself right now in the uniform and looking out across the street.\nPerception is a necessary skill for all law enforcement. Without it, criminals would continue to wreak havoc and no one will be any the wiser. If a situation seems off, I will notice. I know the symptoms of being under the influence of hard drugs: drowsiness, hyperactivity, sweating, irritability, paranoia. Liars will not fool me either. I will note the delay and uncertainty in a person\u2019s response and the many gestures that accompany deceit. Then I will politely ask for the truth. There is another sense that is required for this position.\n\nA sense of justice is a key component to upholding the law. The privilege of safeguarding other people can corrupt. Many act as if they are the rulers of the land but I would consider myself a servant of society. Abusing power is unthinkable to me. There are government workers who accept bribes and practice favoritism. I would treat all citizens as equals, not favoring the rich, a gender, or any particular ethnicity. This country is founded on principles of equality and should be enforced by only the fair-minded.\n\nProfessions require a certain set of skills. Applicants that want to be police officers are weeded out first for the incapable. I have astute skills to notice illegal and abnormal activities and I also have a clear sense of justice. I know I will pass the training and perform well in the field. In the not too distant future, I will assist in keeping the country, the city, the people in uniform.Prompt: ?\nI was born in Guatemala. When I was about five years old my mother contacted some people and I\u2019ve lived in Georgia ever since. Growing up was a real struggle. Bills were paid late, sometimes there was no dinner for me and my siblings, and eventually we would relocate to a different apartment. This happened several times until money was no longer an issue and we moved into a humble house.\nMy brother had it the worst out of the three kids my mom had. There was always the language barrier, but he was lucky since the school actually bumped him up a grade. Even with all the stress he managed to graduate. My sister was a total different story, however. Greilyn was always involved in extracurricular activities, and throughout her high school years she had at least one Advanced Placement class. She would juggle sleep, homework, sports, and after school clubs all at once. She wasn\u2019t able to attend college because she didn\u2019t have legal papers at that time. My brother, my sister and I were able to get a worker\u2019s permit two years ago and my sister and brother were able to get a stable job. Both Heber and Greilyn moved to Florida, my brother with his wife and my sister with her husband.\n\nFamily problems arose back at home. When I was in seventh grade I started to miss a lot of days in school. Some teachers told me I wouldn\u2019t get anywhere in life and that\u2019s where I stopped caring about anything that had to deal with school. This was when life knocked the teeth straight out of my mouth. I would have mental breakdowns time after time. In the 10th grade, I barely passed the first semester and I failed four classes the second. When I got to my junior year in high school I realized how important school really was and I made a life plan to become a mechanical engineer.\nI moved to Florida with my sister for the first semester of 11th grade and that\u2019s where I recovered my lost credits. I went from taking advanced classes to standard classes in less than a year. I didn\u2019t give up there and I\u2019m still here standing. I know my story is merely one of thousands, but nothing would mean more to me than being the first in my family to go to college and prove to myself that I am no failure. I have always believed that one cannot get back up if they have never fallen. I\u2019m grabbing life by the horns and taming the raging beast. This is only the beginning, for one day I will also prove the world, and those who doubted me, that I [...] am a successful college graduate.As the window bust from the hard wind I Can feel the the heat rise as the flames spread extremely rapidly from the garage to the living room. The flames started in the garage it was caused by the wires in the walls the Fire department said it was an electrical fire. I can remember the harsh smell of wood burning that made my stomach ache. The heat of the fire felt liked when you open the oven after a long time of preheating. One of My Greatest challenges that I faces was my house burning to the ground in the spring of 2007. This experience Changed my life completely it showed me things about family and friends, Showed me to Value things more, but it also made life harder.\nIt was 11:48Pm on a Wednesday night everybody was asleep except my brother he was up watching TV when he notice a burning smell coming from down stairs, he rushed to see where it was coming from when he notice the garage was in flames, He run upstairs panicking to wake everybody up. Once he thought everybody was up the flames was already spreading more and more. As we try and put on our shoes we hear window bursting one by one. We all rushed towards the front door were you could barely see anything because the house was filled with black smoke, as I inhaled the smoke I remember getting lite headed jumping out the fire. Then once everybody was out we notice my baby brother didn\u2019t make it out. The fire man said it was too risky for anybody to go back in the house, even the fire marshal gave up on him. My older brother wasn\u2019t going for it he broke loose from the fire man and ran fast thru the back yard to the back door and up the stairs as he heard my brother scream for help. He yells to my brother to just roll down the stairs. He rolls down the stairs and he and my baby brother jumped out the house together as soon as they jumped out the whole entire house collapse. My brother had 3rd degree burns in many places. They Fire department called him a miracle because they never seen somebody make it out a house like that. My family lost everything, 5 dogs all our clothes shoes furniture and pictures everything. At the end of the night we were placed in a hotel for those whom didn\u2019t have a house. We stayed in a hotel for about 2 months until we finally moved back to Chicago for 2 months to stay with my grandma.\n\nAfter the fire everything was different crying myself to sleep every night waking up in tears having nightmares of that night, I felt like I was reliving it all over again night by night, Not going to school every day because we had no clothes or shoes. When my house burnt down I left my best friend she stayed in that neighborhood she was the only person to know and understand. At that time I didn\u2019t care about school at all. Going to school and people asking about was the worst. People making fun of me because I didn\u2019t have a house I hated school just because of that. Nobody could understand what I was going thru at a young age. Moving from hotel to hotel school to school I went to 5 different elementary schools a different school every year. Having to make new friends every year was hard being insecure of my situation to tell people was the hardest. I used to go to school just to go not even caring about it. Until my 5th grade year and I meet this teacher who was so cooled and I could talk to her bout everything and she made me realize school is what I need. She taught me I can just write my hurt and my problems out with poetry or just start writing when I\u2019m upset.\n\nAs time moved on things started getting better, we started getting our life back together. Started building a home back together getting everything back to normal, even though it was hard and we struggled but my mom always managed to get it done. We noticed family wasn\u2019t always there for you when you need them. It was us by ourselves against everything all the problems with no help, even my mom mother wasn\u2019t there after time went back. It showed us life can be gone in a blink of an eye. After that it made us stronger and closer as a family. It made us strive harder to get everything we wanted and once had because we lost it all in one night. It showed me that I need an education to be successful in order to get everything I want.Prompt: The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?\n\nHigh school is a great stepping ground for young adults to experience responsibility, freedom and to prepare themselves for college and the work field. Everyone makes mistakes but it\u2019s up to you to correct them and better the situation.\n\nHaving responsibilities is a huge thing to have. You always have to stay focused and on top of things. My freshmen year in high school I failed second semester Biology. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to be able to make it up so that I could still graduate on time and have a good college look at me. I went to my counselor to ask her about any programs that the school offered for kids that failed classes. She offered me a chance to do a afterschool program called Credit Recovery. The program was $100 for two weeks and class was 3 hours long. Having to do Credit Recovery for those two weeks I still had to say on top of doing my classwork for school and working. Me failing Biology set me back but also made me realize how much school Is important to me and just how badly I wanted stay focused and do the right thing.\n\nFreedom can help or set you back in life, it\u2019s up to you to keep everything in order and to still do what you\u2019re supposed to do. For example wanting to go out with your friends, instead of studying for a quiz. I honestly thinkPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nFrom a young age my grandparents were always on my butt to go in a straight line, to stay focus, and to never do something I would regret in the future. My grandparents always had a huge influence in my life. To this day I can never be any more grateful to have them. The example they set is the example I want to set to the lower classmen.\n\nFrom 5 in the morning to 6 afternoons, Monday thru Friday they would come with tiredness written all over their face. Just knowing they\u2019re busting their butts just so I can go to school and knowing I don\u2019t have to worry about anything. Because of them I want to strive for success, I want to be someone with a doctor\u2019s degree or a business degree, just something that they could be proud of. I was given an opportunity that wasn\u2019t given to my grandparents and that was an education.\n\nI\u2019ve face situations where dropping out was the easy way out, but why quit when I\u2019m so close to getting a diploma, why quit on something my grandparents would be so happy about, why let them down, why not graduate so they can tell their friends and family that they raised a successful kid, a kid that didn\u2019t give up. My grandparents would tell me \u201c if you want to be successful go for it, we would be by your side; nothing stopping you from being someone important in life.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s my senior year and its crazy to think that I made it this far, I\u2019m the only one in my family that\u2019s about to graduate, I\u2019m breaking a curse that\u2019s been in my family for generations. My grandparents are the reason for me to finish my education. Every day I would get lectured about what kind of life I would have if I don\u2019t finish high school, I don\u2019t want to be behind a lawn mower working 11 hours a day in the heat. Having an education open so many doors for different opportunities in the future.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face\n\nEveryone has a challenge that they expect to face. My greatest challenge that I expect to face is going to college and being successful in the future. Those are my greatest challenge because it is not going to be easy. I am going to have to put a lot of effort and not mess up. Once you mess up it is very hard to get back up, and since it is about your future than it is very important to not make that mistake.\n\nIt is not going to be easy because colleges do not just accept anybody. They require much information such as the SAT or the ACT. Which are a test that every college requires, and you have to meet the average point or above. Also a certain point of GPA and above, resume and other important requirements. College is the real thing, it is more freedom and that is where you already know what you want to do in life. You have your mind set on your career and at that moment you already know what you should do and expect to do.\n\nTo be successful in my future I have to do something I enjoy doing and that gets me good money for it. I want to do entrepreneur, because I want to have my own business. I do not like it when people boss me around. Therefor if I study entrepreneur I would be the one bossing people around and they would work for me. I enjoy that because it something I like to do and I have always wanted to have my own business. In college I want to study entrepreneur, but it would not be easy. Even though it would not be easy I would not give up, it would be a great challenge for me.\n\nCollege is the time to get your things together and start working extra hard. It is not going to be easy but one should not give up. It would be extremely stressful and hard but that is just how college is. I am the type of person that gets distracted easily so I paying attention in college with no distractions would be a challenge. I would have to set up goals and learn how to accomplish each one of them. When you set up goals you have to be determined and find a way to achieve them. It is a lot to do but it is something I expect to face.Prompt: The greatest challenge I am expected to face.\n\nAs a child I had almost everything handed to me. What I would ask for I received, I had six pets for crying out loud. As time prevailed getting what I wanted when I wanted wasn\u2019t so easy anymore. Now it\u2019s my last year of high school and it could not be any more stressful than it is now.\nIt\u2019s the last first day of high school I am struck with \u201csenioritis\u201d as soon as I walk through those double doors. Saying to myself \u201cI can\u2019t wait to graduate and get this year over with\u201d. By May all of this will be over and I\u2019ll be left to my own devices, by May all my friends would have moved on ,and I\u2019ll be stuck thinking to my self what\u2019s next? By May my time would be upPrompt: Discuss a place that has changed you.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame how few people choose not to go to college. I plan on going to college and have a bright future. One particular school I\u2019ve been seeking is Morehouse. I plan on attending a school with a positive environment and fair rules. I have learned unique history and facts about the school as well.\n\nNot too long ago I visited Morehouse College my sophomore year. I was in this mentoring program called BEAMERS we went on a field trip to visit the school. This experience changed me. I remember stepping off that rusty bus into the quiet school. The halls were silent and echoed every step you took. The lunch room smelled like a 5-star restaurant. I said to myself: \u201cI\u2019d love to attend this school\u201d.\n\nAs soon as we made it to the college we sat in a class room then talked to a student that attends Morehouse. He told us the GPA requirements, which was a 3.7 at the time. He explained Morehouse is a private, four-year, historically black college. We were also informed that Morehouse was an all-male school. This statement was a shock to many including myself. The crazy thing was Spelman College was right across the street from Morehouse. Spellman was an all-female school. The student informed us with much information about the school but our tour was nowhere finished.\n\nThe best part about our tour was coming up next. The student informed us with unique history of the school. There is an obelisk named in honor of Howard Thurman. Thurman was an African American author, philosopher, theologian, educator and civil rights leader. He was a graduate of Morehouse College. There were many other celebrities that graduated from this school such as Spike Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Martin Luther King Jr. Martin Luther King was enrolled at more at the age of 15 after skipping the 9th & 12th grade. These unique facts went on and on like a broken record.\n\nEver since the Morehouse tour I\u2019ve never been the same. I met the requirements to this college. I would be more than happy to attend it. I hope ever school high school gets to tour this college. It is truly a life changing experience.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face.\n\nThroughout my entire life challenges have been with me from the beginning. No matter what I have faced challenges and been expecting to face more that are thrown my way. Without dealing with these situations in life I don\u2019t think I would be as successful as I am now. Challenges to me are basically things to where I have to push myself in order to go where I want to go. Plus learning how to never give up and stay at the task at hand.\n\nThe greatest challenge I expect to face in life is getting my mom and brother a bigger house and a better lifestyle for them. I really expect to do all that through basketball as a matter of fact and I have a great feeling that I will be able to accomplish this as well. Basketball is really my wife in this world because I have become so phenomenal at it that I have been attending colleges and camps. The only reason for me even wanting to play is because my little brother looks up to me and he wants to see me make it big for the family. In the future as I finish up high school, I expect to have matured well enough to be ready for college and hoping that I will be succeeding in that as well. I already know that for me challenges will forever come my way but as a humble human being I will never complain. I\u2019m going to always push myself to get better at what I love and loving something I always wanted to do.\n\nThe other challenge I expect to face is trying to find the college that\u2019s right for me and depending on how great of a school they are education wise and activity wise. I have visited colleges any basketball or any other athlete can ever dream of. My recent visits have been North Carolina or UNC, Kentucky, Birmingham Southern, Georgia State, FAMU, Florida State University, Georgia State, Louisville, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, and that\u2019s pretty much it. For me visiting those schools it took a lot of hard work to get there and that\u2019s not even including sports wise really. Those colleges expect major things from kids attending, and I can get really lazy so it will take me some time to bypass all of that. A college I was really considering going to was Florida State University. With that being a highly attended school in the country they acquire kids to be outstanding scholars. For me to get in there I have to do exceptionally well in high school as of now since I\u2019m a senior. Because if I didn\u2019t loiter around in my freshman and sophomore year, I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about much as a senior. But that is a challenge I am facing at this moment and I know I can overcome it. Especially knowing people are here to support me as I continue on with the success I\u2019m at I know I\u2019ll be okay.\n\nThat is really the greatest challenge I have faced in my life because there were days to where I just wanted to give up and stop playing basketball all together. But I had to come to my intellectual gift and do what I what destined to do as my heart desired. Another Challenge I expect to face is overcoming my laziness and putting forth the effort as I am told to do so. But I have overcome that already but if I want to get in a successful college at this moment of life I got to just get through it. Another college I was looking forward to coming to see was Tennessee. I wanted to consider them on my list because their high school requirements aren\u2019t as major as Kentucky and so on. But it will still be a big obstacle for me to get into. Plus their courses have to meet my needs because I wouldn\u2019t want to attend if they aren\u2019t as good as I thought. But there are a lot of athletes in my shoes and especially professional athletes as a matter of fact. So really it doesn\u2019t bother me knowing I have to face a colossal obstacle at hand.Prompt: ?\n\nThe high way a never ending sees of concrete and steel. My hands dire and tit on the old polished letter wheal my first day on the road. I stop pull over and scream not in anguish but it in nervous excitement over my future I was going to university to some no surprise to others dis belief. My interest confused and angered my friends and some family I wanted to become a geneticist something never herd of by my pears. Growing up in Canada theirs a wall much greater than in the states not racial not nationalist theirs was a learning wall my wall from the time I could remember I had trouble with words not on the page but in my mind. I could read and understand words with the best of them but the second I was told to write my mind went a blank not with ideas but in how I could put them on paper I couldn\u2019t spell.

Till I got to high school my teacher asked me to write an essay I was terrified so I wrote as little as possible, I was steaming I couldn\u2019t write what I wanted the things floating in my head I couldn\u2019t get them out. Meany years pass I slowly but Shirley made my way to AP classes my writing improved and but compared to my AP classmates I was far from them but I\u2019m getting better every day.\n\n\u201clife is hard it will beat you down if you let it but it\u2019s not about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep going \u201c Rock 4 life will never be easy I learned this form a young age but thing that seem hard for some might not be for others. Wrestling was never a hard thing for me ya there where hard practices but its temporary it\u2019s, better to work hard and get your hand razed then to playing around then to be on your back gasping for air. If you\u2019ve wrestled with something, your whole life wrestling for 6 minutes is easy. So many people ask me is it hard is it hard it\u2019s not about weather its hard it about whether it\u2019s worth it, university is no different just another opponent I haft to wrestle agents but before we step in the ring I\u2019m just letting you know university compared to my previous opponents is just a bump in the high way of life.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nMy parents are the ones that have made me who I am. They are the reason to why I am in school. Thanks to them I want to do my best and become someone in life. Each one of them had their own part in order for me and my brother to get here.\n\nMy mom, she has worked really hard since the time she got here in order to bring my older brother and me here. She has always given us what we wanted and works hard for it. She has two jobs morning and afternoon. She leaves at 7am and comes home at 11pm from her second job. Sometimes my brothers and I don\u2019t see her the whole day. We would have to say up in order to see her and when she has off.\n\nShe tries to hang out with us When she doesn\u2019t work she would take us to the park or anywhere we want. Somehow she always finds a way to spend time with us even though she might be tired. She did her best for me now it\u2019s my turn to do my best for her and give her the life she deserves. Furthermore my father has always been there for us and gives us what we need.\n\nMy father on the other hand has only one job. He works in the morning and comes home at 4pm. Somehow he finds a way to pay bills send money to my family In Mexico and have some left to give to us so we can buy what we want. He would give us advice to keep moving forward to not give up and to go for our dreams. All my father wants is for us to be happy and get education. He wasn\u2019t given the opportunity to go to school and be someone in life, but even though he didn\u2019t go to school he is very smart.

Mostly all kids have a good childhood and some not so many that good. People like seeing little kids laugh, smile, giggle, and play. I wished I had a childhood like that it would off change me. I would enjoy my years but I couldn\u2019t because I had responsibilities when I was a little kid.\nWhen I was a little kid I had to look out for my little brother. I had to help out my mom around the house and help here clean houses so we can get money and pay the bills and for food. Also on top of anything my dad left us or abandoned us when I was 8 years old. When I was 10 I had to work in a job so I can help out my mom,Prompt: A Personal or national issue that is important to you\nThe distribution of wealth in America is one of the biggest issues to me on a personal level and is a big problem on a national level too. Economic equality doesn\u2019t seem like a priority in this country with the lopsided balance of wealth in this country. Surveys have been done interviewing Americans of all different backgrounds and economic status and most thought that the distribution of wealth in America was a lot closer than in reality what it is. There are a lot of people in America struggling, out of work and not meeting their financial needs and that I see as a big problem because, the situation could be handled better to where everyone can benefit.\nNow I can\u2019t ever see Americas wealth being distributed equally because, there would be no drive to work and achieve goals and make more money. I do believe that the gap between how much the wealthy, the middle class and poor people make is way too wide. 40 % of this nation\u2019s wealth go to the top 1%. That means those big C.E.O\u2018s guys like bill gates 40% of the whole nations wealth goes to those guys. The average these guys get paid is 380x more than there average employee and in the fast food industries over 1200x more. Now I\u2019m sure that\u2019s these guys work very hard for their money but its very hard to believe that they are working 1200x or even 380x harder than their employees. Also the richest 20% of Americans own 84% of the nation wealth.\nThere are so many people on food stamps and other government assistance programs because, of this problems. You have people with degrees and can\u2019t find jobs that pay well enough to provide for their families and daily lifestyle. There are millions in this country who struggle to make ends meet financially and very few rich people, but yet the ratio of how much they make versus millions of Americans is ridiculous.\n\nThere is also a big reason why the rich make so much more money than the poor. Normally poor people are unaware of this situation and just trying to get by in life. The poor and middle class a lot of times do not educate themselves to this situation and it seems as the rich care more because, they want to keep all the money there making. If we want to make money and solve this problem we have to wake up and realize what\u2019s actually going on with our wages and demand a better distribution of the wealth in this country.Prompt: ?\n\nA good lawyer can the be the biggest factor in a case. A great example that many people have heard was is the o.j. Simpson case. Many people thought that he commit the crimes. Most of the proof connected to the crime he was accused did point to him, however Simpson brought the bet lawyers money could buy. With his lawyers he was found not guilty which surprised many people. I personally do not care if Simpson was or was not guilty however his case did teach me the importance of a good lawyer.\nWhen I was a boy my brother was arrested for murder, later they found the real killer but he spent two years on the inside. When I found out he was guilty I felt tears falling my face. My family could not afford a very good lawyer and we had to use a family friend, Joe Vincent. My mother said that Vincent was an okay lawyer but the prosecutor was like Peitho, the Greek god of persuasion. My mom would not let me attend the trail (she thought it would be inappropriate for a seven year old.) I had to grind my teeth or I would yell at the top of my lungs. When my brother was convicted many of my own family members believed he was guilty. That reinforced my belief that a lawyer has the power to win any case. That\u2019s why I want to be lawyer to make sure the right people are convicted.\n\nIf a lawyer is good enough he can be the main factor in a case. Even with all the evidence stacked, like the Simpson case, a lawyer can still win your case. A convince judge or jury that a man is guilty or innocent, that is why I want to be a lawyer. After the I read about the Simpson case I a light off went in my head, I saw that could help a lot people by just being their lawyer. I know now that there is a lot to being a lawyer but I still want to help people by being their lawyer.\n\nSomething else I found out about lawyer is that many people could not afford the good ones. I plan on doing a lot of pro bono work. I want to help everyone I believe to be innocent. Many people who cannot afford a good lawyer and are found guilty and have a harsher punishment, however people of considerable wealth usually get off quite easy because the can afford amazing lawyers. There are many examples of the rich getting off easy besides the Simpson case. Walmart is sued every for some another but they can afford the best lawyers alive. I believe many big companies can sell harmful food or underpay their employees not because they bribe government officials but because they get the best lawyers they can buy to convince the government that everything is fine.\n\nThose reasons I not only want to be a lawyer but I want to start my own firm, because many lawyers abuse their powers of persuasion for money. My firm will be about help people who can\u2019t afford a good lawyer and of course those who can because I need to make a living. I will try to be the best lawyer I can be so no one has to watch their innocent brother go to jail.Prompt: Greatest challenge I have faced\n\nHaving to grow up looking different than other can be difficult especially when your overweight .you get looked at differently , judged differently , and treated differently and this has been my greatest challenge faced so far .\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear of something that weighs 224 pounds? Big and heavy right? Well that was me, a big 14 year old girl with low self-esteem. Everywhere I went I was looked at differently than others. I didn\u2019t even want to leave my room because even my family looked at me differently with eyes looking straight at me up and down with disgust and disappointment knowing that I could do better , but I didn\u2019t care I ate and ate whatever I desired I don\u2019t even know what I ate most of the time because the more they looked at me like that the more I wanted to eat but then I realized I was getting bigger and unhealthy so I ate less and it was a nightmare but then I started noticing results but it still wasn\u2019t enough but I didn\u2019t give up on myself .\n\nAs time passed by I was being judged because I was still over weight. People called me fat, ugly and people made fun of me in every possible way they could. I was embarrassed of myself I was even made fun of for trying to lose weight and everything I ate I didn\u2019t know what to do that I would just cry to sleep but I kept telling myself hard work will pay off and people will see that they were wrong to bully some overweight girl because I will shine .\n\nAs I got older I started having more friends and they were all thinner than me and every time we went out together all the boy would have their eyes on them but me .I knew is was because of my weight cus no guy likes big girls well at least that\u2019s what thought and all I had on my mind is that why don\u2019t they look at me like that? , why don\u2019t they think im cute ? so I lost more weight .Prompt: Who has influence me the most\n\nI was between the ages of 12-14 when I realized that who has influents me by my parents and my sisters. My parents and sister are my influence because they have been there with me since day one; they also my parents and sisters always told me that what I should do and don\u2019t, Also all of them helps me with everything.\nMy parents and my sisters have been there for me since day one. If I ever need any advice my parents and sisters will always be there for me. Also everyone who influence me they will always have my back and tell will always give me good advice for any problems I have/gotPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nEvery time I think of my first day of sophomore year I can picture it in my head like if I am living in the moment. That night I had to go to bed, my eyes were opened as wide as three school buses put together because I could not sleep from how excited I was to go to school. I kept reaching under my pillow for a little white iPhone 4s -that barely functioned just to glance at the time. It was barely twelve or twelve \u2013twenty around that time. I was so anxious to meet new people eat lunch with friends and just the feeling of arriving as a sophomore made it tough for me to fall asleep. I had no Idea I was going to meet someone that will make a difference in me and the way of seeing things in life. You never know who will influence you for good or bad.\n\nIt was a brand new year at my high school. Everyone is excited well, almost everyone. As I walked in the building I saw Amanda, one of my classmates from last year. We never really talked it was a Hi and bye kind of thing but this time she was more excited to see me than ever. I could tell by the way she approached me and yelled my name out across the halls. I guess you could say she was lonely and didn\u2019t want to roam the school alone on the first day. I didn\u2019t mind at all because I was alone too. I pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that contained my schedule and I started to scan the routine I had to take. As I placed my schedule back she asked me what I had for first period. \u201cI have French first what about you?\u201d I responded. I recall the smile she carried on her face when she said, \u201cOMG I do too!\u201d We both pulled out our schedules to compare them and it turned out that not only did we have first period together but, we had each other in all classes.\n\nNever did it cross my mind that Amanda and I would have classes together.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nI Know like every college essay, people talk about their mom being their hero, but in my case I truly believe my mom is my hero. My mom has faced many challenges in her life and she always makes it work out to her benefit. I watched my mother struggle with 3 jobs, she worked in Columbia University in the human resources department, she worked as a mom, and she was my teacher. Even to this day no challenge stops her from reaching her goal, I am glad to say in 2016 like me she will be graduating but she will be getting her bachelors\u2019 degree.\n\nWhen I started the second grade things started to become hectic because I was always getting in trouble at home and my mom being a young mother didn\u2019t know I had a hereditary learning challenge where I have a difficult time hearing and pulling phonetic sounds. She thought I was being lazy and would make me stay up late on school nights to finish my homework. Years later we discovered that my brother came out with the same hereditary reading challenge, we also discovered that the gene was given to me and my brother through my dad who had gotten it from his mother.\n\nMy mother wasn\u2019t always the happiest or patience woman, my dad expected a lot from her and so did we. She was our mom, a co-worker, a wife, a teacher, and a chef. A lot of her responsibilities became mine when I entered 6th grade. I was responsible for leaving for school at 8:05, after school going straight to karate class, at 6 o\u2019clock leaving karate to go pick up my brother and sister from afterschool and taking them home so they can start on their homework and I had to help them with their homework too. When I entered the 7th grade I told my mom that it was a lot of pressure to go to school karate and pick up the kids on time to get them home, so she placed me in the same after school program so right after they release me I can get my brother and sister and take them home. Things soon became very complicated when the girls at my school wanted to fight me and would chase me home every day after school. So my mother had to lie and say we lived with my aunt so I can go to the same school as her kids. So my mother would drive me to school every day right before she left for work and I would have to take the bus home to get to my afterschool. When my mother got home at 6:30 she would say hi to us and go straight to the kitchen to cook dinner. MY dad expected dinner to be done when he got home because he worked 2 jobs. My mother did all the parenting because my dad was always tired and sleepy when he got home so she had to do a lot of the disciplining herself. Sometimes her choices weren\u2019t the best but she did the best she could.Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life\n\nImagine waking up one morning to the bitter sound of nothing. You\u2019re the last to wake up but that could\u2019ve fooled anyone with the amount of silence flowing throughout the entire house. I remember walking downstairs to the kitchen on June 3rd 2015, and seeing my family gathered around the dinner table. Without them even saying a word I already knew what was coming next. I mentally prepared myself for what I was about to hear but there\u2019s not enough ways in the world to prepare yourself to hear that your home isn\u2019t going to be your home anymore.\n\nAfter 15 years of living in the same house and learning this place like the back of my hand and watching as what was once the little tree outside our house grow every day, or watching the progression of the fresh black concrete fade as the days went by to a dry grey color, after all of that; this house wasn\u2019t going to be ours anymore. This was the same house I learned to ride a bike at, where I met my best friend the first day we moved here from Texas when I was only 3 years old, where I had my birthday parties, where I experienced the most important milestones in my life; letting go seemed more than impossible. Moving day came and I watched as each room in our house became empty; it was almost as if we were never there.\n\nIt was an emotional roller coaster. Although a part of me was hurt I had to push my feelings to the side and be a support system for my parents. I did not let them know how I was feeling about the whole situation and just tried my best to uplift their spirits. I didn\u2019t want them to feel in anyway guilty because I knew well that everything was done that could have possibly been done to try to keep our home. I was grateful to them because although we were in a tight situation money wise they pushed every penny they had and still managed to give our family a nice house to live in. it\u2019s a beautiful place really it\u2019s a town house, 2 story, wood floors with white rooms. The first time I walked into this house I felt like crying because I knew there was no going back to my old house. After nights of crying and missing my old home, I realized change should always be good. No matter how difficult the situation might be, or how \u201cimpossible\u201d letting go may seem to you at the moment you always have to make sure that you use your time wisely. That\u2019s exactly what I did. This situation might not seem like the most tragic thing in the world, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s not. This transition alone though ,has taught me to enjoy every second of what I have while I have it because you never know if the next day you\u2019ll wake up and it won\u2019t be there for you anymore.\n\nI learned to take advantage of my time because you can never go back. This is a lesson everyone should learn in their lifetime, I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 thing to say but I never really found the true meaning of this until I experienced it firsthand. Time is everything and sometimes you don\u2019t get warnings as to when it will be gone. I\u2019ve lived by this everyday but never really embraced it like I do now. You need to enjoy everything till the last bit of it. Losing my house was an awful point in time for our family, but we learned quickly from this. This happening made us learn to value everything in our lives to a further extent. This was a lesson well learned and well needed.Sixth PeriodPrompt: The greatest challenge that I expect to face\n\nOk, so since I\u2019m talking about my greatest challenge I thought about it, but I realized I cannot think of one. So I decided to just write about the challenge that I am facing now in my senior year of high school. So really this is the greatest challenge I have ever faced. So come with me in this challenge and image what I\u2019m going through.\nSo one day my consoler had called me in to his office and had showed me what my credits were. So I saw it and I wondered and thought to myself. Am I really going to graduate with my senior class in May 2016? But first for me to do that, I need to go through some steps in order to graduate. And believe me it\u2019s a lot of steps. So the things I need to do are mandatory.\n\nSo what I need to do is? 1. Pass all the classes I have this semester and next semester. 2. I have to do credit recovery this semester and next semester. 3. Do 2 classes online or from a different place like faith academy, phoenix, and a different place that which I forgot. 4. Pass all of those in those classes and then I need 1.5 credits of the following: Arts, foreign language, or technology class outside of Berkmar. And this is a lot to do on my part, And not to mention a lot of money for all that. So this year I really got to step up my game a lot on my grades. If I want to pass and graduate next year may.\nThis right here had got put to the top of this list of challenges. But anyway let me continue on this. When I had got home and told my mom and dad what I needed to do. We started looking up what I can do and how much everything is going to be and everything. I can tell u right now it\u2019s not going to be cheap at all. When I was talking to my consoler, and he was telling me a lot of things I need to do. His face didn\u2019t look like a good one. He told me that it would be a lot of work for me and was telling me to just finish it next year in December. And he was saying that it won\u2019t be cheap because of where I had to take it. So I said ok and that I was going to go ahead and try it.\n\nThe reason y this is a big challenge for me is because of what my consoler said when I had left his office. He said and I quote that it was going to be hard and he told me that it\u2019s not impossible but he didn\u2019t say it was possible. So when he said that I said to myself this is a big challenge for me do I accept? And in my head I said yes I do challenge accepted. So now this will be the biggest challenge I have ever faced. Now let me see if I can compete this challenge or is it going to be a fail? Never know till I try.Prompt: You have been elected President of the United States; write your inauguration speech for us.\n\nGreetings, my fellow Americans of the United States of America. As your new President, I would like to share my feelings and changes I have in mind to put our country in a positive direction. But, before anything, I would like to thank the citizens of America for making me their new President and giving me a chance to better our country.\n\nFirst, I have a speech for you America, a speech to demonstrate my options, or plans for this country of ours. Let\u2019s all face it; America is heading upside down, Economy/National issues. Our war on isis has been going on for a bit now, and our previous president has done NOTHING to get us out of the situation, instead he used his 2 cents and made things worse. But , my goal on the other hand , is to bring our troops home and end the conflict with isis , simply by destroying them , talk is cheap , serious action needs to be done, quickly. Now , promises have failed this country so now I will say , America, I will give you my word , isis will no longer be an issue for the United States.\n\nSecondly, I would like to address the welfare problem; it has completely gotten out of hand. Most people on welfare get money every month, without even giving an attempt to get a job or make something of themselves. It\u2019s nice to know where my tax dollars are going, along with many other Americans. But now that I\u2019m in office that will change. The welfare policy will be if you sign up for welfare and you don\u2019t have a job currently, you have 4 months to find a job and be accepted or else if you don\u2019t complete the task, you wouldn\u2019t be qualified for welfare and have to wait 1 year before you can try again. You only get $100 for groceries, every month, which should be great because you will have a job if you\u2019re on welfare.\n\nLastly, I would like to address the complication of cops, and how some people have their opinion that police officers are to overpowered and they are serving brutality to African Americans. Police officers do their job; they risk their lives to save others. If you\u2019re not in the situation first hand , dealing with the subject , you have no right to share your 2 cents on what you think the cop is doing, because when it all comes down to it , you will need them before they need you. So with that being said I will change the law to where, if you fail to cooperate and listen to the cop by the first instruction, you simply need to be taken in , because you failed to listen and follow direction , and it would be a fine for Failure to follow instructions.\n\nIn conclusion, America I\u2019m here to create a brighter future for everything and everyone. But most importantly make a brighter future for our country, The United States of America. With that being said , expect bigger and better things , thank you for electing me as your President.Prompt: ?\n\nChallenges can be helpful or they can be stressful. Either a good stress that motivates you to do your very best or the bad kind that can lead to health problems and bring you down. Either way it goes, challenges help us, regardless if we like what the challenges is. My greatest challenge is happening right now, deciding what college to go to.\n\nThere are many different colleges that I can apply to. Most of the schools, I don\u2019t even know the name or where they are located. I want to be a high school art teacher. Meaning I most have 4 years of with a major in education and art as my minor. I originally thought that it that art would be my major and education would be my minor. I was born in Missouri, so it would be good to find colleges there, because I already know the area. Atlanta is my second choose, it is where I am currently living and where I most likely be living for another year.\n\nThere are two school that interested me Slayer University and Kaplan U. Slayer has class that I would have to go to, but Kaplan u has online classes which is way more convenient for me saying that I am no actually in Missouri at the moment. Although, I might miss out on the experience of campus life, online classes seem a lot less of a hassle. Now that I have chosen the schools that I am most interested in I have to make a plan of action. I must first look at the requirements and see if I meet them. Then I must make sure I have a place to stay for which ever school I end up going to whether with family, a dorm with a roommate, or even an apartment. Either way it goes I will need to get a job that will allow me to study and attend classes.\n\nAnother challenge that would go along with this is that Georgia and Missouri are very different places. In Georgia I feel like a car is a most have thing most of the stores and restaurants are miles away. When I lived in Missouri, I and my friends walked to almost every store and restaurants, the stores were never further then 1-2 miles away from where I lived it was great and we never wasted gas. In Missouri it\u2019s in the north meaning it snows. I used to roll in the snow as a child and December was that happiest month for me because I love when the temperature is below 20 degrees. In Georgia I hate it, here it never snows and the temperature doesn\u2019t even go below 40 degrees. It\u2019s too hot here; if I do end up going to a college in Georgia it will have been my last possible option.\n\nMy greatest challenge was deciding what college to go to. Now that I have looked at the pros and the cons, moving to Missouri or staying here in Georgia I decided that Missouri is where I belong. Having already lived there for most of my life and having family close by it would also be the smart choose. Yes Georgia has its pros, but the cons over way them. This challenge has affected my life in a good way. I the way that it made me think about what I want to do with my life after high school it gave me another challenge. That is to get in the college that I want to go to.Prompt: The Person Who Inspired Me The Most\n\nThe women who took care of me for 17 years always told me, \u201cDo something that you love and not something for the love of money.\u201d My mom has been and always will be my number one supporter. She was the person who encouraged me to be comfortable in expressing myself. She was the one who wanted me to strive to be someone that I would be happy about 5 years down the road. My mom is the reason I\u2019m going for this. I always knew cosmetology was something I loved and wanted to do for a very long time.\n\nI can remember the first time I started wearing makeup. I woke up one morning feeling bold and snuck in one of my mom\u2019s mascaras out her purse that felt like a never-ending cave. Being only in 5th grade, I had no idea what I was doing. I\u2019ve seen my mom put on her bright lipstick and her neutral eye shadow colors with peachy cheeks before and it just excited me about wanting to be exactly like her. I was terrified that my mom would catch me, but I honestly couldn\u2019t wait to ask her. I only finished putting mascara on one eye and left to school like that.\n\nThroughout the years, I went through some pretty bad embarrassments. My first year of middle school I decided I needed a new me, a new haircut. I chopped off my hair. My nest of hair looked like I closed my eyes and sneezed when I cut it. My seventh year wasn\u2019t any better. I used to watch a lot of videos on the internet. So I decided to experiment on picture day. I see these girls on TV that made any eye color look just absolutely stunning. I wanted to do what they did. I remember wearing this flamingo bright pink on my eyes with some lipstick that looked like a basket of red apples. I don\u2019t know how I survived school. All those years and my mom always told me that practice makes perfect.\n\nAs I grew older and my mind-set changed, wanting to be a cosmetologist never did. While everyone wanted to be a doctor, computer expert, or even a zoo keeper, I wanted to dedicate my life on making other people feel good about themselves. I\u2019ve been told that a cosmetologist isn\u2019t a job a hundred times that at some point I started to believe them. My mom is the one who said, \u201cIf it makes money, it\u2019s a job.\u201d My passion for hair and beauty is unbelievable. I made sure I got ahead on my high school credits to attend Maxwell and start early. My goal one day after high school and later finishing up cosmetology school is to open up a business over in Texas. I know I\u2019m setting the bar high on this one but I\u2019m going to for it and I\u2019m sticking to this. My mom encouraged me to do this and make it happen at whatever risk. She\u2019s all the support I need to make this happen.\n\nMy mom wants me to aim high but walk through stairs. Applying to Paul Mitchell School is the first step on my staircase. Being accepted to this school would be an honor and privilege to attend to. This school is everything I want. Paul Mitchell is every future cosmetologist dream. The challenges I would have to face are going to be worth every sweat and tear being a student here. This is where I set foot outside of my box. Through this school, I will be become the person I\u2019ve long waited to be and I know my mom would be so proud to call me her daughter.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nRole models, we all them or at least someone we look up too weather that person is real or fictional. Personally speaking I have several role models but the main one that I can say has had the biggest influence on me is batman. \u201cYes batman\u201d the dark night himself. Going back I remember watching the old series batman and just thinking he was (in simplest terms) awesome! Since then he was already a part of my life but it wasn\u2019t until the beginnings of middle school when he really impacted me. To begin with, I wasn\u2019t a very social person most throughout my life. More or less due to the fact that I had terrible self-esteem because of previous encounters with bulling in elementary school. To worsen things I was already a naturally shy person and my face would always turn tomato red and my palms would start to get moist every time I would get called on to answer a question or even do something simple like walking to talk to the teacher. As years passed by things got worse and they weren\u2019t looking any better as time passed. Thus watching my entire favorite hero\u2019s on TV and such I really got into the character batman. This is because of the entire hero\u2019s that would pass on TV, they all were likable friendly extrovert kinds of people and batman was the complete opposite. He was quite, serious; he wouldn\u2019t play and had no friends, in addition to the fact that even some civilians (the people he protects) fear him. All that though didn\u2019t bother batman. He would still carry his duty and protect the people regardless of anything. So eventually what started to happen was that I found myself relating to batman\u2019s person or character. In doing so, it made things start looking up for me. How? Because I could now be myself and not feel completely down about the way I was. If batman could be serious and scary to people but yet a hero at the same time, why not I.\u201d maybe not a hero\u201d but at least out there handling my business without caring what people think. Anyways as the years started to pass I would just feel better and better about myself. It got to the point that it would show through my character, personality, voice; just everything that I was indeed feeling more comfortable with myself. So By the time of high school I was a different person. I was more out spoken, people would approach me and not say that were scared of me or such. Everything was going great but then things took a slight turn. Those kids that I had problems with bulling in elementary school were going to BHS as well. Everything was still all well until I would see them or they would have the same class as me. I would just feel a huge explosion go off in my chest and my head got really hot and my mood would just change for the worst in a second. The reason for that was that I couldn\u2019t forgive them for what they had done to me previously. This experience or event however let me to be able to relate to batman a little more in the sense of forgiveness. To begin with, watching batman I noticed that no matter what any villain did or how corrupt and psycho that person was, he never once hurt an enemy to the point that they were in the hospital or anything. Instead he would warn them before he did anything and if they didn\u2019t listen then he would take action. From all that though, what I took in was that he forgave the bad for himself to be the better person and not give into a bad path where he would end up being the same or no better than the people he fights against. Thus I admired that and decided to forgive all my enemies and such and just be the bigger person and carry on with my life. In doing so I was able to finish high school and carry on with the world and with ease all thanks to my number one hero/idol batman.Literally I feel like my heart just dropped to the floor and I am terrified to pick it back up. My eyes were locked at the end of the board all I had to do now was to take my steps and do my dive. Every step I took I felt like the board was getting longer and longer and I wouldn\u2019t be able to reach it but at last I was at the end and you better believe I was riding that board like it was my life on the line. Shooting me off like a cannon ball I majestically did my dive and I went into the water like a fish causing no splash at all.\n\nBeing in the water felt really peaceful like if it was another world I could hear people clapping and chanting like animals fighting over a piece of meat as I arose to the surface I could hear the scoring from the judges overall they thought it was a good dive. Coming out of the water knowing that I was done competing felt great my heart was no longer on that board it was right back in my rib cage. Considering that it was my first meet I thought I did pretty good looking at my team from a far I could see them jumping up and down and cheering. Getting closer and closer to them made my smile stretch all the way up to the ends of my ears I was extremely happy because knowing that I made them proud gave me great joy in seeing them. Arriving to the bench where my team was stationed at felt like I was arriving to home from a long trip.\nMinutes after I had taken a seat to rest and to think about overall on how did I began to realize that I had come so far to be at this level. A short woman with big ol\u2019 white hair had started to rally up a commotion about me to my coaches. Suddenly I felt a pounding on my shoulder coming from someone wanting my attention I slowly turned around to acknowledge the person and it turned out to be the women with big ol\u2019 hair. Looking at me with her big eyes I knew she had some news to tell me and it was good news.Prompt: ?\n\nThe past mistakes make you rethink your choices and decisions to better yourself. \u201cLife does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.\u201d My life has been impacted in many ways as I grew up starting when I was 5 years old and barely came to the United States in the year of 2004. I thought my life would be such a hurricane due to what had happened in my family especially with my own mother and led to changing the way of living with my brother. Family is very important in our daily life. Family supports you on anything, loves you regardless how much someone can fail them and family are people that are always there for you helping you with important things such as your education or deciding what type of pathway you will choose when going into college. People in the world do not realize how much impact they can cause into someone\u2019s life either for better or for bad such as falling into depression or finding better ways to make them even better as a person.\n\nFairy tales don\u2019t exist maybe in movies and shows but not in real life where many broken pieces with unanswered questions will be found, unfortunately some stories don\u2019t end with a \u201chappily ever after\u201d. A couple of months had passed by since I arrived from Mexico to Georgia. A lot of changes were going on in my family, one started with my mother who was being strange all the time, who at times made her own kids feel like the only mother they had was their grandmother and aunts. A few days passed away, my brother and I were playing outside until we saw our mother walking by with a bag that was full of her and my little sister\u2019s clothes. She had told us that she was going to sale those clothes or donate them but who could of thought what she said was all a lie. Days and a couple of months went by no type of communication was involved after my mom left with my little sister, until it was my little cousins birthday party was when I finally got to see my little sister and this time would be for forever. Someone I did not see was my mom.\n\nYears have come by and there was no communication done with her. Almost 15 years have come by with no word being heard from the person that gave me birth, I forgot who my mother is, how she looks like and her way of being. All I remember was that I had a mother who just didn\u2019t care about hurting her own kids or leaving them without thinking about how much they will end up needing her throughout the years. During those 15 years of life for 3 years I fell into depression where all I wanted to do was commit suicide simply because seeing my friends with both their parents made me jealous and feel worthless. I always dreamed of having perfect parents who would last forever and be an example for their own kids. Fairy tales don\u2019t end with happy ending sometimes you have to create your own beginning by having people that will help you and never give up on you and end up with a happy ending.\nThe years continued to go on until I was 10 years old. My brother was going into his last year of high school unfortunately my family was breaking apart economically. My father had it very tough with my siblings, grandma and I. He had two jobs in which he got paid well but that money wasn\u2019t enough for the bills that needed to be paid.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nDid you ever had that feeling when you\u2019re hopeless? Or that moment when you just want to give up? Or that feeling when you\u2019re stuck and don\u2019t know how to get out of the situation? I had, a ton and I feel like I\u2019m the only one with problems. That\u2019s when I need help but like friends aren\u2019t always there. My sister Elsy has helped me time to time and gave me advice even though I don\u2019t do what she tells me what I should do in my own problems.\n\nMy sister Elsy, loves to create pictures on paper.

Then there\u2019s me, I doutle something and it comes out awful, so I do what Elsy did. I keep on tryin\u2019 till I get it right.\n\nElsy also helps me when there\u2019s a boy problem, in relationship, sometimes I need help on what to do. The feeling when I was being a toy and my feelings didn\u2019t have meaning. There\u2019s problems everyday and it never quits. Elsy tells me to drop it and go to the next one or better to stay single. She was right and I realized I needed to think of myself first and for what is best for me. I give people advice, yet I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t take my own advice.\n\nElsy also influence me on planning for my future after graduation. My sister has a big future ahead of her and she knows where her place is at. It made me think,What am i going to do after graduation? Which college am i going to go?

After college I head off to country to country and with my career, I express it.

Her life was like a shadow being behind me between middle school and high school, that is how she understands what I\u2019m going through. She knows what is best for me \u201cI\u2019m telling you this Sandy because I don\u2019t want you to end up in the garbage out in the world.\u201d We act like cats and dogs time to time and I hate it when Elsy acts like a parent. But Elsy had helped me through rocky times. I love the fact that she\u2019s my sister and I can always count on her when I need a hand.Prompt: ?\n\nDonald Trump wants to beat everyone in poles but where does he really stand in the economy?

What do this quote means to me is that life is a challenge. In which it is, but that don\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get passed that challenge. My biggest challenge is my IEP. What does IEP means to me; well I should say what it did mean to me. IEP means to me is a small problem in life that I have struggled with for a long time. The real meaning is \u201c(IEP) \u2014 to help kids succeed in school\u201d. I have an IEP in reading, math and writing.\n\nI would say reading is my biggest one, it not that I can read it just means I struggle with that the most. I have the biggest fear that one day I would just get called out in front a whole bunch of people and be told to read something. People are my biggest fear when you say something or something they would laugh. When I am by myself when I read for miles, it seems I forget all the worlds when I\u2019m around people. I have been getting better though, I read more and also out loud.\n\nMath is the easy for me; I can do it with flying colors if I know what I\u2019m doing. For math all I have to do is listen to the teacher and ask questions. Really math isIndicate a person who has had a significant influence on you can describe that influence.\n\nRole models are people you look up to and admire. They can be celebrities, family members, or a friend. They can also influence you through many ways like maybe through a song or a picture .Their influence can either be positive or negative. My mother has influenced me to be hardworking, supportive, and positive.\nMy mother has influenced me to be hardworking, because she started working at a young age, she has her own business, and she started from the bottom. My mother started working at the age of 13 in Mexico, and she was taken out of school. She practically was the only person bringing home the money, because her parents didn\u2019t work enough to support the family. This made me realize that working hard in school pays off, because not everyone has the same opportunities in other countries. My mother owning her own business influences me to strive to own my own business someday and be the best I can be. She is her own boss and doesn\u2019t have to worry about someone else constantly being over her. Also she started from the lowest point to building her way to the top. This shows me that it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from or who you are you have the potential to be a somebody and not be nobody.\n\nMy mother has influenced me to be positive, because you are able to see a different outlook on life and many doors open for you. My mom has gotten to where she is today by staying positive, no matter how bad a certain situation got or if she was going through a tough time; She always looked on the bright side. She would always overcome that certain obstacle. This taught me that no matter what obstacle I face, I will overcome it. Also staying positive can lead to opening new doors for me, because mom has had many doors open for her. She started working for the first time when I was 8, and she would get mean comments from her coworkers .She didn\u2019t allow that to affect her instead she stayed positive, and she soon started to get more and more opportunities. She was able to buy the store she was once an employee at, all because she was positive and kept her cool throughout the time she was working there. This has made have a different point of view on things and not to hold grudges towards other people.\n\nMy mother has influenced me to be very supportive of myself and others, because being supportive towards other people can really show others what\u2019s important to you, and what you care about. My mom has been very supportive about my plans and goals for the future. She has sat down with me and asked me about my future plans, and she listens to what I have to say. She also gives me advice on how I shouldn\u2019t be to insecure on what other people say about me and always do my best at whatever it is. This has really taught me that I am really fortunate to have a mom who supports me, because not everyone is fortunate to have parents who support you on your plans after high school.\n\nIn all, my mom has been the person I admire the most; she has influenced me in many ways the words can\u2019t explain. She has taught me that it is important to be hardworking, because hard work pays off. Also that having a positive mind set can lead to new opportunities. Also that having support in your life can help you .Prompt: Discuss what makes you uniquely qualified for this position.\n\nThe reason why I should work at Footlocker or any other shoe company, because I have the potential for working with shoes, and Im also an excellent shoes salesman. I really want this job, because I can finally help support my mom pay some bills and help my family with the rent, and also make her proud. To be honest I really think that working at footlocker is going to be an easy task to do because once a customer walks in the store imam greet them with respect and let them find some shoes that they are looking for, and if I see them struggle then imam walk up to them and ask them if they need any help or any shoes that they are looking at in particular.\nThere are going to be some strengths and weakness that I\u2019m going to have when I work there, and my strengths are greeting the customers with a smile, asking them if they need any help, going to the back room and going to get their shoe size and then going to the register and ringing them up correctly. My weakness are knowing the type of shoes that they want that will be comfortable for them and also seeing which shoe will be in style for kids and adults, but I can manage to get to that by researching online and looking them up to get real comfortable with hooking them up with shoes. I feel like that I can be way better than the other workers that I\u2019m going to be working with because once a customer comes in and ask one of my co-worker that they are looking for some shoes that they can play basketball in and then they\u2019re going to be like I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, then that is when I come in and be like I know the perfect shoes that can be fit for you when you play basketball, then I walk over to that section and show them and then they are going to say hey I like these, then I ring them up and tell them to have a nice day and come back and see us again. Another reason is that I\u2019m very organized and very nice when it comes to talking to people and I\u2019m also very friendly, for example if you come up to me and ask me a question I am going to say sure I can help you with something and then walk over there and see what the customer needs help with and then once they ask me that they need a shoe measure, I\u2019m going to go and get the thing to measure their foot to see what size I need to get.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\nIs there a person who significant influence on you. Like your parent, your friend, and your cousin. What makes you unique person you are today. The person takes you places you like to go. Who makes you happy when you are in a bad day?\nThere is a person I significant influence. That is my dad. He do is best for us, have insurance, makes go to school and buy us food. My dad tells me what is right and wrong. Each day if we do something wrong he would repeat the things over and over again in a good way.\n\nWe love him anyway he does. He takes the places you like to go. I wanted to go to the mall or the book store. My dad was doing something he was watching a soccer games, he said to wait for the break time. He will drive you there. I have a sister we always fright, so my dad would say when you get order you won\u2019t have each other backs and regret what you have back then.\n\nMy dad would always tell us a story when he was small. Each time we talk during dinner time he would about his stories. He would say your parent can\u2019t stay with you; you have to do it on your own. When we have some kind of party, he doesn\u2019t like other people talk about his family like that. There are some people doesn\u2019t like us. Most of the party we go there are my mom she has a lot of friends. He always asks us about our day. He always asks us about our day. When we get home from school he would say that to us. My dad wants me a good life, not like my parent right now. My dad work at a Mayer Electric Suppler, my mom work at a nail place each day is like that. My dad doesn\u2019t want us like them. He would want us always to go to school.Seventh PeriodPrompt: Think of a place you know well. Describe the place, and include your feelings about it.\n\nHome; there\u2019s no place like it. It\u2019s my favorite place to be but also the place I loathe the most. The 13 years that I have lived in my house there have been so many memories made with my family and friends. Memories full of nonsense and memories full of love and fun.\nAll the foolishness and nonsense began when I moved from an apartment, into the house I live in now. I was only 4 when Daniel moved in the big blue house next to mine. Daniel is significant due to all the memories we made together and because he\u2019s my best friend. Daniel was the more creative, fun, and mischievous one between us. For example, one day when he and I were together and we were bored he thought of this game called \u201cadventures\u201d and I would always look forward to playing with him. Daniel to me was like a role model and if it weren\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be me today. Although Daniel moved away not too long ago he and I are still best friends and if it weren\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today.\n\nGrowing up as a kid I would say I was different from the average American kid. And not only was I different so was my home/ lifestyle. I found out from experience that there\u2019s no place like my home. My family is from Bosnia and in Bosnia we do things different than here. Even though I was born here in Georgia, I\u2019m still very Bosnian due to my family. For example, in our culture we don\u2019t wear shoes in the house; I learned to take off my shoes whenever I enter a house. I was different and unique because my parents weren\u2019t really accustomed to the American life and they wanted me to retain all of our Bosnian culture but America changes you. America changes you because surviving in America is different than Bosnia. In Bosnia it would be easier to find a job, make money, and live a regular life but I had to forget about simplicity and an easy life and get accustomed to our economy. Although life may be harder here in America when I\u2019m home everything is easy that\u2019s why I love being home.\nNow that I\u2019m all grown and finishing high school soon I see my home and family in a different way. I understand everything my parents were trying to retain and teach me but still accept that I had to change to survive in America. Just like my mom had to learn English so she could get a job and provide for me and my family I had to do the same to provide for me and now also for my mom and dad. I also realized home isn\u2019t home without your family and your family doesn\u2019t only consist of blood relatives. An actual family for me consists of my blood relatives and my friends Daniel, Elvis, and Donny. If it weren\u2019t for every one of them home would never be the same. They all created me and created my home to be the way it is today.\n\nSo when you think about it there\u2019s really no place like home, and that doesn\u2019t just include me it includes the whole world. I\u2019m, sure everyone feels the same. If it weren\u2019t for me moving into this house, for me meeting Daniel, for me changing to get accustomed to the American way of life I wouldn\u2019t be here today and I wouldn\u2019t be the [...] I am today.Prompt: ?\nMany states are known by their stereotypes and other people around the world actually believe those stereotypes. New Jersey is one of those places that people believe only loud mouth and reckless citizens reside there. However, that is only what is shown on television just for the amusement of society. This voluptuous state is full of way more than just their stereotypes, we represent equality and togetherness. Being born and raised there, has taught me how to be a mature young lady. It has also taught me that your family can be spanned out across an entire state, and they will always be there for you. New Jersey is a place that I know well and that will stay in my heart no matter where I travel to.\nI lived in a small town that resided in Bergen County called Hackensack. It shared a small area with two other towns; Englewood and Teaneck. These towns were so small that you could walk over the bridge and you would be in Teaneck. Everything was so close to each other and it was very convenient in any type of emergency situations. Walking down the streets of Hackensack, you could just smell the aroma of flowers sprouting from the ground and smoke from the buses. You could hear people greeting you every five seconds that you walked down the street with a warm \u2018Hello\u201d. People always had bright smiles on their faces like they had all won the lottery, even when it was like a blizzard during December. I lived near a diner called Fairmount Diner, Target and B&W Bakery, which were right across from the train tracks. You could smell pancakes dripping in syrup from the diner and freshly baked pastries containing sugar and flour from a mile away.\n\nHackensack became a gigantic influence on the way that I live my life. It has molded me into the model young woman that I have grown to be. Even after moving to Georgia, Hackensack is still in my heart no matter what and always will be. It was just one of those places that allowed me to be as creative as Leonardo da Vinci and I have learned to express that in my current location too. Whether it be through writing or drawing, I am a creative person. New Jersey taught me about family, equality and individualism in many ways that I could never possibly forget. That is the one place that means a lot to me and I am planning on going back really soon. I will be going back to see old friends and reconnect with all my family. Hackensack, New Jersey is a place that I know well and is also a place that will stay in my heart forever.Prompt: ?\n\nMany things in life help you become a better person and make you see how you should be. In my life there was one thing that really made be treat people differently and really began to love life. This was something that hit me like a fast ball and it was something that changed me forever.\nHeart beating fast, eyes bulged, Nothing was more important than this moment. I gave all my focus in to my cousin as she picked which hand the freshly covered in copper penny was in. My expressions and body turned firey inside and out as she somehow managed to pick the right hand again. Me becoming envious decided to change it up and do anything so that my cousin wouldn\u2019t win. The first thing that came to my head was that I should hide the penny in my cloths but I only had on my non pocketed jean dress and I had no pockets to hide them there so that was out of the question. The last and most secure place to me to hide the penny was in my warm moist mouth. At the time this seemed like a very intelligent Idea. Until my cousin chose a empty hand and I opened up my mouth and me still being the jealous person that I am decided I never wanted her to even see the penny again so I had made a decision that wasn\u2019t well thought out.\n\nI swallowed it! When it happened I could taste the copper slowly go half way down my throat. It happened so fast that I didn\u2019t realize that I had done something complet  ley wrongPrompt: ?\n\nChorus Room\n\nWho am I? I always repeat that question to myself. I realize that I\u2019m a different person then I was three years ago. When I view myself in the mirror I don\u2019t see all the agonizing misery that once took a place in me. I recognize a different person, someone who is overjoyed and at peace within their self. I only found this new conception because of a chorus room.\n\nHigh School pointed out all my flaws the moment I walked down the street at 6:25 a.m. to get to the bus stop on time. I arrived at this huge contraption at 6:45 a.m. As I walked in feeling apprehensive and insecure seeing all the different types of people. I found myself trying to find a familiar face to socialize with, but instead I ended going to my first class of a new environment.\nIn first period looking at 4 white walls and too timid to try and make conversation to new people\u2026 in comes some old friends and I was so excited to see them and start to make conversation. And soon it was time for Chorus. Chorus ended up being my safe place. A place where I could be myself and no one could judge me. I met all kind of different people in, and two of them became my best friends. They brought me out my shell and opened this new person that is present here today.\n\nThe Berkmar High School Chorus Room changed my life completely. I never was in a place where I felt so welcomed and felt like I belong. I always had to hide who I was because the fear of being rejected by society. But I wasn\u2019t rejected, I was accepted for all my flaws something that High School didn\u2019t do. High School pointed out all flaws but The Chorus Room made me embrace my flaws. It was the best thing that could ever happen to me.\nI grew and grew into a person you wouldn\u2019t even recognize three years ago, by my looks, maybe a little. Yes, not by the way I walked or talked or even the way I ate. But by how jubilant I was how nothing bothered me even loosing friends.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face.\n\nPeople face a lot of different challenges throughout their lives. Some are able it to make it through and others just quit and fall off. Well I am not a quitter. I have faced challenges before and if I have to go through that situation again; I am sure that I will succeed.Prompt: ?\n\nThe person that has the most influence on me in life is superman, or you can say one of the strongest people I know\u2026\u2026my dad. He\u2019s like my backbone that keeps me straight. There\u2019s so many different thing I have learned from him and YouTube. I look up to my dad, because he goes out to work every day to provide and help my mom, sister, and me. I can tell working year round is not easy, but you got to do what you got to do. He\u2019s taught me how to not waist money depending on other people to do the same thing I can do. There\u2019s no telling where I\u2019d be without him.\n\nHe raised me to not be dependent on others, and different ways to make money the clean way. He introduced me to many different things that I know for a fact I wouldn\u2019t be doing without him today. We hang out more as best friends more than farther than son. Year round we are working and riding our horse. During fall and winter we hunt, and in the summer time only I fish. Mainly because he\u2019s not too good at it like I am. He\u2019s the one that taught me most of the laws of life that I know. The top two of them is \u201cEvery day is a new day\u201d, and \u201cLearn from yesterday, live for today, and hope for tomorrow\u201d. Sometimes I think about what if I wake up one morning and he\u2019s not there anymore.Prompt: ?\nIts 12:34 a.m. and I wake up frightened that I hear the phones from my job ringing. Ever since that moment forward I realized that needed to go to college that I wouldn\u2019t be able to work at a fast food like Pizza Hut. In life, there are challenges you have to change to be a better person in your future. In this moment, I realized didn\u2019t want to work at a place where I would be bossed around in a way that I felt uncomfortable. I have faced many different situations to the point where I feel that I can\u2019t be having someone treat me this way. Thanks to this job I\u2019ve realized that I need to work hard to get easy money. In other words, I need to go to college and face another hard challenge to get to where I can make easy money and not have to deal with people treating me however they want.\n\nAs a young teenager you want to make your own money to get your own things. In high school you face many situations and challenges in which you realize you need to be more dependent on yourself then your parents. Now as a senior I have realized its worth coming this long way and doing all I had to do to get where I am today. I am thankful for everyone that has helped me along the way and has pushed me to keep going. When I first started working my family supported me telling me if I didn\u2019t like the job because if I did it would mean I liked easy money in a way that isn\u2019t fair. In other words, it would not be right that I would work so hard to get so little money.There are many places in the world that can change a person. It could be a church or a certain place that you visited. It all can affect you from the way that they act, to the Future decisions you make. One place in significance many can relate to is prison. One place that I may Say has changed me is the football field. This place in many ways has changed me to become a better Individual.\nTo begin with, being on the football field alone conjures up memories good and bad. One way that it has changed me to be a better individual, is to always work hard. A moto that has always been self-evident every time I suit up, and walk on to the football field. For instance, one memory that comes to mind is the very first time I step foot on the field. I could remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Tuesday evening and hot as devils toes. The sweat trickled down into my eyes where it began to burn with no chance of it stopping at all. Then the coach called for individuals. I could not have taken another second of this. My knees began to tremble under the weight of my fatigue, but then one of the head coaches pulled me aside and told me calmly, \u201c you got this son, just keep going and never, the pain of today will be your gain tomorrow, I believe that you will go far.\u201d Ever since then have always worked hard.\nIn additionPrompt: ?\nIt was a warm sunny fall Sunday afternoon. It was a tough very stressful decision to make. Choosing a University to attend next fall. This experience has shown me that it\u2019s tough to make a decision without your parent\u2019s having a say. In what could affect you as you transition into your next phase in life.\nReceiving letters from different colleges is very exciting. Just to know that they are mailing and calling you just so you can come to their college is very fun. Seeing your mom\u2019s face turn bloodshot red, because she is tiered of all the college drama. Colleges will go to war with each other so they can lure you in to come on their campus.Prompt: Discuss what make you uniquely qualified for this position.\n\nContinuing my boxing career is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Because as a kid I loved things that were physically involved .However it may seems very easy sport. But it\u2019s really not. Meanwhile looking at the TV while two fighters are taking the hits may seem a little cool. But the fact that it can damage their brain in a long term. However it\u2019s hard to believe .Let us not forget that boxing is still one of the best sports that was invented during ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nSince I was 8 year old I loved boxing. I use to watch it a lot. I basically like sports that physically involve punching. Meanwhile I am new to United States of America .on the other hand, there was an Afghani family that that just moved to USA. My family knew them well. However one day I was watching a boxing match and he saw me .He asked me if I want to join a boxing club? Well he was a great boxer in Colombia .he had won a lot of trophy and medals and etc.Bascially the next day he takes me to the gym and my training begins. However know that he knew I loved boxing and how I take it serious. He decided that he will train me very seriously and he won\u2019t take it easy on me. However, for some reason I love his idea about training me very seriously .Because there are two different types of athletics in this world. One that takes it serious just like it\u2019s his or her passion. On the second hand there people who does for the time killer or the money. Well to me doing a sport for money is stupid idea. However there\u2019s people in world that does it for the money or to kill time. But however to me boxing as always been my sport, and my passion.\n\nIt was early in morning. The sky was still dark. While we were in car, going to Gym.my coach said today is a big day for you.when we arrive in the gym .I Saw couple of parents there and couple of students. It was a big day for me.It was my first boxing match. The first round went very well .But however during round nine, my hands were giving up.it was hard for me to see.Becuase I was stuck in a corner. However every time I would try to clinch on him. He would throw a jab and hook. Which was hard for me stay on balance. He would try to unbalance me but it wouldn\u2019t work. Now that round nine was over my coach told me this is the round that I have to go full power. Because we can\u2019t take the risk of going all twelve rounds. So the round started and I was dizzy I was acting like I was okay. But I got caught with a hook and he put into his corner. And he landed a lot of punches .But meanwhile I was waiting for him to do a single mistake and KO him. He seemed very tired. We still had a minute left on the clock. Well he drop his hands and my reaction was fast I duck down and jabbed him twice and I throw a right hook which made him off balance .From that point it was my turn so I throw many punches and my last punch KO him. And I won the match. Everybody thinks that boxing is an easy sport. It\u2019s not it take time to build speed and power punches. From that point on I learn my lesson no to wait for opponent to attack first. I should always start off.\n\nTo conclude, boxing has always been part of my life. To me boxing is like having a best friend beside you. \u201cAccording to some, boxing is just a sport, but according to me is not just sport, it\u2019s my passion, my life.\u201d\n\nI have faced plenty of challenges but the most important one that I expect to face is going to college. However, I just think of myself everyday of where I will be in the future. College is one of the most important things in someone\u2019s life because without college you\u2019re going to stay getting paid $7.25 an hour. College is a must have I see people every day struggling because they didn\u2019t went to college. I think that everyone should go to college if they want to be successful.\n\nPeople that go to college great treated different then everyone else because people know that they are going to be successful people in life. The other people that don\u2019t go to college get treated like crap. For example, I know my cousin that work at a mall and they were clowning him because he didn\u2019t have a high school diploma. You don\u2019t want to be like my cousin because even if someone asks you if you graduated you will feel embarrassed to say no. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to go to school and do what you have to do to get that education.Prompt: ?\n\nAbout 300,000 kids in America that plays high school football .Only 2,000 of those kids receive division 1 scholarship to college.100 of those 2,000 kids that make it to college go to the next level and that\u2019s the NFL and most of them won\u2019t make the team. Well I\u2019m one of those 300,000 kids that is fighting against the odds to be able to earn a college scholarship. It\u2019s a tough challenge that I have to face it\u2019s my senior year, and I have no, stars, no ranks, and only one way out.\n\nYear after year hearing the sound of a buzzer going off and hearing cheering and joy, but not from the people beside you nor behind you, but across the field of grass another team has defeated you again. The years of having losing seasons. This is the year that it\u2019s not going to happen again and I can\u2019t let that happen either. Definitely to the underclassmen who are the future of our program.Prompt: ?\n\nThe definition of challenges is to arouse of one\u2019s action or effort to stimulate the quality or requiring full use of one\u2019s ability, and energy. One of the greatest challenges that I am facing right now is high school. Why is high school my biggest challenge you might ask. Well it\u2019s simple deciding what to do with your life after high school, what career, and what field. All can take a lot and put stress on you.\n\nMy challenge is to finish high school and decide what to do with my life. For some of you who do not know. High school is not what you expect it to be like. Walking the hallways felt like an evening commute home on the I-85. The school lunch can only be described as a weeks ago bread. Every day you walk/drive home exhausted. Some days I would come home not remembering anything at school. I would always question myself.\n\nThe hardest part about a high school life is to get past the distraction you face every-day. Walking to class in the traffic filled hallway, my lungs rapidly pace itself, my muscle straining itself, and all to do what. Walk through the hall. So much work just to walk in the hallway. Why it is that people like to hang out at the doorway. No common sense. Doors are meant for walking through, not standing and blocking it while people try to push their ways across.\n\nOut of all the little distraction I face every-day, one challenge still remain. What would I do after high school? After 4 years of high school I can still not make up my mind. There are many options but I cannot pick which is the best for me. What college should I go to, what field should I do what about the military? All the questions I want to answer but simply cannot.\n\nIn conclusion, I am currently trying my best to figure out what to do with my life after high school. I do not know whether I am going to which college or if I am to attend the military. Whatever happens in the future will happen depending on my actions this year. After all what is the point of a challenge if it doesn\u2019t make you try your best.Prompt: Discuss a place that has changed you\n\nHave you ever been told that the whole point of life is learning to live with the consequences of the bad decisions we\u2019ve made. It only takes a place and a wrong decision to change your life around and sometimes your future plans. To me it all happened around the end of the school year of senior year. I was a 16 year old girl attending Berkmar High School. I decided to drop out of high school to have a job and depend on myself because of family problems I had a sick dad who got fire and a stepmom who only work part time. My only choice was to help and hold down my family. Dropping out of high school is an issue face by many teens today including me unfortunately. There are many causes to drop out of school but with those causes come many negative effects. Out of those effects I learn that school is really important and brightens anyone\u2019s future as so makes our career easy.\n\nSchool was really a waste of time for me. I had zero interest. I\u2019m sure school is a huge benefit if you are actually interested. But it only was making me angry and depressed. I honestly never thought I would drop out of high school. I loved school; I love learning, being organized and the socializing when I was in elementary school to middle school. Things change; sometimes they changed in bad ways. I was very hurt and felt like I was worthless for not being able to continue my education I was basically committed to demonstrate to my family and friends that I was that one person with honors cords and the crowd cheering me while I walk to receive my diploma. A lot of those people were disappointed at me. I felt like I was the definition of a high school dropout. At that point I decided to help my family out since money was needed around that year. I told my dad my decision and he agree he said he understands I want to help them out but he told me I had to promise I will come back to school and graduate. As a teen I just want the best for me and my future family so of course I will be a high school graduate and a collage graduate as well.\n\nThere are many reasons why any dropout decides school is not for them as many people say now days. I was once one of them. I kept telling myself that I wouldn\u2019t graduate on time I was already behind. All those negative thoughts made me not believe in me anymore. I started skipping classes. I didn\u2019t care about school anymore, I didn\u2019t care about my grades anymore not even the classes I was doing good at. At the end of the year I decided to drop out what the point of going to classes is when I was already failing them I kept asking myself. Until the day came when I decided to not go to school anymore and be welcome to the real life \u201chaving a job and depending on you.\u201d\n\nDuring that time I was struggling to find a job. I felt like nobody was there for me. Everybody was still going to school to finish what I couldn\u2019t finish my junior year. I felt left behind alone and helpless until I met a friend who works as a waitress. I told her what was going on and if she could help me find a place to work at her job. Finally they hire me at her job at that point I was really happy and felt like everything was getting better. I hated working every day from 2pm-2am I got home really tired I wanted to give up but I would have felt like a loser until I realize how hard and stressful is to work. To remind you it was my first job at age 16. I hated the job I knew this wasn\u2019t for me that\u2019s when I realize and open my eyes and told myself what was I doing here. I rather wanted to be at school then working somewhere I hated it.\n\nFinally summer came I decided to go to summer school and finish some classes. I was doing goo still manage to go to work. Then finalyPrompt: ?\n\nThe smell of salt in the air and women in bikinis all around us. What would you think your at? The beach of course a place where most would spend spring break at or for just relaxation. This place I know well is Myrtle Beach, SC just place I can\u2019t forget. I do have feelings for this place I didn\u2019t spend much time their but I really have somewhere in my heart I could not forget.\n\nTo start off why this place means something to me is because my dad choose this play to spend time there as a family, well now since he is not with us anymore that place is just a reminder of my pops. Not just of the memories I have of it is special it is also a beautiful resort I would recommend to others to enjoy. With its crystal blue waters and a great view of the atlantic ocean something you can\u2019t see everyday.\u201cDad, where\u2019s mom\u201d I asked. My dad looks over, sighs, and says to me \u201cShe\u2019s Working son. She\u2019ll be home later\u201d. I\u2019d look up at him, and see my dad smile at me like there\u2019s nothing wrong, and hug me. My dad knows that I and my sister know that she\u2019s been leaving. He didn\u2019t want us to worry because we were just kids. So he\u2019d make up things like \u201cShe\u2019s working\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s at the store\u201d. My dad was having a hard accepting the she was leaving, and so were we. Abandonment doesn\u2019t just affect the other parent but the kids as well.\n\nAs a kid I knew something was wrong but I didn\u2019t know what. I could hear yelling from my parents especially from my dad. I\u2019d hear bits of what they were saying. My dad \u201cYou need to stop\u2026.\u201d My mom \u201cI\u2019m going\u2026.\u201d I hear a door slam and just curl up in my bed, blanket covering me, hiding. My mother was like any other mom working, cooking, cleaning, etc. then she got into gambling. At my age I didn\u2019t know what that was. A little after that she would go missing. It started with a couple of days to weeks. I don\u2019t know what my mom was thinking. She had five kids my older sister, me, my little sister, and twin boys. My mother had taken up a gambling problem. My mother would take my dad\u2019s money and go to a casino. Win or lose she\u2019d go. She lost so much at one point that we lost our house. Not just that house but two more after that. She\u2019d come back to my dad all broke, but he wouldn\u2019t care because he loved her. Once she was back the cycle would happen again. This happened until we were going to another house and she brought along her \u201cfriend\u201d. I say \u201cfriend\u201d because she told my dad he was just a friend but in reality she played him. That \u201cfriend\u201d turned out to be the guy she ran off with. Him over my dad. It left my dad devastated.\n\nMy dad had a hard time accepting that she had left him for another man. That she had gave up on her husband and kids. He couldn\u2019t handle the fact she had did not want him. My father wasn\u2019t the same after that. He\u2019d throw himself into work. If he was home he\u2019d be working on something. He became silent not talking. My dad has never been through this. So he didn\u2019t know how to deal with something like this. How can you. The night that he found out that she was leaving I found my dad in his room crying. My father is crying. I couldn\u2019t help but just hug him. It was my dad. A man I never thought can cry. I found him at the edge of his bed shaking his head while slow tears just falling from his cheeks. He hears me come in with my older sister, and tries to wipe up his tears. Saying he\u2019s fine don\u2019t worry. My dad is a very prideful person. He never wanted us to see him weak or down so he would always be happy no matter what. It was just sad because he wasn\u2019t the only person who was struggling. My sister and I were too\n\nLike my dad I was having a hard time dealing with this issue. I felt it was my fault. Like I could\u2019ve done something to change what happened. Like what can I do to bring her back. What can I do. I had many trust issues built on this. I didn\u2019t trust anyone because I felt as if they weren\u2019t telling the truth. I didn\u2019t trust that people would stay in my life. I felt like what\u2019s next to go, my dad. I felt like I could never believe in happily ever after. I thought I will be alone all my life. I became emotionally depressed. Because my mother had left with no emotion at all. Just packed up and left. This was the moment I felt abandoned. From there I isolated myself from everyone and everything. I didn\u2019t want to let people come into my life and just leave like she did. I built my wall to keep anyone from getting in friends, family anyone. I\u2019ve been like this for years but keep it to myself. I didn\u2019t feel the need to open up to anyone.\nYears passed by now and I\u2019m eighteen now. I still have issues but I\u2019m trying to get passed it. I\u2019ve accepted she has left. I\u2019ve been trying to get back in life and experience it. I have a better perspective on thing and how they work. It hard but I found what I want to do and be in life. I want to be a psychologist. I want to be a psychologist because I want to help treat the minds of other so they don\u2019t have to feel like I have or bad in anyway. I made my goal out of this situation. My goal in life is to help anyone and everyone so they can be happy in life. It doesn\u2019t matter friends, family, strangers anyone that feels sad or mad or even alone. I want to help them.Prompt: ?\n\nOne of the places\u2019 I know best is where my parents were born and raised. This place is where I can find freedom. Every year I go visit I feel like an eagle soring throw the blue sky. My heart starts to race every time my family and I go visit. Every year we go visit my parents family, it shows me that family is what really matters in life.\nThe first year I visited my parents\u2019 home town was when I was ten years old. We had left the house around two in the morning on a Saturday night. That night my mom and dad where ready with the luggage and everything in my dad\u2019s ford f-350 (king ranch). My brother and sister had woken up when I walked in there room and told them to get ready so we could leave. While my brother and sister started to get read, my mom started to look for our passports, while my dad checked the truck for anything that might cause a problem with it.\n\nAfter my mom and dad had done everything they needed to do we headed off on the freeway. My brother and sister half asleep in the truck and, my mom and dad as well. Me on the other hand, my heart was still racing and just jumping with joy inside. My dad started driving and it would take us one full day and three more hours just to get to the border. My mom and dad toke turns drive and I also helped them out a little as well. After the long drive we finally reached the border and there were a lot of people there. The line to cross the border was very long, more than the down town Atlanta traffic is on a game day. After the 3 hours we spent at the border we were ready to hit the road again. It was my dad\u2019s turn to drive again, pulse he was the only one that know the shortest way to get there without taking the long way like last time.Prompt: ?\n\nThree specific things about me is I like American History, because you can learn so much about American in some many classes. So I want to go to college get my major in history and might become a teacher on day.\nAnother specific thing about me is that I\u2019m a hard working person, I ask questions we need, and always caring about each other. So I hope to keep that positive feeling with me till I die.\n\nThe Final specific thing about me is my family is Athletic, because my parents played sports while there were young and in high school. My sister is playing two sports right now Softball and Basketball, but I\u2019m the only person that doesn\u2019t play high school sports. But I still play sports after school.\nSo I hope that you let me in your University to played sport and be a positive student in life. Also to accomplish my goals I set while I\u2019m there.Prompt: ?\n\nDonald Trump wants to beat everyone in poles but where does he really stand in the economy? Lately all he has been arguing about is immigration insisting that Mexican immigrants were \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\u201d and arguing Mexican immigrants bring \u201ctremendous infectious disease\u201d to the country, which is not true, not just that but threating tariffs because he is \u201crich\u201d as he claims in CNN news. \u201cI\u2019m rich and not using lobbyists. I\u2019m not using donors. I don\u2019t care I\u2019m rich\u201d and expects us to believe that he\u2019s really going to makes U.S.A a better place when he plans to hurt people and family\u2019s and doesn\u2019t care about other races other than the legal people whom according to him do not make crimes or are not spreading diseases\n\nAs many people have heard Donald Trump is working with Univision as head management in miss U.S.A pageant. as soon as this 20015 pageant ends he claims that he is not satisfied because of a \u201cnon-completed agreement in his contract.\u201d When in reality he is just trying to make an honest buck out of Univision that happened to be the biggest Hispanic news industry and the TNT network news interview him and ask him \u201cdo you regret the comments?\u201d Donald Trump: \u201dNot at all had I said people from all over the country\u201d TNT network: \u201chow much are you sewing them for?\u201d Donald Trump: \u201cI\u2019m sewing them for a tremendous amount of money for defamation\u201d when really the person who should be sewed for defamation is him for saying people from the middle east and Islamic people are destroying our country\n\nThe real question is do we really want a guy to run for America? He can barely hold his tongue when it\u2019s his turn to speak, just common sense as a child, even a child knows better. they know when they are permitted to speak and when they should start speaking and how without being rude if you ask me I believe Donald trump was a troubled child and still is today don\u2019t get it wrong he has good qualities but I still feel he shouldn\u2019t be given such a higher power when his idea of respect is as ideal as a three year old child.Late ArrivalsPrompt: Who is someone you look up to and why?\n\nThere are many different people that come in and out of your life. All of them teach you different things. Some come in to teach you how to survive, and others just to mess your life up. Many of the people that stay are the ones who love you and the ones you learn to love. The very two first people that will teach you everything are your parents. My prime example is my dad.\n\nMy dad is literally a pain in the neck when it comes to my studies and school work. He\u2019s always on my back when he comes home from work. \u201cKevin get off your phone, that\u2019s not helping you study!\u201d I always seem to make the same dumb mistake by saying,\u201d yeah dad I did that already.\u201d Usually he always likes checking my homework. He is such a perfectionist, doesn\u2019t like not even the slightest mistake. My dad is also always asking about my grades. Like any other parent he turns into a loud parakeet and yells at me if I have a bad grade, but never does he hit me for any reason.\nMy dad has probably taught me the most valuable things in life. When he was only fifteen years old, he was in the army back in El Salvador. After one year he decided to run away from the military and flee his country. When he arrived to the U.S. his mom told him he had to work, because she didn\u2019t have enough money for the both of them. My dad has been independent ever since. He always tells me how I should value my life and that I should appreciate that I have both my parents. With my dad I can play around but he\u2019s also showed me when it\u2019s time to be serious. My dad is like my mentor. He always pesters me about how I shouldn\u2019t do a lot of the things he did, because he doesn\u2019t want to see me suffering like he did.\n\nThis man has always been there for me. Blood is thicker than water they say, and my dad has proved that to me. There\u2019s never a time I don\u2019t like going out to work with my dad. he\u2019s taught me so much of the things he knows. Always says that when he dies he wants me to be known the way he is. My dad has never given me a bad example. Yes he may drink and stuff but he always likes to do it behind our backs so we won\u2019t see him. He\u2019s never offered us anything and even though he says you should try a lot of things at least once, the way he\u2019s raised me I could never. He has always been there for me and my family. Never had we had to suffer the way he did. There\u2019s always been a roof on our heads, clothes on our body, and food in our mouth. He may not seem like a big deal to you, but when I grow up I want to be just like my dad and if possible even better.\n\nI\u2019m very lucky to have a man like that in life. He has always stuck by my side no matter what. My dad has taught me what it\u2019s like to be a man. All the memories he\u2019s given me I will never forget. All the stories he\u2019s told me I hope to pass down to my kids. I want my dad to be remembered for an eternity. I look up to my dad because he\u2019s the greatest dad alive!I am uniquely qualified as a vet because of my love for animal\u2019s, past experience and achieving my goals and accomplishments.\nMy passion for animals is to love them in many ways, giving them their different needs. Figuring out the problems by performing good connections and communication. I am willing to heal the broken hearts and outer skins on the helpless animals and not only the pets but the pet owners.\n\nIn my 19 years I\u2019ve grown up with pets all my life, so I am aware of the requirements into keeping a pet and providing the right care for them, I\u2019ve learned that every day I am learning something new about different species and still want to continue to gain new knowledge.\n\nStudying animals all my life has also made me want to participate in an actual animal shelter, and maybe my own someday, I plan to better myself into the new things that come my way to help these animals and teach others the right way.essayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessay12Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/103669", "artist_names": "Copywrite (Ft.

Bubble Machine LyricsThe first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who's Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.\n\nBy now, most of us know the major players. As George Bush's last Treasury secretary, former Goldman CEO Henry Paulson was the architect of the bailout, a suspiciously self-serving plan to funnel trillions of Your Dollars to a handful of his old friends on Wall Street. Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton's former Treasury secretary, spent 26 years at Goldman before becoming chairman of Citigroup \u2014 which in turn got a $300 billion taxpayer bailout from Paulson. There's John Thain, the asshole chief of Merrill Lynch who bought an $87,000 area rug for his office as his company was imploding; a former Goldman banker, Thain enjoyed a multi-billion-dollar handout from Paulson, who used billions in taxpayer funds to help Bank of America rescue Thain's sorry company. And Robert Steel, the former Goldmanite head of Wachovia, scored himself and his fellow executives $225 million in golden-parachute payments as his bank was self-destructing. There's Joshua Bolten, Bush's chief of staff during the bailout, and Mark Patterson, the current Treasury chief of staff, who was a Goldman lobbyist just a year ago, and Ed Liddy, the former Goldman director whom Paulson put in charge of bailed-out insurance giant AIG, which forked over $13 billion to Goldman after Liddy came on board. The heads of the Canadian and Italian national banks are Goldman alums, as is the head of the World Bank, the head of the New York Stock Exchange, the last two heads of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2014 which, incidentally, is now in charge of overseeing Goldman \u2014 not to mention \u2026\n\nBut then, any attempt to construct a narrative around all the former Goldmanites in influential positions quickly becomes an absurd and pointless exercise, like trying to make a list of everything. What you need to know is the big picture: If America is circling the drain, Goldman Sachs has found a way to be that drain \u2014 an extremely unfortunate loophole in the system of Western democratic capitalism, which never foresaw that in a society governed passively by free markets and free elections, organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy.\n\nThe bank's unprecedented reach and power have enabled it to turn all of America into a giant pump-and-dump scam, manipulating whole economic sectors for years at a time, moving the dice game as this or that market collapses, and all the time gorging itself on the unseen costs that are breaking families everywhere \u2014 high gas prices, rising consumer credit rates, half-eaten pension funds, mass layoffs, future taxes to pay off bailouts. All that money that you're losing, it's going somewhere, and in both a literal and a figurative sense, Goldman Sachs is where it's going: The bank is a huge, highly sophisticated engine for converting the useful, deployed wealth of society into the least useful, most wasteful and insoluble substance on Earth \u2014 pure profit for rich individuals.\n\nThey achieve this using the same playbook over and over again. The formula is relatively simple: Goldman positions itself in the middle of a speculative bubble, selling investments they know are crap. Then they hoover up vast sums from the middle and lower floors of society with the aid of a crippled and corrupt state that allows it to rewrite the rules in exchange for the relative pennies the bank throws at political patronage. Finally, when it all goes bust, leaving millions of ordinary citizens broke and starving, they begin the entire process over again, riding in to rescue us all by lending us back our own money at interest, selling themselves as men above greed, just a bunch of really smart guys keeping the wheels greased. They've been pulling this same stunt over and over since the 1920s \u2014 and now they're preparing to do it again, creating what may be the biggest and most audacious bubble yet.\n\nIf you want to understand how we got into this financial crisis, you have to first understand where all the money went \u2014 and in order to understand that, you need to understand what Goldman has already gotten away with. It is a history exactly five bubbles long \u2014 including last year's strange and seemingly inexplicable spike in the price of oil. There were a lot of losers in each of those bubbles, and in the bailout that followed. But Goldman wasn't one of them.\nBUBBLE #1 The Great Depression\n\nGoldman wasn't always a too-big-to-fail Wall Street behemoth, the ruthless face of kill-or-be-killed capitalism on steroids \u2014just almost always. The bank was actually founded in 1869 by a German immigrant named Marcus Goldman, who built it up with his son-in-law Samuel Sachs. They were pioneers in the use of commercial paper, which is just a fancy way of saying they made money lending out short-term IOUs to smalltime vendors in downtown Manhattan.\n\nYou can probably guess the basic plotline of Goldman's first 100 years in business: plucky, immigrant-led investment bank beats the odds, pulls itself up by its bootstraps, makes shitloads of money. In that ancient history there's really only one episode that bears scrutiny now, in light of more recent events: Goldman\u2019s disastrous foray into the speculative mania of pre-crash Wall Street in the late 1920s.\n\nThis great Hindenburg of financial history has a few features that might sound familiar. Back then, the main financial tool used to bilk investors was called an \"investment trust.\" Similar to modern mutual funds, the trusts took the cash of investors large and small and (theoretically, at least) invested it in a smorgasbord of Wall Street securities, though the securities and amounts were often kept hidden from the public. So a regular guy could invest $10 or $100 in a trust and feel like he was a big player. Much as in the 1990s, when new vehicles like day trading and e-trading attracted reams of new suckers from the sticks who wanted to feel like big shots, investment trusts roped a new generation of regular-guy investors into the speculation game.\n\nBeginning a pattern that would repeat itself over and over again, Goldman got into the investmenttrust game late, then jumped in with both feet and went hogwild. The first effort was the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation; the bank issued a million shares at $100 apiece, bought all those shares with its own money and then sold 90 percent of them to the hungry public at $104. The trading corporation then relentlessly bought shares in itself, bidding the price up further and further. Eventually it dumped part of its holdings and sponsored a new trust, the Shenandoah Corporation, issuing millions more in shares in that fund \u2014 which in turn sponsored yet another trust called the Blue Ridge Corporation. In this way, each investment trust served as a front for an endless investment pyramid: Goldman hiding behind Goldman hiding behind Goldman. Of the 7,250,000 initial shares of Blue Ridge, 6,250,000 were actually owned by Shenandoah \u2014 which, of course, was in large part owned by Goldman Trading.\n\nThe end result (ask yourself if this sounds familiar) was a daisy chain of borrowed money, one exquisitely vulnerable to a decline in performance anywhere along the line. The basic idea isn't hard to follow. You take a dollar and borrow nine against it; then you take that $10 fund and borrow $90; then you take your $100 fund and, so long as the public is still lending, borrow and invest $900. If the last fund in the line starts to lose value, you no longer have the money to pay back your investors, and everyone gets massacred.\n\nIn a chapter from The Great Crash, 1929 titled \"In Goldman Sachs We Trust,\" the famed economist John Kenneth Galbraith held up the Blue Ridge and Shenandoah trusts as classic examples of the insanity of leveragebased investment. The trusts, he wrote, were a major cause of the market's historic crash; in today's dollars, the losses the bank suffered totaled $475 billion. \"It is difficult not to marvel at the imagination which was implicit in this gargantuan insanity,\" Galbraith observed, sounding like Keith Olbermann in an ascot. \"If there must be madness, something may be said for having it on a heroic scale.\"\n\nBUBBLE #2 Tech Stocks\n\nFast-forward about 65 years. Goldman not only survived the crash that wiped out so many of the investors it duped, it went on to become the chief underwriter to the country's wealthiest and most powerful corporations. Thanks to Sidney Weinberg, who rose from the rank of janitor's assistant to head the firm, Goldman became the pioneer of the initial public offering, one of the principal and most lucrative means by which companies raise money. During the 1970s and 1980s, Goldman may not have been the planet-eating Death Star of political influence it is today, but it was a top-drawer firm that had a reputation for attracting the very smartest talent on the Street.\n\nIt also, oddly enough, had a reputation for relatively solid ethics and a patient approach to investment that shunned the fast buck; its executives were trained to adopt the firm's mantra, \"long-term greedy.\" One former Goldman banker who left the firm in the early Nineties recalls seeing his superiors give up a very profitable deal on the grounds that it was a long-term loser. \"We gave back money to 'grownup' corporate clients who had made bad deals with us,\" he says. \"Everything we did was legal and fair \u2014 but 'long-term greedy' said we didn't want to make such a profit at the clients' collective expense that we spoiled the marketplace.\"\n\nBut then, something happened. It's hard to say what it was exactly; it might have been the fact that Goldman's cochairman in the early Nineties, Robert Rubin, followed Bill Clinton to the White House, where he directed the National Economic Council and eventually became Treasury secretary. While the American media fell in love with the story line of a pair of baby-boomer, Sixties-child, Fleetwood Mac yuppies nesting in the White House, it also nursed an undisguised crush on Rubin, who was hyped as without a doubt the smartest person ever to walk the face of the Earth, with Newton, Einstein, Mozart and Kant running far behind.\n\nRubin was the prototypical Goldman banker. He was probably born in a $4,000 suit, he had a face that seemed permanently frozen just short of an apology for being so much smarter than you, and he exuded a Spock-like, emotion-neutral exterior; the only human feeling you could imagine him experiencing was a nightmare about being forced to fly coach. It became almost a national clich\u00e8 that whatever Rubin thought was best for the economy \u2014 a phenomenon that reached its apex in 1999, when Rubin appeared on the cover of Time with his Treasury deputy, Larry Summers, and Fed chief Alan Greenspan under the headline The Committee To Save The World. And \"what Rubin thought,\" mostly, was that the American economy, and in particular the financial markets, were over-regulated and needed to be set free. During his tenure at Treasury, the Clinton White House made a series of moves that would have drastic consequences for the global economy \u2014 beginning with Rubin's complete and total failure to regulate his\nold firm during its first mad dash for obscene short-term profits.\n\nThe basic scam in the Internet Age is pretty easy even for the financially illiterate to grasp. Companies that weren't much more than potfueled ideas scrawled on napkins by uptoolate bongsmokers were taken public via IPOs, hyped in the media and sold to the public for mega-millions. It was as if banks like Goldman were wrapping ribbons around watermelons, tossing them out 50-story windows and opening the phones for bids. In this game you were a winner only if you took your money out before the melon hit the pavement.\nIt sounds obvious now, but what the average investor didn't know at the time was that the banks had changed the rules of the game, making the deals look better than they actually were. They did this by setting up what was, in reality, a two-tiered investment system \u2014 one for the insiders who knew the real numbers, and another for the lay investor who was invited to chase soaring prices the banks themselves knew were irrational. While Goldman's later pattern would be to capitalize on changes in the regulatory environment, its key innovation in the Internet years was to abandon its own industry's standards of quality control.\n\n\"Since the Depression, there were strict underwriting guidelines that Wall Street adhered to when taking a company public,\" says one prominent hedge-fund manager. \"The company had to be in business for a minimum of five years, and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. But Wall Street took these guidelines and threw them in the trash.\" Goldman completed the snow job by pumping up the sham stocks: \"Their analysts were out there saying Bullshit.com is worth $100 a share.\"\n\nThe problem was, nobody told investors that the rules had changed. \"Everyone on the inside knew,\" the manager says. \"Bob Rubin sure as hell knew what the underwriting standards were. They'd been intact since the 1930s.\"\n\nJay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida who specializes in IPOs, says banks like Goldman knew full well that many of the public offerings they were touting would never make a dime. \"In the early Eighties, the major underwriters insisted on three years of profitability. Then it was one year, then it was a quarter. By the time of the Internet bubble, they were not even requiring profitability in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nGoldman has denied that it changed its underwriting standards during the Internet years, but its own statistics belie the claim. Just as it did with the investment trust in the 1920s, Goldman started slow and finished crazy in the Internet years. After it took a little-known company with weak financials called Yahoo! public in 1996, once the tech boom had already begun, Goldman quickly became the IPO king of the Internet era. Of the 24 companies it took public in 1997, a third were losing money at the time of the IPO. In 1999, at the height of the boom, it took 47 companies public, including stillborns like Webvan and eToys, investment offerings that were in many ways the modern equivalents of Blue Ridge and Shenandoah. The following year, it underwrote 18 companies in the first four months, 14 of which were money losers at the time. As a leading underwriter of Internet stocks during the boom, Goldman provided profits far more volatile than those of its competitors: In 1999, the average Goldman IPO leapt 281 percent above its offering price, compared to the Wall Street average of 181 percent.\n\nHow did Goldman achieve such extraordinary results? One answer is that they used a practice called \"laddering,\" which is just a fancy way of saying they manipulated the share price of new offerings. Here's how it works: Say you're Goldman Sachs, and Bullshit.com comes to you and asks you to take their company public. You agree on the usual terms: You'll price the stock, determine how many shares should be released and take the Bullshit.com CEO on a \"road show\" to schmooze investors, all in exchange for a substantial fee (typically six to seven percent of the amount raised). You then promise your best clients the right to buy big chunks of the IPO at the low offering price \u2014 let's say Bullshit.com's starting share price is $15 \u2014 in exchange for a promise that they will buy more shares later on the open market. That seemingly simple demand gives you inside knowledge of the IPO's future, knowledge that wasn't disclosed to the day trader schmucks who only had the prospectus to go by: You know that certain of your clients who bought X amount of shares at $15 are also going to buy Y more shares at $20 or $25, virtually guaranteeing that the price is going to go to $25 and beyond. In this way, Goldman could artificially jack up the new company's price, which of course was to the bank's benefit \u2014 a six percent fee of a $500 million IPO is serious money.\n\nGoldman was repeatedly sued by shareholders for engaging in laddering in a variety of Internet IPOs, including Webvan and NetZero. The deceptive practices also caught the attention of Nicholas Maier, the syndicate manager of Cramer & Co., the hedge fund run at the time by the now-famous chattering television asshole Jim Cramer, himself a Goldman alum. Maier told the SEC that while working for Cramer between 1996 and 1998, he was repeatedly forced to engage in laddering practices during IPO deals with Goldman.\n\n\"Goldman, from what I witnessed, they were the worst perpetrator,\" Maier said. \"They totally fueled the bubble. And it's specifically that kind of behavior that has caused the market crash. They built these stocks upon an illegal foundation \u2014 manipulated up \u2014 and ultimately, it really was the small person who ended up buying in.\" In 2005, Goldman agreed to pay $40 million for its laddering violations \u2014 a puny penalty relative to the enormous profits it made. (Goldman, which has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases it has settled, refused to respond to questions for this story.)\n\nAnother practice Goldman engaged in during the Internet boom was \"spinning,\" better known as bribery. Here the investment bank would offer the executives of the newly public company shares at extra-low prices, in exchange for future underwriting business. Banks that engaged in spinning would then undervalue the initial offering price \u2014 ensuring that those \"hot\" opening-price shares it had handed out to insiders would be more likely to rise quickly, supplying bigger first-day rewards for the chosen few. So instead of Bullshit.com opening at $20, the bank would approach the Bullshit.com CEO and offer him a million shares of his own company at $18 in exchange for future business \u2014 effectively robbing all of Bullshit's new shareholders by diverting cash that should have gone to the company's bottom line into the private bank account of the company's CEO.\n\nIn one case, Goldman allegedly gave a multimillion-dollar special offering to eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who later joined Goldman's board, in exchange for future i-banking business. According to a report by the House Financial Services Committee in 2002, Goldman gave special stock offerings to executives in 21 companies that it took public, including Yahoo! cofounder Jerry Yang and two of the great slithering villains of the financial-scandal age \u2014 Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski and Enron's Ken Lay. Goldman angrily denounced the report as \"an egregious distortion of the facts\" \u2014 shortly before paying $110 million to settle an investigation into spinning and other manipulations launched by New York state regulators. \"The spinning of hot IPO shares was not a harmless corporate perk,\" then-attorney general Eliot Spitzer said at the time. \"Instead, it was an integral part of a fraudulent scheme to win new investment-banking business.\"\n\nSuch practices conspired to turn the Internet bubble into one of the greatest financial disasters in world history: Some $5 trillion of wealth was wiped out on the NASDAQ alone. But the real problem wasn't the money that was lost by shareholders, it was the money gained by investment bankers, who received hefty bonuses for tampering with the market. Instead of teaching Wall Street a lesson that bubbles always deflate, the Internet years demonstrated to bankers that in the age of freely flowing capital and publicly owned financial companies, bubbles are incredibly easy to inflate, and individual bonuses are actually bigger when the mania and the irrationality are greater.\n\nNowhere was this truer than at Goldman. Between 1999 and 2002, the firm paid out $28.5 billion in compensation and benefits \u2014 an average of roughly $350,000 a year per employee. Those numbers are important because the key legacy of the Internet boom is that the economy is now driven in large part by the pursuit of the enormous salaries and bonuses that such bubbles make possible. Goldman's mantra of \"long-term greedy\" vanished into thin air as the game became about getting your check before the melon hit the pavement.\n\nThe market was no longer a rationally managed place to grow real, profitable businesses: It was a huge ocean of Someone Else's Money where bankers hauled in vast sums through whatever means necessary and tried to convert that money into bonuses and payouts as quickly as possible. If you laddered and spun 50 Internet IPOs that went bust within a year, so what? By the time the Securities and Exchange Commission got around to fining your firm $110 million, the yacht you bought with your IPO bonuses was already six years old. Besides, you were probably out of Goldman by then, running the U.S. Treasury or maybe the state of New Jersey. (One of the truly comic moments in the history of America's recent financial collapse came when Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey, who ran Goldman from 1994 to 1999 and left with $320 million in IPO-fattened stock, insisted in 2002 that \"I've never even heard the term 'laddering' before.\")\nFor a bank that paid out $7 billion a year in salaries, $110 million fines issued half a decade late were something far less than a deterrent \u2014they were a joke. Once the Internet bubble burst, Goldman had no incentive to reassess its new, profit-driven strategy; it just searched around for another bubble to inflate. As it turns out, it had one ready, thanks in large part to Rubin.\n\nBUBBLE #3 The Housing Craze\n\nGoldman's role in the sweeping global disaster that was the housing bubble is not hard to trace. Here again, the basic trick was a decline in underwriting standards, although in this case the standards weren't in IPOs but in mortgages. By now almost everyone knows that for decades mortgage dealers insisted that home buyers be able to produce a down payment of 10 percent or more, show a steady income and good credit rating, and possess a real first and last name. Then, at the dawn of the new millennium, they suddenly threw all that shit out the window and started writing mortgages on the backs of napkins to cocktail waitresses and ex-cons carrying five bucks and a Snickers bar.\n\nNone of that would have been possible without investment bankers like Goldman, who created vehicles to package those shitty mortgages and sell them en masse to unsuspecting insurance companies and pension funds. This created a mass market for toxic debt that would never have existed before; in the old days, no bank would have wanted to keep some addict ex-con's mortgage on its books, knowing how likely it was to fail. You can't write these mortgages, in other words, unless you can sell them to someone who doesn't know what they are.\n\nGoldman used two methods to hide the mess they were selling. First, they bundled hundreds of different mortgages into instruments called Collateralized Debt Obligations. Then they sold investors on the idea that, because a bunch of those mortgages would turn out to be OK, there was no reason to worry so much about the shitty ones: The CDO, as a whole, was sound. Thus, junk-rated mortgages were turned into AAA-rated investments. Second, to hedge its own bets, Goldman got companies like AIG to provide insurance \u2014 known as credit default swaps \u2014 on the CDOs. The swaps were essentially a racetrack bet between AIG and Goldman: Goldman is betting the ex-cons will default, AIG is betting they won't.\n\nThere was only one problem with the deals: All of the wheeling and dealing represented exactly the kind of dangerous speculation that federal regulators are supposed to rein in. Derivatives like CDOs and credit swaps had already caused a series of serious financial calamities: Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings both lost fortunes, and Orange County, California, was forced to default in 1994. A report that year by the Government Accountability Office recommended that such financial instruments be tightly regulated \u2014 and in 1998, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a woman named Brooksley Born, agreed. That May, she circulated a letter to business leaders and the Clinton administration suggesting that banks be required to provide greater disclosure in derivatives trades, and maintain reserves to cushion against losses.\n\nMore regulation wasn\u2019t exactly what Goldman had in mind. \u201cThe banks go crazy \u2014 they want it stopped,\u201d says Michael Greenberger, who worked for Born as director of trading and markets at the CFTC and is now a law professor at the University of Maryland. \u201cGreenspan, Summers, Rubin and [SEC chief Arthur] Levitt want it stopped.\u201d\n\nClinton's reigning economic foursome \u2014 \u201cespecially Rubin,\u201d according to Greenberger \u2014 called Born in for a meeting and pleaded their case. She refused to back down, however, and continued to push for more regulation of the derivatives. Then, in June 1998, Rubin went public to denounce her move, eventually recommending that Congress strip the CFTC of its regulatory authority. In 2000, on its last day in session, Congress passed the now-notorious Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which had been inserted into an 11,000-page spending bill at the last minute, with almost no debate on the floor of the Senate. Banks were now free to trade default swaps with impunity.\n\nBut the story didn't end there. AIG, a major purveyor of default swaps, approached the New York State Insurance Department in 2000 and asked whether default swaps would be regulated as insurance. At the time, the office was run by one Neil Levin, a former Goldman vice president, who decided against regulating the swaps. Now freed to underwrite as many housing-based securities and buy as much credit-default protection as it wanted, Goldman went berserk with lending lust. By the peak of the housing boom in 2006, Goldman was underwriting $76.5 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities \u2014 a third of which were sub-prime \u2014 much of it to institutional investors like pensions and insurance companies. And in these massive issues of real estate were vast swamps of crap.\n\nTake one $494 million issue that year, GSAMP Trust 2006S3. Many of the mortgages belonged to second-mortgage borrowers, and the average equity they had in their homes was 0.71 percent. Moreover, 58 percent of the loans included little or no documentation \u2014 no names of the borrowers, no addresses of the homes, just zip codes. Yet both of the major ratings agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, rated 93 percent of the issue as investment grade. Moody's projected that less than 10 percent of the loans would default. In reality, 18 percent of the mortgages were in default within 18 months.\n\nNot that Goldman was personally at any risk. The bank might be taking all these hideous, completely irresponsible mortgages from beneath-gangster-status firms like Countrywide and selling them off to municipalities and pensioners \u2014 old people, for God's sake \u2014 pretending the whole time that it wasn't grade D horseshit. But even as it was doing so, it was taking short positions in the same market, in essence betting against the same crap it was selling. Even worse, Goldman bragged about it in public. \"The mortgage sector continues to be challenged,\" David Viniar, the bank's chief financial officer, boasted in 2007. \"As a result, we took significant markdowns on our long inventory positions \u2026 However, our risk bias in that market was to be short, and that net short position was profitable.\" In other words, the mortgages it was selling were for chumps. The real money was in betting against those same mortgages.\n\n\"That's how audacious these assholes are,\" says one hedge fund manager. \"At least with other banks, you could say that they were just dumb \u2014 they believed what they were selling, and it blew them up. Goldman knew what it was doing.\"\n\nI ask the manager how it could be that selling something to customers that you're actually betting against \u2014 particularly when you know more about the weaknesses of those products than the customer \u2014 doesn't amount to securities fraud.\n\n\"It's exactly securities fraud,\" he says. \"It's the heart of securities fraud.\"\n\nEventually, lots of aggrieved investors agreed. In a virtual repeat of the Internet IPO craze, Goldman was hit with a wave of lawsuits after the collapse of the housing bubble, many of which accused the bank of withholding pertinent information about the quality of the mortgages it issued. New York state regulators are suing Goldman and 25 other underwriters for selling bundles of crappy Countrywide mortgages to city and state pension funds, which lost as much as $100 million in the investments. Massachusetts also investigated Goldman for similar misdeeds, acting on behalf of 714 mortgage holders who got stuck holding predatory loans. But once again, Goldman got off virtually scot-free, staving off prosecution by agreeing to pay a paltry $60 million \u2014 about what the bank's CDO division made in a day and a half during the real estate boom.\n\nThe effects of the housing bubble are well known \u2014 it led more or less directly to the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG, whose toxic portfolio of credit swaps was in significant part composed of the insurance that banks like Goldman bought against their own housing portfolios. In fact, at least $13 billion of the taxpayer money given to AIG in the bailout ultimately went to Goldman, meaning that the bank made out on the housing bubble twice: It fucked the investors who bought their horseshit CDOs by betting against its own crappy product, then it turned around and fucked the taxpayer by making him pay off those same bets.\n\nAnd once again, while the world was crashing down all around the bank, Goldman made sure it was doing just fine in the compensation department. In 2006, the firm's payroll jumped to $16.5 billion \u2014 an average of $622,000 per employee. As a Goldman spokesman explained, \"We work very hard here.\"\n\nBut the best was yet to come. While the collapse of the housing bubble sent most of the financial world fleeing for the exits, or to jail, Goldman boldly doubled down \u2014 and almost single-handedly created yet another bubble, one the world still barely knows the firm had anything to do with.\n\nBUBBLE #4 $4 a Gallon\n\nBy the beginning of 2008, the financial world was in turmoil. Wall Street had spent the past two and a half decades producing one scandal after another, which didn't leave much to sell that wasn't tainted. The terms junk bond, IPO, sub-prime mortgage and other once-hot financial fare were now firmly associated in the public's mind with scams; the terms credit swaps and CDOs were about to join them. The credit markets were in crisis, and the mantra that had sustained the fantasy economy throughout the Bush years \u2014 the notion that housing prices never go down \u2014 was now a fully exploded myth, leaving the Street clamoring for a new bullshit paradigm to sling.\n\nWhere to go? With the public reluctant to put money in anything that felt like a paper investment, the Street quietly moved the casino to the physical-commodities market \u2014 stuff you could touch: corn, coffee, cocoa, wheat and, above all, energy commodities, especially oil. In conjunction with a decline in the dollar, the credit crunch and the housing crash caused a \"flight to commodities.\" Oil futures in particular skyrocketed, as the price of a single barrel went from around $60 in the middle of 2007 to a high of $147 in the summer of 2008.\n\nThat summer, as the presidential campaign heated up, the accepted explanation for why gasoline had hit $4.11 a gallon was that there was a problem with the world oil supply. In a classic example of how Republicans and Democrats respond to crises by engaging in fierce exchanges of moronic irrelevancies, John McCain insisted that ending the moratorium on offshore drilling would be \"very helpful in the short term,\" while Barack Obama in typical liberal-arts yuppie style argued that federal investment in hybrid cars was the way out.\n\nBut it was all a lie. While the global supply of oil will eventually dry up, the short-term flow has actually been increasing. In the six months before prices spiked, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the world oil supply rose from 85.24 million barrels a day to 85.72 million. Over the same period, world oil demand dropped from 86.82 million barrels a day to 86.07 million. Not only was the short-term supply of oil rising, the demand for it was falling \u2014 which, in classic economic terms, should have brought prices at the pump down.\n\nSo what caused the huge spike in oil prices? Take a wild guess. Obviously Goldman had help \u2014 there were other players in the physical commodities market \u2014 but the root cause had almost everything to do with the behavior of a few powerful actors determined to turn the once-solid market into a speculative casino. Goldman did it by persuading pension funds and other large institutional investors to invest in oil futures \u2014 agreeing to buy oil at a certain price on a fixed date. The push transformed oil from a physical commodity, rigidly subject to supply and demand, into something to bet on, like a stock. Between 2003 and 2008, the amount of speculative money in commodities grew from $13 billion to $317 billion, an increase of 2,300 percent. By 2008, a barrel of oil was traded 27 times, on average, before it was actually delivered and consumed.\n\nAs is so often the case, there had been a Depression-era law in place designed specifically to prevent this sort of thing. The commodities market was designed in large part to help farmers: A grower concerned about future price drops could enter into a contract to sell his corn at a certain price for delivery later on, which made him worry less about building up stores of his crop. When no one was buying corn, the farmer could sell to a middleman known as a \"traditional speculator,\" who would store the grain and sell it later, when demand returned. That way, someone was always there to buy from the farmer, even when the market temporarily had no need for his crops.\n\nIn 1936, however, Congress recognized that there should never be more speculators in the market than real producers and consumers. If that happened, prices would be affected by something other than supply and demand, and price manipulations would ensue. A new law empowered the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u2014 the very same body that would later try and fail to regulate credit swaps \u2014 to place limits on speculative trades in commodities. As a result of the CFTC's oversight, peace and harmony reigned in the commodities markets for more than 50 years.\n\nAll that changed in 1991 when, unbeknownst to almost everyone in the world, a Goldman-owned commodities-trading subsidiary called J. Aron wrote to the CFTC and made an unusual argument. Farmers with big stores of corn, Goldman argued, weren't the only ones who needed to hedge their risk against future price drops \u2014 Wall Street dealers who made big bets on oil prices also needed to hedge their risk, because, well, they stood to lose a lot too.\n\nThis was complete and utter crap \u2014 the 1936 law, remember, was specifically designed to maintain distinctions between people who were buying and selling real tangible stuff and people who were trading in paper alone. But the CFTC, amazingly, bought Goldman's argument. It issued the bank a free pass, called the \"Bona Fide Hedging\" exemption, allowing Goldman's subsidiary to call itself a physical hedger and escape virtually all limits placed on speculators. In the years that followed, the commission would quietly issue 14 similar exemptions to other companies.\n\nNow Goldman and other banks were free to drive more investors into the commodities markets, enabling speculators to place increasingly big bets. That 1991 letter from Goldman more or less directly led to the oil bubble in 2008, when the number of speculators in the market \u2014 driven there by fear of the falling dollar and the housing crash \u2014 finally overwhelmed the real physical suppliers and consumers. By 2008, at least three quarters of the activity on the commodity exchanges was speculative, according to a congressional staffer who studied the numbers \u2014 and that's likely a conservative estimate. By the middle of last summer, despite rising supply and a drop in demand, we were paying $4 a gallon every time we pulled up to the pump.\n\nWhat is even more amazing is that the letter to Goldman, along with most of the other trading exemptions, was handed out more or less in secret. \"I was the head of the division of trading and markets, and Brooksley Born was the chair of the CFTC,\" says Greenberger, \"and neither of us knew this letter was out there.\" In fact, the letters only came to light by accident. Last year, a staffer for the House Energy and Commerce Committee just happened to be at a briefing when officials from the CFTC made an offhand reference to the exemptions.\n\n\"I had been invited to a briefing the commission was holding on energy,\" the staffer recounts. \"And suddenly in the middle of it, they start saying, 'Yeah, we've been issuing these letters for years now.' I raised my hand and said, 'Really? You issued a letter? Can I see it?' And they were like, 'Duh, duh.' So we went back and forth, and finally they said, 'We have to clear it with Goldman Sachs.' I'm like, 'What do you mean, you have to clear it with Goldman Sachs?'\"\n\nThe CFTC cited a rule that prohibited it from releasing any information about a company's current position in the market. But the staffer's request was about a letter that had been issued 17 years earlier. It no longer had anything to do with Goldman's current position. What's more, Section 7 of the 1936 commodities law gives Congress the right to any information it wants from the commission. Still, in a classic example of how complete Goldman's capture of government is, the CFTC waited until it got clearance from the bank before it turned the letter over.\n\nArmed with the semi-secret government exemption, Goldman had become the chief designer of a giant commodities betting parlor. Its Goldman Sachs Commodities Index \u2014 which tracks the prices of 24 major commodities but is overwhelmingly weighted toward oil \u2014 became the place where pension funds and insurance companies and other institutional investors could make massive long-term bets on commodity prices. Which was all well and good, except for a couple of things. One was that index speculators are mostly \"long only\" bettors, who seldom if ever take short positions \u2014 meaning they only bet on prices to rise. While this kind of behavior is good for a stock market, it's terrible for commodities, because it continually forces prices upward. \"If index speculators took short positions as well as long ones, you'd see them pushing prices both up and down,\" says Michael Masters, a hedge fund manager who has helped expose the role of investment banks in the manipulation of oil prices. \"But they only push prices in one direction: up.\"\n\nComplicating matters even further was the fact that Goldman itself was cheerleading with all its might for an increase in oil prices. In the beginning of 2008, Arjun Murti, a Goldman analyst, hailed as an \"oracle of oil\" by The New York Times, predicted a \"super spike\" in oil prices, forecasting a rise to $200 a barrel. At the time Goldman was heavily invested in oil through its commodities trading subsidiary, J. Aron; it also owned a stake in a major oil refinery in Kansas, where it warehoused the crude it bought and sold. Even though the supply of oil was keeping pace with demand, Murti continually warned of disruptions to the world oil supply, going so far as to broadcast the fact that he owned two hybrid cars. High prices, the bank insisted, were somehow the fault of the piggish American consumer; in 2005, Goldman analysts insisted that we wouldn't know when oil prices would fall until we knew \"when American consumers will stop buying gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and instead seek fuel-efficient alternatives.\"\n\nBut it wasn't the consumption of real oil that was driving up prices \u2014 it was the trade in paper oil. By the summer of 2008, in fact, commodities speculators had bought and stockpiled enough oil futures to fill 1.1 billion barrels of crude, which meant that speculators owned more future oil on paper than there was real, physical oil stored in all of the country's commercial storage tanks and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve combined. It was a repeat of both the Internet craze and the housing bubble, when Wall Street jacked up present-day profits by selling suckers shares of a fictional fantasy future of endlessly rising prices.\n\nIn what was by now a painfully familiar pattern, the oil-commodities melon hit the pavement hard in the summer of 2008, causing a massive loss of wealth; crude prices plunged from $147 to $33. Once again the big losers were ordinary people. The pensioners whose funds invested in this crap got massacred: CalPERS, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, had $1.1 billion in commodities when the crash came. And the damage didn't just come from oil. Soaring food prices driven by the commodities bubble led to catastrophes across the planet, forcing an estimated 100 million people into hunger and sparking food riots throughout the Third World.\n\nNow oil prices are rising again: They shot up 20 percent in the month of May and have nearly doubled so far this year. Once again, the problem is not supply or demand. \"The highest supply of oil in the last 20 years is now,\" says Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat from Michigan who serves on the House energy committee. \"Demand is at a 10-year low. And yet prices are up.\"\n\nAsked why politicians continue to harp on things like drilling or hybrid cars, when supply and demand have nothing to do with the high prices, Stupak shakes his head. \"I think they just don't understand the problem very well,\" he says. \"You can't explain it in 30 seconds, so politicians ignore it.\"\n\nBUBBLE #5 Rigging the Bailout\n\nAfter the oil bubble collapsed last fall, there was no new bubble to keep things humming \u2014 this time, the money seems to be really gone, like worldwide-depression gone. So the financial safari has moved elsewhere, and the big game in the hunt has become the only remaining pool of dumb, unguarded capital left to feed upon: taxpayer money. Here, in the biggest bailout in history, is where Goldman Sachs really started to flex its muscle.\n\nIt began in September of last year, when then-Treasury secretary Paulson made a momentous series of decisions. Although he had already engineered a rescue of Bear Stearns a few months before and helped bail out quasi-private lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Paulson elected to let Lehman Brothers \u2014 one of Goldman's last real competitors \u2014 collapse without intervention. (\"Goldman's superhero status was left intact,\" says market analyst Eric Salzman, \"and an investment banking competitor, Lehman, goes away.\") The very next day, Paulson green-lighted a massive, $85 billion bailout of AIG, which promptly turned around and repaid $13 billion it owed to Goldman. Thanks to the rescue effort, the bank ended up getting paid in full for its bad bets: By contrast, retired auto workers awaiting the Chrysler bailout will be lucky to receive 50 cents for every dollar they are owed.\n\nImmediately after the AIG bailout, Paulson announced his federal bailout for the financial industry, a $700 billion plan called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and put a heretofore unknown 35-year-old Goldman banker named Neel Kashkari in charge of administering the funds. In order to qualify for bailout monies, Goldman announced that it would convert from an investment bank to a bank holding company, a move that allows it access not only to $10 billion in TARP funds, but to a whole galaxy of less conspicuous, publicly backed funding \u2014 most notably, lending from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. By the end of March, the Fed will have lent or guaranteed at least $8.7 trillion under a series of new bailout programs \u2014 and thanks to an obscure law allowing the Fed to block most congressional audits, both the amounts and the recipients of the monies remain almost entirely secret.\n\nConverting to a bank-holding company has other benefits as well: Goldman's primary supervisor is now the New York Fed, whose chairman at the time of its announcement was Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs. Friedman was technically in violation of Federal Reserve policy by remaining on the board of Goldman even as he was supposedly regulating the bank; in order to rectify the problem, he applied for, and got, a conflict of interest waiver from the government. Friedman was also supposed to divest himself of his Goldman stock after Goldman became a bank holding company, but thanks to the waiver, he was allowed to go out and buy 52,000 additional shares in his old bank, leaving him $3 million richer. Friedman stepped down in May, but the man now in charge of supervising Goldman \u2014 New York Fed president William Dudley \u2014 is yet another former Goldmanite.\n\nThe collective message of all this \u2014 the AIG bailout, the swift approval for its bank holding conversion, the TARP funds \u2014 is that when it comes to Goldman Sachs, there isn't a free market at all. The government might let other players on the market die, but it simply will not allow Goldman to fail under any circumstances. Its edge in the market has suddenly become an open declaration of supreme privilege. \"In the past it was an implicit advantage,\" says Simon Johnson, an economics professor at MIT and former official at the International Monetary Fund, who compares the bailout to the crony capitalism he has seen in Third World countries. \"Now it's more of an explicit advantage.\"\n\nOnce the bailouts were in place, Goldman went right back to business as usual, dreaming up impossibly convoluted schemes to pick the American carcass clean of its loose capital. One of its first moves in the post-bailout era was to quietly push forward the calendar it uses to report its earnings, essentially wiping December 2008 \u2014 with its $1.3 billion in pretax losses \u2014 off the books. At the same time, the bank announced a highly suspicious $1.8 billion profit for the first quarter of 2009 \u2014 which apparently included a large chunk of money funneled to it by taxpayers via the AIG bailout. \"They cooked those first quarter results six ways from Sunday,\" says one hedge fund manager. \"They hid the losses in the orphan month and called the bailout money profit.\"\n\nTwo more numbers stand out from that stunning first-quarter turnaround. The bank paid out an astonishing $4.7 billion in bonuses and compensation in the first three months of this year, an 18 percent increase over the first quarter of 2008. It also raised $5 billion by issuing new shares almost immediately after releasing its first quarter results. Taken together, the numbers show that Goldman essentially borrowed a $5 billion salary payout for its executives in the middle of the global economic crisis it helped cause, using half-baked accounting to reel in investors, just months after receiving billions in a taxpayer bailout.\n\nEven more amazing, Goldman did it all right before the government announced the results of its new \"stress test\" for banks seeking to repay TARP money \u2014 suggesting that Goldman knew exactly what was coming. The government was trying to carefully orchestrate the repayments in an effort to prevent further trouble at banks that couldn't pay back the money right away. But Goldman blew off those concerns, brazenly flaunting its insider status. \"They seemed to know everything that they needed to do before the stress test came out, unlike everyone else, who had to wait until after,\" says Michael Hecht, a managing director of JMP Securities. \"The government came out and said, 'To pay back TARP, you have to issue debt of at least five years that is not insured by FDIC \u2014 which Goldman Sachs had already done, a week or two before.\"\n\nAnd here's the real punch line. After playing an intimate role in four historic bubble catastrophes, after helping $5 trillion in wealth disappear from the NASDAQ, after pawning off thousands of toxic mortgages on pensioners and cities, after helping to drive the price of gas up to $4 a gallon and to push 100 million people around the world into hunger, after securing tens of billions of taxpayer dollars through a series of bailouts overseen by its former CEO, what did Goldman Sachs give back to the people of the United States in 2008?\n\nFourteen million dollars.\n\nThat is what the firm paid in taxes in 2008, an effective tax rate of exactly one, read it, one percent. The bank paid out $10 billion in compensation and benefits that same year and made a profit of more than $2 billion \u2014 yet it paid the Treasury less than a third of what it forked over to CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who made $42.9 million last year.\n\nHow is this possible? According to Goldman's annual report, the low taxes are due in large part to changes in the bank's \"geographic earnings mix.\" In other words, the bank moved its money around so that most of its earnings took place in foreign countries with low tax rates. Thanks to our completely fucked corporate tax system, companies like Goldman can ship their revenues offshore and defer taxes on those revenues indefinitely, even while they claim deductions upfront on that same untaxed income. This is why any corporation with an at least occasionally sober accountant can usually find a way to zero out its taxes. A GAO report, in fact, found that between 1998 and 2005, roughly two-thirds of all corporations operating in the U.S. paid no taxes at all.\n\nThis should be a pitchfork-level outrage \u2014 but somehow, when Goldman released its post-bailout tax profile, hardly anyone said a word. One of the few to remark on the obscenity was Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee. \"With the right hand out begging for bailout money,\" he said, \"the left is hiding it offshore.\"\n\nBUBBLE #6 Global Warming\n\nFast-forward to today. It's early June in Washington, D.C. Barack Obama, a popular young politician whose leading private campaign donor was an investment bank called Goldman Sachs \u2014 its employees paid some $981,000 to his campaign \u2014 sits in the White House. Having seamlessly navigated the political minefield of the bailout era, Goldman is once again back to its old business, scouting out loopholes in a new government-created market with the aid of a new set of alumni occupying key government jobs.\n\nGone are Hank Paulson and Neel Kashkari; in their place are Treasury chief of staff Mark Patterson and CFTC chief Gary Gensler, both former Goldmanites. (Gensler was the firm's co-head of finance.) And instead of credit derivatives or oil futures or mortgage-backed CDOs, the new game in town, the next bubble, is in carbon credits \u2014 a booming trillion dollar market that barely even exists yet, but will if the Democratic Party that it gave $4,452,585 to in the last election manages to push into existence a groundbreaking new commodities bubble, disguised as an \"environmental plan,\" called cap-and-trade.\n\nThe new carbon credit market is a virtual repeat of the commodities-market casino that's been kind to Goldman, except it has one delicious new wrinkle: If the plan goes forward as expected, the rise in prices will be government-mandated. Goldman won't even have to rig the game. It will be rigged in advance.\n\nHere's how it works: If the bill passes, there will be limits for coal plants, utilities, natural-gas distributors and numerous other industries on the amount of carbon emissions (a.k.a. greenhouse gases) they can produce per year. If the companies go over their allotment, they will be able to buy \"allocations\" or credits from other companies that have managed to produce fewer emissions. President Obama conservatively estimates that about $646 billion worth of carbon credits will be auctioned in the first seven years; one of his top economic aides speculates that the real number might be twice or even three times that amount.\n\nThe feature of this plan that has special appeal to speculators is that the \"cap\" on carbon will be continually lowered by the government, which means that carbon credits will become more and more scarce with each passing year. Which means that this is a brand new commodities market where the main commodity to be traded is guaranteed to rise in price over time. The volume of this new market will be upwards of a trillion dollars annually; for comparison's sake, the annual combined revenues of all electricity suppliers in the U.S. total $320 billion.\n\nGoldman wants this bill. The plan is (1) to get in on the ground floor of paradigm-shifting legislation, (2) make sure that they're the profit-making slice of that paradigm and (3) make sure the slice is a big slice. Goldman started pushing hard for cap-and-trade long ago, but things really ramped up last year when the firm spent $3.5 million to lobby climate issues. (One of their lobbyists at the time was none other than Patterson, now Treasury chief of staff.) Back in 2005, when Hank Paulson was chief of Goldman, he personally helped author the bank's environmental policy, a document that contains some surprising elements for a firm that in all other areas has been consistently opposed to any sort of government regulation. Paulson's report argued that \"voluntary action alone cannot solve the climate change problem.\" A few years later, the bank's carbon chief, Ken Newcombe, insisted that cap-and-trade alone won't be enough to fix the climate problem and called for further public investments in research and development. Which is convenient, considering that Goldman made early investments in wind power (it bought a subsidiary called Horizon Wind Energy), renewable diesel (it is an investor in a firm called Changing World Technologies) and solar power (it partnered with BP Solar), exactly the kind of deals that will prosper if the government forces energy producers to use cleaner energy. As Paulson said at the time, \"We're not making those investments to lose money.\"\n\nThe bank owns a 10 percent stake in the Chicago Climate Exchange, where the carbon credits will be traded. Moreover, Goldman owns a minority stake in Blue Source LLC, a Utah-based firm that sells carbon credits of the type that will be in great demand if the bill passes. Nobel Prize winner Al Gore, who is intimately involved with the planning of cap-and-trade, started up a company called Generation Investment Management with three former bigwigs from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, David Blood, Mark Ferguson and Peter Harris. Their business? Investing in carbon offsets. There's also a $500 million Green Growth Fund set up by a Goldmanite to invest in green-tech \u2026 the list goes on and on. Goldman is ahead of the headlines again, just waiting for someone to make it rain in the right spot. Will this market be bigger than the energy futures market?\n\n\"Oh, it'll dwarf it,\" says a former staffer on the House energy committee.\n\nWell, you might say, who cares? If cap-and-trade succeeds, won't we all be saved from the catastrophe of global warming? Maybe \u2014 but cap-and-trade, as envisioned by Goldman, is really just a carbon tax structured so that private interests collect the revenues. Instead of simply imposing a fixed government levy on carbon pollution and forcing unclean energy producers to pay for the mess they make, cap-and-trade will allow a small tribe of greedy-as-hell Wall Street swine to turn yet another commodities market into a private tax collection scheme. This is worse than the bailout: It allows the bank to seize taxpayer money before it's even collected.\n\n\"If it's going to be a tax, I would prefer that Washington set the tax and collect it,\" says Michael Masters, the hedge fund director who spoke out against oil futures speculation. \"But we're saying that Wall Street can set the tax, and Wall Street can collect the tax. That's the last thing in the world I want. It's just asinine.\"\n\nCap-and-trade is going to happen. Or, if it doesn't, something like it will. The moral is the same as for all the other bubbles that Goldman helped create, from 1929 to 2009. In almost every case, the very same bank that behaved recklessly for years, weighing down the system with toxic loans and predatory debt, and accomplishing nothing but massive bonuses for a few bosses, has been rewarded with mountains of virtually free money and government guarantees \u2014 while the actual victims in this mess, ordinary taxpayers, are the ones paying for it.\n\nIt's not always easy to accept the reality of what we now routinely allow these people to get away with; there's a kind of collective denial that kicks in when a country goes through what America has gone through lately, when a people lose as much prestige and status as we have in the past few years. You can't really register the fact that you're no longer a citizen of a thriving first-world democracy, that you're no longer above getting robbed in broad daylight, because like an amputee, you can still sort of feel things that are no longer there.\n\nBut this is it. This is the world we live in now. And in this world, some of us have to play by the rules, while others get a note from the principal excusing them from homework till the end of time, plus 10 billion free dollars in a paper bag to buy lunch. It's a gangster state, running on gangster economics, and even prices can't be trusted anymore; there are hidden taxes in every buck you pay.

Into the parking lot of a local hamburger stand pulls a chromed-out black Mercedes SUV, driven by 27-year-old Kendrick Lamar, arguably the most talented rapper of his generation. there are a half-dozen guys from the neighborhood waiting to meet him: L, Turtle, G-Weed. \"I grew up with all these cats,\" Lamar says. He nods to Mingo, a Compton-born sweetheart who is roughly the size of the truck he arrived in: \"I don't need to hire a bodyguard. Look how fucking big he is!\" The burger joint, Tam's, sits at the corner of Rosecrans and Central, a famous local spot recently made infamous when Suge Knight allegedly ran over two men with his truck in the parking lot, killing one of them. \"Homey died right here,\" G-Weed says, pointing to a dark spot on the asphalt. \"That security camera caught everything. They're building a case.\"\n\nLamar grew up just six blocks from here, in a little blue three-bedroom house at 1612 137th St. Across the street is the Louisiana Fried Chicken where he used to get the three-piece meal with fries and lemonade; over there is the Rite Aid where he walked to buy milk for his little brothers. Tam's was another hangout. \"This is where I seen my second murder, actually.\" he says. \"Eight years old, walking home from McNair Elementary. Dude was in the drive-thru ordering his food, and homey ran up, boom boom - smoked him.\" He saw his first murder at age five, a teenage drug dealer gunned down outside Lamar's apartment building. \"After that,\" he says, \"you just get numb to it.\"\n\nIt's almost noon, but Lamar is just starting his day - having spent a late night in the studio scrambling to finish his new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, which has to be done in five days. He's dressed casually in a gray hoodie, maroon sweatpants, and white socks with black slides, but recognizable enough that an old lady in line decides to tease him while complaining about the heat inside. \"Y'all need to put the air conditioner on,\" she calls to the manager. \"Kendrick Lamar is here!\"\n\nLamar may be a two-time Grammy winner with a platinum debut executive-produced by Dr. Dre, and with fans from Kanye West to Taylor Swift. But here at Tam's, he's also Kendrick Duckworth, Paula and Kenny's son. Inside, a middle-aged woman who just left church comes up and gives him a hug, and he buys lunch for a cart-toting lady he knows used to be a harmless crack addict. (\"She used to chase us with sticks and stuff, he says.) Outside, an old man in a motorized wheelchair scoots over to introduce himself. He says he moved here in 1951, when Compton was still majority-white. \"Back in the day, we had the baddest cars in L.A.,\" he says. \"I just wanted you to know where you came from. It's a hell of a neighborhood.\"\n\nOn his breakthrough album, 2012's good kid, m.A.A.d City, Lamar made his name by chronicling this neighborhood, vividly evoking a specific place (this same stretch of Rosecrans) and a specific time (in the summer of 2004, between 10th and 11th grade). It was a concept album about adolescence, told with cinematic precision through the eyes of someone young enough to recall every detail (as in: \"Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota/A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, one orange soda\")\n\nLamar's parents moved here from Chicago in 1984, three years before Kendrick was born. His dad, Kenny Duckworth, was reportedly running with a South Side street gang called the Gangster Disciples, so his mom, Paula Oliver, issued an ultimatum. \"She said, 'I can't fuck with you if you ain't trying to better yourself,'\" Lamar recounts. \"'We can't be in the streets forever.'\" They stuffed their clothes in two black garbage bags and boarded a train to California with $500. \"They were going to go to San Bernardino,\" Lamar says. \"But my Auntie Tina was in Compton. She got 'em a hotel until they got on their feet, and my mom got a job at McDonald's.\" For the first couple of years, they slept in their car or motels, or in the park when it was hot enough. \"Eventually, they saved enough money to get their first apartment, and that's when they had me.\"\nLamar has a lot of good memories of Compton as a kid: riding bikes, doing back flips off friends' roofs, sneaking into the living room during his parents' house parties. (\"I'd catch him in the middle of the dance floor with his shirt off,\" his mom says. \"Like, 'What the...? Get back in that room!'\") Then there's one of his earliest memories - the afternoon of April 29th, 1992, the first day of the South Central riots\n\nKendrick was four. \"I remember riding with my pops down Bullis Road, and looking out the window and seeing motherfuckers just running,\" he says. \"I can see smoke. We stop, and my pops goes into the AutoZone and comes out rolling four tires. I know he didn't buy them. I'm like, 'What's going on?'\" (Says Kenny, \"We were all taking stuff. That's the way it was in the riots!\")\n\n\"Then we get to the house,\" Lamar continues, \"and him and my uncles are like, 'We fixing to get this, we fixing to get that, we fixing to get all this shit!' I'm thinking they're robbing. There's some real mayhem going on in L.A. Then, as time progresses, I'm watching the news, hearing about Rodney King and all this, I said to my mom, 'So the police beat up a black man, and now everybody's mad? Ok. I get it now.'\"\n\nWe've been sitting on the patio a while when Lamar sees someone he knows at the bus stop. \"Matt Jeezy! What up, bro?\" Matt Jeezy nods. \"That's my boy,\" Lamar says. \"He's part of the inner circle.\" Lamar has a few friends like this, guys he's known all his life. But often he'd rather be by himself\n\n\"He was always a loner,\" Kendrick's mom says. Lamar agrees: \"I was always in the corner of the room watching.\" He has two little brothers and one younger sister, but until he was seven, he was an only child. He was so precocious his parents nicknamed him Man-Man. \"I grew up fast as fuck,\" he says. \"My moms used to walk me home from school - we didn't have no car - and we'd talk from the county building to the welfare office.\" \"He would ask me questions about Section 8 and the Housing Authority, so I'd explain it to him,\" his mom says. \"I was keeping it real.\"\n\nThe Duckworths survived on welfare and food stamps, and Paula did hair for $20 a head. His dad had a job at KFC, but at a certain point, says Lamar, \"I realized his work schedule wasn't really adding up.\" It wasn't until later that he suspected Kenny was probably making money off the streets. \"They wanted to keep me innocent,\" Lamar says now. \"I love them for that.\" To this day, he and his dad have never discussed it. \"I don't know what type of demons he has,\" Lamar says, \"but I don't wanna bring them shits up.\" (Says Kenny, \"I don't want to talk about that bad time. But I did what I had to do.\")\n\nThere's a famous story from Tom Petty's childhood in which a 10-year-old Tom sees Elvis shooting a movie near his hometown in Florida, takes on look at the white Cadillac and the girls, and decides to become a rock star on the spot. Lamar has a similar story - only for him it's sitting on his dad's shoulders outside the Compton Swap Meet, age eight, watching Dr. Dre and 2Pac shoot a video for \"California Love.\" \"I want to say they were in a white Bentley,\" Lamar says. (It was actually black.) \"These motorcycle cops trying to conduct traffic but one almost scraped the car, and Pac stood up on the passenger seat, like, 'Yo, what the fuck!'\" He laughs. \"Yelling at the police, just like on his motherfucking songs. He gave us what we wanted.\"\n\nBeing a rapper was far from preordained for Lamar. As late as middle school, he had a noticeable stutter. \"Just certain words,\" he says. \"It came when I was excited or in trouble.\" He loved basketball - he was short, but quick - and dreamed of making it to the NBA. But in seventh grade, an English teacher named Mr. Inge turned him on to poetry - rhymes, metaphors, double-entendres - and Lamar fell in love. \"You could put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and they'd make sense to you,\" he says. \"I liked that.\"\n\nAt home, Lamar started writing non-stop. \"We used to wonder what he was doing with all that paper,\" his dad says. \"I thought he was doing homework! I didn't know he was writing lyrics.\" \"I had never heard him say profanity before,\" says his mom. \"Then I found his little rap lyrics, and it was all 'Eff you.' 'D-i-c-k.' I'm like, 'Oh, my God! Kendrick's a cusser!'\"\n\nAn A student, Lamar flirted with the idea of going to college. \"I could have went. I should have went.\" (He still might: \"It's always in the back of my mind. It's not too late.\") But by the time he was in high school, he was running with a bad crowd. This is the crew he raps about on good kid, m.A.A.d City - the ones doing robberies, home invasions, running from the cops\n\nOnce his mom found a bloody hospital gown, from a trip he took to the ER with \"one of his little homeys who got smoked.\" Another time she found him curled up crying in the front yard. She thought he was sad because his grandmother had just died: \"I didn't know somebody had shot at him.\" One night, the police knocked on their door and said he was involved in an incident in their neighborhood, and his parents, in a bout of tough love, kicked him out for two days. \"And that's a scary thing,\" Lamar says, \"because you might not come back.\"\n\nAfter a couple of hours, the mood on Rosecrans starts to shift. An ambulance roars by, sirens blaring. In the middle of the street, a homeless man is shouting at passing cars. Lamar starts to grow uneasy, his eyes glancing at the corners. I ask if everything's OK. \"It's the temperature,\" he says. \"It's uh, raising a little bit.\" A few minutes later, one of his friends - who's been cruising back and forth on his bicycle all afternoon, \"patrolling the perimeter\" - calls out, \"Rollers!\" and a few seconds later, two L.A. County sherrif cruisers round the corner. \"There they go,\" Lamar says, as they hit their lights and take off\n\nAs a teenager, \"the majority of my interactions with police were not good,\" Lamar says. \"There were a few good ones who were actually protecting the community. But then you have ones from the Valley. They never met me in their life, but since I'm a kid in basketball shorts and a white T-shirt, they wanna slam me on the hood of the car. Sixteen years old,\" he says, nodding toward the street. \"Right there by that bus stop. Even if he's not a good kid, that don't give you the right to slam a minor on the ground, or pull a pistol on him.\"\nYou might also likeLamar says he's had police pull guns on him on two occasions. The first was when he was 17, cruising around Compton with his friend Moose. He says a cop spotted their flashy green Camaro and pulled them over, and when Moose couldn't find his license fast enough, the cop pulled a gun. \"He literally put the beam on my boy's head,\" Lamar recalls. \"I remember driving off in a silence, feeling violated, and him being so angry a tear dropped from his eye.\" The story of the second time is murkier: Lamar won't say what he and his friends were up to, only that a cop drew his gun and they ran. \"We was in the wrong,\" he admits. \"But we just kids. It's not worth pulling your gun out over. Especially when we running away.\"\n\nFriends of his weren't so lucky. Just after midnight on June 13th, 2007, officers from the LAPD's Southeast Division responded to a domestic-violence call on East 120th Street, about five minutes from Lamar's house. There, they found his good friend D.T. allegedly holding a 10-inch knife. According to police, D.T. charged, and an officer opened fire, killing him. \"It never really quite added up,\" Lamar says. \"But here's the crazy thing. Normally when we find out somebody got killed, the first thing we say is 'Who did it? Where we gotta go?' It's a gang altercation. But this time it was the police - the biggest gang in California. You'll never win against them.\"\n\nOn an otherwise positive song called \"Hiiipower,\" from his 2011 mixtape Section.80, Lamar rapped, \"I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol/Aim it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is going to miss you.\" It's an unsettling line, especially coming from a rapper who often subverts gangster tropes but rarely trafficks in them. \"I was angry,\" he says. \"To be someone with a good heart, and to still be harassed as a kid...it took a toll on me. Soon you're just saying, 'Fuck everything.' That line was me getting those frustrations out. And I'm glad I could get them out with a pen and a paper.\"\n\nAbout three years ago, Lamar was flipping through the channels on his tour bus when he saw on the news a report that a 16-year old named Trayvon Martin had been shot to death in a Florida subdivision. \"It just put a whole new anger inside me,\" Lamar says. \"It made me remember how I felt. Being harassed, my partners being killed.\" He grabbed a pen and started writing, and within an hour, he had rough verses for a new song, \"The Blacker the Berry\":Coming from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big\nMy nose is round and wide\nYou hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people\nYour plan is to terminate my culture...But as soon as Lamar wrote, he also started thinking about his own time in the streets and \"all the wrong I've done.\" So he started writing a new verse, in which he turned the microscope on himself. How can he criticize America for killing young black men, he asks, when young black men are often just as good at it? As the song's narrator put it, \"Why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street/When gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?/Hypocrite\"\n\nWhen it was finally released last month, the song sparked a rash of think pieces, with some listeners saying Lamar was ignoring the real problem: the systemic racism that created the conditions for black-on-black crime in the first place. Coupled with a recent Billboard interview in which Lamar seemed to suggest that some of the responsibility for preventing killings like that of Michael Brown lay with black people themselves, some fans thought he sounded like a right-wing apologist. The rapper Azealia Banks called his comments \"the dumbest shit I've ever heard a black man say.\"\n\nLamar says he's not an idiot. \"I know the history,\" he says. \"I'm not talking about that. I'm talking from a personal standpoint. I'm talking about gangbanging\n\nHe grew up surrounded by gangs. Some of his close friends were West Side Pirus, a local Blood affiliate, and his mom says her brothers were Compton Crips. One of his uncles did a 15-year stretch for robbery, and another is locked up now for the same; his Uncle Tony, meanwhile, was shot in the head at a burger stand when kendrick was a boy. But Lamar says he was taught that change starts from within. \"My moms always told me: 'How long you gonna play the victim?'\" he says. \"I can say I'm mad and I hate everything, but nothing really changes until I change myself. So no matter how much bullshit we've been through as a community, I'm strong enough to say fuck that, and acknowledge myself and my own struggles.\"\n\nWhen Lamar released the new album's first single, \"i,\" last September, many fans weren't sure what to make of it. A blast of pop positivity that samples an Isley Brothers hit recently heard soundtracking a Swiffer commercial, it felt like an odd move for Lamar, who's known for more complex fare. People called it corny, mocked its feel-good, \"Happy\"-style chorus (\"I love myself!\"). \"I know people might think that means I'm conceited or something,\" Lamar says. \"No. It means I'm depressed.\"\n\nLamar is sitting in the Santa Monica recording studio where he made much of his new album, dressed in a charcoal sweatsuit and Reeboks. His baseball cap is pulled low over his sprouting braids, and he speaks softly and thoughtfully, with long pauses between sentences\n\n\"I've woken up in the morning and felt like shit,\" he says. \"Feeling guilty. Feeling angry. Feeling regretful. As a kid from Compton, you can get all the success in the world and still question your worth.\"\n\nLamar says he intended \"i\" as a \"Keep Ya Head Up\"-style message for his friends in the penitentiary. But he also wrote it for himself, to ward off dark thoughts. \"My partner Jason Estrada told me, 'If you don't attack it, it will attack you,'\" Lamar says. \"If you sit around moping, feeling sad and stagnant, it's gonna eat you alive. I had to make that record. It's a reminder. It makes me feel good.\"\nLamar also points out that the fans who scratched their heads at \"i\" had yet to hear \"u\" - its counterpoint on the album. \"'i' is the answer to 'u,'\" he says. The latter is four and a half minutes of devastating honesty, with Lamar almost sopping over a discordant beat, berating himself about his lack of confidence and calling himself \"a fucking failure.\" It's the sound of a man staring into the mirror and hating what he sees, punctuated by a self-aware hook: \"Loving you is complicated.\"\n\n\"That was one of the hardest songs I had to write,\" he says. \"There's some very dark moments in there. All my insecurities and selfishness and letdowns. That shit is depressing as a motherfucker. But it helps, though,\" he says. \"It helps.\"\n\nLamar has documented his inner struggles before, most notably on \"Swimming Pools,\" from good kid, which explores his past troubles with alcohol and his family's history of addiction. But once he got successful, he says, things got more difficult, not less. One of his biggest issues was self esteem - accepting that he deserved to be where he was. And some of that came from his discomfort around white people\n\n\"I'm going to be 100 percent real with you,\" Lamar says. \"In all my days of schooling, from preschool all the way up to 12th grade, there was not one white person in my class. Literally zero.\" Before he started touring, he had barely left Compton; when he finally did, the culture shock threw him. \"Imagine only discovering that when you're 25,\" Lamar says. \"You're around people you don't know how to communicate with. You don't speak the same lingo. It brings confusion and insecurity. Questioning how did I get here, what am I doing? That was a cycle I had to break quick. But at the same time, you're excited, because you're in a different environment. The world keeps going outside the neighborhood.\"\n\nThe week good kid was released, Lamar began keeping a diary. \"It really came from the conversations I had with Dre,\" he says. \"Hearing him tell stories about all these moments, and how it went by like that\" - he snaps. \"I didn't want to forget how I was feeling when my album dropped, or when I went back to Compton.\"\n\nLamar ended up filling multiple notebooks. \"There's a lot of weird shit in there,\" he says. \"Lot of drawings, visuals.\" Where as good kid was an exercise in millennial nostalgia, To Pimp a Butterfly is firmly in the present. It's his take on what it means to be young and black in America today - and more specifically, what it means to be Kendrick Lamar, navigating success, expectation and his own self-doubt\n\nMusically, the album - at least the half that he's comfortable sharing so far - is adventurous, borrowing from free jazz and 1970s funk. Lamar says he listened to a lot of Miles Davis and Parliament. His producer Mark \"Sounwave\" Spears, who's known Lamar since he was 16, says, \"Every producer I've ever met was sending me stuff - but there was a one-in-a-million chance you could send us a beat that actually fit what we were doing.\" Ali says Lamar works synesthetically - \"He talks in colors all the time: 'Make it sound purple.' 'Make it sound light green.'\"\n\nBut of all the album's colors, the most prominent is black. There are allusions to the entire sweep of African-American history, from the dispora to the cotton fields to the Harlem renaissance to Obama. \"Mortal Man\" (inspired in part by a 2014 trip to South Africa) name-checks leaders from Mandela to MLK all the way back to moses. On \"King Kunta,\" a stomping blast of James Brown funk, he imagines himself as the titular slave from Roots, shouting the punchline \"Everybody wanna cut the legs off him!/Black man taking no losses!\"\n\nHanging over it all, of course, are the tragedies of the past three years: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice. Says Sounwave, \"To me, the album is perfect for right now. If the world was happy, maybe we'd give you a happy album. But right now, we are not happy.\"\n\nLamar - who calls the album \"fearful, honest and unapologetic\" - is coy about what the title means. \"Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'butterfly'...\" he says, then laughs. \"It's a trip. That's something that will be a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses - I truly believe that.\" I ask if he's the pimp or the butterfly, and he just smiles. \"I could be both,\" he says\n\nOn the last day of February, Lamar and two dozen loved ones are gathered at a $6 million mansion in Calabasas, for a surprise birthday party for Sounwave. The estate belongs to \"Top Dawg\" Tiffeth, part of a group of properties so exclusive they're protected by two security gates, the second presumably to keep out the riff-raff inhabiting the mansions inside the first. NBA star Paul Pierce lives across the street, and multiple Kardashians live around the block. There's probably a million dollars in this driveway,\" says Lamar's tour manager, a friendly dude named retOne, as he surveys the Audis, Benzes and Range Rovers out front\n\nLamar lives down the coast with his longtime girlfriend, Whitney (he has called her his \"best friend\"), in a tri-level condo he rents in the South Bay, on the water. He still hasn't splurged on much: So far his biggest purchase is a relatively modest house in the suburbs east of L.A., which he bought for his parents more than a year ago. Top Dawg says that at first his mom didn't want to take it, because it meant giving up their Section 8 status. Kendrick had to reassure her: \"It's OK, Mom. We're good.\" (\"It was hard times, and we've been through a lot,\" says Kenny. \"But like Drake said: 'We started from the bottom, now we're here.'\")\n\nIn the kitchen, the girls are snacking and chatting, while the guys are in the home theater watching the new Kobe documentary. In the dining room, Lamar is talking to Sounwave and his manager Dave Free, trying to make last-minute changes to the record that's due out in two weeks\n\nEventually, Whitney comes in and rests her hand on Lamar's shoulder. \"They're about the blow out the candles,\" she says. Everyone moves into the kitchen to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to Sounwave, and Lamar stands beside Whitney, his arm around her waist. They look happy. Sounwave is about to blow out the candles when someone tells him to make a wish - but before he can, Lamar jumps in and makes one for him. \"I wish,\" he says, smiling, \"for hot beats!\"16Embed"},

LyricsIt's the hard knock life but never underestimate me\n\nErr,Let me tell you my story\nWhen I was young I always saw my momma crying\nWould go like \"Fucks wrong with this bitch?\"\nMy dad be sledgin' me like I'm a fuckin' Aussie on the pitch\nWould be the untouched at the weddings and fuckin' odd dinners\nFat kid on the block,not to forget Uni brow midget guy\nNow all these girls thinkin' I'm attractive\n\"Oh he's so attractive\"\nTables turn so quick,I never knew\nMet this guy,thought he had changed my life but then I woke back into the reality,straight went to fap\nWant to be a rapper,I have other plans too\nNever was this good,now I'm goin' \"Ooh\"\nMet the love of my life,never mind boo\nI'm a failure at school\nThese motherfuckers just don't get me\nI'm almost betrayed every fuckin' day\nI Give life to my lifeless soul,for a second I thought I was in Seoul,Damn I'm so bored\nDespite the fact I love my girl,but I just don't like her\nEverywhere I look it's the same old scenes going past me\nI don't want to be a victim of reality\nSucidal thoughts is what hype me\nI'm not mainstream,bitch I am the man on this street\nGetting heat,3rd quarter still can't get my god damn seat\nI get what I desire but still something is missing\nShit,I sound like a fuckin' sissy\nI love God but do I love God?\nI love God but do I serve god?\nYou see what I did there?\nKilluminati,Eyes closed,Illuminati\nI just would love to have fun with somebody\nLet's throw some party and get naughty\nThen Publish as the best nominee\nShit,I ain't gettin' broad\nSo,I'mma probably go like \"Fuck the world\"\nStruggled all through my life\nAt the end of the day it's just who you are and who you choose to be\nAnd you are?\n\nI'm the one who keep makin' it like I'm on some focused shit\nAll this time,I'm just playing my part.I ain't doing shit\nPaul Mitchell for my hair,just so your bitch knows\nThe reason why I'm fresher than your ho\nI keep it gold,Head to toe.Who you trying to buy my boy? I'll never get sold\nI'm On that same old motto,your girl just cracked up.The fake Manolo might made her wacked up\nI'm just fed up,All this shit got me messed up\nJust sick and tired of being sick and tired\nHeard you said something,it's okay cuz I was just nut busting\nFuck around I was never trusting on you anyways\n3 in the morning,I'm on this lavish Airways\nI keep doing it like it's my motherfucking job\nOnly one who made it out through the dark\nYoungin's need inspiration but the G.O.V.T just given' em Asprinations\nI never get dictated cuz I'm the Adolf.Sagafillini myself\nFuck that,let's get us some wealth\nSmokin' loud,riskin' my health\nI'm just depressed\nI got people on my back,I'm never gonna tell\nJus' when I thought it felt like I was at the end of the road\nMy boy O,gave me an antidote\n100 was the call,we just made it more\nHe's the day one guy,keep it real,I ain't fuckin' with any other friend\nStop claimin',You never gonna be famous\nOnly God can judge me,so stop complainin'\nNever thought I could fuck with the fairest girl on the planet,I did it\nBut ain't no love for you hoes cuz y'll crazy\nJust check out my wrist\nTake a glimpse of my past,I swear you ain't gettin' it even a lil bit of that\nNo more tears comin' down through my eyes\nNo love found,No love lost\n100mm Hi Top on my feet,0.45 on my gut\nJust so if I ever had to bust a nut\nI'm out,Fuck\nDirty sprite in my bladder\nStraight out the 3rd world,I'm peaceful\nNever pulled a trigger\nClimbed the ladder like I'm a rat searchin' for some cheddar\nWoke up,Livin' my dream\nLivin' better than how your grandpa left it\nSprinkled up,I'm high forever\nOthers abandoned this,I'm still gonna dig it\nThis for people like me,who go through shit everyday and still make it\nJus' let em'

respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more

"Elf Screenplay LyricsPAPA ELF: Oh, hello. You're, uh, you're probably here about the, uh, the story. Elves love to tell stories. I-I'll bet you didn't know that about elves. There's, uh, probably a lot of things you... you didn't know about elves. Another... another interesting uh, 'elf-ism', uh, there are only three jobs available to an elf. The first is making shoes at night while, you know, while the old... The old cobbler sleeps.\n\nTwo ELVES hammering away at a pile of shoes as a fat shoemaker sleeps with a copy of \"Hot Cobbler\" magazine on his chest, a busty cobbler lady on the cover.\n\nDISGRUNTLED COBBLER ELF: Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.\n\nYou can bake cookies\n\nIn a tree. Hey!\n\nAs you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous Having an oven\nIn an oak tree during the dry season.\n\n[Screaming] I wanna make shoes!\n\nBut the third job... uh, some call It, uh,\n\n\"The show,\" or... or \"the big dance,\"\n\nIt's the profession that every elf Aspires to,\n\nAnd that is to build toys in Santa's workshop.\n\nOnly two weeks left till Christmas!\n\nI-It's a job only an elf can do.\n\nOur... our nimble fingers,\n\nNatural cheer and active minds\n\nAre perfect for toy-building.\n\nThey... they tried using gnomes And trolls,\n\nBut the gnomes drank too much...\n...and the trolls weren't toilet trained.\n\nNo human being has ever set... set foot in Santa's workshop.\n\nUh, that is until about 30 years ago,\n\nAnd, as you may have guessed,\n\nThat's where our story begins.\n\nWow!\n\nWhoa!\n\nOoh!\n\nWow!\n\nWow!\n\n[Humming]\n\nOw! Ow!\n\nWhoa!\nAre you sleepy?\n\nHere we are.\n\nWe're just going to make you feel so comfortable.\n\nHere we are.\n\nThere you are.\n\nIt's time to go to sleep.\n\nMaybe by next Christmas you'll Have a home.\n\nMerry Christmas, my angel.\n\n[Creaking]\n\n[Santa:] Mmm...\n\n[Bars clang]\n\n[Cheering music playing]\n\nAll right, all right.\n\nWe've had another very successful year.\n\n[Cheering]\n\nSo, after all that hard work,\n\nIt's time to start preparations\n\nFor next Christmas!\n\n[Cheering]\n\nWhat in the name of Sam hill Is that?\n\n[Elves:] Wow...\n\n[Male elf:] A baby...\n\n[Elf:] \"little buddy diapers.\"\n\nHis name is buddy. He must've...\n\nSnuck into your sack at the orphanage.\n\nWhat do we do?\n\n[Papa Elf:] So, Santa had a Decision to make,\n\nAnd fortunately, when it Comes to babies,\n\nSanta's a... a pushover.\n\nSo, buddy stayed with, uh An older elf\n\nWho had always wanted a child?\n\nBut had been so committed to Building toys, he...\n\nHe, well, had forgotten to Settle down.\n\nSanta.\n\nYes, yes, I... I raised buddy.\n\nI was his adopted father.\n\nThough buddy grew twice as fast,\n\nHe... he wasn't any different from the other children.\n\nChuckles not too fast, buddy.\n\nI mean, not... not really.\n\nBefore we learn how to build The latest\n\nIn extreme graphic chipset Processors,\n\nLet's recite the \"Code of the elves,\"\n\nShall we?\n\nNumber one.\n\n\"Treat every day like Christmas.\"\n\nNumber two.\n\n\"There's room for everyone on the Nice list.\"\n\nNumber three.\n\n\"The best way to spread Christmas Cheer\n\nIs singing loud for all to hear.\"\n\nAnd one day, when buddy was old enough,\n\nI made him my own personal apprentice.\n\nI've never been in this room before.\n\nWell, I think it's time you start\n\nYour tinker training.\n\n[Gasps] Santa's sleigh.\n\nYou're gonna help me make it fly.\n\nI thought the magical reindeer made The sleighs fly.\n\nAnd where do the reindeer get their magic from?\n\nChristmas spirit. Everybody knows that.\n\nWell, silly as it sounds,\n\nA lot of people down south\n\nDon't believe in Santa Claus.\n\nWhat?!\n\nWell, who do they think puts all? their toys under the tree?\n\nWell, there's a rumor floating around\n\nThat, uh, that the parents do it.\n\nThat's... that's ridiculous.\n\nI mean, parents couldn't do that all in one night.\n\nWhat about Santa's cookies?\n\nI suppose parents eat them, too?\n\nYeah, I, uh, I... I know,\n\nUh, and every earless and less People\n\nBelieve in Santa Claus.\n\nI mean, we have a real energy crisis on our hands.\n\nOh.\n\nI mean, just see how low the, uh Claus meter is.\n\nThat's shocking.\n\nThat's why I came up\n\nWith this little beauty in the '60s.\n\n[Engine hums to life]\n\nWH-what is it?\n\nIt's a cringle 3000...\n\nA 500-reindeer power jet turbine engine.\n\nWithout it, the sleigh couldn't\n\nGet more than, uh, a few feet off the ground.\n\nWell, it looks like we got\n\nA short in the thermo coupler.\n\nYou wanna give mea hand with that?\n\nYou want me to help?\n\nAs much as, uh, buddy was accepted\n\nBy his family and friends,\n\nThere were a few drawbacks\n\nTo being, uh, a human in, uh an elf's world.\n\n[Music plays chattering]\n\nHey, Ming Ming.\n\nUm...\n\nI'm gonna be a little bit short on today's quota.\n\nIt's all right, buddy.\n\nJust how many etch-a-sketches\n\nDid you get finished?\n\nCome on, buddy. How many?\n\nI made, uh... 85.\n\nEighty-five?\n\nThat puts you...\n\n915 off the pace.\n\n[Female elf:] Ooh... that's bad.\n\nWhy don't you just say it?\n\nI'm the worst toy maker in the world.\n\nI'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.\n\n[Gasps]\n\nNo, buddy, you're not cotton- headed ninny-muggins.\n\nWe all just have different talents That's all.\n\nSeems like everyone else\n\nHave the same talents except for me.\n\nYou... you have, you have lots of Talents, uh...\n\nSpecial talents in fact, like Um, uh...\n\nSpecial talents?\n\nYou changed the batteries in the smoke detector.\n\nYou sure did... aaa's.\n\nAnd in six months, you'll have to check 'em again...\n\nWon't he?\n\nAnd you're the only baritone in the elf choir.\n\nYou bring us down whole octave.\n\nIn a good way.\n\nSee, buddy?\n\nYou're not a cotton-headed ninny- muggings.\n\nYou're just... special.\n\nAnd so, buddy was sent where the... The special elves work.\n\n[Devilish laughter] Aah!\n\n[Pop goes the weasel playing]\n\n[Laughter] Ah!\n\n[Sighs]\n\n[Pop goes the weasel playing]\n\n[Laughter]\n\nHey, foom foom...\n\nI hate to do this to you, but you Think you could\n\nHelp me pick up the slack on those etch-a-sketches?\n\nNo problem. I appreciate it.\n\nBuddy is killing me.\n\nI already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.\n\nThat was quick thinking yesterday\n\nWith that \u00a1\u00b0special talents\u00a1\u00b1 thing.\n\nMing Ming: I feel bad for the guy.\n\nI just hope he doesn't get wise.\n\nWell, if he hasn't figured out He's a human by now,\n\nI don't think he ever will.\n\n[Foom foom:] If he hasn't figured Out he's a human\n\nBy now, I don't think he ever will.\n\nI think they're too small.\n\n[Ming Ming:] You're just... special.\n\n[Snores]\n\n[Buddy sings deeply]\n\n[Sneakers screech]\n\n[Devilish laughter]\n\nYou don't look so good, buddy.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nI'll be okay, I just need a glass of water.\n\nAah!\n\nBuddy...\n\nUnh! Aah!\n\n[Knock on door]\n\nBuddy, are you okay?\n\nI'm sorry, papa.\n\nI just need some alone time.\n\nBuddy, I... I think we... we have to talk.\n\nBuddy, uh, I think there's something\n\nI... I probably should tell you.\n\nYou probably should have found out a long...\n\nA long time ago.\n\nI then proceeded to tell buddy of how his father\n\nHad fallen in love when he was very young\n\nWith a beautiful girl named Susan wells,\n\nAnd how buddy was born\n\nAnd put up for adoption by his mother,\n\nAnd how she had later passed away.\n\nI... I told him his father\n\nHad never even known that Buddy was born,\n\nAnd most importantly,\n\nI told him where his father was...\n\nUh, in a magical land called new York City.\n\nMy dad works there?\n\nEmpire state building.\n\nHey, buddy, wanna pick some snow berries?\n\nNot now, arctic puffin.\n\nHello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.\n\nWhy the long face, partner?\n\nIt seems I'm... I'm not an elf.\n\n'Course you're not. You're 6'3\"\n\nAnd had a beard since you were 15.\n\nPapa says my real father\n\nLives in a magical place far away.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n\nAt least you have a daddy.\n\nI was just rolled up one day and left out here in the cold.\n\nBut the thing is, I've never even left the North Pole.\n\nBuddy, I've been around the world Many times\n\nWhen I was a young cumulus nimbus cloud.\n\nIt's a wonderful place, filled with Wondrous creatures...\n\nExcept dogs.\n\nOh, by the way, don't eat the yellow snow.\n\nOh, I know that.\n\nAll I'm say in' is, this might be The golden opportunity\n\nTo find out whom you really are.\n\nSo, I hear you're going\n\nOn a little journey to the big city.\n\nYup. Ahh.\n\nI'm kind a nervous.\n\n[Chuckles]\n\nLeon says New York is pretty different.\n\nOh, don't pay attention to Leon.\n\nHe's never been anywhere. He doesn't have any feet.\n\nI've been to New York thousands of times.\n\nReally? Mm-hmm.\n\nWhat's it like?\n\nWell, there are some things you should know.\n\nFirst off, you see gum on The street,\n\nLeave it there. It's not free candy.\n\nOh. Second,\n\nThere are, like, 30 ray's pizzas.\n\nThey all claim to be the Original,\n\nBut the real one' son 11th.\n\nAnd if you see a sign that Says \"peep show,\"\n\nThat doesn't mean that They're letting you\n\nLook at presents before Christmas.\n\nCan't wait to see my dad...\n\nWe're gonna go ices skating and... And eat sugar plums.\n\nYeah, that's the other thing\n\nI wanted to talk to you about.\n\nYou know, buddy... [sighs]\n\nYour father...\n\nWell... he's on the naughty list.\n\nNo!!!\n\nYou're taking the books back?\n\n[Chuckles]\n\nSee, I...

I'm good at that.\n\nI know you are.\n\nAnd I'll...\n\nI'll always, uh,\n\nI'll always be here for you.\n\nNow, uh...\n\nGo... uh, get.\n\nBye, guys.\n\nBye, buddy. Bye, buddy.
