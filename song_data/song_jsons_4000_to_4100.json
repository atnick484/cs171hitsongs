guessed one would touch me to my soul\n\n[Chorus:]\nShe said\nDaddy, when we get to Heaven\nCan I taste the Milky Way?\nAre we going there to visit\nOr are we going there to stay?\nAm I gonna see my Grandpa?\nCan I have a pair of wings?\nAnd do you think that God could use another angel\nTo help pour out the rain?\n\nLa, da, da\nDa, de, de, de, de\n\n[Verse 2:]\nWell, I won't lie\nI pulled that car right over\nAnd I sat there on the shoulder\nTrying to dry my misty eyes\n\nAnd I whispered\nLord, I wanna thank you for my children\nCause your innocence that fills them\nOften takes me by surprise like\n\n[Chorus:]\nDaddy, when we get to Heaven\nCan I taste the Milky Way?\nAre we goin' there to visit\nOr are we goin' there to stay?\n\nAm I gonna see my Grandpa?\nCan I have a pair of

her in to bed\nI got down on my knees and prayed\n\n[Chorus:]\nLord, when I get to Heaven\nCan I taste the Milky Way?\nI don't wanna come to visit\nCause I'm coming home to stay?\n\nAnd I can't wait to see my family\nAnd meet Jesus face to face\nAnd do you think, Lord\nYou could use another angel\nTo help pour out the rain?\n\nMmmm\nCan I help pour out the rain?\nCan I help pour out the

don't need you, then why am I crying on my bed?\nIf I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?\nIf you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?\nIf you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't know why you're so far away\nBut I know that this much is true\nWe'll make it through\nAnd I hope you are the one I share my life with\nAnd I wish that you could be the one I die with\nAnd I'm praying you're the one I build my home with\nI hope, I love you all my life\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I

bound for Mexico\nOne was headed for vacation, one for higher education\nAnd two of them were searching for lost souls\nThat driver never ever saw the stop sign\nAnd eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime\n\n[Chorus]\nThere are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway\nWhy there's not four of them, Heaven only knows\nI guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you\nIt's what you leave behind you when you go\n[Verse 2]\nThat farmer left a harvest, a home, and eighty acres\nThe faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart\nAnd that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children\nAnd did her best to give 'em all a better start\nAnd that preacher whispered, \"Can't you see the Promised Land?\"\nAs he laid his blood-stained Bible in that hooker's hand\n\n[Chorus]\nThere are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway\nWhy there's not four of them, Heaven only knows\nI guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you\nIt's what you leave behind you when you go\n\n[Bridge]\nThat's the story that our preacher told last Sunday\nAs he held that blood-stained Bible up for all of us to see\nHe said, \"Bless the farmer, and the teacher, and the preacher\nWho gave this Bible to my mama, who read it to me\"\n\n[Chorus]\nThere are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway\nWhy there's not

this began) I had nothing to say\nAnd I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me\n(I was confused) And I let it all out to find\nThat I'm not the only person with these things in mind\n(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed\nIs the only real thing that I've got left to feel\n(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone\nAnd the fault is my own, and the fault is my own\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]\nI wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real\nI wanna let go of the pain I've held so long\n(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)\nI wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real\nI wanna find something I've wanted all along\nSomewhere I belong\n[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]\nAnd I've got nothing to say\nI can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face\n(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find\nThat it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind\n(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?\n'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me\n(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone\nAnd the fault is my own, and the fault is my own\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]\nI wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real\nI wanna let go of the pain I've held so long\n(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)\nI wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real\nI wanna find something I've wanted all along\nSomewhere I belong\n\n[Bridge: Chester Bennington]\nI will never know myself until I do this on my own\nAnd I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed\nI will never be anything 'til I break away from me\nI will break away, I'll find myself today\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]\nI wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real\nI wanna let go of the pain I've held so long\n(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)\nI wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real\nI wanna find something I've wanted all along\nSomewhere I belong\nYou might also like[Outro: Chester Bennington]\nI wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong\nI wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong\nSomewhere I belong51Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 13, "api_path": "/songs/601628", "artist_names": "Darryl Worley", "full_title": "Have You Forgotten by\u00a0Darryl\u00a0Worley", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/91bc29ea0a09241f132b09932369e42b.220x218x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/91bc29ea0a09241f132b09932369e42b.220x218x1.jpg", "id": 601628, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1282962, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1652733664, "path": "/Darryl-worley-have-you-forgotten-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Darryl-worley-have-you-forgotten-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2003, "month": 3, "day": 10}, "release_date_for_display": "March 10, 2003", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Mar. 10, 2003", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/91bc29ea0a09241f132b09932369e42b.220x218x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/91bc29ea0a09241f132b09932369e42b.220x218x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 13, "hot": false, "pageviews": 6498}, "title": "Have You Forgotten", "title_with_featured": "Have You Forgotten", "updated_by_human_at": 1652733664, "url": "https://genius.com/Darryl-worley-have-you-forgotten-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/278382", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/95fcfa02834f65afec8dd2a6c3948315.1000x428x1.jpg", "id": 278382, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3428a9dbaffeac01da9b1b76e39a986f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "Darryl Worley", "slug": "Darryl-worley", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Darryl-worley", "iq": 387}, "artist": "Darryl Worley", "lyrics": "Have You Forgotten LyricsI hear people sayin'.

pages\nOf a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone\nAnd if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go\n\n[Chorus]\nIn your house, I long to be\nRoom by room, patiently\nI'll wait for you there like a stone\nI'll wait for you there alone\n[Verse 2]\nAnd on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels\nLike a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven\nTo a place I recall, I was there so long ago\nThe sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on\n\n[Chorus]\nIn your house, I long to be\nRoom by room, patiently\nI'll wait for you there like a stone\nI'll wait for you there alone, alone\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd on I read until the day was gone\nAnd I sat in regret of all the things I've done\nFor all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged\nIn dreams until my death, I will wander on\n\n[Chorus]\nIn your house, I long to be\nRoom by room, patiently\nI'll wait for you there like a stone\nI'll wait for you there alone,

comes easy, it takes much practice\nLike, I met a woman who's becoming a star\nShe was very beautiful, leaving people in awe\nSinging songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version\nHung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin\nCocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose\nCould've died, so young, now looks ugly and old\nNo fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath\n'Cause she smells of corrosion and death\nWatch the company you keep and the crowd you bring\n'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing\nSo if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how\nPut your hands in the air, and take the vow\n[Chorus x2]\nI know I can (I know I can)\nBe what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)\nIf I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)\nI'll be where I wanna

be)\n\n[Verse 2]\nBe, b-boys and girls, listen again\nThis is for grown-looking girls who's only 10\nThe ones who watch videos and do what they see\nAs cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID\nCareful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV\nYou can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey\nWhatever you decide, be careful, some men be\nRapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be\nOlder than you are, give yourself time to grow\nYou thinking he can give you wealth, but so\nYoung boys, you can use a lot of help, you know\nYou thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice\nYou don't wanna be my age and can't read and write\nBegging different women for a place to sleep at night\nSmart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish\nIf you believe you can achieve, then say it like this\nSee Nas

from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans\nAsian Arabs and gave them gold, when\nGold was converted to money it all changed\nMoney then became empowerment for Europeans\nThe Persian military invaded\nThey heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred\nAfrica was almost robbed naked\nSlavery was money, so they began making slave ships\nEgypt was the place that Alexander the Great went\nHe was so shocked at the mountains with black faces\nShot up they nose to impose what basically\nStill goes on today, you see?\nIf the truth is told, the youth can grow\nThey learn to survive until they gain control\nNobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes\nRead more, learn more, change the globe\nGhetto children, do your thing\nHold your head up, little man, you're a king\nYoung princess, when you get your wedding ring\nYour man will sing, \"She's my Queeeeeen\"\n[Chorus]\nI know I can (I know I can)\nBe what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)\nIf I work hard at it (If I work

gas\nKnew it had to last\n[Chorus]\nIn the back of that red ragtop\nShe said, \"Please, don't stop\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, the very first time her mother met me\nHer green-eyed girl was a mother to be for two weeks (Ooh)\nI was out of a job and she was in school\nAnd life was fast and the world was cruel\nWe were young and wild (Ooh)\nWe decided not to have a child\nSo we did what we did and we tried to forget\nAnd we swore up and down, there would be no regrets\nIn the morning light\nBut on the way home that night\n\n[Chorus]\nOn the back of that red ragtop\nShe said, \"Please, don't stop\nLoving me\"\n\n[Bridge]\nWe took one more trip around the sun\nBut it was all make believe in the end (In the end)\nNo, I can't say where she is today\nI can't remember who I was back then\nSee

in\nSome guys were puttin' him down\nBullyin' him 'round, round\nNow I wish I would\u2019ve talked to him\nGave him the time of day and not turned away\nIf I would\u2019ve been the one to maybe go this far\nHe might have stayed at home\nPlayin' angry chords on his guitar\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nHe's not invisible anymore\nWith his baggy pants and his legs in chains\nSince he walked

wanted her, she'd never tell\nSecretly she wanted him as well\nBut all of her friends stuck up their nose\nThey had a problem with his baggy clothes\n\n[Chorus]\nHe was a skater boy, she said, \"See you later, boy\"\nHe wasn't good enough for her\nShe had a pretty face, but her head was up in space\nShe needed to come back down to Earth\n[Verse 2]\nFive years from now, she sits at home\nFeedin' the baby, she's all alone\nShe turns on TV, guess who she sees?\nSkater boy rockin' up MTV\nShe calls up her friends, they already know\nAnd they've all got tickets to see his show\nShe tags along and stands in the crowd\nLooks up at the man that she turned down\n\n[Chorus]\nHe was a skater boy, she said, \"See you later, boy\"\nHe wasn't good enough for her\nNow he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar\nDoes your pretty face see what he's worth?\nHe was a skater boy, she said, \"See you later, boy\"\nHe wasn't good enough for her\nNow he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar\nDoes your pretty face see what he's worth?\n\n[Bridge]\nSorry, girl, but you missed out\nWell, tough luck, that boy's mine now\nWe are more than just good friends\nThis is how the story ends\nToo bad that you couldn't see\nI see the man that boy could be\nThere is more than meets the eye\nI see the soul that is inside\nSee Avril Lavigne LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like[Breakdown]\nHe's just a boy, and I'm just a girl\nCan I make it any more obvious?\nWe are in love, haven't you heard\nHow we rock each other's world?\n\n[Chorus]\n(Yeah-yeah-yeah)\nI'm with the skater boy (Yeah-yeah-yeah)\nI said, \"See you later, boy\" (Yeah-yeah-yeah)\nI'll be backstage after the show (Yeah-yeah-yeah)\nI'll be at our studio (Yeah-yeah-yeah)\nSingin' the song we wrote (Yeah-yeah-yeah)\nAbout a girl you
