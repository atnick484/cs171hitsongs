to love you but you got me anyway\nNa na na na na...\nI don't want to love you but you got me anyway\n\nAll the things I've done and the places I've been\nEvery hour like a day, every day another

Chevrolet\nTokin\u2019 on a number and diggin' on the radio\nJust as I crossed the Mississippi line\nI heard that highway start to whine\nAnd I knew that left rear tire was about to go\nWell the spare was flat and I got uptight\n'Cause there wasn't a filling station in sight\nSo I just limped on down the shoulder on the rim\nI went as far as I could, and when I stopped the car\nIt was right in front of this little bar\nKind of a redneck-lookin' joint called the Dew Drop Inn\nWell, I stuffed my hair up under my hat\nAnd told the bartender that I had a flat\nAnd would he be kind enough to give me change for a one?\nThere was one thing I was sure proud to see\nThere wasn't a soul in the place except for him and me\nHe just looked disgusted and pointed toward the telephone\nI called up a station down the road a ways\nAnd he said he wasn't very busy today\nAnd he could have someone there in just about 10 minutes or so\nHe said, \"Now, you just stay right where yer at!\"\nAnd I didn't bother to tell the darn fool\nThat I sure as hell didn't have anyplace else to go\nI just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar\nWhen some guy walked in and said, \"Who owns this car\nWith the peace sign, and the mag wheels, and four on the floor?\"\nWell, he looked at me and I damn near died\nAnd I decided that I'd just wait outside\nSo I laid a dollar on the bar and headed for the door\nJust when I thought I'd get out of there with my skin\nThese five big dudes come strollin' in\nWith this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth\nAnd I was almost to the door, when the biggest one\nSaid, \"You tip your hat to this lady son!\"\nAnd when I did, all that hair fell out from underneath\nNow the last thing I wanted was to get into a fight\nIn Jackson Mississippi on a Saturday night\nEspecially when there was three of them and only one of me\nBut they all started laughing, and I felt kinda sick\nAnd I knew I better think of something pretty quick\nSo I just reached out and kicked ol' green teeth right in the knee\nNow he let out a yell that'd curl your hair\nBut before he could move I grabbed me a chair\nAnd said, \"Watch him folks 'cause he's a thoroughly dangerous man!\"\n\"You may not know it but this man is a spy\nHe's a undercover agent for the FBI\nAnd he's been sent down here to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan!\"\nHe was still bent over holding on to his knee\nBut everybody else was looking and listening to me\nAnd I laid it on thicker and heavier as I went\nI said, \"Would you believe this man has gone as far\nAs tearing Wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars\nAnd he voted for George McGovern for President\"\n\"Well, he's a friend of them long haired hippy-type, pinko fags!\nI bet you he's even got a commie flag\nTacked up on the wall inside of his garage\"\n\"He's a snake in the grass, I tell you guys\nHe may look dumb but that's just a disguise\nHe's a mastermind in the ways of espionage\"\nThey all started looking real suspicious at him\nAnd he jumped up and said, \"Now just wait a minute Jim!\nYou know he's lying, I been living here all of my life!\"\n\"I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch\nAnd I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church\nAnd I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!\"\nThen he started saying something 'bout the way I was dressed\nBut I didn't wait around to hear the rest\nI was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run out of luck\nAnd when I hit the ground I was making tracks\nAnd they were just taking my car down off the jacks\nSo I threw the man a twenty and jumped in and fired that mother up\nMario Andretti would have be sure been proud\nOf the way I was moving when I passed that crowd\nComing out the door and headed toward me in a trot\nAnd I guess I should've gone ahead and run\nBut somehow I just couldn't resist the fun\nOf chasing them all just once around the parking lot\nWell, they headed for their car, but I hit the gas\nAnd spun around and headed them off at the pass\nI was slinging gravel and putting a ton of dust in the air\nI had them all out there stepping and fetching\nLike their heads were on fire and their asses was catching\nBut I figured I had better go ahead and split before the cops got there\nWhen I hit the road I was really wheeling\nHad gravel flying and rubber squealing\nAnd I didn't slow down 'til I was almost to Arkansas\nWell, I think I'm going to reroute my trip\nI wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped\nIf I went to L.A. via OmahaYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,

Witch LyricsBlack water Hattie lived back in the swamp\nWhere the strange green reptiles crawl\nSnakes hang thick from the cypress trees\nLike sausage on a smokehouse wall\nWhere the swamp is alive with a thousand eyes\nAn' all of them watching you\nStay off the track to Hattie's Shack in the back of the Black Bayou\n\nWay up the road from Hattie's Shack\nLies a sleepy little Okeechobee town\nTalk of swamp witch Hattie lock you in when the sun go down\nRumours of what she'd done, rumours of what she'd do\nKept folks off the track of Hattie's shack\nIn the back of the Black Bayou\nOne day brought the rain and the rain stayed on\nAnd the swamp water overflowed\n'skeeters and the fever grabbed the town like a fist\nDoc Jackson was the first to go\nSome say the plague was brought by Hattie\nThere was talk of a hang'n too\nBut the talk got shackled by the howls and the cackles\nFrom the bowels of the Black bayou\n\nEarly one morn 'tween dark and dawn when shadows fill the sky\nThere came an unseen caller on a town where hope had run dry\nIn the square there was found a big black round\nVat full of gurgling brew\nWhispering sounds as the folk gathered round\n\"It came from the Black Bayou\"\n\nThere ain't much pride when you're trapped inside\nA slowly sink'n ship\nThey scooped up the liquid deep and green\nAnd the whole town took a sip\nFever went away and the very next day the skies again were blue\nLet's thank old Hattie for saving our town\nWe'll fetch her from the Black Bayou\n\nParty of ten of the town's best men headed for Hattie's shack\nSaid Swamp Witch magic was useful and good\nAnd they're gonna bring Hattie back\nNever found Hattie and they never found the shack\nNever made the trip back in\nThere was a parchment note they found tacked to a stump\nSaid, \"Don't come look'n again\"You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1125319", "artist_names": "The Dramatics", "full_title": "Hey You!

Lyrics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men\nWith most prevailing tinsel: who unpen\nTheir baaing vanities, to browse away\nThe comfortable green and juicy hay\nFrom human pastures; or, O torturing fact!\nWho, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd\nFire-branded foxes to sear up and singe\nOur gold and ripe-ear'd hopes. With not one tinge\nOf sanctuary splendour, not a sight\nAble to face an owl's, they still are dight\nBy the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,\nAnd crowns, and turbans. With unladen breasts,\nSave of blown self-applause, they proudly mount\nTo their spirit's perch, their being's high account,\nTheir tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones\u2013\nAmid the fierce intoxicating tones\nOf trumpets, shoutings, and belabour'd drums,\nAnd sudden cannon. All! how all this hums,\nIn wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone\u2013\nLike thunder clouds that spake to Babylon,\nAnd set those old Chaldeans to their tasks.\u2013\nAre then regalities all gilded masks?\nNo, there are throned seats unscalable\nBut by a patient wing, a constant spell,\nOr by ethereal things that, unconfin'd,\nCan make a ladder of the eternal wind,\nAnd poise about in cloudy thunder-tents\nTo watch the abysm-birth of elements.\nAye, 'bove the withering of old-lipp'd Fate\nA thousand Powers keep religious state,\nIn water, fiery realm, and airy bourne;\nAnd, silent as a consecrated urn,\nHold sphery sessions for a season due.\nYet few of these far majesties, ah, few!\nHave bared their operations to this globe\u2013\nFew, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe\nOur piece of heaven\u2013whose benevolence\nShakes hand with our own Ceres; every sense\nFilling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,\nAs bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud\n'Twixt Nothing and Creation, I here swear,\nEterne Apollo! that thy Sister fair\nIs of all these the gentlier-mightiest.\nWhen thy gold breath is misting in the west,\nShe unobserved steals unto her throne,\nAnd there she sits most meek and most alone;\nAs if she had not pomp subservient;\nAs if thine eye, high Poet! was not bent\nTowards her with the Muses in thine heart;\nAs if the ministring stars kept not apart,\nWaiting for silver-footed messages.\nO Moon! the oldest shades 'mong oldest trees\nFeel palpitations when thou lookest in:\nO Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din\nThe while they feel thine airy fellowship.\nThou dost bless every where, with silver lip\nKissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,\nCouched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine:\nInnumerable mountains rise, and rise,\nAmbitious for the hallowing of thine eyes;\nAnd yet thy benediction passeth not\nOne obscure hiding-place, one little spot\nWhere pleasure may be sent: the nested wren\nHas thy fair face within its tranquil ken,\nAnd from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf\nTakes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief\nTo the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps\nWithin its pearly house.\u2013The mighty deeps,\nThe monstrous sea is thine\u2013the myriad sea!\nO Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee,\nAnd Tellus feels his forehead's cumbrous load.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cynthia! where art thou now? What far abode\nOf green or silvery bower doth enshrine\nSuch utmost beauty? Alas, thou dost pine\nFor one as sorrowful: thy cheek is pale\nFor one whose cheek is pale: thou dost bewail\nHis tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?\nAh! surely that light peeps from Vesper's eye,\nOr what a thing is love!

Long in misery\nI wasted, ere in one extremest fit\nI plung'd for life or death. To interknit\nOne's senses with so dense a breathing stuff\nMight seem a work of pain; so not enough\nCan I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,\nAnd buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt\nWhole days and days in sheer astonishment;\nForgetful utterly of self-intent;\nMoving but with the mighty ebb and flow.\nThen, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew\nHis spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,\nI tried in fear the pinions of my will.\n'Twas freedom! and at once I visited\nThe ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.\nNo need to tell thee of them, for I see\nThat thou hast been a witness\u2013it must be\u2013\nFor these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,\nBy the melancholy corners of that mouth.\nSo I will in my story straightway pass\nTo more immediate matter.

Kind stranger-youth!\nI lov'd her to the very white of truth,\nAnd she would not conceive it. Timid thing!\nShe fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,\nRound every isle, and point, and promontory,\nFrom where large Hercules wound up his story\nFar as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew\nThe more, the more I saw her dainty hue\nGleam delicately through the azure clear:\nUntil 'twas too fierce agony to bear;\nAnd in that agony, across my grief\nIt flash'd, that Circe might find some relief\u2013\nCruel enchantress! So above the water\nI rear'd my head, and look'd for Ph\u0153bus' daughter.\n\u00c6\u00e6a's isle was wondering at the moon:\u2013\nIt seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon\nLeft me dead-drifting to that fatal power.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When I awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;\nJust when the light of morn, with hum of bees,\nStole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.\nHow sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,\nAnd over it a sighing voice expire.\nIt ceased\u2013I caught light footsteps; and anon\nThe fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon\nPush'd through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!\nWith tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove\nA net whose thraldom was more bliss than all\nThe range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall\nThe dew of her rich speech: \"Ah! Art awake?\nO let me hear thee speak, for Cupid's sake!\nI am so oppress'd with joy! Why, I have shed\nAn urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;\nAnd now I find thee living, I will pour\nFrom these devoted eyes their silver store,\nUntil exhausted of the latest drop,\nSo it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop\nHere, that I too may live: but if beyond\nSuch cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond\nOf soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;\nIf thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;\nIf smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,\nHang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,\nO let me pluck it for thee.\" Thus she link'd\nHer charming syllables, till indistinct\nTheir music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;\nAnd then she hover'd over me, and stole\nSo near, that if no nearer it had been\nThis furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Young man of Latmos! thus particular\nAm I, that thou may'st plainly see how far\nThis fierce temptation went: and thou may'st not\nExclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who could resist?

Dead as she was\nI clung about her waist, nor ceas'd to pass\nFleet as an arrow through unfathom'd brine,\nUntil there shone a fabric crystalline,\nRibb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl.\nHeadlong I darted; at one eager swirl\nGain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!\n'Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;\nAnd all around\u2013But wherefore this to thee\nWho in few minutes more thyself shalt see?\u2013\nI left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.\nMy fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread\nMet palsy half way: soon these limbs became\nGaunt, wither'd, sapless, feeble, cramp'd, and lame.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,\nWithout one hope, without one faintest trace\nOf mitigation, or redeeming bubble\nOf colour'd phantasy; for I fear 'twould trouble\nThy brain to loss of reason: and next tell\nHow a restoring chance came down to quell\nOne half of the witch in me.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\"On a day,\nSitting upon a rock above the spray,\nI saw grow up from the horizon's brink\nA gallant vessel: soon she seem'd to sink\nAway from me again, as though her course\nHad been resum'd in spite of hindering force\u2013\nSo vanish'd: and not long, before arose\nDark clouds, and muttering of winds morose.\nOld Eolus would stifle his mad spleen,\nBut could not: therefore all the billows green\nToss'd up the silver spume against the clouds.\nThe tempest came: I saw that vessel's shrouds\nIn perilous bustle; while upon the deck\nStood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;\nThe final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:\nI heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.\nO they had all been sav'd but crazed eld\nAnnull'd my vigorous cravings: and thus quell'd\nAnd curb'd, think on't, O Latmian! did I sit\nWrithing with pity, and a cursing fit\nAgainst that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,\nBy one and one, to pale oblivion;\nAnd I was gazing on the surges prone,\nWith many a scalding tear and many a groan,\nWhen at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,\nGrasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.\nI knelt with pain\u2013reached out my hand\u2013had grasp'd\nThese treasures\u2013touch'd the knuckles\u2013they unclasp'd\u2013\nI caught a finger: but the downward weight\nO'erpowered me\u2013it sank. Then 'gan abate\nThe storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst\nThe comfortable sun. I was athirst\nTo search the book, and in the warming air\nParted its dripping leaves with eager care.\nStrange matters did it treat of, and drew on\nMy soul page after page, till well-nigh won\nInto forgetfulness; when, stupefied,\nI read these words, and read again, and tried\nMy eyes against the heavens, and read again.\nO what a load of misery and pain\nEach Atlas-line bore off!\u2013a shine of hope\nCame gold around me, cheering me to cope\nStrenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!\nFor thou hast brought their promise to an end.\n\"In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,\nDoom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch\nHis loath'd existence through ten centuries,\nAnd then to die alone. Who can devise\nA total opposition? No one. So\nOne million times ocean must ebb and flow,\nAnd he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,\nThese things accomplish'd:\u2013If he utterly\nScans all the depths of magic, and expounds\nThe meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;\nIf he explores all forms and substances\nStraight homeward to their symbol-essences;\nHe shall not die. Moreover, and in chief,\nHe must pursue this task of joy and grief\nMost piously;\u2013all lovers tempest-tost,\nAnd in the savage overwhelming lost,\nHe shall deposit side by side, until\nTime's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:\nWhich done, and all these labours ripened,\nA youth, by heavenly power lov'd and led,\nShall stand before him; whom he shall direct\nHow to consummate all.

There arose\nA noise of harmony, pulses and throes\nOf gladness in the air\u2013while many, who\nHad died in mutual arms devout and true,\nSprang to each other madly; and the rest\nFelt a high certainty of being blest.\nThey gaz'd upon Endymion. Enchantment\nGrew drunken, and would have its head and bent.\nDelicious symphonies, like airy flowers,\nBudded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers\nOf light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.\nThe two deliverers tasted a pure wine\nOf happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out.\nSpeechless they eyed each other, and about\nThe fair assembly wander'd to and fro,\nDistracted with the richest overflow\nOf joy that ever pour'd from heaven.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\u2014\"Away!\"\nShouted the new born god; \"Follow, and pay\nOur piety to Neptunus supreme!\"\u2013\nThen Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,\nThey led on first, bent to her meek surprise,\nThough portal columns of a giant size,\nInto the vaulted, boundless emerald.\nJoyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,\nDown marble steps; pouring as easily\nAs hour-glass sand,\u2013and fast, as you might see\nSwallows obeying the south summer's call,\nOr swans upon a gentle waterfall.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,\nEre from among some rocks of glittering spar,\nJust within ken, they saw descending thick\nAnother multitude. Whereat more quick\nMoved either host. On a wide sand they met,\nAnd of those numbers every eye was wet;\nFor each their old love found.

California\nMy name is KXNG Crooked\nI snap on you rappers often\nWhen I'm spazzin' I'm just gettin' my passionate point across\nLike a hood cat clappin' his hands when he talkin'\nNow that I got your attention, I feel I should really mention\nDon't come around here flossin', Big Willies, we Willie Lynch 'em\nPull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground\nLike every bar's a bullet, when I pull it, it sound like\nBa-da-da-da-da-da-da a couple of bullets are comin' your way\nThen it jam, like God damn\nThen I pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity\nThe proximity, the Glocksimity, we on Yosemite Sam\nBam, bam your body drop, Van Damme, karate chop\nThe Beretta's a better competitor\nPop pop turn your sweater to a crop top\nKillin' you and whoever in that drop top\nEtcetera, etcetera and it will not stop\nJust shoot, shoot like doot doot\nAnd beaucoup, beaucoup, I'm cuckoo\nI'm a star goin' to war with you clones like Count Dooku\nI'm worlds apart from you rappers\nLike I walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic\nAnd NASA's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapping\nBroadcastin' from uninhibited planets\nWhen I come back, that's it\nYou see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, I\nWhen I land, you wack niggas die\nAnd your casket is your last hit\nYou wack bitch, fuckin' bastard\nBack to the hand clappin'\nYou die quicker than Darren Wilson walkin' through Ferguson\nDressed like the grand dragon of the Klan\nPassin' niggas with pants saggin'\nWith they hand on a black Magnum\nTo clap him backwards\nSo their last words is \"kcuf meht nmad saggin\"\nThat's backwards for \"fuck them damn niggas\"\nBuck them damn triggers\nYou charge us, bodies fill up them damn Rivers\n'Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive\nBut I only like dead rappers\nCompare me to the best rappers who died\nAnd you rappers I used to look up to\nI gotta cancel you now\nLike Simon Cowell, I can't let you ex-factors survive\nNah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'\nMy mic can only be likened to Poseidon's trident and Zeus' lightnin' strike\nAnd my metaphors are what Thor was to the Norse viking\nI'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'\nI'm slicin' organs with songwritin', I dwarf giants\nI hope I'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sort of like poor dykin'\nI smoke philosophy, I snort science\nThat mean I'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes\nThat's where the fire's burnin'\nTry to deny a music messiah's returnin'\nYou die and you fry in my iron furnace\nI am on my get rich or die tryin' like when Em was signin' Curtis\n'Cause I am murderous\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nJoe Budden, Jersey City, New Jersey\nNow we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends\nCould give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs\nOr I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims\nOr I could tell you why I'm hot and disappear like MIMS\nBut the bars there, put that on God, ask a atheist\nAnd if I ain't the bomb at least I'm in the blast radius\nI'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, I like the terror\nAPB on my actions, I'm in the viking era\nMoment of truth, I give you facts right now\nFuck this cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now\nSo it's fuck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit\nGot a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip\nFace says I been stressed\nI got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS\nNigga, why am I here? For the look, for the promo\nShit that bothered from the start\n'Cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfather's heart\nYeah, just not the side that the beat is on\nI'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on\nI'm planning the funeral, I'm getting the hearse ready\nThese niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready\nNot a how do I feel, not a how do I deal\nIf that\u2019s life, then nigga, how is it real?\nThese last couple of days I've been speaking to my peers\nGiving them cries for help, I guess they need to see the tears\nBut wait, wildest part of all of that is\nThey'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge\nBut fuck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em\nHouse Gang, Shady, I'm gone, nigga, my job is done\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Yelawolf]\nYelawolf, Gadsden, Alabama\nMy name is Wayne, I'm from Alabama\nHere's the back story:\nI just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb\nI'm 33, I've got 3 kids and I just popped 3 pills\nI don't know which one's which or what it's for\nSafety ain't really a habit I've formed\nI still smoke to the cigarette butt\nI still drink till I end up being that klutz\nClumsy, self-destructive dummy\nStumbling over my words, mumbling\nI'll probably do it tonight\nLeave the bar, leave the car\nAnd pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars\nAnd dream about that light that leads up to the lord\nI have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard\nWake up feeling like half a human\nHit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret\nFor my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community\nBut unity between country music and MCs, I'm claiming immunity\nStill I'm working, sawing, milling this tree\nBuilding this house exactly the way Charlemagne tha god and Lord Jamar thought it would be\nWait a minute... the lord and the god hate me\nJesus Christ, I am the white devil!\nNah...\nI'm still working, sawing, milling this tree\nBuilding this house exactly the way I thought it should be\nWanna take a tour? Let's see\nI've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion\nBucks, bears, trucks, boats, tires, spares, four-wheelers\nThree-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call\nPlaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall\nLift kits, low riders, chop shops, hi tops, low tops, cowboy boots\nDixie flags, American flags, Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass\nCEO\nI've got my name on the bathrobe, and the flame on the back porch is lit\nGuess who's coming to dinner?\nAndr\u00e9 3000 and Hank the Third, go figure\nI've got two stand-up jetskis, a top pedigree horse, just to pet and feed of course\nWho rides a horse in Nashville? I might\nI've got bicycles for the kids, tricycles for the babies\nM-80s, bottle rockets, bottles in my pocket\nMoonshine, gold watches, gold rings\nAll fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing\nI've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style\nGoodwill loves me Mackle-more than you\nI've got flat screen TVs, with skate videos on repeat\nAll the latest CDs, mp3s, and Beats by Dre\nThank you very much, Jimmy Iovine for the check\nI've got a black woman fine as she can be\nFeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind\nA 5, a 10, a couple hundreds layin' on the counter\nI don't know where that came from\nI got artwork from hard work, yardworkers for yard work\nDon't look under the tarp, sir\nI'm growin' weed for my mama there\nI've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my Harley\nAnd I did it my way\nSee, hip-hop is what you make of it\nAnd I'm makin' a lot of it\nSee that's a quadruple entendre, Jay Z eat your heart out\n[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]\nJoell Ortiz, Brooklyn, New York\nBut these cyphers?\nI treat 'em like they a war; don't want no mediators\nNah, this that grow up in the P's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors\nPeople thank you, I do this for all the mean creators\nI was someone who never needed favors to get where I'm at\nNow they deem me a savior\nBut to be honest I ain't feelin' like that, man I just really like rap\nY'all lucky, trust me\nI'm opposite the hands of Sandusky\nWith the shit that my pen state, these rappers can't touch me\nUgly? Shit, you serious? I'm hideous\nI was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out just who I really is\nAs a younger dude, life was somethin' rude\nI barely made it to the first like a Cutler move\nNo rubber groove on my shoes led to fights, so suspensions\nI had 3 in one week, yeah that was public school\nDid I say 3 in 1? That's funny 'cause there's 4 of us in the Slaughter\nThat's a 3 and 1, I learned that in public school too\nLike what's in between a 3 and 1 and House Gang, I spoke to all 3 on 1 call\nLike I dropped 2 albums and #3 is 1 second from bein' done\nJust need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece\nFor this Heatmakerz beat and Brother's Keeper 1\nSimple mathematics, I'm addin' up to all these rap addicts\nI don't like to divide dough so I multiply flow\nAnd subtract maggots\nLike a brand new Craftmatic, boy I'm back at it\nSmokin' these new boys like my last habit\nDabnabbit I tried to quit but everything I kick's like the last dragon\nHoes suckin' my drummer dick, they on my bandwagon\nI just gotta laugh 'cause y'all pushin' a lot of swag\nI'm pushin' this big ole Hearse, don't get body bagged\n\n[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nRoyce Da 5'9\", Detroit, gah\nThese new rappers be askin' me\nWhy I don't be hangin' out where they be hangin' out\nI tell 'em, I say, \"Lil nigga, listen here;\"\nIf I don't got no business there, I don't got no business there\nSee there's a difference here\nYou hustlin' so you can be seen\nNigga I'm grindin' so I can disappear\nI don't do it like other rappers do\nWhen it's on time, it's skull and bone signs at the stu\nWe got guns you only find on your cheat code screen\nIf you think I remind you of any of these niggas you wildin' out\nLike Chico Bean\nWhen there's drama I don't ask no questions, I just clap in that direction\nI look at this gat like it's a actual accessory\nI'm anti-social so relax when you step to me\nNigga I shoot the breeze with actual weaponry\nYour lil' stare downs won't fare well\nI got a pale conscience, I'm the grey area\nThe last person I had a bond with was a bail bondsman\nNow imagine me hangin' with y'all and we rappin' on the same song\nNigga I'd rather juggle a couple of chainsaws\nOr run through hell with a pair of gasoline Hanes on\nI'm a star but not on some I wanna be a star kinda shit\nThe only celebrity who give a fuck less than me is Marshawn Lynch\nGlock in the stash as a backup but the MAC'll burst\nCripple your style, your first born child'll come out\nWith a colostomy bag as the afterbirth\nI don't give a fuck\nNigga I'll show up to Beyonce's show posin' as Jay Z\nStagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest\nLookin' like Omarion holdin' his baby\nJump in the 4 door Mercedes with a .44 listenin' to JoJo and K-Ci\nDrinkin' and sniffin' enough blow that it got me thinkin' I can exchange sicknesses\nMaybe, this ebola for rabies\nThat's it, just livin' the rapper life\nBanana clip in the air, lookin' like it's 'bout to start singin' it's MAC tonight\nMACs, I use this MAC as a component for thugs rollin' up\nI got this MAC on and you better stay in that corner\n'Cause shit can turn into that song except I don't give a fuck what day it is\nI'll have this club goin' up, fuck with me\nMack magnet, attractin' enormous green\nSlap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack\n'Cause this bitch is that war machine\nLife of a giant, but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft\nDrag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jackin' the beanstalk\nWe both got marketing plans\nYours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before\nMine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me\nAnd then go and invest into a grocery store\nRolled up with the Smith & Wesson and drew on you like let's fight now\nI do numbers, I turn you and your crew into two plumbers\nTranslation, get your shit together and pipe down\nFuck a mic, I don't write, I chew and spit\nI'll shoot you and your sis if you insist\nI got my eyes on the sparrow\nSilencer's so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the front of the barrel\nAnd he doin' this\n[Verse 6: Eminem]\nMy name is Marshall, I'm reppin' that motherfuckin' Motor City, bitch\nI just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet\nBegan to trend-set, murdered a friend's pet\nMade shit as ill as it can get went in-depth\nLike a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet\nI'm already covered in sweat and I wasn't even ready to come in yet\nAHH, let me set this drink down\nBeat up a gal, start beef with her pal\nProbably be wild 'til I'm wrinkled and senile\nAnd \"Rap God\" was a freestyle\nOff the top of the dome piece while I was 'sleep on the couch\nAnd I'm freestyling now\nI need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow\nIt's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul\n'Cause shit I'm thinking about should be illegal\nI need my head banned like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio\nAnd went to South Beach with his talents\nScream \"fuck you\" on the way out and wink with a smile\nThis whole game can eat a dick, I'm going back deep underground\nBut right now I'm back on that bullshit and you I'm singling out\n'Cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while\nWhat the fuck is this Klusterfuk of busters?\nBunch of Buster Douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders\nOne swing and you're crowned\nKnocked one out the park, one catchy jingle and now\nYou think you fucking with me 'cause you sold like 300 thou?\nBitch, I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground\nReach up, swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around\nEvil and vile enough to leap in the crowd\nAnd heave a child in a sinkhole on Cinco de Mayo\nWhen I'm sprinkled in pico de gallo\nMardi Gras beads in a towel\nI just made that up\nI don't know much Spanish, I'm not bilingual\nBut I'll show you a Mexican stand off\nBetween just these two amigos\n'Cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud\nBut I sure as fuck think I know how to read body English, no doubt\n'Cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically\nThe fuck is humility? What is a real emcee?\nRoyce, he came up in this shit with me\nNever spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me\nLet them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me\nJust not giving a fuck and plus with the history\nOf muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery\nWhy this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning\nSo what in the fuck is a list to me?\nI'm used to not being on it, I expect it out 'em\nHeck wit' em, I get my respect without 'em\nAin't really been into diamonds since I put my first record out\nBut I could put a chain around my second album\nAnd wear it as a neck medallion\nBecame a millionaire, went downhill from there\nBecame civil, office swivel chair, sterling silverware\nScreaming life is still unfair til I get a real career\nThe fuck am I gonna do until then? This job is too fulfilling\nTwo ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in\nA mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville\nInto some children at the food pavilion at Build-A-Bear\nWarrior's mind, I\u2019m pro-hydrocodone euphoria\nIn the Drug Emporium line, I'm soaring\nI'm pouring Vicodin four at a time ignoring the warning signs on 'em 'fore I go four wheeler riding\nGory and violent, horrifying\nYou surely won't find no one more abhorring\nThan I am with this retaliatory of rhyming for Gloria Steinem\nBut I finger her like a witness, show me a line-up\nI usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am\nI guess I must've threw you for a loop like Toucan Sam\nWhen I said I could use the sample 'cause you's a tramp\nBut look how you react to this trigger like\nWhen I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam\nYou're playing right into Lex Luthor's hand\nIt's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan\nBut fuck it, Superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for Stan\nI'm a brand new being like Grand Puba's band\nHappy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed\nIn his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... I can't\nSince honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try\nTry to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify\nAs a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride\nAnd say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize\nI think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines\nAnd thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds\nThen I'm like dollar signs\nBut I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke\nIs more of a knockout than Janay Rice\nPlay nice, bitch, I'll punch Lana Del Rey right\nIn the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight\nIn plain sight of the elevator surveillance\nTil her head is banged on the railing\nThen celebrate with the Ravens\nNever date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants\nI'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape\nThe aggression, rage and the anger\nCause leg restraints on the ankles\nHeavy weights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains\nJust ain't enough to contain it\nBut I'd still get the same respect as Jay if I came on\nStage in a fucking neglig\u00e9e everyday and Liz Claiborne\nDevastated from breakup with Kate Hudson\nWait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say\n'Cause makeup ain't gonna cover\nThat eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut\nPeppersprayed with your face cut\nMade my bank like a lay up\nOff these effing skanks on the way up\nOh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent\nIt's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches\nYes, I said seven, I measured it\nSeven inches from the floor\nWhile I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony\nAt the Sheraton while I'm stretching it\nBitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get\nSo if she's hesitant to get the hint\nI'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with\nHella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon\nWhen I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench\nExistential detriment to a lesbian devil\nAnd the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level\nA separatist like a Chechnian rebel\nImpressionist with a pencil\nA pessimist, with his lips pressed against\nThe edge of this Red Bull\nPedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever\nYou see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass\nSHADYXV as perplexing as\nThe last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse\nWhen I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird\nWhen I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears\nAnd these little Disney queers\nWho use chicks for beards?\nJust made that up too...\nOh and the Shady 2.0\nWe wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls\n'Cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes\nSo flows lose you as usual, so juvenile\n2 year old when I go to the studio\nIt's only music but don't be foolish though\nYou don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though\nIn my homie's Buick\nBeen known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it\nWhen I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do\nAnd murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart\nIn one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it\nYou couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it\nThe day I don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it\nRootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip\nWith the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women\nI'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot\nBut they consider me equivalent to chlamydia\nThey tryna get rid of me gadzooks\nBut I stiggity stand for the figgity flag\nOf the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through\nAnd if I catch you doing anything\nHindering or prohibiting that after I get me the\nTattoo of your lips on my ass I'ma be literally\nPickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you, woooh!\nFuck it\nGot it somewhere in there probably, I don't know142Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/865741", "artist_names": "Eumir Deodato", "full_title": "Also sprach

2]\nLove has slipped away left us only friends\nWe almost seem like strangers\nAll that's left between us are the memories we share\nOf times we thought we cared for each other\n[Chorus]\nThere's nothing left to do but go our separate ways\nAnd pick up all the pieces left behind us\nAnd maybe someday, somewhere along the way\nAnother love will find us\n\n[Verse 3]\nSome day when she's older, maybe she will understand\nWhy her mom and dad are not together\nThe tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye\nWill tear at my heart forever\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's nothing left to do but go our separate ways\nPick up all the pieces left behind us\nAnd maybe someday, somewhere along the way\nAnother love will find us\n\nWow wow woa wow,

2]\nOh, in your head, you don't believe what the good book said\nYou're gonna strike out now instead, 'cause the world's been unkind\nPut through thick and thin, whatever shape your heart is in\nYou only have one next of kin, better keep 'em in mind\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're the keeper of the castle, so be a good man to your lady\nThe creator of the sunshine in her day\nTend the garden that you seeded, be a friend when a friend is needed\nYou won't have to look the other way\n\n[Outro]\nLive it down, there's a lot of us been pushed around\nRed, yellow, black, white and brown with a tear of their

He was difficult to live with, inconsistent, moody. His appetite was appalling, and he told me so many times to stop pestering him I consulted Atticus: \u201cReckon he\u2019s got a tapeworm?\u201d Atticus said no, Jem was growing. I must be patient with\nhim and disturb him as little as possible.\n\nThis change in Jem had come about in a matter of weeks. Mrs. Dubose was not cold\nin her grave\u2014Jem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he went to read\nto her. Overnight, it seemed, Jem had acquired an alien set of values and was trying to\nimpose them on me: several times he went so far as to tell me what to do. After one\naltercation when Jem hollered, \u201cIt\u2019s time you started bein\u2018 a girl and acting right!\u201d I burst\ninto tears and fled to Calpurnia.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fret too much over Mister Jem\u2014\u201d she began.\n\u201cMister Jem?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s just about Mister Jem now.\u201d\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t that old,\u201d I said. \u201cAll he needs is somebody to beat him up, and I ain\u2019t big\nenough.\u201d\n\u201cBaby,\u201d said Calpurnia, \u201cI just can\u2019t help it if Mister Jem\u2019s growin\u2018 up. He\u2019s gonna want\nto be off to himself a lot now, doin\u2019 whatever boys do, so you just come right on in the\nkitchen when you feel lonesome. We\u2019ll find lots of things to do in here.\u201d\nThe beginning of that summer boded well: Jem could do as he pleased; Calpurnia\nwould do until Dill came. She seemed glad to see me when I appeared in the kitchen,\nand by watching her I began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl.\nBut summer came and Dill was not there. I received a letter and a snapshot from him.\nThe letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed, and he would have to\nstay in Meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat. His father was a lawyer\nlike Atticus, only much younger. Dill\u2019s new father had a pleasant face, which made me\nglad Dill had captured him, but I was crushed. Dill concluded by saying he would love\nme forever and not to worry, he would come get me and marry me as soon as he got\nenough money together, so please write.\nThe fact that I had a permanent fianc\u00e9 was little compensation for his absence: I had\nnever thought about it, but summer was Dill by the fishpool smoking string, Dill\u2019s eyes\nalive with complicated plans to make Boo Radley emerge; summer was the swiftness\nwith which Dill would reach up and kiss me when Jem was not looking, the longings we\nsometimes felt each other feel. With him, life was routine; without him, life was\nunbearable. I stayed miserable for two days. \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 62\nAs if that were not enough, the state legislature was called into emergency session\nand Atticus left us for two weeks. The Governor was eager to scrape a few barnacles off\nthe ship of state; there were sit-down strikes in Birmingham; bread lines in the cities\ngrew longer, people in the country grew poorer. But these were events remote from the\nworld of Jem and me.\nWe were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in the Montgomery Advertiser above\nthe caption, \u201cMaycomb\u2019s Finch.\u201d It showed Atticus barefooted and in short pants,\nchained to a desk: he was diligently writing on a slate while some frivolous-looking girls\nyelled, \u201cYoo-hoo!\u201d at him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a compliment,\u201d explained Jem. \u201cHe spends his time doin\u2018 things that wouldn\u2019t\nget done if nobody did \u2019em.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nIn addition to Jem\u2019s newly developed characteristics, he had acquired a maddening air\nof wisdom.\n\u201cOh, Scout, it\u2019s like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things. That kind\nof thing\u2019s pretty dry to most men.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\u201cOh, go on and leave me alone. I\u2019m readin\u2018 the paper.\u201d\nJem got his wish. I departed for the kitchen.\nWhile she was shelling peas, Calpurnia suddenly said, \u201cWhat am I gonna do about\nyou all\u2019s church this Sunday?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, I reckon. Atticus left us collection.\u201d\nCalpurnia\u2019s eyes narrowed and I could tell what was going through her mind. \u201cCal,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cyou know we\u2019ll behave. We haven\u2019t done anything in church in years.\u201d\nCalpurnia evidently remembered a rainy Sunday when we were both fatherless and\nteacherless. Left to its own devices, the class tied Eunice Ann Simpson to a chair and\nplaced her in the furnace room. We forgot her, trooped upstairs to church, and were\nlistening quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued from the radiator pipes,\npersisting until someone investigated and brought forth Eunice Ann saying she didn\u2019t\nwant to play Shadrach any more\u2014Jem Finch said she wouldn\u2019t get burnt if she had\nenough faith, but it was hot down there.\n\u201cBesides, Cal, this isn\u2019t the first time Atticus has left us,\u201d I protested.\n\u201cYeah, but he makes certain your teacher\u2019s gonna be there. I didn\u2019t hear him say this\ntime\u2014reckon he forgot it.\u201d Calpurnia scratched her head. Suddenly she smiled. \u201cHow\u2019d\nyou and Mister Jem like to come to church with me tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cHow \u2018bout it?\u201d grinned Calpurnia.\nIf Calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before, it was nothing compared to her\nsupervision of that Saturday night\u2019s routine. She made me soap all over twice, drew\nfresh water in the tub for each rinse; she stuck my head in the basin and washed it with\nOctagon soap and castile. She had trusted Jem for years, but that night she invaded his\nprivacy and provoked an outburst: \u201cCan\u2019t anybody take a bath in this house without the\nwhole family lookin\u2018?\u201d\nNext morning she began earlier than usual, to \u201cgo over our clothes.\u201d When Calpurnia\nstayed overnight with us she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen; that morning it was\ncovered with our Sunday habiliments. She had put so much starch in my dress it came\nup like a tent when I sat down. She made me wear a petticoat and she wrapped a pink\nsash tightly around my waist. She went over my patent-leather shoes with a cold biscuit\nuntil she saw her face in them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we were goin\u2018 to Mardi Gras,\u201d said Jem. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this for, Cal?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anybody sayin\u2018 I don\u2019t look after my children,\u201d she muttered. \u201cMister Jem,\nyou absolutely can\u2019t wear that tie with that suit. It\u2019s green.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Smatter with that?\u201d\n\u201cSuit\u2019s blue. Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d\n\u201cHee hee,\u201d I howled, \u201cJem\u2019s color blind.\u201d \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 63\nHis face flushed angrily, but Calpurnia said, \u201cNow you all quit that. You\u2019re gonna go to\nFirst Purchase with smiles on your faces.\u201d\nFirst Purchase African M.E. Church was in the Quarters outside the southern town\nlimits, across the old sawmill tracks. It was an ancient paint-peeled frame building, the\nonly church in Maycomb with a steeple and bell, called First Purchase because it was\npaid for from the first earnings of freed slaves. Negroes worshiped in it on Sundays and\nwhite men gambled in it on weekdays.\nThe churchyard was brick-hard clay, as was the cemetery beside it. If someone died\nduring a dry spell, the body was covered with chunks of ice until rain softened the earth.\nA few graves in the cemetery were marked with crumbling tombstones; newer ones\nwere outlined with brightly colored glass and broken Coca-Cola bottles. Lightning rods\nguarding some graves denoted dead who rested uneasily; stumps of burned-out\ncandles stood at the heads of infant graves. It was a happy cemetery.\nThe warm bittersweet smell of clean Negro welcomed us as we entered the\nchurchyard\u2014Hearts of Love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida, snuff, Hoyt\u2019s\nCologne, Brown\u2019s Mule, peppermint, and lilac talcum.\nWhen they saw Jem and me with Calpurnia, the men stepped back and took off their\nhats; the women crossed their arms at their waists, weekday gestures of respectful\nattention. They parted and made a small pathway to the church door for us. Calpurnia\nwalked between Jem and me, responding to the greetings of her brightly clad neighbors.\n\u201cWhat you up to, Miss Cal?\u201d said a voice behind us.\nCalpurnia\u2019s hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked around: standing\nin the path behind us was a tall Negro woman. Her weight was on one leg; she rested\nher left elbow in the curve of her hip, pointing at us with upturned palm. She was bulletheaded\nwith strange almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and an Indian-bow mouth. She\nseemed seven feet high.\nI felt Calpurnia\u2019s hand dig into my shoulder. \u201cWhat you want, Lula?\u201d she asked, in\ntones I had never heard her use. She spoke quietly, contemptuously.\n\u201cI wants to know why you bringin\u2018 white chillun to nigger church.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019s my comp\u2019ny,\u201d said Calpurnia. Again I thought her voice strange: she was\ntalking like the rest of them.\n\u201cYeah, an\u2018 I reckon you\u2019s comp\u2019ny at the Finch house durin\u2019 the week.\u201d\nA murmur ran through the crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t you fret,\u201d Calpurnia whispered to me, but the\nroses on her hat trembled indignantly.\nWhen Lula came up the pathway toward us Calpurnia said, \u201cStop right there, nigger.\u201d\nLula stopped, but she said, \u201cYou ain\u2019t got no business bringin\u2018 white chillun here\u2014they\ngot their church, we got our\u2019n. It is our church, ain\u2019t it, Miss Cal?\u201d\nCalpurnia said, \u201cIt\u2019s the same God, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\nJem said, \u201cLet\u2019s go home, Cal, they don\u2019t want us here\u2014\u201d\nI agreed: they did not want us here. I sensed, rather than saw, that we were being\nadvanced upon. They seemed to be drawing closer to us, but when I looked up at\nCalpurnia there was amusement in her eyes. When I looked down the pathway again,\nLula was gone. In her place was a solid mass of colored people.\nOne of them stepped from the crowd. It was Zeebo, the garbage collector. \u201cMister\nJem,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re mighty glad to have you all here. Don\u2019t pay no \u2018tention to Lula,\nshe\u2019s contentious because Reverend Sykes threatened to church her. She\u2019s a\ntroublemaker from way back, got fancy ideas an\u2019 haughty ways\u2014we\u2019re mighty glad to\nhave you all.\u201d\nWith that, Calpurnia led us to the church door where we were greeted by Reverend\nSykes, who led us to the front pew.\nFirst Purchase was unceiled and unpainted within. Along its walls unlighted kerosene\nlamps hung on brass brackets; pine benches served as pews. Behind the rough oak\npulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed God Is Love, the church\u2019s only decoration\nexcept a rotogravure print of Hunt\u2019s The Light of the World. There was no sign of piano,\norgan, hymn-books, church programs\u2014the familiar ecclesiastical impedimenta we saw \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 64\nevery Sunday. It was dim inside, with a damp coolness slowly dispelled by the gathering\ncongregation. At each seat was a cheap cardboard fan bearing a garish Garden of\nGethsemane, courtesy Tyndal\u2019s Hardware Co. (You-Name-It-We-Sell-It).\nCalpurnia motioned Jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between us.\nShe fished in her purse, drew out her handkerchief, and untied the hard wad of change\nin its corner. She gave a dime to me and a dime to Jem. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ours,\u201d he\nwhispered. \u201cYou keep it,\u201d Calpurnia said, \u201cyou\u2019re my company.\u201d Jem\u2019s face showed brief\nindecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime, but his innate courtesy won and he\nshifted his dime to his pocket. I did likewise with no qualms.\n\u201cCal,\u201d I whispered, \u201cwhere are the hymn-books?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWell how\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cSh-h,\u201d she said. Reverend Sykes was standing behind the pulpit staring the\ncongregation to silence. He was a short, stocky man in a black suit, black tie, white shirt,\nand a gold watch-chain that glinted in the light from the frosted windows.\nHe said, \u201cBrethren and sisters, we are particularly glad to have company with us this\nmorning. Mister and Miss Finch. You all know their father. Before I begin I will read\nsome announcements.\u201d\nReverend Sykes shuffled some papers, chose one and held it at arm\u2019s length. \u201cThe\nMissionary Society meets in the home of Sister Annette Reeves next Tuesday. Bring\nyour sewing.\u201d\nHe read from another paper. \u201cYou all know of Brother Tom Robinson\u2019s trouble. He has\nbeen a faithful member of First Purchase since he was a boy. The collection taken up\ntoday and for the next three Sundays will go to Helen\u2014his wife, to help her out at\nhome.\u201d\nI punched Jem. \u201cThat\u2019s the Tom Atticus\u2019s de\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSh-h!\u201d\nI turned to Calpurnia but was hushed before I opened my mouth. Subdued, I fixed my\nattention upon Reverend Sykes, who seemed to be waiting for me to settle down. \u201cWill\nthe music superintendent lead us in the first hymn,\u201d he said.\nZeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle, stopping in front of us and\nfacing the congregation. He was carrying a battered hymn-book. He opened it and said,\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sing number two seventy-three.\u201d\nThis was too much for me. \u201cHow\u2019re we gonna sing it if there ain\u2019t any hymn-books?\u201d\nCalpurnia smiled. \u201cHush baby,\u201d she whispered, \u201cyou\u2019ll see in a minute.\u201d\nZeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a land beyond the river.\u201d\nMiraculously on pitch, a hundred voices sang out Zeebo\u2019s words. The last syllable,\nheld to a husky hum, was followed by Zeebo saying, \u201cThat we call the sweet forever.\u201d\nMusic again swelled around us; the last note lingered and Zeebo met it with the next\nline: \u201cAnd we only reach that shore by faith\u2019s decree.\u201d\nThe congregation hesitated, Zeebo repeated the line carefully, and it was sung. At the\nchorus Zeebo closed the book, a signal for the congregation to proceed without his help.\nOn the dying notes of \u201cJubilee,\u201d Zeebo said, \u201cIn that far-off sweet forever, just beyond\nthe shining river.\u201d\nLine for line, voices followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a melancholy\nmurmur.\nI looked at Jem, who was looking at Zeebo from the corners of his eyes. I didn\u2019t\nbelieve it either, but we had both heard it.\nReverend Sykes then called on the Lord to bless the sick and the suffering, a\nprocedure no different from our church practice, except Reverend Sykes directed the\nDeity\u2019s attention to several specific cases.\nHis sermon was a forthright denunciation of sin, an austere declaration of the motto on\nthe wall behind him: he warned his flock against the evils of heady brews, gambling, and\nstrange women. Bootleggers caused enough trouble in the Quarters, but women were \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 65\nworse. Again, as I had often met it in my own church, I was confronted with the Impurity\nof Women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen.\nJem and I had heard the same sermon Sunday after Sunday, with only one exception.\nReverend Sykes used his pulpit more freely to express his views on individual lapses\nfrom grace: Jim Hardy had been absent from church for five Sundays and he wasn\u2019t\nsick; Constance Jackson had better watch her ways\u2014she was in grave danger for\nquarreling with her neighbors; she had erected the only spite fence in the history of the\nQuarters.\nReverend Sykes closed his sermon. He stood beside a table in front of the pulpit and\nrequested the morning offering, a proceeding that was strange to Jem and me. One by\none, the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a black\nenameled coffee can. Jem and I followed suit, and received a soft, \u201cThank you, thank\nyou,\u201d as our dimes clinked.\nTo our amazement, Reverend Sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked the\ncoins into his hand. He straightened up and said, \u201cThis is not enough, we must have ten\ndollars.\u201d\nThe congregation stirred. \u201cYou all know what it\u2019s for\u2014Helen can\u2019t leave those children\nto work while Tom\u2019s in jail. If everybody gives one more dime, we\u2019ll have it\u2014\u201d Reverend\nSykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of the church. \u201cAlec, shut the\ndoors. Nobody leaves here till we have ten dollars.\u201d\nCalpurnia scratched in her handbag and brought forth a battered leather coin purse.\n\u201cNaw Cal,\u201d Jem whispered, when she handed him a shiny quarter, \u201cwe can put ours in.\nGimme your dime, Scout.\u201d\nThe church was becoming stuffy, and it occurred to me that Reverend Sykes intended\nto sweat the amount due out of his flock. Fans crackled, feet shuffled, tobacco-chewers\nwere in agony.\nReverend Sykes startled me by saying sternly, \u201cCarlow Richardson, I haven\u2019t seen\nyou up this aisle yet.\u201d\nA thin man in khaki pants came up the aisle and deposited a coin. The congregation\nmurmured approval.\nReverend Sykes then said, \u201cI want all of you with no children to make a sacrifice and\ngive one more dime apiece. Then we\u2019ll have it.\u201d\nSlowly, painfully, the ten dollars was collected. The door was opened, and the gust of\nwarm air revived us. Zeebo lined On Jordan\u2019s Stormy Banks, and church was over.\nI wanted to stay and explore, but Calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of her. At\nthe church door, while she paused to talk with Zeebo and his family, Jem and I chatted\nwith Reverend Sykes. I was bursting with questions, but decided I would wait and let\nCalpurnia answer them.\n\u201cWe were \u2018specially glad to have you all here,\u201d said Reverend Sykes. \u201cThis church has\nno better friend than your daddy.\u201d\nMy curiosity burst: \u201cWhy were you all takin\u2018 up collection for Tom Robinson\u2019s wife?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear why?\u201d asked Reverend Sykes. \u201cHelen\u2019s got three little\u2019uns and she\ncan\u2019t go out to work\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t she take \u2018em with her, Reverend?\u201d I asked. It was customary for field\nNegroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while their\nparents worked\u2014usually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of cotton. Those\nunable to sit were strapped papoose-style on their mothers\u2019 backs, or resided in extra\ncotton bags.\nReverend Sykes hesitated. \u201cTo tell you the truth, Miss Jean Louise, Helen\u2019s finding it\nhard to get work these days\u2026 when it\u2019s picking time, I think Mr. Link Deas\u2019ll take her.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not, Reverend?\u201d\nBefore he could answer, I felt Calpurnia\u2019s hand on my shoulder. At its pressure I said,\n\u201cWe thank you for lettin\u2018 us come.\u201d Jem echoed me, and we made our way homeward.\n\u201cCal, I know Tom Robinson\u2019s in jail an\u2018 he\u2019s done somethin\u2019 awful, but why won\u2019t folks\nhire Helen?\u201d I asked. \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 66\nCalpurnia, in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat, walked between Jem and me. \u201cIt\u2019s\nbecause of what folks say Tom\u2019s done,\u201d she said. \u201cFolks aren\u2019t anxious to\u2014to have\nanything to do with any of his family.\u201d\n\u201cJust what did he do, Cal?\u201d\nCalpurnia sighed. \u201cOld Mr. Bob Ewell accused him of rapin\u2018 his girl an\u2019 had him\narrested an\u2018 put in jail\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMr. Ewell?\u201d My memory stirred. \u201cDoes he have anything to do with those Ewells that\ncome every first day of school an\u2018 then go home? Why, Atticus said they were absolute\ntrash\u2014I never heard Atticus talk about folks the way he talked about the Ewells. He\nsaid-\u201d\n\u201cYeah, those are the ones.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if everybody in Maycomb knows what kind of folks the Ewells are they\u2019d be glad\nto hire Helen\u2026 what\u2019s rape, Cal?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s somethin\u2018 you\u2019ll have to ask Mr. Finch about,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can explain it better\nthan I can. You all hungry? The Reverend took a long time unwindin\u2019 this morning, he\u2019s\nnot usually so tedious.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s just like our preacher,\u201d said Jem, \u201cbut why do you all sing hymns that way?\u201d\n\u201cLinin\u2018?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cIs that what it is?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s called linin\u2018. They\u2019ve done it that way as long as I can remember.\u201d\nJem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get some\nhymn-books.\nCalpurnia laughed. \u201cWouldn\u2019t do any good,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t read.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t read?\u201d I asked. \u201cAll those folks?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Calpurnia nodded. \u201cCan\u2019t but about four folks in First Purchase read\u2026\nI\u2019m one of \u2018em.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you go to school, Cal?\u201d asked Jem.\n\u201cNowhere. Let\u2019s see now, who taught me my letters? It was Miss Maudie Atkinson\u2019s\naunt, old Miss Buford\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you that old?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m older than Mr. Finch, even.\u201d Calpurnia grinned. \u201cNot sure how much, though. We\nstarted rememberin\u2018 one time, trying to figure out how old I was\u2014I can remember back\njust a few years more\u2019n he can, so I\u2019m not much older, when you take off the fact that\nmen can\u2019t remember as well as women.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your birthday, Cal?\u201d\n\u201cI just have it on Christmas, it\u2019s easier to remember that way\u2014I don\u2019t have a real\nbirthday.\u201d\n\u201cBut Cal,\u201d Jem protested, \u201cyou don\u2019t look even near as old as Atticus.\u201d\n\u201cColored folks don\u2019t show their ages so fast,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMaybe because they can\u2019t read. Cal, did you teach Zeebo?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Mister Jem. There wasn\u2019t a school even when he was a boy. I made him learn,\nthough.\u201d\nZeebo was Calpurnia\u2019s eldest son. If I had ever thought about it, I would have known\nthat Calpurnia was of mature years\u2014Zeebo had half-grown children\u2014but then I had\nnever thought about it.\n\u201cDid you teach him out of a primer, like us?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNo, I made him get a page of the Bible every day, and there was a book Miss Buford\ntaught me out of\u2014bet you don\u2019t know where I got it,\u201d she said.\nWe didn\u2019t know.\nCalpurnia said, \u201cYour Granddaddy Finch gave it to me.\u201d\n\u201cWere you from the Landing?\u201d Jem asked. \u201cYou never told us that.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly am, Mister Jem. Grew up down there between the Buford Place and the\nLandin\u2018. I\u2019ve spent all my days workin\u2019 for the Finches or the Bufords, an\u2018 I moved to\nMaycomb when your daddy and your mamma married.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the book, Cal?\u201d I asked. \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 67\n\u201cBlackstone\u2019s Commentaries.\u201d\nJem was thunderstruck. \u201cYou mean you taught Zeebo outa that?\u201d\n\u201cWhy yes sir, Mister Jem.\u201d Calpurnia timidly put her fingers to her mouth. \u201cThey were\nthe only books I had. Your grandaddy said Mr. Blackstone wrote fine English\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t talk like the rest of \u2018em,\u201d said Jem.\n\u201cThe rest of who?\u201d\n\u201cRest of the colored folks. Cal, but you talked like they did in church\u2026\u201d\nThat Calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. The idea that she had a\nseparate existence outside our household was a novel one, to say nothing of her having\ncommand of two languages. \u201cCal,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhy do you talk nigger-talk to the\u2014to your\nfolks when you know it\u2019s not right?\u201d\n\u201cWell, in the first place I\u2019m black\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you hafta talk that way when you know better,\u201d said Jem.\nCalpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head, then pressed her hat down carefully\nover her ears. \u201cIt\u2019s right hard to say,\u201d she said. \u201cSuppose you and Scout talked coloredfolks\u2019\ntalk at home it\u2019d be out of place, wouldn\u2019t it? Now what if I talked white-folks\u2019 talk at\nchurch, and with my neighbors? They\u2019d think I was puttin\u2018 on airs to beat Moses.\u201d\n\u201cBut Cal, you know better,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to tell all you know. It\u2019s not ladylike\u2014in the second place, folks\ndon\u2019t like to have somebody around knowin\u2018 more than they do. It aggravates \u2019em.\nYou\u2019re not gonna change any of them by talkin\u2018 right, they\u2019ve got to want to learn\nthemselves, and when they don\u2019t want to learn there\u2019s nothing you can do but keep your\nmouth shut or talk their language.\u201d\n\u201cCal, can I come to see you sometimes?\u201d\nShe looked down at me. \u201cSee me, honey? You see me every day.\u201d\n\u201cOut to your house,\u201d I said. \u201cSometimes after work? Atticus can get me.\u201d\n\u201cAny time you want to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d be glad to have you.\u201d\nWe were on the sidewalk by the Radley Place.\n\u201cLook on the porch yonder,\u201d Jem said.\nI looked over to the Radley Place, expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning\nhimself in the swing. The swing was empty.\n\u201cI mean our porch,\u201d said Jem.\nI looked down the street. Enarmored, upright, uncompromising, Aunt Alexandra was\nsitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life.\nChapter 13\n\u201cPut my bag in the front bedroom, Calpurnia,\u201d was the first thing Aunt Alexandra said.\n\u201cJean Louise, stop scratching your head,\u201d was the second thing she said.\nCalpurnia picked up Aunty\u2019s heavy suitcase and opened the door. \u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d said\nJem, and took it. I heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump. The sound had\na dull permanence about it. \u201cHave you come for a visit, Aunty?\u201d I asked. Aunt\nAlexandra\u2019s visits from the Landing were rare, and she traveled in state. She owned a\nbright green square Buick and a black chauffeur, both kept in an unhealthy state of\ntidiness, but today they were nowhere to be seen.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t your father tell you?\u201d she asked.\nJem and I shook our heads.\n\u201cProbably he forgot. He\u2019s not in yet, is he?\u201d\n\u201cNome, he doesn\u2019t usually get back till late afternoon,\u201d said Jem.\n\u201cWell, your father and I decided it was time I came to stay with you for a while.\u201d\n\u201cFor a while\u201d in Maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years. Jem and I\nexchanged glances.\n\u201cJem\u2019s growing up now and you are too,\u201d she said to me. \u201cWe decided that it would be\nbest for you to have some feminine influence. It won\u2019t be many years, Jean Louise,\nbefore you become interested in clothes and boys\u2014\u201d \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 68\nI could have made several answers to this: Cal\u2019s a girl, it would be many years before\nI would be interested in boys, I would never be interested in clothes\u2026 but I kept quiet.\n\u201cWhat about Uncle Jimmy?\u201d asked Jem. \u201cIs he comin\u2018, too?\u201d\n\u201cOh no, he\u2019s staying at the Landing. He\u2019ll keep the place going.\u201d\nThe moment I said, \u201cWon\u2019t you miss him?\u201d I realized that this was not a tactful\nquestion. Uncle Jimmy present or Uncle Jimmy absent made not much difference, he\nnever said anything. Aunt Alexandra ignored my question.\nI could think of nothing else to say to her. In fact I could never think of anything to say\nto her, and I sat thinking of past painful conversations between us: How are you, Jean\nLouise? Fine, thank you ma\u2019am, how are you? Very well, thank you, what have you\nbeen doing with yourself? Nothin\u2018. Don\u2019t you do anything? Nome. Certainly you have\nfriends? Yessum. Well what do you all do? Nothin\u2019.\nIt was plain that Aunty thought me dull in the extreme, because I once heard her tell\nAtticus that I was sluggish.\nThere was a story behind all this, but I had no desire to extract it from her then. Today\nwas Sunday, and Aunt Alexandra was positively irritable on the Lord\u2019s Day. I guess it\nwas her Sunday corset. She was not fat, but solid, and she chose protective garments\nthat drew up her bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her waist, flared out her rear, and\nmanaged to suggest that Aunt Alexandra\u2019s was once an hour-glass figure. From any\nangle, it was formidable.\nThe remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when\nrelatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway. It was\nAtticus, home from Montgomery. Jem, forgetting his dignity, ran with me to meet him.\nJem seized his briefcase and bag, I jumped into his arms, felt his vague dry kiss and\nsaid, \u201c\u2018d you bring me a book? \u2019d you know Aunty\u2019s here?\u201d\nAtticus answered both questions in the affirmative. \u201cHow\u2019d you like for her to come live\nwith us?\u201d\nI said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie under certain\ncircumstances and at all times when one can\u2019t do anything about them.\n\u201cWe felt it was time you children needed\u2014well, it\u2019s like this, Scout,\u201d Atticus said. \u201cYour\naunt\u2019s doing me a favor as well as you all. I can\u2019t stay here all day with you, and the\nsummer\u2019s going to be a hot one.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea, however, that Aunt\nAlexandra\u2019s appearance on the scene was not so much Atticus\u2019s doing as hers. Aunty\nhad a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose her coming to live\nwith us was in that category.\nMaycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so loaded with\nshinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long visits with Aunt Alexandra,\nconsisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking her head and saying, \u201cUh, uh, uh.\u201d Miss\nRachel next door had Aunty over for coffee in the afternoons, and Mr. Nathan Radley\nwent so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her.\nWhen she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra seemed\nas if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary Society refreshments added to her\nreputation as a hostess (she did not permit Calpurnia to make the delicacies required to\nsustain the Society through long reports on Rice Christians); she joined and became\nSecretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all parties present and participating in\nthe life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one of the last of her kind: she had river-boat,\nboarding-school manners; let any moral come along and she would uphold it; she was\nborn in the objective case; she was an incurable gossip. When Aunt Alexandra went to\nschool, self-doubt could not be found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning. She\nwas never bored, and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal\nprerogative: she would arrange, advise, caution, and warn.\nShe never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal groups\nto the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused Jem rather than annoyed him:\n\u201cAunty better watch how she talks\u2014scratch most folks in Maycomb and they\u2019re kin to \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 69\nus.\u201d\nAunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweather\u2019s suicide, said it\nwas caused by a morbid streak in the family. Let a sixteen-year-old girl giggle in the\nchoir and Aunty would say, \u201cIt just goes to show you, all the Penfield women are flighty.\u201d\nEverybody in Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a Drinking Streak, a Gambling Streak,\na Mean Streak, a Funny Streak.\nOnce, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawford\u2019s tendency to mind other\npeople\u2019s business was hereditary, Atticus said, \u201cSister, when you stop to think about it,\nour generation\u2019s practically the first in the Finch family not to marry its cousins. Would\nyou say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak?\u201d\nAunty said no, that\u2019s where we got our small hands and feet.\nI never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received the\nimpression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the sense they\nhad, but Aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer a\nfamily had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.\n\u201cThat makes the Ewells fine folks, then,\u201d said Jem. The tribe of which Burris Ewell and\nhis brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the Maycomb dump,\nand had thrived on county welfare money for three generations.\nAunt Alexandra\u2019s theory had something behind it, though. Maycomb was an ancient\ntown. It was twenty miles east of Finch\u2019s Landing, awkwardly inland for such an old\ntown. But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimblewittedness\nof one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pigtrails\nmet, the only tavern in the territory. Sinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied\nammunition to Indians and settlers alike, neither knowing or caring whether he was a\npart of the Alabama Territory or the Creek Nation so long as business was good.\nBusiness was excellent when Governor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting the\nnewly created county\u2019s domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its\nexact center and there establish its seat of government. The surveyors, Sinkfield\u2019s\nguests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of Maycomb County, and\nshowed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built. Had not Sinkfield\nmade a bold stroke to preserve his holdings, Maycomb would have sat in the middle of\nWinston Swamp, a place totally devoid of interest. Instead, Maycomb grew and\nsprawled out from its hub, Sinkfield\u2019s Tavern, because Sinkfield reduced his guests to\nmyopic drunkenness one evening, induced them to bring forward their maps and charts,\nlop off a little here, add a bit there, and adjust the center of the county to meet his\nrequirements. He sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts of\nshinny in their saddlebags\u2014two apiece and one for the Governor.\nBecause its primary reason for existence was government, Maycomb was spared the\ngrubbiness that distinguished most Alabama towns its size. In the beginning its buildings\nwere solid, its courthouse proud, its streets graciously wide. Maycomb\u2019s proportion of\nprofessional people ran high: one went there to have his teeth pulled, his wagon fixed,\nhis heart listened to, his money deposited, his soul saved, his mules vetted. But the\nultimate wisdom of Sinkfield\u2019s maneuver is open to question. He placed the young town\ntoo far away from the only kind of public transportation in those days\u2014river-boat\u2014and it\ntook a man from the north end of the county two days to travel to Maycomb for storebought\ngoods. As a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years, an\nisland in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland.\nAlthough Maycomb was ignored during the War Between the States, Reconstruction\nrule and economic ruin forced the town to grow. It grew inward. New people so rarely\nsettled there, the same families married the same families until the members of the\ncommunity looked faintly alike. Occasionally someone would return from Montgomery or\nMobile with an outsider, but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of family\nresemblance. Things were more or less the same during my early years.\nThere was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked this way: the\nolder citizens, the present generation of people who had lived side by side for years and \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 70\nyears, were utterly predictable to one another: they took for granted attitudes, character\nshadings, even gestures, as having been repeated in each generation and refined by\ntime. Thus the dicta No Crawford Minds His Own Business, Every Third Merriweather Is\nMorbid, The Truth Is Not in the Delafields, All the Bufords Walk Like That, were simply\nguides to daily living: never take a check from a Delafield without a discreet call to the\nbank; Miss Maudie Atkinson\u2019s shoulder stoops because she was a Buford; if Mrs. Grace\nMerriweather sips gin out of Lydia E. Pinkham bottles it\u2019s nothing unusual\u2014her mother\ndid the same.\nAunt Alexandra fitted into the world of Maycomb like a hand into a glove, but never\ninto the world of Jem and me. I so often wondered how she could be Atticus\u2019s and Uncle\nJack\u2019s sister that I revived half-remembered tales of changelings and mandrake roots\nthat Jem had spun long ago.\nThese were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay, as she had little to\nsay to Jem or me, and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went to\nbed. It was summer and we were outdoors. Of course some afternoons when I would\nrun inside for a drink of water, I would find the livingroom overrun with Maycomb ladies,\nsipping, whispering, fanning, and I would be called: \u201cJean Louise, come speak to these\nladies.\u201d\nWhen I appeared in the doorway, Aunty would look as if she regretted her request; I\nwas usually mud-splashed or covered with sand.\n\u201cSpeak to your Cousin Lily,\u201d she said one afternoon, when she had trapped me in the\nhall.\n\u201cWho?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYour Cousin Lily Brooke,\u201d said Aunt Alexandra.\n\u201cShe our cousin? I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\nAunt Alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to Cousin\nLily and firm disapproval to me. When Cousin Lily Brooke left I knew I was in for it.\nIt was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the Finch Family, or to\ninstall any pride into his children. She summoned Jem, who sat warily on the sofa\nbeside me. She left the room and returned with a purple-covered book on which\nMeditations of Joshua S. St. Clair was stamped in gold.\n\u201cYour cousin wrote this,\u201d said Aunt Alexandra. \u201cHe was a beautiful character.\u201d\nJem examined the small volume. \u201cIs this the Cousin Joshua who was locked up for so\nlong?\u201d\nAunt Alexandra said, \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, Atticus said he went round the bend at the University. Said he tried to shoot the\npresident. Said Cousin Joshua said he wasn\u2019t anything but a sewer-inspector and tried\nto shoot him with an old flintlock pistol, only it just blew up in his hand. Atticus said it\ncost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that one\u2014\u201d\nAunt Alexandra was standing stiff as a stork. \u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about\nthis.\u201d\nBefore bedtime I was in Jem\u2019s room trying to borrow a book, when Atticus knocked\nand entered. He sat on the side of Jem\u2019s bed, looked at us soberly, then he grinned.\n\u201cEr\u2014h\u2019rm,\u201d he said. He was beginning to preface some things he said with a throaty\nnoise, and I thought he must at last be getting old, but he looked the same. \u201dI don\u2019t\nexactly know how to say this,\u201c he began.\n\u201cWell, just say it,\u201d said Jem. \u201cHave we done something?\u201d\nOur father was actually fidgeting. \u201cNo, I just want to explain to you that\u2014your Aunt\nAlexandra asked me\u2026 son, you know you\u2019re a Finch, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d Jem looked out of the corners of his eyes. His voice rose\nuncontrollably, \u201cAtticus, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\nAtticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you the facts of life.\u201d\nJem\u2019s disgust deepened. \u201cI know all that stuff,\u201d he said.\nAtticus suddenly grew serious. In his lawyer\u2019s voice, without a shade of inflection, he\nsaid: \u201cYour aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and Jean Louise that you \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d By Nelle Harper Lee 71\nare not from run-of-the-mill people, that you are the product of several generations\u2019\ngentle breeding\u2014\u201d Atticus paused, watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg.\n\u201cGentle breeding,\u201d he continued, when I had found and scratched it, \u201cand that you\nshould try to live up to your name\u2014\u201d Atticus persevered in spite of us: \u201cShe asked me to\ntell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are. She wants\nto talk to you about the family and what it\u2019s meant to Maycomb County through the\nyears, so you\u2019ll have some idea of who you are, so you might be moved to behave\naccordingly,\u201d he concluded at a gallop.\nStunned, Jem and I looked at each other, then at Atticus, whose collar seemed to\nworry him. We did not speak to him.\nPresently I picked up a comb from Jem\u2019s dresser and ran its teeth along the edge.\n\u201cStop that noise,\u201d Atticus said.\nHis curtness stung me. The comb was midway in its journey, and I banged it down.\nFor no reason I felt myself beginning to cry, but I could not stop. This was not my father.\nMy father never thought these thoughts. My father never spoke so. Aunt Alexandra had\nput him up to this, somehow. Through my tears I saw Jem standing in a similar pool of\nisolation, his head cocked to one side.\nThere was nowhere to go, but I turned to go and met Atticus\u2019s vest front. I buried my\nhead in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the light blue\ncloth: his watch ticking, the faint crackle of his starched shirt, the soft sound of his\nbreathing.\n\u201cYour stomach\u2019s growling,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI know it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou better take some soda.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAtticus, is all this behavin\u2018 an\u2019 stuff gonna make things different? I mean are you\u2014?\u201d\nI felt his hand on the back of my head. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot time to worry.\u201d When I heard that, I knew he had come back to us. The blood in my\nlegs began to flow again, and I raised my head. \u201cYou really want us to do all that? I can\u2019t\nremember everything Finches are supposed to do\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to remember it. Forget it.\u201d\nHe went to the door and out of the room, shutting the door behind him. He nearly\nslammed it, but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly. As Jem and I\nstared, the door opened again and Atticus peered around. His eyebrows were raised,\nhis glasses had slipped. \u201cGet more like Cousin Joshua every day, don\u2019t I? Do you think\nI\u2019ll end up costing the family five hundred dollars?\u201d\nI know now what he was trying to do, but Atticus was only a man.

[iii]\nOr low Dubost [2]\u2014as once the world has seen\u2014\nDegrade God's creatures in his graphic spleen?\nNot all that forced politeness, which defends\nFools in their faults, could gag his grinning friends.\nBelieve me, Moschus, like that picture seems [iv]\nThe book which, sillier than a sick man's dreams,\nDisplays a crowd of figures incomplete,\nPoetic Nightmares, without head or feet.\nPoets and painters, as all artists know, [v]\nMay shoot a little with a lengthened bow;\nWe claim this mutual mercy for our task,\nAnd grant in turn the pardon which we ask;\nBut make not monsters spring from gentle dams\u2014\nBirds breed not vipers, tigers nurse not lambs.\n\nA laboured, long Exordium, sometimes tends\n(Like patriot speeches) but to paltry ends; [vi]\nAnd nonsense in a lofty note goes down,\nAs Pertness passes with a legal gown: [vii]\nThus many a Bard describes in pompous strain [viii]\nThe clear brook babbling through the goodly plain:\nThe groves of Granta, and her Gothic halls,\nKing's Coll-Cam's stream-stained windows, and old walls:\nOr, in adventurous numbers, neatly aims\nTo paint a rainbow, or the river Thames. [3]\n\nYou sketch a tree, and so perhaps may shine [ix]\u2014\nBut daub a shipwreck like an alehouse sign;\nYou plan a vase\u2014it dwindles to a pot;\nThen glide down Grub-street\u2014fasting and forgot:\nLaughed into Lethe by some quaint Review,\nWhose wit is never troublesome till\u2014true.\nIn fine, to whatsoever you aspire,\nLet it at least be simple and entire.\nThe greater portion of the rhyming tribe [x]\n(Give ear, my friend, for thou hast been a scribe)\nAre led astray by some peculiar lure. [xi]\nI labour to be brief\u2014become obscure;\nOne falls while following Elegance too fast;\nAnother soars, inflated with Bombast;\nToo low a third crawls on, afraid to fly,\nHe spins his subject to Satiety;\nAbsurdly varying, he at last engraves\nFish in the woods, and boars beneath the waves! [xii]\nUnless your care's exact, your judgment nice,\nThe flight from Folly leads but into Vice;\n\nNone are complete, all wanting in some part,\nLike certain tailors, limited in art.\nFor galligaskins Slowshears is your man [xiii]\nBut coats must claim another artisan. [4]\nNow this to me, I own, seems much the same\nAs Vulcan's feet to bear Apollo's frame;\nOr, with a fair complexion, to expose\nBlack eyes, black ringlets, but\u2014a bottle nose!\nDear Authors! suit your topics to your strength,\nAnd ponder well your subject, and its length;\n\nNor lift your load, before you're quite aware\nWhat weight your shoulders will, or will not, bear.\nBut lucid Order, and Wit's siren voice, [xiv]\nAwait the Poet, skilful in his choice;\nWith native Eloquence he soars along,\nGrace in his thoughts, and Music in his song.\nLet Judgment teach him wisely to combine\nWith future parts the now omitted line:\nThis shall the Author choose, or that reject,\nPrecise in style, and cautious to select;\nNor slight applause will candid pens afford\nTo him who furnishes a wanting word. [xv]\nThen fear not, if 'tis needful, to produce\nSome term unknown, or obsolete in use,\n(As Pitt has furnished us a word or two, [5]\nWhich Lexicographers declined to do;)\nSo you indeed, with care,\u2014(but be content\nTo take this license rarely)\u2014may invent.\nNew words find credit in these latter days,\nIf neatly grafted on a Gallic phrase; [xvi]\n\nWhat Chaucer, Spenser did, we scarce refuse\nTo Dryden's or to Pope's maturer Muse.\nIf you can add a little, say why not,\nAs well as William Pitt, and Walter Scott?\nSince they, by force of rhyme and force of lungs, [xvii]\nEnriched our Island's ill-united tongues;\n'Tis then\u2014and shall be\u2014lawful to present\nReform in writing, as in Parliament.\nAs forests shed their foliage by degrees,\nSo fade expressions which in season please;\n\nAnd we and ours, alas! are due to Fate,\nAnd works and words but dwindle to a date.\nThough as a Monarch nods, and Commerce calls, [xviii]\nImpetuous rivers stagnate in canals;\nThough swamps subdued, and marshes drained, sustain [xix]\nThe heavy ploughshare and the yellow grain,\nAnd rising ports along the busy shore\nProtect the vessel from old Ocean's roar,\nAll, all, must perish; but, surviving last,\nThe love of Letters half preserves the past.\n\nTrue, some decay, yet not a few revive; [xx] [6]\nThough those shall sink, which now appear to thrive,\nAs Custom arbitrates, whose shifting sway [xxi]\nOur life and language must alike obey.\nThe immortal wars which Gods and Angels wage,\nAre they not shown in Milton's sacred page?\nHis strain will teach what numbers best belong\nTo themes celestial told in Epic song. [xxii]\nThe slow, sad stanza will correctly paint\nThe Lover's anguish, or the Friend's complaint.\n\nBut which deserves the Laurel\u2014Rhyme or Blank? [xxiii]\nWhich holds on Helicon the higher rank?\nLet squabbling critics by themselves dispute\nThis point, as puzzling as a Chancery suit.\nSatiric rhyme first sprang from selfish spleen.\nYou doubt\u2014see Dryden, Pope, St. Patrick's Dean. [7]\nBlank verse is now, with one consent, allied\nTo Tragedy, and rarely quits her side.\nThough mad Almanzor [8] rhymed in Dryden's days,\nNo sing-song Hero rants in modern plays;\n\nWhilst modest Comedy her verse foregoes\nFor jest and 'pun' [9] in very middling prose.\nNot that our Bens or Beaumonts show the worse,\nOr lose one point, because they wrote in verse.\nBut so Thalia pleases to appear, [xxiv]\nPoor Virgin! damned some twenty times a year!\nWhate'er the scene, let this advice have weight:\u2014\nAdapt your language to your Hero's state.\nAt times Melpomene forgets to groan,\nAnd brisk Thalia takes a serious tone;\n\nNor unregarded will the act pass by\nWhere angry Townly [10] \"lifts his voice on high.\"\nAgain, our Shakespeare limits verse to Kings,\nWhen common prose will serve for common things;\nAnd lively Hal resigns heroic ire, [xxv]\u2014\nTo \"hollaing Hotspur\" [11] and his sceptred sire. [xxvi]\n'Tis not enough, ye Bards, with all your art,\nTo polish poems; they must touch the heart:\nWhere'er the scene be laid, whate'er the song,\nStill let it bear the hearer's soul along;\n\nCommand your audience or to smile or weep,\nWhiche'er may please you\u2014anything but sleep.\nThe Poet claims our tears; but, by his leave,\nBefore I shed them, let me see 'him' grieve.\nIf banished Romeo feigned nor sigh nor tear,\nLulled by his languor, I could sleep or sneer. [xxvii]\nSad words, no doubt, become a serious face,\nAnd men look angry in the proper place.\nAt double meanings folks seem wondrous sly,\nAnd Sentiment prescribes a pensive eye;\n\nFor Nature formed at first the inward man,\nAnd actors copy Nature\u2014when they can.\nShe bids the beating heart with rapture bound,\nRaised to the Stars, or levelled with the ground;\nAnd for Expression's aid, 'tis said, or sung, [xxviii]\nShe gave our mind's interpreter\u2014the tongue,\nWho, worn with use, of late would fain dispense\n(At least in theatres) with common sense;\nO'erwhelm with sound the Boxes, Gallery, Pit,\nAnd raise a laugh with anything\u2014but Wit.\n\nTo skilful writers it will much import,\nWhence spring their scenes, from common life or Court;\nWhether they seek applause by smile or tear,\nTo draw a Lying Valet, [12] or a Lear, [13]\nA sage, or rakish youngster wild from school,\nA wandering Peregrine, or plain John Bull;\nAll persons please when Nature's voice prevails,\nScottish or Irish, born in Wilts or Wales.\nOr follow common fame, or forge a plot; [xxix]\nWho cares if mimic heroes lived or not!\n\nOne precept serves to regulate the scene:\nMake it appear as if it might have been.\nIf some Drawcansir [14] you aspire to draw,\nPresent him raving, and above all law:\nIf female furies in your scheme are planned,\nMacbeth's fierce dame is ready to your hand;\nFor tears and treachery, for good and evil,\nConstance, King Richard, Hamlet, and the Devil!\nBut if a new design you dare essay,\nAnd freely wander from the beaten way,\n\nTrue to your characters, till all be past,\nPreserve consistency from first to last.\nTis hard [15] to venture where our betters fail, [xxx]\nOr lend fresh interest to a twice-told tale;\nAnd yet, perchance,'tis wiser to prefer\nA hackneyed plot, than choose a new, and err;\nYet copy not too closely, but record,\nMore justly, thought for thought than word for word;\nNor trace your Prototype through narrow ways,\nBut only follow where he merits praise.\n\nFor you, young Bard! whom luckless fate may lead [16]\nTo tremble on the nod of all who read,\nEre your first score of cantos Time unrolls, [xxxi]\nBeware\u2014for God's sake, don't begin like Bowles!\n\"Awake a louder and a loftier strain,\" [17]\u2014\nAnd pray, what follows from his boiling brain?\u2014\nHe sinks to Southey's level in a trice,\nWhose Epic Mountains never fail in mice!\nNot so of yore awoke your mighty Sire\nThe tempered warblings of his master-lyre;\n\nSoft as the gentler breathing of the lute,\n\"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruit\"\nHe speaks, but, as his subject swells along,\nEarth, Heaven, and Hades echo with the song.\"[xxxii]\nStill to the \"midst of things\" he hastens on,\nAs if we witnessed all already done; [xxxiii]\nLeaves on his path whatever seems too mean\nTo raise the subject, or adorn the scene;\nGives, as each page improves upon the sight,\nNot smoke from brightness, but from darkness\u2014light;\n\nAnd truth and fiction with such art compounds,\nWe know not where to fix their several bounds.\nIf you would please the Public, deign to hear\nWhat soothes the many-headed monster's ear: [xxxiv]\nIf your heart triumph when the hands of all\nApplaud in thunder at the curtain's fall,\nDeserve those plaudits\u2014study Nature's page,\nAnd sketch the striking traits of every age;\nWhile varying Man and varying years unfold\nLife's little tale, so oft, so vainly told;\n\nObserve his simple childhood's dawning days,\nHis pranks, his prate, his playmates, and his plays:\nTill time at length the mannish tyro weans,\nAnd prurient vice outstrips his tardy teens! [xxxv]\nBehold him Freshman! forced no more to groan [xxxvi]\nO'er Virgil's [18] devilish verses and his own;\nPrayers are too tedious, Lectures too abstruse,\nHe flies from Tavell's frown to \"Fordham's Mews;\"\n(Unlucky Tavell! [19] doomed to daily cares [xxxvii]\nBy pugilistic pupils, and by bears,)\n\nFines, Tutors, tasks, Conventions threat in vain,\nBefore hounds, hunters, and Newmarket Plain.\nRough with his elders, with his equals rash,\nCivil to sharpers, prodigal of cash;\nConstant to nought\u2014save hazard and a whore, [xxxviii]\nYet cursing both\u2014for both have made him sore:\nUnread (unless since books beguile disease,\nThe P\u2014\u2014x becomes his passage to Degrees);\nFooled, pillaged, dunned, he wastes his terms away, [xxxix]\nAnd unexpelled, perhaps, retires M.A.;\n\nMaster of Arts! as hells and clubs [20] proclaim, [xl]\nWhere scarce a blackleg bears a brighter name!\nLaunched into life, extinct his early fire,\nHe apes the selfish prudence of his Sire;\nMarries for money, chooses friends for rank,\nBuys land, and shrewdly trusts not to the Bank;\nSits in the Senate; gets a son and heir;\nSends him to Harrow\u2014for himself was there.\nMute, though he votes, unless when called to cheer,\nHis son's so sharp\u2014he'll see the dog a Peer!\n\nManhood declines\u2014Age palsies every limb;\nHe quits the scene\u2014or else the scene quits him;\nScrapes wealth, o'er each departing penny grieves, [xli]\nAnd Avarice seizes all Ambition leaves;\nCounts cent per cent, and smiles, or vainly frets,\nO'er hoards diminished by young Hopeful's debts;\nWeighs well and wisely what to sell or buy,\nComplete in all life's lessons\u2014but to die;\nPeevish and spiteful, doting, hard to please,\nCommending every time, save times like these;\n\nCrazed, querulous, forsaken, half forgot,\nExpires unwept\u2014is buried\u2014Let him rot!\nBut from the Drama let me not digress,\nNor spare my precepts, though they please you less. [xlii]\nThough Woman weep, and hardest hearts are stirred, [xliii]\nWhen what is done is rather seen than heard,\nYet many deeds preserved in History's page\nAre better told than acted on the stage;\nThe ear sustains what shocks the timid eye,\nAnd Horror thus subsides to Sympathy,\n\nTrue Briton all beside, I here am French\u2014\nBloodshed 'tis surely better to retrench:\nThe gladiatorial gore we teach to flow\nIn tragic scenes disgusts though but in show;\nWe hate the carnage while we see the trick,\nAnd find small sympathy in being sick.\nNot on the stage the regicide Macbeth\nAppals an audience with a Monarch's death; [xliv]\nTo gaze when sable Hubert threats to sear\nYoung Arthur's eyes, can ours or Nature bear?\n\nA haltered heroine [21] Johnson sought to slay\u2014\nWe saved Irene, but half damned the play,\nAnd (Heaven be praised!) our tolerating times\nStint Metamorphoses to Pantomimes;\nAnd Lewis' [22] self, with all his sprites, would quake\nTo change Earl Osmond's negro to a snake!\nBecause, in scenes exciting joy or grief,\nWe loathe the action which exceeds belief:\nAnd yet, God knows! what may not authors do,\nWhose Postscripts prate of dyeing \"heroines blue\"? [23]\n\nAbove all things, Dan Poet, if you can,\nEke out your acts, I pray, with mortal man,\nNor call a ghost, unless some cursed scrape [xlv]\nMust open ten trap-doors for your escape.\nOf all the monstrous things I'd fain forbid,\nI loathe an Opera worse than Dennis did; [24]\nWhere good and evil persons, right or wrong,\nRage, love, and aught but moralise\u2014in song.\nHail, last memorial of our foreign friends, [xlvi]\nWhich Gaul allows, and still Hesperia lends!\n\nNapoleon's edicts no embargo lay\nOn whores\u2014spies\u2014singers\u2014wisely shipped away.\nOur giant Capital, whose squares are spread [xlvii]\nWhere rustics earned, and now may beg, their bread,\nIn all iniquity is grown so nice,\nIt scorns amusements which are not of price.\nHence the pert shopkeeper, whose throbbing ear\nAches with orchestras which he pays to hear, [xlviii]\nWhom shame, not sympathy, forbids to snore,\nHis anguish doubling by his own \"encore;\" [xlix]\n\nSqueezed in \"Fop's Alley,\" [25] jostled by the beaux,\nTeased with his hat, and trembling for his toes;\nScarce wrestles through the night, nor tastes of ease,\nTill the dropped curtain gives a glad release:\nWhy this, and more, he suffers\u2014can ye guess?\u2014\nBecause it costs him dear, and makes him dress! [26]\nSo prosper eunuchs from Etruscan schools;\nGive us but fiddlers, and they're sure of fools!\nEre scenes were played by many a reverend clerk, [l] [27]\n(What harm, if David danced before the ark?) [li]\n\nIn Christmas revels, simple country folks\nWere pleased with morrice-mumm'ry and coarse jokes.\nImproving years, with things no longer known,\nProduced blithe Punch and merry Madame Joan,\nWho still frisk on with feats so lewdly low, [lii]\n'Tis strange Benvolio [28] suffers such a show;\nSuppressing peer! to whom each vice gives place, [liii]\nOaths, boxing, begging\u2014all, save rout and race.\nFarce followed Comedy, and reached her prime,\nIn ever-laughing Foote's fantastic time: [29]\n\nMad wag! who pardoned none, nor spared the best,\nAnd turned some very serious things to jest.\nNor Church nor State escaped his public sneers,\nArms nor the Gown\u2014Priests\u2014Lawyers\u2014Volunteers:\n\"Alas, poor Yorick!\" now for ever mute!\nWhoever loves a laugh must sigh for Foote.\nWe smile, perforce, when histrionic scenes\nApe the swoln dialogue of Kings and Queens,\nWhen \"Crononhotonthologos must die,\" [30]\nAnd Arthur struts in mimic majesty.\n\nMoschus! with whom once more I hope to sit, [liv]\nAnd smile at folly, if we can't at wit;\nYes, Friend! for thee I'll quit my cynic cell,\nAnd bear Swift's motto, \"Vive la bagatelle!\"\nWhich charmed our days in each \u00c6gean clime,\nAs oft at home, with revelry and rhyme.\nThen may Euphrosyne, who sped the past,\nSoothe thy Life's scenes, nor leave thee in the last;\nBut find in thine\u2014like pagan Plato's bed, [lv] [31]\nSome merry Manuscript of Mimes, when dead.\n\nNow to the Drama let us bend our eyes,\nWhere fettered by whig Walpole low she lies; [32]\nCorruption foiled her, for she feared her glance;\nDecorum left her for an Opera dance!\nYet Chesterfield, [33] whose polished pen inveighs\n'Gainst laughter, fought for freedom to our Plays;\nUnchecked by Megrims of patrician brains,\nAnd damning Dulness of Lord Chamberlains.\nRepeal that act! again let Humour roam\nWild o'er the stage\u2014we've time for tears at home;\n\nLet Archer [34] plant the horns on Sullen's brows,\nAnd Estifania gull her \"Copper\" [35] spouse;\nThe moral's scant\u2014but that may be excused,\nMen go not to be lectured, but amused.\nHe whom our plays dispose to Good or Ill\nMust wear a head in want of Willis' skill; [36]\nAye, but Macheath's example\u2014psha!\u2014no more!\nIt formed no thieves\u2014the thief was formed before; [37]\nAnd spite of puritans and Collier's curse, [lvi]\nPlays make mankind no better, and no worse. [38]\n\nThen spare our stage, ye methodistic men!\nNor burn damned Drury if it rise again. [39]\nBut why to brain-scorched bigots thus appeal?\nCan heavenly Mercy dwell with earthly Zeal?\nFor times of fire and faggot let them hope!\nTimes dear alike to puritan or Pope.\nAs pious Calvin saw Servetus blaze,\nSo would new sects on newer victims gaze.\nE'en now the songs of Solyma begin;\nFaith cants, perplexed apologist of Sin!\n\nWhile the Lord's servant chastens whom he loves,\nAnd Simeon kicks, [40] where Baxter only \"shoves.\"[41]\nWhom Nature guides, so writes, that every dunce [lvii],\nEnraptured, thinks to do the same at once;\nBut after inky thumbs and bitten nails [lviii],\nAnd twenty scattered quires, the coxcomb fails.\nLet Pastoral be dumb; for who can hope\nTo match the youthful eclogues of our Pope?\nYet his and Philips' [42] faults, of different kind,\nFor Art too rude, for Nature too refined, [lix]\n\nInstruct how hard the medium 'tis to hit\n'Twixt too much polish and too coarse a wit.\nA vulgar scribbler, certes, stands disgraced\nIn this nice age, when all aspire to taste;\nThe dirty language, and the noisome jest,\nWhich pleased in Swift of yore, we now detest;\nProscribed not only in the world polite [lx],\nBut even too nasty for a City Knight!\nPeace to Swift's faults! his wit hath made them pass,\nUnmatched by all, save matchless Hudibras!\n\nWhose author is perhaps the first we meet,\nWho from our couplet lopped two final feet;\nNor less in merit than the longer line,\nThis measure moves a favourite of the Nine.\nThough at first view eight feet may seem in vain\nFormed, save in Ode, to bear a serious strain [lxi],\nYet Scott has shown our wondering isle of late\nThis measure shrinks not from a theme of weight,\nAnd, varied skilfully, surpasses far\nHeroic rhyme, but most in Love and War,\n\nWhose fluctuations, tender or sublime,\nAre curbed too much by long-recurring rhyme.\nBut many a skilful judge abhors to see,\nWhat few admire\u2014irregularity.\nThis some vouchsafe to pardon; but 'tis hard\nWhen such a word contents a British Bard.\nAnd must the Bard his glowing thoughts confine, [lxii]\nLest Censure hover o'er some faulty line?\nRemove whate'er a critic may suspect,\nTo gain the paltry suffrage of \"Correct\"?\n\nOr prune the spirit of each daring phrase,\nTo fly from Error, not to merit Praise?\nYe, who seek finished models, never cease [lxiii],\nBy day and night, to read the works of Greece.\nBut our good Fathers never bent their brains\nTo heathen Greek, content with native strains.\nThe few who read a page, or used a pen,\nWere satisfied with Chaucer and old Ben;\nThe jokes and numbers suited to their taste\nWere quaint and careless, anything but chaste;\n\nYet, whether right or wrong the ancient rules,\nIt will not do to call our Fathers fools!\nThough you and I, who eruditely know\nTo separate the elegant and low,\nCan also, when a hobbling line appears,\nDetect with fingers\u2014in default of ears.\nIn sooth I do not know, or greatly care\nTo learn, who our first English strollers were;\nOr if, till roofs received the vagrant art,\nOur Muse, like that of Thespis, kept a cart;\n\nBut this is certain, since our Shakespeare's days,\nThere's pomp enough\u2014if little else\u2014in plays;\nNor will Melpomene ascend her Throne [lxiv]\nWithout high heels, white plume, and Bristol stone.\nOld Comedies still meet with much applause,\nThough too licentious for dramatic laws;\nAt least, we moderns, wisely, 'tis confest,\nCurtail, or silence, the lascivious jest [lxv].\nWhate'er their follies, and their faults beside,\nOur enterprising Bards pass nought untried;\n\nNor do they merit slight applause who choose\nAn English subject for an English Muse,\nAnd leave to minds which never dare invent\nFrench flippancy and German sentiment.\nWhere is that living language which could claim\nPoetic more, as philosophic, fame,\nIf all our Bards, more patient of delay,\nWould stop, like Pope, to polish by the way? [43]\nLords of the quill, whose critical assaults\nO'erthrow whole quartos with their quires of faults [lxvi],\n\nWho soon detect, and mark where'er we fail,\nAnd prove our marble with too nice a nail!\nDemocritus himself was not so bad;\nHe only 'thought'\u2014but 'you' would make us\u2014mad!\nBut truth to say, most rhymers rarely guard\nAgainst that ridicule they deem so hard;\nIn person negligent, they wear, from sloth,\nBeards of a week, and nails of annual growth;\nReside in garrets, fly from those they meet,\nAnd walk in alleys rather than the street. 470\nWith little rhyme, less reason, if you please,\nThe name of Poet may be got with ease,\nSo that not tuns of helleboric juice [lxvii]\nShall ever turn your head to any use;\nWrite but like Wordsworth\u2014live beside a lake,\nAnd keep your bushy locks a year from Blake; [44]\nThen print your book, once more return to town,\nAnd boys shall hunt your Bardship up and down. [45]\nAm I not wise, if such some poets' plight,\nTo purge in spring\u2014like Bayes [46]\u2014before I write?\n\nIf this precaution softened not my bile,\nI know no scribbler with a madder style;\nBut since (perhaps my feelings are too nice)\nI cannot purchase Fame at such a price,\nI'll labour gratis as a grinders' wheel, [lxviii]\nAnd, blunt myself, give edge to other's steel,\nNor write at all, unless to teach the art\nTo those rehearsing for the Poet's part;\nFrom Horace show the pleasing paths of song, [lxix],\nAnd from my own example\u2014what is wrong.\n\nThough modern practice sometimes differs quite,\n'Tis just as well to think before you write;\nLet every book that suits your theme be read,\nSo shall you trace it to the fountain-head.\nHe who has learned the duty which he owes\nTo friends and country, and to pardon foes;\nWho models his deportment as may best\nAccord with Brother, Sire, or Stranger-guest;\nWho takes our Laws and Worship as they are,\nNor roars reform for Senate, Church, and Bar;\n\nIn practice, rather than loud precept, wise,\nBids not his tongue, but heart, philosophize:\nSuch is the man the Poet should rehearse,\nAs joint exemplar of his life and verse.\nSometimes a sprightly wit, and tale well told,\nWithout much grace, or weight, or art, will hold\nA longer empire o'er the public mind\nThan sounding trifles, empty, though refined.\nUnhappy Greece! thy sons of ancient days\nThe Muse may celebrate with perfect praise,\n\nWhose generous children narrowed not their hearts\nWith Commerce, given alone to Arms and Arts. [lxx]\nOur boys (save those whom public schools compel\nTo \"Long and Short\" before they're taught to spell)\nFrom frugal fathers soon imbibe by rote,\n\"A penny saved, my lad, 's a penny got.\"\nBabe of a city birth! from sixpence take [lxxi]\nThe third, how much will the remainder make?\u2014\n\"A groat.\"\u2014\"Ah, bravo! Dick hath done the sum!

Dacier, Mons. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Boileau, and others, have left their dispute on the meaning of this sentence in a tract considerably longer than the poem of Horace. It is printed at the close of the eleventh volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9's Letters, edited by Grouvelle, Paris, 1806. Presuming that all who can construe may venture an opinion on such subjects, particularly as so many who can't have taken the same liberty, I should have held \"my farthing candle\" as awkwardly as another, had not my respect for the wits of Louis 14th's Augustan \"Si\u00e8cle\" induced me to subjoin these illustrious authorities. I therefore offer:\n\nfirstly Boileau: \"Il est difficile de trailer des sujets qui sont \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de tout le monde d'une maniere qui vous les rende propres, ce qui s'appelle s'approprier un sujet par le tour qu'on y donne.\"\n\n2dly, Batteux: \"Mais il est bien difficile de donner des traits propres et individuels aux etres purement possibles.\"\n\n3dly, Dacier: \"Il est difficile de traiter convenablement ces caract\u00e8res que tout le monde peut inventer.\"\n\nMr. S\u00e9vign\u00e9's opinion and translation, consisting of some thirty pages, I omit, particularly as Mr. Grouvelle observes, \"La chose est bien remarquable, aucune de ces diverses interpretations ne parait \u00eatre la veritable.\" But, by way of comfort, it seems, fifty years afterwards, \"Le lumineux Dumarsais\" made his appearance, to set Horace on his legs again, \"dissiper tous les nuages, et concilier tous les dissentiments;\" and I suppose some fifty years hence, somebody, still more luminous, will doubtless start up and demolish Dumarsais and his system on this weighty affair, as if he were no better than Ptolemy or Copernicus and comments of no more consequence than astronomical calculations. I am happy to say, \"la longueur de la dissertation\" of Mr. D. prevents Mr. G. from saying any more on the matter. A better poet than Boileau, and at least as good a scholar as Mr. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, has said,\n\n\"A little learning is a dangerous thing.\"\n\nAnd by the above extract, it appears that a good deal may be rendered as useless to the Proprietors.\n\n[Byron chose the words in question, Difficile,' etc., as a motto for the first five cantos of 'Don Juan']\n\n[Footnote 16: About two years ago a young man named Townsend was announced by Mr. Cumberland, in a review (since deceased) [the 'London Review'], as being engaged in an epic poem to be entitled \"Armageddon.\" The plan and specimen promise much; but I hope neither to offend Mr. Townsend, nor his friends, by recommending to his attention the lines of Horace to which these rhymes allude. If Mr. Townsend succeeds in his undertaking, as there is reason to hope, how much will the world be indebted to Mr. Cumberland for bringing him before the public! But, till that eventful day arrives, it may be doubted whether the premature display of his plan (sublime as the ideas confessedly are) has not,\u2014by raising expectation too high, or diminishing curiosity, by developing his argument,\u2014rather incurred the hazard of injuring Mr. Townsend's future prospects. Mr. Cumberland (whose talents I shall not depreciate by the humble tribute of my praise) and Mr. Townsend must not suppose me actuated by unworthy motives in this suggestion. I wish the author all the success he can wish himself, and shall be truly happy to see epic poetry weighed up from the bathos where it lies sunken with Southey, Cottle, Cowley (Mrs. or Abraham), Ogilvy, Wilkie, Pye, and all the \"dull of past and present days.\" Even if he is not a 'Milton', he may be better than 'Blackmore'; if not a 'Homer', an 'Antimachus'. I should deem myself presumptuous, as a young man, in offering advice, were it not addressed to one still younger. Mr. Townsend has the greatest difficulties to encounter; but in conquering them he will find employment; in having conquered them, his reward.

I refer them to their own pages, where they congratulated themselves on the prospect of a tilt between Mr. Jeffrey and myself, from which some great good was to accrue, provided one or both were knocked on the head. Having survived two years and a half those \"Elegies\" which they were kindly preparing to review, I have no peculiar gusto to give them \"so joyful a trouble,\" except, indeed, \"upon compulsion, Hal;\" but if, as David says in 'The Rivals', it should come to \"bloody sword and gun fighting,\" we \"won't run, will we, Sir Lucius?\" [Byron, writing at Athens, away from his books, misquotes 'The Rivals'.

Had any other set of men expressed such sentiments, I should have smiled, and left them to the \"recording angel;\" but from the pharisees of Christianity decency might be expected. I can assure these brethren, that, publican and sinner as I am, I would not have treated \"mine enemy's dog thus.\" To show them the superiority of my brotherly love, if ever the Reverend Messrs.

A literary friend of mine, walking out one lovely evening last summer, on the eleventh bridge of the Paddington canal, was alarmed by the cry of \"one in jeopardy:\" he rushed along, collected a body of Irish haymakers (supping on butter-milk in an adjacent paddock), procured three rakes, one eel-spear and a landing net, and at last ('horresco referens') pulled out\u2014his own publisher. The unfortunate man was gone for ever, and so was a large quarto wherewith he had taken the leap, which proved, on inquiry, to have been Mr. Southey's last work. Its \"alacrity of sinking\" was so great, that it has never since been heard of; though some maintain that it is at this moment concealed at Alderman Birch's pastry premises, Cornhill. Be this as it may, the coroner's inquest brought in a verdict of \"'Felo de bibliopol\u00e2'\" against a \"quarto unknown;\" and circumstantial evidence being since strong against 'The Curse of Kehama' (of which the above words are an exact description), it will be tried by its peers next session, in Grub-street\u2014Arthur, Alfred, Davideis, Richard Coeur de Lion, Exodus, Exodiad, Epigoniad, Calvary, Fall of Cambria, Siege of Acre, Don Roderick, and Tom Thumb the Great, are the names of the twelve jurors.

By the bye, it is a good deal beneath Scott and Campbell, and not much above Southey, to allow the booby Ballantyne to entitle them, in the 'Edinburgh Annual Register' (of which, by the bye, Southey is editor) \"the grand poetical triumvirate of the day.\" But, on second thoughts, it can be no great degree of praise to be the one-eyed leaders of the blind, though they might as well keep to themselves \"Scott's thirty thousand copies sold,\" which must sadly discomfort poor Southey's unsaleables. Poor Southey, it should seem, is the \"Lepidus\" of this poetical triumvirate.

Jeffrey was counsel for the pursuer, who sought to recover a sum of \u00a35000 lent under a bond. For the defence it was alleged that the money had been entrusted for a particular purpose, namely, the maintenance of an infant. Jeffrey denied the existence of any such claim, and maintained that whatever was scandalous or calumnious in the defence was absolutely untrue. The case, which was not included in the Scottish Law Reports, was probably settled out of court. Evidently the judge held that on technical grounds an action did not lie.

At last it was decided by Jeffrey, that it meant nothing more\nnor less than the \"counter of Archy Constable's shop.\"]\n[Footnote 62: Voltaire's 'Pucelle' is not quite so immaculate as Mr. Southey's 'Joan of Arc', and yet I am afraid the Frenchman has both more truth and poetry too on his side\u2014(they rarely go together)\u2014than our patriotic minstrel, whose first essay was in praise of a fanatical French strumpet, whose title of witch would be correct with the change of the first letter.]\n\n[Footnote 63: Like Sir Bland Burges's 'Richard'; the tenth book of which I read at Malta, on a trunk of Eyre's, 19, Cockspur-street. If this be doubted, I shall buy a portmanteau to quote from.\n\n[Sir James Bland Burges (1752-1824), who assumed, in 1821, the name of Lamb, married, as his first wife, the Hon. Elizabeth Noel, daughter of Lord Wentworth, and younger sister of Byron's mother-in-law, Lady Milbanke. He was called to the bar in 1777, and in the same year was appointed a Commissioner in Bankruptcy. In 1787 he was returned M.P. for the borough of Helleston; and from 1789 to 1795 held office as Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. In 1795, at the instance of his chief, Lord Grenville, he vacated his post, and by way of compensation was created a baronet with a sinecure post as Knight-Marshal of the Royal Household. Thenceforth he devoted himself to literature. In 1796 he wrote the 'Birth and Triumph of Love', by way of letter-press to some elegant designs of the Princess Elizabeth. (For 'Richard the First' and the 'Exodiad', see note, p. 436.) His plays, 'Riches and Tricks for Travellers', appeared in 1810, and there were other works. In spite of Wordsworth's testimony (Wordsworth signed, but Coleridge dictated and no doubt composed, the letter: see 'Thomas Poole and His Friends', ii. 27) \"to a pure and unmixed vein of native English\" in 'Richard the First (Bland-Burges Papers', 1885, p. 308), Burges as a poet awaits rediscovery. His diaries, portions of which were published in 1885, are lively and instructive. He has been immortalized in Person's Macaronics\u2014\n\n\"Poetis nos l\u00e6tamur tribus,\nPye, Petro Pindar, parvo Pybus.\nSi ulterius ire pergis,\nAdde his Sir James Bland Burges!\"]\n\n[Footnote 64: [Charles Lamb, in \"Christ's Hospital Five and Thirty Years\nAgo\" (Prose Works, 1836, ii. 30), records his repeated visits, as a\nBlue Coat boy, \"to the Lions in the Tower\u2014to whose lev\u00e9e, by courtesy\nimmemorial, we had a prescriptive title to admission.\"]\n[Footnote 65: Lines 677, 678 are not in 'MS. L. (a)'.]\n\n[Footnote 66: Lines 689-696 are not in 'MS. L. (a)' or 'MS. L. (b)'.]\n\n[Footnote 67: 'MS. L.' ('a' and 'b') continue at line 758.]\n\n[Footnote 68:\n\n\"Tum quoque marmorea caput a cervice revulsum,\nGurgite cum medio portans OEagrius Hebrus,\nVolveret Eurydicen vox ipsa, et frigida lingua;\nAh, miseram Eurydicen! anim\u00e2 fugiente vocabat;\nEurydicen toto referebant flumine rip\u00e6.\"\n'Georgic', iv. 523-527.]\n\n[Footnote 69: I beg Nathaniel's pardon: he is not a cobbler; 'it' is a 'tailor', but begged Capel Lofft to sink the profession in his preface to two pair of panta\u2014psha!\u2014of cantos, which he wished the public to try on; but the sieve of a patron let it out, and so far saved the expense of an advertisement to his country customers\u2014Merry's \"Moorfields whine\" was nothing to all this. The \"Delia Cruscans\" were people of some education, and no profession; but these Arcadians (\"Arcades ambo\"\u2014bumpkins both) send out their native nonsense without the smallest alloy, and leave all the shoes and small-clothes in the parish unrepaired, to patch up Elegies on Enclosures, and P\u00e6ans to Gunpowder. Sitting on a shop-board, they describe the fields of battle, when the only blood they ever saw was shed from the finger; and an \"Essay on War\" is produced by the ninth part of a \"poet;\"\n\n\"And own that 'nine' such poets made a Tate.\"\n\nDid Nathan ever read that line of Pope? and if he did, why not take it as his motto?\n\n['An Essay on War; Honington Green, a Ballad \u2026 an Elegy and other\nPoems,' was published in 1803.]]\n[Footnote 70: This well-meaning gentleman has spoiled some excellent shoemakers, and been accessory to the poetical undoing of many of the industrious poor. Nathaniel Bloomfield and his brother Bobby have set all Somersetshire singing; nor has the malady confined itself to one county. Pratt too (who once was wiser) has caught the contagion of patronage, and decoyed a poor fellow named Blackett into poetry; but he died during the operation, leaving one child and two volumes of \"Remains\" utterly destitute. The girl, if she don't take a poetical twist, and come forth as a shoemaking Sappho, may do well; but the \"tragedies\" are as ricketty as if they had been the offspring of an Earl or a Seatonian prize poet. The patrons of this poor lad are certainly answerable for his end; and it ought to be an indictable offence. But this is the least they have done: for, by a refinement of barbarity, they have made the (late) man posthumously ridiculous, by printing what he would have had sense enough never to print himself. Certes these rakers of \"Remains\" come under the statute against \"resurrection men.\" What does it signify whether a poor dear dead dunce is to be stuck up in Surgeons' or in Stationers' Hall? Is it so bad to unearth his bones as his blunders? Is it not better to gibbet his body on a heath, than his soul in an octavo? \"We know what we are, but we know not what we may be;\" and it is to be hoped we never shall know, if a man who has passed through life with a sort of \u00e9clat is to find himself a mountebank on the other side of Styx, and made, like poor Joe Blackett, the laughing-stock of purgatory. The plea of publication is to provide for the child; now, might not some of this 'Sutor ultra Crepidaitis' friends and seducers have done a decent action without inveigling Pratt into biography? And then his inscription split into so many modicums!\u2014\"To the Duchess of Somuch, the Right Hon. So-and-So, and Mrs. and Miss Somebody, these volumes are,\" etc. etc.\u2014why, this is doling out the \"soft milk of dedication\" in gills,\u2014there is but a quart, and he divides it among a dozen. Why, Pratt, hadst thou not a puff left? Dost thou think six families of distinction can share this in quiet? There is a child, a book, and a dedication: send the girl to her grace, the volumes to the grocer, and the dedication to the devil.\n\n[For Robert Bloomfield, see 'English Bards', ll. 774-786, and note 2.\nFor Joseph Blacket, see 'English Bards', ll. 765-770, and note 1.\nBlacket's 'Remains', with Life by Pratt, appeared in 1811. The work was\ndedicated \"To Her Grace the Duchess of Leeds, Lady Milbanke and Family,\nBenevolent Patrons of the Author,\" etc.]]\n[Footnote 71: Lines 737-758 are not in either of the three original MSS. of 'Hints from Horace', and were probably written in the autumn of 1811. They appear among a sheet of \"alterations to 'English Bards, and S. Reviewers', continued with additions\" ('MSS. L.'}, drawn up for the fifth edition, and they are inserted on a separate sheet in 'MS. M.' A second sheet ('MSS. L.') of \"scraps of rhyme \u2026 principally additions and corrections for 'English Bards', etc.\" (for the fifth edition), some of which are dated 1810, does not give the whole passage, but includes the following variants (erased) of lines 753-756:\u2014\n\n(i.)\n\n\"Then let thy ponderous quarto steep and stink,\nThe dullest fattest weed on Lethe's brink.\nDown with that volume to the depths of hell!\nOblivion seems rewarding it too well.\"\n(ii.)\n\n\"Yet then thy quarto still may,\" etc.\n\nA \"Druid\" (see 'English Bards', line 741) was Byron's name for a scribbler who wrote for his living. In 'MS. M.', \"scribbler\" has been erased, and \"Druid\" substituted. It is doubtful to whom the passage, in its final shape, was intended to apply, but it is possible that the erased lines, in which \"ponderous quarto\" stands for \"lost songs,\" were aimed at Southey (see 'ante', line 657, 'note' 1).]\n\n[Footnote 72: 'MS. L. (a)' recommences at line 758.]\n\n[Footnote 73: Here will Mr. Gifford allow me to introduce once more to his notice the sole survivor, the \"ultimus Romanorum,\" the last of the Cruscanti\u2014\"Edwin\" the \"profound\" by our Lady of Punishment! here he is, as lively as in the days of \"well said Baviad the Correct.\" I thought Fitzgerald had been the tail of poesy; but, alas! he is only the penultimate.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/347228", "artist_names": "Bill Withers", "full_title": "Use Me by\u00a0Bill\u00a0Withers",

Neanderthal... troglodytes. Let's take the average\nCave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up\nTry to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this:\n\"Dance... dance\". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look\nIn the mirror: \"Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a\nWoman gotta find a woman\". He'd go down to the lake where all the\nWoman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look\nAround and just reach in and grab one. \"Come here... come here\"\nHe'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause\nIt might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd\nBe swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there\nWet and frightened. He said: \"Move... move\". She got up. She was a\nBig woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one\nOf the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said:\n\"Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me\nSock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!\". She looked down on him\nShe was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said\n(Falsetto):\n\"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\". He said: \"Wha?\". She said (falsetto):\n\"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\". You know what he said? He started it way\nBack then. I wouldn't lie to you. When she said (falsetto)\n\"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\" he said \"Right on! Right on! Hotpants!\nHotpants! Ugh... ugh... ugh\"You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/793275", "artist_names": "Al Green", "full_title": "Look What You Done for Me

maybe someday\nYou'll be back\n(You\u2019ll be back)\nIn my arms once again\n(You\u2019ll be back in my arms once again)\n\n[Verse 3:]\nSomeone help me\nHelp me\nHelp me please\nIs the answer up

Lyrics[Intro]\nYou are a child of the universe\nNo less than the trees and the stars\nYou have a right...\n\nDesiderata, desiderata, desiderata\n\n[Verse 1]\nGo placidly amid the noise and haste\nAnd remember what peace there may be in silence\nAs far as possible without surrender\nBe on good terms with all persons\nSpeak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others -\nEven the dull and ignorant, they too have their story\nAvoid loud and aggressive persons - they are vexations to the spirit\nIf you compare yourself with others\nYou may become vain and bitter\nFor always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself\n[Chorus]\nYou are a child of the universe\nNo less than the trees and the stars\nYou have a right to be here\nAnd whether or not it is clear to you\nNo doubt the universe is unfolding as it should\n\n[Verse 2]\nEnjoy your achievements as well as your plans\nKeep interested in your own career -\nHowever humble, it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time\nExercise caution in your business affairs\nFor the world is full of trickery\nBut let this not blind you to what virtue there is\nMany persons strive for high ideals\nAnd everywhere life is full of heroism\nBe yourself!\nEspecially do not feign affection, neither be cynical about love\nFor in the face of all aridity and disenchantment\nIt is as perennial as the grass\nTake kindly the counsel of the years\nGracefully surrendering the things of youth\nNurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune\nBut do not distress yourself with imaginings -\nMany fears are borne of fatigue and loneliness\nBeyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou are a child of the universe (You are a child of the universe)\nNo less than the trees and the stars (No less than the trees and the stars)\nYou have a right to be here (You have a right to be here)\nAnd whether or not it is clear to you (And whether or not it is clear to you)\nNo doubt the universe is unfolding as it should (No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should)\n\n[Verse 3]\nTherefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him to be\nAnd whatever your labors and aspirations\nIn the noisy confusion of life\nKeep peace with your soul\nWith all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams\nIt is still a beautiful world\nBe careful. Strive to be happy\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are a child of the universe\nNo less than the trees and the stars\nYou have a right to be here\n\nYou are a child of the universe\nNo less than the trees and the stars\nYou have a right to be here\n\nYou are a child of the universe\nNo less than the trees and the stars\nYou have a right to be here\nYou are a child of the universe\nNo less than the trees and the stars\nYou have a right to be here\n\nYou are a child of the universe\nNo less than the trees and the stars\nYou have a right to be here1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/6998154", "artist_names": "Genius", "full_title": "February 2022 Singles Release Calendar by\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "id": 6998154, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8723889, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1657260777, "path": "/Genius-february-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-february-2022-singles-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 2, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "February 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 32425}, "title": "February 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "February 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1657260777, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-february-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/204611", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/822a5f872a1fcfe377695dc0046c6bc6.900x176x1.jpg", "id": 204611, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0ca83e3130e1303a7f78ba351e3091cd.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Genius", "slug": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius", "iq": 77868}, "artist": "Genius", "lyrics": "February 2022 Singles Release Calendar LyricsAttention: Please DO NOT edit this page on the NEW song page2/1\nArlo Parks - \"Softly\"\nBIG30 - \"Protest\"\nDEKKO - \"Kelede\"\nDuwap Kaine - \"Free the Innocent\"\nJim-E Stack - \"Next To Me\" ft.

it, Clayton taught me how to drink booze\nI can see him half-stoned picking up the Lovesick Blues\nWhen Clayton died I made him a promise\nI was gonna carry on somehow\nI'd give a hundred dollars if

clear\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut early this morning when I opened my eyes\nThat old lonesome feelin' took me by surprise\nI guess you meant more than I realized\n[Chorus]\nThe love we had stays on my mind (The love we had)\nThe love we had stays on my mind (Stays on my mind)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd pretty girl, I've been rememberin'\nThe good times that we used to share\nMy thoughts of you don't have an ending\nAnd memories of you are everywhere\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut why should I tell you? It's not your concern\nYou win some, you lose some, I've lost and I've learned\nIt's just that I'm so lonely with no place to turn\nAnd here at the end I'll find\n\n[Chorus]\nThe love we had stays on my mind\n\n[Bridge]\nGirl, if you were nearer, if you had a mirror\nMaybe you could count my tears\nAnd if you were nearer, it would all be clearer\nHow I wish that you were here\nHow I wish that you were here\n(How I wish that you were here)\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nAnd baby girl, I was tired\nSo I lay down to dream a while\nAnd lately I've been so uninspired\nWithout the comfort of your smile\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I'm not complaining 'cause that's how it goes\nThere's always some heartaches in this world I suppose\nBut you can't imagine, nobody knows\nThe love\n\n[Chorus]\nThe love we had stays on my mind\n(Stays on my mind, stays on my mind)\nThe love we had stays on my mind\n(I never will forget you, baby)\nThe love we had stays on my mind\n(Why?

It is towards sunset.]\n[PEER GYNT, a handsome middle-aged gentleman, in an elegant\ntravelling-dress, with a gold-rimmed double eyeglass hanging at his\nwaistcoat, is doing the honours at the head of the table.

That language is so stiff.-\n:But the phenomenon's final cause\n:if we would seek-\nPEER\n:It's found already.\n:The reason is that I'm unmarried.\n:Yes, gentlemen, completely clear\n:the matter is.

COTTON\n:Ay, that is practical!\nPEER [lights a cigar].\n:Dear friends,\n:just think of my career in general.\n:In what case came I to the West?\n:A poor young fellow, empty-handed.\n:I had to battle sore for bread;\n:trust me, I often found it hard.\n:But life, my friends, ah, life is dear,\n:and, as the phrase goes, death is bitter.\n:Well! Luck, you see, was kind to me;\n:old Fate, too, was accommodating.\n:I prospered; and, by versatility,\n:I prospered better still and better.\n:In ten years' time I bore the name\n:of Croesus 'mongst the Charleston shippers.\n:My fame flew wide from port to port,\n:and fortune sailed on board my vessels-\nMR.

To stop the trade\n:with China was impossible.\n:A plan I hit on-opened straightway\n:a new trade with the self-same land.\n:I shipped off idols every spring,\n:each autumn sent forth missionaries,\n:supplying them with all they needed,\n:as stockings, Bibles, rum, and rice-\nMR. COTTON\n:Yes, at a profit?\nPEER\n:Why, of course.\n:It prospered. Dauntlessly they toiled.\n:For every idol that was sold\n:they got a coolie well baptised,\n:so that the effect was neutralised.\n:The mission-field lay never fallow,\n:for still the idol-propaganda\n:the missionaries held in check.\nMR. COTTON\n:Well, but the African commodities?\nPEER\n:There, too, my ethics won the day.\n:I saw the traffic was a wrong one\n:for people of a certain age.\n:One may drop off before one dreams of it.\n:And then there were the thousand pitfalls\n:laid by the philanthropic camp;\n:besides, of course, the hostile cruisers,\n:and all the wind-and-weather risks.\n:All this together won the day.\n:I thought: Now, Peter, reef your sails;\n:see to it you amend your faults!\n:So in the South I bought some land,\n:and kept the last meat-importation,\n:which chanced to be a superfine one.\n:They throve so, grew so fat and sleek,\n:that 'twas a joy to me, and them too.\n:Yes, without boasting, I may say\n:I acted as a father to them,-\n:and found my profit in so doing.\n:I built them schools, too, so that virtue\n:might uniformly be maintained at\n:a certain general niveau,\n:and kept strict watch that never its\n:thermometer should sink below it.\n:Now, furthermore, from all this business\n:I've beat a definite retreat;-\n:I've sold the whole plantation, and\n:its tale of live-stock, hide and hair.\n:At parting, too, I served around,\n:to big and little, gratis grog,\n:so men and women all got drunk,\n:and widows got their snuff as well.\n:So that is why I trust,-provided\n:the saying is not idle breath:\n:Whoso does not do ill, does good,-\n:my former errors are forgotten,\n:and I, much more than most, can hold\n:my misdeeds balanced by my virtues.\nVON EBERKOPF [clinking glasses with him].\n:How strengthening it is to hear\n:a principle thus acted out,\n:freed from the night of theory,\n:unshaken by the outward ferment!\nPEER [who has been drinking freely during the preceding passages]\n:We Northland men know how to carry\n:our battle through! The key to the art\n:of life's affairs is simply this:\n:to keep one's ear close shut against\n:the ingress of one dangerous viper.\nMR.
