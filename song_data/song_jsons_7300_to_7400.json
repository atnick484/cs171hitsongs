give love?\n\n[Outro: David Bowie]\nBecause love's such an old-fashioned word\nAnd love dares you to care for\nThe people on the (People on streets) edge of the night\nAnd love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of\nCaring about ourselves\nThis is our last dance\nThis is our last dance\nThis is ourselves under pressure\nUnder pressure\nUnder pressure\nPressure77Embed"}, {"_type":

I know I can be so selfish\nI could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless\nBut she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do\nAnd though it don't always show, I love her just like I love you, and\nI need to treat you better\nWish you could live forever\nSo we could spend more time together\nI love you mama\n\n[Chorus]\nI keep my head high\nI got my wings to carry me\nI don't know freedom\nI want my dreams to rescue me\nI keep my faith strong\nI ask the Lord to follow me\nI've been unfaithful\nI don't know why you call on me\nYou might also

ho\nAnother day, another time zone\nToday, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right, I got two bitches playing on my trombone\nKeep up, never sure where the words would take me\nNiggas eat em up and regurgitate me\nShit trump tight never slurred it lazy\nGive a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please\nBest friends really make great for enemies\nMy watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these\nI see you, nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's an AP, nigga\nI'm hot, dog, catch up to me, nigga\u2014 huh, couldn't resist\nAim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed\nBut I was riding on fumes, so I stopped by the moon\nNow I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch\nLike, \"Thanks for the view,\" waiting on thanks from a few\n'Cause without me you wouldn't exist\nYou know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget\nCole is your phone on zero percent\nGoing off, now niggas showing off\nNiggas swear they hard, but they flowing soft\nI'm taking off like \"boing!\" on a big ass Boeing, and getting head like a coin toss, too easy\n[Chorus]\nI keep my head high\nI got my wings to carry me\nI don't know freedom\nI want my dreams to rescue me\nI keep my faith strong\nI ask the

strangers and the noise\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd why leave when I got you, baby?\nIt's a risk, but babe, I need the thrill\nI never said you'd be easy\nBut if it was all up to me\nI\u2019d be no

on papers\nWe walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers\nLame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us\nGot different hoes, I'm pimpin' hoes, you could tell by my paystubs\nMy

friends\nNigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in\nMiddle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex\nYou know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest\nYou don't really want that Glock boy\nYou don't really wanna feel them shots boy\nYou a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy\nSix shots got me feelin' like 'Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop,

that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nDo to you\nBad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you\nI might have to take your number when I'm through with you\nAll I ask of you is try to earn my memory\nMake me remember you like you remember me\nBad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you\nI might have to take your number when I'm through with you\nAll I ask of you is try to earn my memory\nMake me remember you like you remember me\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh\nUsed to you\nThrough with you\nAll I ask of you is try to earn my memory\nMake me remember you like you remember me\nUsed to you\nThrough with you\nMemory, remember you105Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/89531", "artist_names": "One Direction", "full_title": "Live

Lyrics[Intro Poem: Wale]\nDiced pineapple\nTonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you\nThe highest form of my admiration\nI ain't no connoisseur but I'm, kinda sure you will admire my taste\nAnd before the sun graze ya, I'm tryin to see how deep you are\nAnd believe me shorty I ain't talking 'bout no intimate conversation\nI wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable\nWhen I peek into your nature\nAnd I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure\nI wanna, give you what's better than better\nThe better my effort, the wetter her treasure\nThe more these mere moments seem like heavens or, temporary forevers\nShorty get it together, hah, diced pineapple\nMay your love come down so my mind might have you\nYou designed my imagination\nLet me redefine foreplay 'til you need five and\nTell me shorty you got it baby\nIf it's not it baby, hope it's progress baby\nLet it all drip baby\nIf you stop that shaking, no more talking baby\nNo more talking baby\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross]\nShorty so fine, pussy so fresh\nDiced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best\nI nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test\nSwept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex\nPaid it off cash so I never wrote a check\nLeave my cars at her crib, I'm just stuntin' on her ex\nPussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess\nI love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh (ugh)\nSex all night, couple shots of C\u00ceROC\nCrib on the water, got LeBron up the block\nMoney ain't the thing, baby, welcome to the mob\nDiced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar\nBitch so bad got me wishing I could sing\nHer uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team\nDouble MG, them other niggas fell off\nBaby girl, I just wanna see you well off\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nCall me crazy, shit at least you\u2019re calling\nFeels better when you let it out, don't it girl?\nKnow it's easy to get caught up in the moment\nWhen you say it cause you mad then you take it all back\nThen we fuck all night 'til things get right\nThen we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nShorty so fine, pussy so fresh\nDiced pineapples, I just bought my girl a set\nI know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set\nShe know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex\nPop bottles, make love, Thug Passion\nRed bottoms, Moncler, high fashion\nBelt buckles, door handles, gold plated\nBalmain, rich denim, out in Vegas\nFrench Riviera, baby girl lets take a trip\nI'ma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick\nBaby listen, this position is a blessing\nAnd with your permission, hopefully you'll learn a lesson (ugh)\nI'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk\nShe so fine she ain't even gotta talk\nDiced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar\nShe never wrote a song but I know that she's a star\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nCall me crazy, shit at least you\u2019re calling\nFeels better when you let it out, don't it girl?\nKnow it's easy to get caught up in the moment\nWhen you say it cause you mad then you take it all back\nThen we fuck all night 'til things get right\nThen we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah\n[Verse 3: Wale]\nSomething about her, probably can't live without her\nRoll up some sour, let me kiss on her fountain\nMission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate\nAnd I won't ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain\nEager to show you, thinking that I should know you\nAnd you eager to work perfect, I can employ you\nDesigner shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil\nTo get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia\nHol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur\nRushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off\nHate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull\nLike to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved\nHow sweet is you? (sweet is you?) Let me see some proof\nFuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune\nAll we need is we, we don\u2019t need no room\nRight now I\u2019m trying to eat, and we don\u2019t need a spoon\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nCall me crazy, shit at least you\u2019re calling\nFeels better when you let it out, don't it girl?\nKnow it's easy to get caught up in the moment\nWhen you say it cause you mad then you take it all back\nThen we fuck all night 'til things get right\nThen we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah65Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

fold-up easy chair\nOn a quiet shady river bank\nLet the world go on without me\nWouldn't have it any other way\nCause I ain't in no hurry today\n[Chorus]\nAin't in no hurry\nI'd be a fool now to worry\nAbout all those things I can't change\nAnd the time that I borrow\nCan wait 'til tomorrow\nCause I ain't in no hurry today\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen I must return\nTo the cold cold ground\nHave them take their time\nWhen they lay this sinner down\n\n[Verse 2]\nHeaven knows that I ain't perfect\nI've raised a little cain\nAnd I plan to raise a whole lot more\nBefore I hear those angels sing\n(Going to get right with the lord)\nBut there'll be hell to pay\nBut I ain't in no hurry\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't in no hurry\nI'd be a fool now to worry\nAbout all those things I can't change\nAnd the time that I borrow\nCan wait 'til tomorrow\nCause I ain't in no hurry today\nAin't in no hurry\nAin't in no hurry todaySee Zac Brown Band LiveGet tickets as low as $76You might also like2Embed"},

what \"I don't love you\" feels like\nIt ain't the middle of the night\nAnd it ain't even raining outside\nIt ain't exactly what I had in mind, for goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nAt a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday\nNothing to say, don't even try\nSome are coming home, some are leaving town\nWhile my world's crashing down\nOn a Sunday in the sunshine\nAt a red light\n[Verse 2]\nI thought she was gonna say\nSomething 'bout that couple kids and crossing the street\nOr something about this beautiful day\nBut she just looked me in the eye\nSaid \"it's over\", didn't try to lie or pick a fight\nI might have seen it coming that way\n\n[Chorus]\nBut at a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday\nNothing to say, don't even try\nSome are coming home, some are leaving town\nWhile my world's crashing down\nOn a Sunday in the sunshine\nAt a red light\n\n[Bridge]\nThere's a mama calming down a little baby\nIn the backseat in front of me\nThere's an old man dressed in his Sunday best\nJust waiting on green\nBut I can't see getting past\n\n[Chorus]\nThis red light in the sunshine on a Sunday\nNothing to say, don't even try\nSome are coming home, some are leaving town\nWhile my world's crashing down\nOn a Sunday in the sunshine\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAt a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday\nNothing to say, don't even try\nSome are coming home, some are leaving town\nWhile my world's crashing down\nOn a Sunday in the sunshine\n\n[Outro]\nAt a red light\nAt a red light\nAt a red light\nAt a red lightEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

given anything\nTo have my own PacMan game at home\nI used to have to get a ride down to the arcade\nNow I've got it on my phone\n\n[Chorus]\nHe-e-ey\nGlory glory hallelujah\nWelcome to the future\n[Verse 2]\nMy grandpa was in World War II\nHe fought against the Japanese\nHe wrote a hundred letters to my grandma\nMailed 'em from his base in the Philippines\nI wish they could see this now\nThe world they say has changed you know\n'Cause I was on a video chat this morning\nWith a company in Tokyo\n\n[Chorus]\nHe-e-ey\nEveryday's a revolution\nWelcome to the future\n\n[Bridge]\nHe-e-ey\nLook around it's all so clear\nHe-e-ey\nWherever we were going, well we're here\nHe-e-ey\nSo many things I never thought I'd see\nHappening right in front of me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI had a friend in school\nRunning-back on a football team\nThey burned a cross in his front yard\nFor asking out the homecoming queen\nI thought about him today\nAnd everybody who's seen what he's

when you're talking out loud but nobody's there\nYou look like hell and you just don't care\nDrinking more than you ever drank\nSinking down lower than you ever sank\nWhen you find yourself falling down upon your knees\nPraying to god, begging him please\nThat's when she's more than a memory\nShe's more\nShe's more\n\n[Verse 3]\nBecause when you're dialing her number just to hang up the

phone\nAnd though you be telling me, I know you're not alone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, and that's why\n(Your eyes)\nI'm over it\n(Your smile)\nI'm over it\n(Realized)\nI'm over it, I'm over it\nI'm over...\n[Chorus]\nWanting you to be wanting me\nNo, that ain't no way to be\nHow I feel, read my lips\nBecause I'm so over (I'm so)\nMoving on and it's my time\nYou never were a friend of mine\nHurt at first a little bit, but now I'm so over\nI'm so over it\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm over your hands\nAnd I'm over your mouth\nTrying to drag me down\nAnd fill me with self doubt\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, and that's why your world\nI'm over it\n(So sure)\nI'm over it\n(I'm not your girl)\nI'm over it, I'm over it\nI'm over...\n\n[Chorus]\nWanting you to be wanting me\nNo, that ain't no way to be\nHow I feel, read my lips\nBecause I'm so over (I'm so)\nMoving on and it's my time\nYou never were a friend of mine\nHurt at first a little bit, but now I'm so over\nSo over it\nI'm so over it\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nOh\nDon't call, don't come by\nAin't no use, don't ask me why\nYou'll never change\nThere'll be no more crying in the rain\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, oh-oh\nI'm over it\n\n[Chorus]\nWanting you to be wanting me\nNo, that ain't no way to be\nHow I feel, read my lips\nBecause I'm so over (I'm so)\nMoving on and it's my time\nYou never were a friend of mine\nHurt at first a little bit, but now I'm so over\nSo over it\nI'm so over it\nI'm over it\n\n[Outro]\nWanting you to be wanting me\nNo, that ain't no way to be\nHow I feel, read my lips\nBecause I'm so over
