It\u2019s in our blood.\nA team of medical personal and Navy officers descend on the chopper. An assortment of high-ranking GENERALS and COMMANDING OFFICERS there to meet the chopper. Tight shots. A bloody hand dangles. A tear filled eyeball, sliced feet.\nLUTTRELL (CONT\u2019D) (vo)\nThere\u2019s a storm inside of us. I\u2019ve heard many team guys speak of this. A burning. A river.

Admirals\u2019 pace in the hallway.\nLUTTRELL (CONT\u2019D) (vo)\nPushing ourselves into those dark cold corners where the bad things live. Where the bad things fight.\nHeart monitor weak. Getting weaker. Compound fracture left shin. Bloody feet rinsed clean. Water flushing out bullet holes. Loose cracked tooth pulled out.

AFGHAN VILLAGE - DAY 7 INTERCUT AFGHAN VILLAGE. Intro Afghan warlord. AHMAD SHAH.\n35 years old. Tall, strong. Fierce. He moves through an Afghan village with a small pack of equally fierce Taliban warriors.\n3A.\n\ufffc\nLOCAL AFGHANS avoid eye contact. This Shah and crew feels like an old school western bad guy moving through a cow town.\nNOTHING like the SUICIDE BOMBERS of BAGDAD. These are real warriors. Strong-jawed. Thin but ripped muscles. Worn rich soulful faces, vivid eyes, color reds and blues. Strong boots. Military vests. Good radio equipment. Well-maintained weapons.\nShah\u2019s number two is TARAQ. Late twenties. Shah is vicious, TARAQ, is more vicious. Strong and very, very violent.\nA very worthy opponent.\nRIGHT now they are clearly pissed.

Trembling. Women pleading.\nWhere is he?\nSHAH SHAH Hagha Cherta Dey?\nThe women scream. As Shah starts throwing teenage boys around the room. Slamming them viciously into walls.\nA 25-year-old man Gulab tries to reason with Shah. A YOUNG BOY watches.\nGULAB GULAB\nPlease, we want no trouble. Mehrabani/lutfan, monga hes\nmushkil no ghowaro\nTaraq throws Gulab down hard. Turns, locks eyes with an older Afghan man(30s).

Shah studies the Afghan deep into his eyes. Decides he\u2019s lying...Shah nods to Taraq.\nTaraq yanks the Afghan to his feet. As his children watch Taraq leads the pleading farmer outside. Into the woods.\nTaraq and his men throw the Afghan down over a fallen log. Face up.\nTwo of Taraq\u2019s men hold him by the beard as Taraq stands over him. Razor sharp machete up.\nShah backlit. Ignoring the man\u2019s pleading...as Taraq hacks down with brutal fury.\nTight on Shah, tight on Taraq, blood dripping from his hand. BLACK\nGRAPHIC: BAGRAM AIR BASE - 14 HOURS EARLIER\nCUT TO:\n8 EXT. BAGRAM AIR BASE - DAWN 8 Sun just beginning to rise over the Base.\nBeautiful.\nCamera moves though the sleeping base.

Map of Afghanistan.\nMIKE MURPHY\nRooms a mess. Clothes and gear everywhere. Grenades on a desk next to a copy of GATES OF FIRE. New York Rangers flag next to a SEAL Flag, 8 x 10 head shot of Ron Burgundy.\nTight on Murphy. His eyes slowly open. Hold a moment. Murphy checks watch. 0500. Slow and smooth Murphy rises. Body strong. Not ripped. Effortless power.\nMurphy goes to his computer. Opens it and checks his mail. Tight on Murphy\u2019s inbox.\nA picture of an Arabian Horse.

Oprah money.\nFuck.\nMURPHY\nLUTTRELL\nI thought you guys were doing this\ntomorrow.\nMurphy and Dietz strap on Body Armor.\n7.\nLUTTRELL (CONT\u2019D) Maybe I\u2019m starting to become tele\nfucking pathic - non-verbal yoda or something. I could swear I just said outloud, that I thought this was happening tomorrow.\nMurphy stretching.\nMURPHY\nI think Red Wings a go. Tonight.\nLUTTRELL\nOutstanding.

Senior Taliban commander\nresponsible for killing Marines in Eastern Afghanistan and sport killing civilians in the Hindu- Kush. Considered Tier One target rumored to be close to Bin Laden. Axe is going to go over our route in.\nAXE\nThe helo pilots are going to do two\nfalse inserts. Then drop us off at our primary insert, located here. Secondary insert located here. From our primary insert, our bearing will be zero three zero patrolling 1.5 kilometers to our designated lay up point. We will be moving up the backside of this mountain which will offer us good concealment from the target but the terrain is gonna be rocky so watch your footing. I\u2019m estimating it\u2019s gonna take us about two hours to complete.\nMURPHY Luttrell - medical\nLUTTRELL\nFirst things first, win the fight.\nThere\u2019s no medicine in a gunfight. It\u2019s self aid, buddy aid, corpsman aide. Two weeks ago, Team 3 was near where you guys will be. Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake. and contrary to popular belief, there is poison oak, so watch the cock and balls cause that will suck. Drink lots of water, wear sunscreen, and Dietz bring your own chapstick.\nDietz stands up, starts talking comms\nDIETZ\nCrypto will be wide band, segment 2-\n4. Murph\u2019s got a SAT phone.

Some of the key pro- words - when we have a successful insert, Budweiser. When we\u2019re halfway through infil, it\u2019ll be Corona. At our observation point, Schlitz Malt Liquor. And if we positively identify Shah: touchdown.\nDanny chucks the toy plane.\nMURPHY\nReaction Force is the following:\nThe 47\u2019s will relocate to J-Bad overnight.\nMurphy uses toy plastic helicopters to explain the size and location of the QRF.\nKRISTENSEN\nThat\u2019s correct. You\u2019ll have fifteen\nteam guys, and about a dozen Marines standing by all night. When we hear Schlitz Malt Liquor, we\u2019re heading back to Bagram for phase 2. QRF will stay here - we\u2019re leaving you with 4 team guys, 20 marines, 2 Blackhawks and 2 Apaches. The Apaches stay with the Blackhawks.\nThe toy Choppers circle on the map giving us a clear understanding of the playing field.\nKRISTENSEN (CONT\u2019D) The movement is so we can get the\n47\u2019s back here and be ready to bring it for phase two once you get eyes on Shah. Remember - comms will most likely be intermittent and there are reports that non- combatants are being used as recon elements for the enemy.\nMURPHY Roger that.\nLuttrell spits chew. Danny doodles furious, mashing demons. Axe quietly studies the picture of Ahmad Shah.\n16.\nJAG GOES OVER RULES OF ENGAGEMENT\nAXE Lotta moving parts.\nMURPHY\nWhat we do, when we do, what we do.\nKRISTENSEN\nWe go in four hours.

Murphy getting frustrated. Louder.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) Do they know?\nThe old man stares, finally says something quiet. Too quiet for the translating machine. Murphy puts the mic closer.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) Say again. Are you Taliban?\nThe old man rants on as the machine struggles to translate his slang Pashtun.\nTRANSLATION MACHINE\nDo not drink with many blood rooms\nfire and knives...\nMURPHY\nThis fuckin thing\u2019s not working...\nThe machine starts translating what Murphy is saying.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) Shut the fuck up !\nMurphy throws the machine on the ground.\nThe dog makes another move at Luttrell. Fangs mashing. Luttrell raises his gun. The dog backs down.\n35 OMIT 35\n38.\n36 EXT. BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN 36 Danny continues to try his radio.\nDANNY\nSpartan 01, Spartan base...Spartan\n01, Spartan base...\nMurphy standing just off the group calls Luttrell over.\nMURPHY Marcus.\nLeaving Axe on security. Luttrell moves up the hill fifty feet with Murphy.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) What do you think?\nLUTTRELL\nMurphy\u2019s God Awful law. Not you\nMikey. The other prick. The God of screw-ups.\nNothing.\nYea.\nMURPHY\nLUTTRELL Soft Compromise bro.\nMURPHY\nYea. I\u2019m aware of that.\nMurphy digs into his pack, pulls out his SATELLITE PHONE. Checks numbers on his wrist pad. Dials up J-Bad TOC (Command Center).\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) (a touch frustrated: to\nDietz)\nI\u2019m now going to be that guy calling on a fucking unsecure Sat line because your radio is not functioning.\nDIETZ\nMove that mountain, we\u2019re good.\nTalk to the mountain, sir.\n39.\nLoses the signal twice. Third try he gets through. Horrible connection.\n37 INT. J-BAD TOC 37 A phone rings, answered by a young Marine, SGT. HASSLERT.\nHASSLERT\nJ-Bad TOC, SERGEANT HASSLERT.\nMURPHY\nSergeant can you hear me, this is\nSpartan 01, can you here me? Horrible delays, echoes and static.\nHello?\nHASSLERT\nMURPHY\nThis is Spartan 01, do you hear me?\nHASSLERT I hear you.\nMURPHY\nThis is not a secure line and I\nneed to speak to the CO immediately.\nThe CO?\nHASSLERT\nMURPHY That\u2019s correct.\nHASSLERT Which CO sir?\nMURPHY Commander Kristensen.\nHASSLERT\nCommander Kristensen is not here\nsir.\nMURPHY\nWhat do you mean he\u2019s not there?\nHASSLERT\nCommander Kristensen left this\nmorning.\n40.\nMurphy realizing Right. That\u2019s\nSTATIC BAD Hello?\nHello?\nhe\u2019s made a mistake.\nMURPHY\nFuck. He\u2019s back at BAGRAM.\nHASSLERT correct sir.\nMURPHY HASSLERT MURPHY\nI\u2018m here, I need to speak right now with the commander.\nHASSLERT Commander is in BAGRAM.\nMURPHY\nI know that can you please transfer\nthis call to BAGRAM OUELLETTE TOC.\nHASSLERT Roger that. Stand by.\nMURPHY Standing by.\nSilence Murphy looks down at the goat herders. Moves over to Danny with the radio. Holding up his SAT phone.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D)\n(re: SAT phone)\nHanding them our goddamned position.\nTight on Murphy, the realization of how fucked they are is starting to settle in.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) What\u2019s the fucking problem?\nDANNY Don\u2019t know.\nMURPHY\nDoes it need new fucking batteries?\n41.\nDANNY\nNo, it\u2019s fine but they won\u2019t\nfucking answer me.\n38 INT. OUELLETTE TOC 38\nIt\u2019s quiet. Among the SEALs present: Patton, James Suh, Dan Healy. A phone in the SEAL TOC rings answered by PATTON\nSHANE PATTON Ouellette TOC Petty Officer\nPatton..\nMURPHY Patton, this is Murphy.\nReally Bad connection.\nSHANE PATTON\nYou\u2019re looking for Mike Murphy?\nMURPHY This is Mike Murphy.\nSHANE PATTON Mike Murphy?\nMURPHY\nYes correct, this is Mike Murphy. A horrible connection.\nPatton is confused. He knows that Murphy and his team are way deep on their opp.\nMike?\nSHANE PATTON\nMURPHY Is this Shane?\nSHANE PATTON\nIt\u2019s Shane. What\u2019s up Mike? This\nconnection sucks.\nMURPHY\nAre you not receiving our transmissions?\nSHANE PATTON Radio calls? Not in a while.\nPatton yells over to the Comms guys.\n42.\nSHANE PATTON (CONT\u2019D) Are you all hearing anything from\nSPARTAN 1.\nCOMMS GUY\nWhen? We\u2019ve been communicating.\nSHANE PATTON (back on the phone)\nThey say they are communicating with you.\nMURPHY Say again.\nSHANE PATTON\nComms says that you are good. Copy?\nMURPHY\nIn the last twenty minutes?\nSHANE PATTON (back to comms guy)\nYou talked in the last twenty minutes?\nCOMMS GUY Negative.\nSHANE PATTON (into phone)\nNegative Murph.\nMURPHY\nI need the skipper now.\nSHANE PATTON He\u2019s sleeping sir.\nMURPHY Wake him up now.\nMurphy\u2019s voice is electronically garbled.\nSHANE PATTON\nDid you say wake him up sir?\nMURPHY Right the fuck now!\nSHANE PATTON Roger that.\n43.\n39 EXT. BAGRAM TOC. 39\nSHANE PATTON barefooted jogs out of the TOC moves through a series of plywood barracks. Knocks on a door.\nSHANE PATTON Skipper. Skipper.\nHe knocks harder.\nSKIPPER! From inside.\nSHANE PATTON (CONT\u2019D)\nKRISTENSEN (oc)\nWhat?\nSHANE PATTON\nSir sorry sir. I\u2019ve got Lieutenant\nMurphy on the phone in the TOC. Says he needs to talk to you. Now.\nA moment, then Kristensen\u2019s door flies open. Kristensen in his underwear, flip flops, moving out, clearly just waking up.\n39A Track with them as Kristensen moves back into the TOC. 39A Reaches for the phone.\nKRISTENSEN (into phone)\nMike? Silence Static.\nKRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Mike...? Mike...? Try him back.\nPATTON reads Murphy\u2019s SAT phone number off the board. Dials. Waits. Nothing. Tries again nothing.\nKRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Is it dead?\nSHANE PATTON\nYes sir. What\u2019d he want?\nKRISTENSEN\n44.\nSHANE PATTON No idea sir.\nKRISTENSEN Did he say anything?\nSHANE PATTON\nJust that he needed to speak to\nyou.\nKRISTENSEN Anything wrong?\nSHANE PATTON Didn\u2019t say sir.\nStay with Kristensen a bit concerned. Looking at the map of the Valley.\nTIGHT ON KRISTENSEN\nThinking.....\n40 EXT. HINDU KUSH MOUNTAIN 40 Murphy trying his IRIDIUM SAT phone one more time.\nMURPHY\nCan someone explain to me why they\nboth crash at the same time?\nLUTTRELL AXE\nMurphy\u2019s law. Murphy\u2019s law\nNow a last resort. Murphy keys his personal radio. An MBITR\nwalkie talkie mounted on the side of his chest.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D)\nSpartan 01 to anyone. Spartan 01 to\nanyone listening. Over.\nLUTTRELL\nWe could light these goats on fire\nand smoke signal our way out of here.\nDANNY\nI could go down to the village and\nask to borrow a phone.\nMurphy just stares at the goat herders.\n45.\nMURPHY\n(quietly to himself)\nFuck.\nLUTTRELL\nYou\u2019d get some interesting tile\nideas down there bro. Afghan Dirt Brown. Goat skin blond, she\u2019ll dig that a hell of a lot more than what is it Honey creme...?\nThe goat noise is now really loud. Dogs barking and Axe is getting focused. Doing the math.\nThe kid bolts. Hands cuffed behind his back, he\u2019s still fast as shit.\nAXE Fuck me.\nHe charges again after the kid. Tackles him. Drags him back. AXE breathing hard. Looking at Murphy.\nMURPHY\nI\u2019m thinking three ways this plays\nout.\nAll eyes on Murphy. His brain churning.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D)\nWe let em go, we\u2019re gonna fight. So\nwe can 1) Tie em up. Move out. Probably take them 15 minutes to get out. 2) Let em go. We hike out. Roll dice.\nDIETZ Three?\nAXE\nThree, soft Compromise. Terminate\nthe compromise.\nAxe stares at Murphy. Third choice is obvious.\nMurphy looks up to the mountain top a mile behind them.\nMURPHY\nCan we get a signal from that\nmountain?\n46.\nDANNY\nI thought about that. Probably. I\ndon\u2019t fucking know.\nMore dog barking, goat baying, bells ringing. The kids are staring rage into the eyes of the Americans.\nDANNY (CONT\u2019D) We gotta do something boss.\nMURPHY\nYea.\nMurphy walks back down to Luttrell and Axe.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) What do you think?\nLUTTRELL\nThey don\u2019t seem to like us very\nmuch.\nMURPHY A pause. Reality setting in.\nAXE\nShah\u2019s down there. We let them go,\nShaw disappears. Mission fails.\nMURPHY What? Kill them.\nAxe stares at Murphy.\nMurphy staring at Axe. Realizing how serious he is.\nAXE\nWe are compromised Mike.\nMarcus spits out some chew. Looking down, he shakes his head. A pained grin plasters his face.\nYea.\nShit.\nLUTTRELL\n47.\nMURPHY Danny?\nDanny takes a long look at the goat herders. Finally...\nDANNY\nI don\u2019t give a shit what you\ndecide. I\u2019m not a lawyer. Just tell me what to do Murph. You\u2019re the big bucks, earn em\u2019.\nMurphy turns to Marcus.\nMURPHY Marcus?\nLUTTRELL I don\u2019t know Mikey.\nLuttrell takes his time. The goats sound like they are howling. The vibe on the mountain is becoming deathly serious.\nLUTTRELL (CONT'D)\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like it. We\nkill them. Yea ok. We kill them. Bury them. They get found. Then what...\nAXE Then what?\nLUTTRELL\nI\u2019m just saying. It ain\u2019t gonna be\nprivate. Gonna be out there for the whole fucking world. CNN -- SEALs kill goat farmers. I don\u2019t want that legacy, bro. I\u2019m not killing goat farmers. Not feeling that.\n48.\nAXE\nI\u2019m not either, but the\nOld man\u2019s Tali and these kids can shoot better than you can.\nLUTTRELL\nLet\u2019s just tie \u2018em up and get the\nfuck out of here.\nAXE\nWe tie them up, we have no control over when they get found; get free. I will die before I let them dictate when we die. I will not end up showing your body -- your head -- on television. On the Computer. No way, they do not get that vote.\nLUTTRELL\nThen let\u2019s just get the fuck out of\nhere.\nI will do this, I will kill them right now. They will not harm you or me or my wife or your wife or any of our unborn children. No. These people are death and I will not fucking bow to this.\nMURPHY\nYou want to kill, Axe? Really?\nThat\u2019s your position?\nAXE\nI want to be playing golf with\nFreddie Couples on Pebble Beach, but I\u2019m having a little trouble getting a tee time.\nLUTTRELL\nIf we kill these kids, it\u2019s International news. CNN doesn\u2019t care about Rules of Engagement. SEALs kill kids. That\u2019s the story. Forever.\nTight on the guys taking this in. Murphy paces, staring intensely at one of the goat kids.\nMURPHY\nAxe what\u2019s your call?\nAXE\n49.\nAxe stares at Murphy.\nAXE (sad grin)\nMy final answer?\n49A.\nMURPHY Your final answer.\nAXE Kill them.\nThis hits hard.\nMURPHY Danny?\nDietz stares at the tied up kids.\nDANNY It\u2019s your call bro.\nMURPHY\nYou don\u2019t have an opinion?\nDANNY\nYea I have an opinion. Two\nopinions. One is that for the record I don\u2019t give a fuck what anyone thinks about what the fuck we do up here. We do what we do. What we have to do. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s our business.\nMURPHY What\u2019s two?\nDANNY\nTwo is, this is the Navy and you\u2019re\nthe boss and your job is to be the boss and my job is to do what I\u2019m fucking told.\nOk.\nMURPHY\nDANNY\nSo you tell me what to do and it\nwill be done. Murphy looks to Marcus.\nMURPHY\nMarcus what\u2019s your call?\nLuttrell seems to get that with Danny out, Murphy\u2019s for letting them go, Axe wants them dead - he\u2019s the tie-breaker.\n50.\nON MURPHY.\nLUTTRELL\n(slowly shaking his head)\nNo. I\u2019d rather fight them straight up. I don\u2019t want to kill these kids.\nThinking. He looks around the area. Looking for a burial spot. Stabbing at the stone earth with his M4. Clearly no soft earth anywhere close.\nMURPHY (quiet)\nFuck me.\nMurphy stares down at the Afghan village. Then long and hard at the three Afghans. Finally turns back to goat herders.\nDANNY\nLook at them. They fucking hate us.\nWe don\u2019t know how many Hajji\u2019s they have down there. We can\u2019t let them go.\nLUTTRELL\nSo now you have an opinion? I\nthought you were standing by waiting for your orders?\nAXE\nThis opp is a soup sandwich. Been so from the beginning. The pitch. The rope. Worst comms that I\u2019ve ever seen. Soft intel, we are not wearing vests, have no heavy weapons, are weak in numbers.... It\u2019s a cursed opp.\nMURPHY\nStarting to feel like a cursed opp.\nLUTTRELL\nIt\u2019s not a cursed opp. There are no fucking curses. Just Afghanistan. That\u2019s all. Everyday man. Devil\u2019s asshole.\nAXE\nShah just killed twenty marines\nlast week and we\u2019re on him. We\u2019ve come this far and these people here are him. They are a part of him. We let them go.\n(MORE)\n51.\nAXE (CONT'D)\nWe\u2019re letting him go and why in the\nfucking world does he have the right to do that to us?\nAxe is starring at LUTTRELL.\n51A.\nSilence.\nAXE.\nSeriously Marcus. Why does he have\nthe right to do that to us?\nLUTTRELL\nI don\u2019t see it that way.\nMURPHY\nSo what is your fucking call bro?\nLUTTRELL\nLet them go. Shut it down.\nSo if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it\u2019s one vote for killing them, one vote for letting them go, Danny is neutral.\nThis is all on MURPHY.\nMurphy turns away from them, looking down the steep pitched mountain. The village far below.\nMurphy thinks. Looks at the young kids. The old man.\nMURPHY\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. Pack\nup. Everything. We\u2019re gonna let \u2018em go and we\u2019re gonna make the peak. When we make the peak were gonna make Comms. We\u2019re calling QRF and we\u2019re getting out.\nSilence as the guys take in the plan. Luttrell lets out a huge breath.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\nDANNY Roger that.\nLUTTRELL Yes sir.\nMURPHY Let\u2019s move it.\nQuick Shots.\nThe guys quickly breaking down their gear. The goat boy watching confused.\n52.\nThe older Goat herders. Defiant. Steel-eyed.\n52A.\n41 INT. SEAL TOC. BAGRAM. 41\nKristensen, Patton with Petty Officer Dan Healy, James Suh and some COMMS guys.\nThe Comms guys trying to get Spartan 01 back on line.\nCOMMS GUY\nSpartan 01, Spartan 01, over.\nKristensen is on the phone, communicating with J-Bad TOC\nKRISTENSEN\nWhen was your last contact with\nSpartan 01?\n42 EXT. J-BAD TOC. 42 The two Blackhawks standing by with the two Apaches.\nThe Apache pilots are firing up their engines.\nMusslemen comes out of a pilot station.\nMUSSLEMEN\nWhere are you guys going?\nAPACHE PILOT\nWe just got called North. By an\nArmy 372, evidently they took some small fire.\nMUSSLEMEN\nWe\u2019re QRF, bro.\nAPACHE PILOT\nThat\u2019s what we thought. BAGRAM is\nnow QRF.\nThe 47s?\nCorrect.\nAre we not the QRF now?\nAPACHE PILOT That\u2019s my understanding.\nMussleman is a bit confused...\nMUSSLEMEN\nAPACHE PILOT\nMUSSLEMEN\n53.\nApache pilots climb into their two birds. Take off.\n43 EXT. MOUNTAIN 43\n10 MINUTES LATER:\nGear packed the four SEALs stand over the Afghans.\nMURPHY CONT\u2019D Everybody good?\nQuick nods from the team as Murphy\u2019s flip knife comes out. He quickly cuts through the flex cuffs. Freeing the Afghans.\nMURPHY\nYou three just won the lottery.\nSpeak well of us.\nAn odd moment as the Afghans stare at the SEALs. Not fully understanding that they are free to leave.\nGo!\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D)\nThe little goat boy stares at Murphy. A beat then gets it. Turning fast he takes off sprinting down the hill.\nThe old man holds a beat. Says something quietly to the team. Sounds fairly ominous.\nThen he too turns and slowly, deliberately starts making his way down the long steep mountain.\nMurphy looks at the team.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) Let\u2019s move it.\nThe four SEALs, full gear, start moving up the mountain.\nThere is no trail. Just steep rocks, fallen trees, and a brutal pitch.\n43A THE YOUNG GOAT BOY. 43A RUNNING DOWN THE HILL.\n54.\nLeaping over rocks. Fallen trees. The kid\u2019s movements are beautiful. Mountain agility in his DNA. Virtually FLYING down the mountain.\n43B UP TOP. 43B\nSlow going for the SEALs. Murphy leading. Danny, loaded up with COMMS, second. Luttrell breathing hard. Axe bringing up the rear.\nOn AXE\nConstantly checking behind him.\nHis left foot catches on some loose granite. Gives out.\nAxe rolls his ankle hard. Slips, falls hard sliding fast tumbling and smashing hard into a fallen tree stump.\nSprained right ankle and bruised left ribs.\nMurphy stops, looking back as Luttrell moves down to Axe. Axe struggling back on his feet.\nYou ok?\nLUTTRELL.\nAXE Fucking Afghanistan.\nLUTTRELL.\nYea. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to\nbe falling.\nAXE I\u2019m fine.\nHe takes a step. White flash of burst pain tears through him. He buckles. Clearly not alright.\n43C THE GOAT KID 43C Running hard approaching the village.\n43D UP TOP. 43D Luttrell reaches for him. Axe pulls away.\nAXE (CONT'D) I\u2019m good. Let\u2019s go.\nAxe digs his foot in. Grinds through the pain and starts back up the hill.\n55.\nAXE (CONT'D)\nMaybe we should just hike down to\nthe village, ask to borrow a phone.\nTight on Murphy\u2019s small smile as he digs it up the hill. The group now moving even slower cause of Axe\u2019s ankle.\n44 EXT. THE VILLAGE. 44\nQuiet. A couple of small fires. Some cooking. A group of young boys playing with sticks. Women cooking as - The young GOAT BOY comes tearing, full sprint into the village.\nTIGHT ON THE GOAT BOY. Eyes wide. Screaming for Shah.\nVillagers start to gather. Shah approaches the boys. Breathing hard, they point up the mountain.\nA couple of Taliban hear this. Take off into the woods.\nTRACKING with the two Taliban.\nAs they sprint deeper into the woods. Into the Taliban camp.\nTaliban soldiers sleeping. The two find Shah and Taraq. Tell them about the Americans.\nShah quickly on his walkie talkie, old school but deathly effective. Rounding up his fighters.\nQuick shots of the Taliban army. Feels like 150 men. Arming themselves. AK\u2019s, RPG\u2019s, grenades, a lot of ammo. Radio gear.\nQuiet, cool, professional. These Afghan soldiers are loading up big time...\n45 EXT. UP MOUNTAIN. 45 The SEALs cresting the hill.\nFuck.\nMURPHY\nHe\u2019s looking up at a larger hill in front of them. They have just ascended a false summit. Still blocked in by another very steep mountain.\nDanny?\nMURPHY (CONT'D)\n56.\nDietz is already into the radio, as Luttrell and Axe spread out, digging in, guns pointed down hill.\nNothing.\nDANNY (on radio)\nAnvil 1 this is Spartan 01, over.\nMURPHY Great.\nComms still clearly dead. Murphy weighing his options. They are high above the village. Murphy pulls out binoculars. Scanning the village and mountain.\nAll three SEALs on glass. SCANNING. SEALS POV\nNothing moving. From their vantage the town seems quiet. Business as usual.\nThey cannot see the Taliban off in the woods. They are OBLIVIOUS to the magnitude of the threat.\nCUT TO:\n46 TWENTY MINUTES LATER. 46\nDanny still working the radio. Axe has tightened his boot. Murphy and Luttrell have spread out on the hill. Staring down at the village.\nMurphy\u2019s got his SAT phone out. Trying to get a signal. Can\u2019t.\nHe\u2019s looking with disgust at the mountain behind him, knowing that it\u2019s blocking his signal.\nMURPHY (to mountain)\nMove Bitch.\nLuttrell\u2019s fifteen feet to his left.\nLUTTRELL What do you want to do?\nMURPHY\nGo home, get in bed, and watch\nAnchorman.\n57.\nCheck.\nLUTTRELL\nMURPHY I wanna be on you.\nLUTTRELL\nRoger that. Should I spread the\nword?\nMURPHY\nNot just yet. Let\u2019s hold up for an\nhour and see just how big of a can of hell we\u2019ve opened.\nLUTTRELL What do you think?\nMURPHY\nWe did the right thing. We let our\nlove light shine. God ought to be smiling down on us. Isn\u2019t that how it works? Good things happen to good people?\nLUTTRELL\nYou think they\u2019re coming after us?\nMURPHY\nLike a pack of wild dogs.\nMURPHY keys his radio.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) What say you Axe?\nAXE (on radio)\nI\u2019m fine.\nMurphy looks up behind him to the large cliff.\nMURPHY (to Axe)\nYou good to go?\nAXE\nNo problems boss.\nMURPHY\nHere\u2019s the deal. Lay low here.\nSoon as the sun sets we move.\n(MORE)\n58.\nMURPHY (CONT'D)\nIf we can\u2019t get comms from that top we\u2019re probably gonna have to walk home anyway, so get some rest. Axe you\u2019re first security. We move in about sixty minutes.\n46A THIRTY MINUTES LATER. 46A Murphy, Danny, and Marcus. Hats low. Eyes closed. Danny on\nthe glass.\nIt\u2019s quiet. Sun getting low. Probably two hours of sunlight left.\nON AXE.\nCalmly checking down hill, whistling very quietly to himself.\nTight on Luttrell resting.\nDanny. Eyes closed. One arm around his radio.\nMurphy. Eyes open. Staring up at the sky.\nBack to Axe. Focused down range.\nDown the mountain. Something appears to move. Axe misses it. Hold a beat. More movement.\nJust catches Axe\u2019s peripheral... Axe shifts his gaze. Focusing.\nTHEN\nMore movement. Axe sees it, raises his gun eye to the scope. Gently scanning the area of movement.\nStops whistling.\nAXE\u2019S POV:\nNo movement.\nAxe slowly pans his M-4 across the hill. Suddenly A FLASH OF SOMETHING HUMAN.\nA HUMAN. He pans a bit more to the right. Then two more.\nAXE pans way to the right. Almost as high as the SEALs are and he see\u2019s more movement.\nThey are almost surrounded.\nTIGHT ON LUTTRELL eyes still closed.\n59.\nMURPHY (CONT'D) (oc)\nSssst! Sssst!\nLuttrell lifts up his hat and looks left.\nSees Axe, rigid, in firing position, his rifle aimed straight up the mountain.\nMURPHY (CONT'D) (to Danny)\nTry and call it in.\nDanny desperate to get the radio to work.\nLuttrell fixes his Mark 12 into firing position looks through scope down hill.\nLUTTRELL\u2019S POV.\nLined along the top are at least a dozen heavily armed Taliban warriors, each one of them with an AK pointing downward. Some carrying rocket propelled grenades.\nLUTTRELL looks left.\nMore Taliban coming down hill to flank them. Luttrell looks right.\nMore Taliban.\nThe SEALs are FUCKED.\nMURPHY (CONT'D)\nHow the fuck fast are these little\nbastards? All four SEALs guns up.\nMarcus in the middle, Axe and Danny up to his left. Murphy twenty feet off to his right. Marcus slowly belly crawls towards Murphy.\nMURPHY (CONT'D) What are you thinking?\nLUTTRELL\nI\u2019m thinking that we\u2019re about\nfixing to get into a pretty good gunfight.\nYea.\nMURPHY\n60.\nLUTTRELL\nLooks like I voted wrong.\nMURPHY\nNegative. We\u2019ve been given the\nopportunity to reach out and make some hell fucking strong contact with our friends from the other side. Job well done.\nLUTTRELL Hoo-yah to that sir.\nON DANNY AND AXE\nLooking up the hill which is now swarming with Taliban. Dozens of soldiers flowing down hill flanking them.\nDANNY Do they see us?\nAXE Dunno.\nBACK TO MARCUS.\nHis back pressed up against a tree, inventorying his ammo. Grenades. Knife.\nDanny, Axe, Murphy all doing the same. Readying for war.\nAxe and Danny sneak quick looks at the pictures of their wives taped inside their helmets.\nThe trap tightening around all of them. All four focused up hill.\nA TREE TWENTY FEET IN FRONT OF MARCUS.\nA flash of a turban. Glint of an AK Barrel pointed in his general direction.\nLuttrell tightens the grip of his rifle slowly starts pointing it in the direction of the man behind the tree.\nLuttrell eyes on glass, still as marble. Aimed at the tree.\nMarcus looks over his shoulder at Murphy whose gun is also trained on the tree.\nMarcus eyes back on the scope. SCOPE POV:\n61.\nA fierce-eyed Taliban warrior peering straight into the scope. Black eyes and thick black beard. The barrel of his AK pointed dead on Luttrell.\nHold.\nTHEN.\nLuttrell fires once. Blowing the man\u2019s head off.\nAn odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan stumbles, still standing, still clutching his AK-47. He takes three more steps towards Luttrell.\nStops.\nLuttrell shoots again removes what\u2019s left of the fighter\u2019s head.\nThe Afghan starts to fall and as he hits the ground, all HELL BREAKS LOOSE.\nFrom above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open fire.\nScreaming at each other, communicating through violent, loud bursts of Pashto, the Taliban moving fast down the hill. Agile and fearless, not weighted down with US-style gear, they are able to leap boulders, fallen trees.\nTaraq in the middle of the pack on the top of the SEALs. UP TOP - Shah calmly giving orders into his radio comms.\nON MURPHY.\nTaliban moving down the hill on both sides. Shooting as they move.\nA solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on top of the hill above them.\nThe SEALs are close to being surrounded.\nMURPHY checks his rear.\nMURPHY POV\nA cliff. More of a series of cliffs. Multiple death falls. First one is at least 300 feet.\nMurphy calls it.\nPush right flank.\nMURPHY\n62.\nAxe the farthest right starts shooting and moving right INTO the wall of the Taliban flanking his right.\nLuttrell follows staying low, shooting, Danny firing with one arm. Desperate to get the radio up.\nDANNY\nSpartan 01 reporting major enemy\ncontact. We need help. Spartan 01 reporting major enemy contact. Request immediate QRF!

ME how do I break the chains on my brain\nMy mind, my body, my soul\nI need total control\nOf my freedom and my liberty\nWhen will it be for all?\nAll Berlin walls must fall\nThe physical torture and mental oppression\nThe anguish of depression\nLife is a lesson\nThat you've got to study hard because the hard times\nAre grippin' and whippin'\nQuit slippin'\nDon't be a slave just create a positive state\nDon't break just make and take\nBe great\nDon't be controlled just be strong never doubt your tomorrow\nAnd we'll hear you scream out...\n[Hook: Me Phi Me & Michael Franks]\nSAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!\nSAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!\n\n[Verse 2: Me Phi Me]\nWhen it rains it pours\nFor pain is a force\nLet happiness be your source and keep goin' for yours\nI know old Dante pulled you in The Inferno\nBut pain you learn though is not eternal\nSo now you're in the dungeon, on the wall you hang\nYou try everything, the pendulum still swings\nYou're down on your knees and prayin' Oh My GOD\nTell me why this life has to be so hard\nIs it all in the cards?\nYeah, deal me a new one\nAnd maybe life won't be so lonely and gruesome\nBut I'ma tell you son -- before you begin\nEven with a bad hand, you can bluff and win\nSo put your chips on the table you're able to do the task\nUnmask the executioner and take his axe\nAnd break the chains that bind and confine your mind this is your time\nUnleash and unwind put pain behind\nClimb out of the pit of darkness and start this new breed\nFor this is what we need\nDon't be held down and hellbound be strong and profound\nUnfasten the leather that's strappin' you down\nDig down and get up and you'll be swingin' the soul sound\nA New Day is coming, the sun don't frown\nDon't conform be confined or obey\nNelson Mandela breathes the air of a New Day\nSo now you're a number in the prison of a hardened soul\nBut be brave and behave and you may get parole\nSo there's HOPE, and hope is a pleasant thing\nOver the horizon I see the sun, I hear you sing...\nYou might also like[Hook]\nSAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!\nSAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!\nSAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!\nSAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!\n\n\n[Verse 3: Me Phi Me]\nSolar energy within ME all through ME\nIt's the sun full of light bringing power and might\nAll right makin' everything start to swing\nYou be the king or queen of your own dream\nLife can be supreme, it's a special thing\nJust keep the faith through the night time\nYou operate smooth and you might find\nAll of the loving, the bliss, the joy -- a happy deal\nFriendship and jubilee, you live The Elysian fields\nFor real -- you need to feel unchained and free\nInto the ME PHI ME\nAnd you are in the rat race, so put an your gym shoes\nRun emphatically, step on them blues\nChoose the right path and be on your way\nAnd

the desert\nI've been through the rain\nI've crossed the border\nWhere pleasure meets pain\nOnce you have seen through me eyes\nYou won't be the same\nOh, no no\n\nI could show your heart\nAnother side\nAll the colors\nThat make up your light\nSo many secrets\nThat you're gonna realize\nLook into the mirror of my eyes\n\nI know a pilot\nIf you'll take my hand\nWe'll sail to waters\nTo uncharted land\nWhere we can both understand\nThe faces of love\n\nSo many places\nWhere true hearts can go\nSo many flowers\nIn my garden grow\nOh boy I want you to know\nThe faces of love\nYou might also likeSing it: la la la\n\nBaby can you tell me\nOh boy have you ever seen\nThe faces of love\n\nI'll be there to show you things you never knew\nIf you would look into my eyes\nI'm sure you'd realize\nEverything you've been missin' boy\nIn your heart, and in your mind\n\nI wanna make you understandEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1297085",

enough to go around\nAnd the thought takes place Uptown\nI grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk\nAnd then taught to hawk New York\nI go to Queens for queens, then get the crew from Brooklyn\nMake money in Manhattan and never been tooken\nGo Uptown in The Bronx to Boogie Down\nGet Strong on the Island, recoup and lay around\nTime to build my juice back up\nProps stack up, suckers get smacked up\nDon't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about\nKnockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out\nShakin' 'em up, wakin' 'em up\nBreakin' 'em up, rakin' 'em up\nStandin' on shaky ground too close to the edge\nLet's see if I Know the Ledge\n[Verse 2]\nCorner's triflin' 'cause shorty's here\nI get cock-D liftin' forties of beer\nHere's a sip for the crew that's deceased\nIf I get revenge, then they rest in peace\nSomebody gotta suffer, I just might spare one\nAnd give a brother a fair one\nStay alert and on P's, and I do work with these like Hercules\nSwitch to southpaw, split your right jaw\n'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall\nSmooth, but I move like an army\nBulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me\nPuttin' brothers to rest like Alien Ness\n'Cause I don't like stress\nStreets ain't the place for innocent bystanders to stand\nNothing's gonna stop the plan\nI'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro\nBlack Gambino, die like a hero\nLivin' on shaky grounds, too close to the edge\nLet's see if I Know the Ledge\n\n[Verse 3]\nShells lay around on the battleground\nDead bodies are found throughout the town\nTry to put shame in my game to make a name\nI'mma put it on a bullet, put it in your brain\nRip the block like a buckshot\nWho cares where it goes? Just keep the casket closed\nNo remorse when a life is lost\nI paid my dues, paid the cost\nAnd my pockets are still fat\nWherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat\nEven if my crew asleep, I'm one deep\nI attract attention, people like to peep\nSo come say hi to the bad guy\nDon't say goodbye, I don't plan to die\n'Cause I get loose and I got troops, and crazy juice\nIn control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini\nHang out with Smith and Wess', don't try to play me\nI'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat\nBut no warnin' shot, my gun is warm a lot\nWhen I cook beef, the smoke will never clear\nAreas in fear 'cause this here's severe\nLivin' life too close to the edge\nHopin' that I Know the Ledge\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nA brand new morn', no time to yawn\nShower's on, power's on\nLate for school, I catch the train\nGirls sip the style and whisper my name\nI push up like an exercise\nCheck they intellect and inspect the thighs\nSelect the best one, pull her to the side\nKeep her occupied for the rest of the ride\nRead her my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, she know already? Cool\nJust meet me after school\nWe can moan and groan until your moms come home\nAnd you'll be callin' me Al \"Dope\" Capone\nSweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose\nCome get me, that's if you want to sip the juice\n'Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety\n'Cause a lot of niggas hate me\nComin' out of the building, they set me up\nSprayed with automatics, they wet me up\nIn a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge\nI guess I didn't Know the Ledge17Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/6189808", "artist_names": "Robbie Nevil",

time?\nYour place or mine?\nYou're so fine, do you mind\nA little kiss on the hand (from the Candyman!)\nAnd as we dance, by any chance may I have your number?\nSometimes I wonder\nWhat it would be like, spendin the night, foolin around\nSo let me see your nightgown\n[Chorus]\nNahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh\nNight-gowwwwwwwn\nNahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh

irritates me the most is when we're close\nYou just boast and brag\nOut all the men you had no one comes close\nBut it always starts like that\nAnd once they get it, forget it, the minute they're done they step\nOut of my pad and all I'm left with is a bad rep\nHer mouth was runnin I had nothin comin to me\nShe kept askin me\nDo you wanna watch TV or do you wanna see the town?\nI wanna see your nightgown~!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Candyman]\nCrept into the bedroom, I was feelin kind of faint\n(Maybe it was somethin you ate)\nThat was my complaint and she bought it like it was on sale\nAnd it never fails\nIt was gettin late ao I figured that she wouldn't even bother me\nBut she treated me properly\nTook the shoes from off of my feet\nPulled down the sheets, I could feel the heat\n(from the fireplace) burnin in the living room\nKnowin that she would give in soon\nMuch to my surprise when I tried, she provided the leadway\nThis is no he say or she say\nWhen I say to you it's on\nI mean

supposed to ever grow\nA peace activist, deeply passionate\nCame at the system through actions of a philanthropist\nMark David Chapman shot in the back in his prime\nAt a time of war he was peace packin'\nThe songs that would seize Vietnam's despair\nLet him be, set him free like John Sinclair\nThe was is over and give peace a chance\nEven God down with Bobby sealing a Black Panthers\nImagine was one of the best songs ever written\nAnd if disagree, you are not a musician\nWe miss him and need him with us to mold the children\nInstead of lying dead in front of the dakota building\nAssassination by a fascist administration\nFor unity of nations and peace demonstrations\nI try explain it to the kids who ain't got the patience\nFor parent from the Reagan era who was lost as Reagan\nI think oh how he died right before I was born\nAnd now he changed my life through the words in his songs\nI love Pink Floyd, Hendrix and Lennon\nAnd I wrote this song in honor of their remembrance\n[Chorus] Yoko Ono\nMrs. Lennon, o' Mrs. Lennon\nChecking the sky to see if there's no clouds\nThere's no clouds\nO' then, I guess it must be alright\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe history of the legend John Lennon, the beetle, the activist\nThe biggest threat to the establishments as Jesus of Nazareth\nMassacred 1980 gateway to Rosemary's baby like JFK's brain\nWith missing, John Lennon was cremated\nMark David assassinated, an angel by Dakota\nOn the mission of Ronald Reagan, a '38 revolver\nShotted in the shoulder like a poet, dropped to the ground\nMark Jasmine characterised to catch her in the right\nLeft the world frozen in time like a sculpture of ice\nI swear only hell below us, we're always lookin' for the sky\nThe eighth of December is marked with blood in my calender\nI seek vengeance upon a murderer that took John Lennon\nConspiracy theories tells me you're a taxidermist\nLike an animal with your flesh eaten by cannibal perverts\nBet it's or Joe or Chapman, they both government jackels\nWe demanding Lennon's ashes to be spreaded over a chapel\nI hear your ghost by piano, I see the blood on your glasses\nYou sign your death through an autograph on the copy of your album\nI travel back beyond the spirits of time to research\nI cough blood on these lyrics, pyramids built in reverse\nThe music industry is cursed, John we truly need you\nWe got a one-world government, that reduces the people\nA mrs. Lennon, we're checking out for the clouds in the sky\nYou know his death was a cover up\nThe government took his life\nMotherfucker\nYou might also like[Chorus] Yoko Ono\nMrs. Lennon, o' Mrs. Lennon\nChecking the sky to see if there's no clouds\nThere's no clouds\nO' then, I guess it must be alrightEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3444298", "artist_names": "Special Generation", "full_title": "Love Me Just For Me by\u00a0Special\u00a0Generation", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/916437f5b680e9947105ed066a7614b8.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/916437f5b680e9947105ed066a7614b8.400x400x1.jpg", "id": 3444298, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 5508372, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1516212743, "path": "/Special-generation-love-me-just-for-me-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Special-generation-love-me-just-for-me-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1990, "month": 9, "day": 24}, "release_date_for_display": "September 24, 1990", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 24, 1990", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/916437f5b680e9947105ed066a7614b8.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/916437f5b680e9947105ed066a7614b8.400x400x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false}, "title": "Love Me Just For Me", "title_with_featured": "Love Me Just For Me", "updated_by_human_at": 1667015842, "url": "https://genius.com/Special-generation-love-me-just-for-me-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1076599", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/916437f5b680e9947105ed066a7614b8.400x400x1.jpg", "id": 1076599, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/916437f5b680e9947105ed066a7614b8.400x400x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Special Generation", "slug": "Special-generation", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Special-generation"}, "artist": "Special Generation", "lyrics": "Love Me Just For Me LyricsLove me just for me.

mean?)\n(Breakdown)\n\n(Breakdown)\n\nIn the beginning, your love was true\nAnd I gave to you\nMy inner emotions\nYo, I was a slave to you\nIf time can heal all wounds\nThen I feel one\nThe path of the broken heart is what we'll run\nYou treat me fine, so you say\nIf I walk away, I'm justified\n'Cause I cried each and every day\nWe used to talk\nHold hands for a long walk\nStretch on the beach\nFor tans on the boardwalk\nCall me up late at night for a small kiss\nThe movies, the mall\nIt ain't easy being dissed\nYou love me\nBut time can change in a big way\nThe deck is strong but the hull, it'll give way\n\n(Our love is breaking down)\nYou used to give the best to me, come next to me\nTake some for self and give all the rest to me\n(Our love is breaking down)\nBut that's dwindled, I sit by the window\nHope for the rain to stop and get rekindled\n(Our love is breaking down)\nLove, to us, at first reinforced it\nBut now when I call, you sound like you lost it\n(Our love is breaking down)\nIf this is true, then I say this to you\nTell me what to do, do\nYou might also likeOur love is breaking down\nOh, yeah\nOur love affair is crumbling down\nOur love is breaking down\nOh, yeah\nOur true love is finally coming to its end\n\nI get to the point sometimes when I think back\nYou don't really love me\nNah, I shouldn't think that\nFriends, they rif and say that you'll diss me\nWeeks go by\nAnd you don't even miss me\n\nSo if I tell you what I feel\nYou gotta tell me if it's real\nYou're breaking down my heart\nAnd tearing me apart\nAnd I appeal for you to stop\nAnd notice me and get very close to me\nYou used to be my one and only\nNow you're a ghost to me\n\nAlthough my love will never stop\nI think we're headed for a drop\nYou used to take me out a lot\nBuy me flowers in a pot\nTwenty-five forget-me-nots\nGoing to the malt shop\nSharing everything we got\nTell me why you changed the plot\n(Our love is breaking down)\nYou don't even come\nOr put a coin in the slot\nLike a fish that is baiting\nI'm tired of waiting\n(Our love is breaking down)\nYou said you would meet me at six\nNow it's eight and I'm tired of crying\nHurt intensifying\n(Our love is breaking down)\nThe romance is shying\nI'm trying and sighing and dying\n(Our love is breaking down)\n(Yeah)\n\nOur love is breaking down\nOh, yeah\nOur love affair is crumbling down\nOur love is breaking down\nOh, yeah\nOur true love is finally coming to its end\n\nOur love is breaking down\nOh, yeah\nOur love affair is crumbling down\nOur love is breaking down\nOh, yeah\nOur true love is

down)\nWe used to be so happy\n(Our love is breaking down)\nA better love could not be found\n(Our love is breaking down)\nBut now our love is breaking down\n\nThe love I found\nYou put me down, you lost me\nYou cost me a whole bunch of time\nNow you boss me around\nIt's rainy, it's sunny\nMy eyeballs are runny\nI'm just like your money\nYou break me\nAnd, honey, you come back to score\nLike a ship with a shore\nAnd therefore I can't take it no more\n\nTogether\nTougher than leather\nThrough any kind of weather\n(Breaking down)\nAnd I never thought that it would sever\n(Breaking down)\nOr come to this, I try to miss\n(Breaking down)\nBut I don't see you enough\nOr let alone get a kiss\n(Breaking down)\nI'd like to grace the place you ace\nHang out or embrace\n(Our love is breaking down)\nSo I could suck your face and get a taste\n\nSometimes I state 'em\nAnd often hate 'em\nBut our love has come to this\nAn ultimatum\n(Breaking down)\nI'm not your superwoman just assuming\nThat you will come home and caress me\n(Our love is breaking down)\n\nI'm human, sweetheart\nI'm tender\nUp and surrender\nI don't wanna go out like this\n(Our love is breaking down)\nBut I'm the best in this gender\nMy love is forsaken\nMy heartbeat is shaken\nI'm not gonna make it\n(Our love, our love)\nAnd, no, I can't fake it\n\n(Our love, our love, our love)\nSo love me or leave me\nBut don't disbelieve me\nAccept me, reject me\nBut don't disrespect me\n(Is breaking down)\nSo get it together\nSo we can exist and reminisce bliss, bliss\n(Oh, oh)\n\nOur love is breaking down\nOh, yeah\nOur love affair is crumbling down\nOur love is breaking down\nOh, yeah\nOur true love is finally coming to its endEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1411577",

1]\nAnd with the hounds at bay\nI'll call your bluff\nHey, 'cause it would be okay\nTo walk on tiptoes everyday\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I think of you and all the love that's due\nI'll make a promise, I'll make a stand\n'Cause to these big brown eyes, this comes as no surprise\nWe've got the whole wide world in our hands\n\n[Hook]\nAdvice for the young at heart\nSoon we will be older\nWhen we gonna make it work?\n\n[Verse 2]\nLove is promise, love is a souvenir\nOnce given\nNever forgotten, never let it disappear\nThis could be our last chance\nWhen we gonna make it work?\nWorking hour is over\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd how it makes me weep\n'Cause someone sent my soul to sleep\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd when I think of you and all the love that's due\nI'll make a promise, I'll make a stand (I'll make a promise, I'll make a stand)\n'Cause to these big brown eyes, this comes as no surprise\nWe've got the whole wide world in our hands\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Bridge]\nWe've got the whole wide world in our hands\nWe've got the whole wide world in our hands (In our hands)\n\n[Hook]\nAdvice for the young at heart\nSoon we will be older\nWhen we gonna make it work?\n\n[Hook]\nAdvice for the young at heart\nSoon we will be older\nWhen we gonna make it work?\n\n[Outro]\nWorking hour is over\nWe can do anything that we want\nAnything that we feel like doing\n\"Advice...\"4Embed"},

Lyrics[Verse 1: Wondress]\nEvery time I close my eyes\nI can clearly see the image of your smile\nShine through my darkest dreams\nI never thought that I'd find myself this close, this close\nTo you, my dear, tell me what it means\nI can feel your sweet caress wash away all the loneliness\nThat I once felt inside my heart\nBoy, if you could read my mind I'm sure that you would find\nWhat you've been searching for, what you've been searching for\n[Pre-Chorus: Wondress]\nFree me from despair (Free me), there's so much to share\nIf you surrender to me\nWhisper in my ears words I long to hear\nWoo ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh\n\n[Chorus: Wondress]\n(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)\nBoy, I got to have your love\n(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)\nYou know, you know, you know I need your love\n(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)\nBoy, I got to have your love\n(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, ha-ha-heart)\nYou know, you know, you know I need your love, ooh\n\n[Verse 2: Wondress]\nYou're like an angel in disguise\nI feel like I'm in heaven when you walk my way\nYou're such a mystery (Such a mystery)\nThe butterflies I feel inside must be (must be), must be (must be)\nA sign of love, no one can disagree\nMy desire for your love is like a new horizon\nOnly lovers see like you and I, I\nSacred love will be the start to sacred nights, our hearts\nI'll love you 'til my dying day, until my dying day\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Wondress]\nFree me from despair (Free me), there's so much to share\nIf you surrender to me (To me, to me, to me)\nWhisper in my ears words I long to hear\nOh oh whoa whoa oh\n\n[Chorus: Wondress]\n(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)\nBoy, I got to have your love\n(Gotta find a way to get into your

endless nights\nCrying you name out loud\nBut still remain\nAlone in an empty crowd\nAs time goes on I realize you'll never change\nI say a prayer\nI count the hours\nI hear a voice but it's not yours\nI count the score\nI can't go on playing the waiting game\n\nIf you should ever change your mind\nI'll be there just call my name\nUntil then I'll be playing the waiting game\n\nI've waited too long\nWishing my life away\nConvincing myself\nTomorrow you'd change your ways\nI can't go on but I still hang on just the same\n\nI say a prayer\nI count the hours\nI hear a voice but it's not yours\nI count the score\nI can't go on playing the waiting game\n\nAll you left me with emptiness\nNow everyday seems the same\nYou've gone but I'm still playing the waiting game\nYou might also

Rancore & Suarez]\n\n[Strofa 1: Rancore]\nIo, non scrivo di getto ma di rigetto\nDio, salvami da questo spettro sotto al letto\nTe l'ho detto, io stesso non mi sono mai retto\nEd \u00e8 una vita che aspetto mentre affetto ogni mio affetto\nAffetto da un morbo rancido che vorrei rompere\nE raccolgo queste idee per terra con l'aspirapolvere\nPer pendere da un lato, perdere ci\u00f2 che mi hai dato\nE prendere il cazzo di lusso di non rispondere\nImpronte che ti fanno capire come mi giudico\nLa gente che continua a vedermi come scorbutico\nE l'action-figure di Rancore avr\u00e0 un opuscolo:\n\"Strappagli dal petto il cuore, scopri che \u00e8 minuscolo\"\nL'unico che fa a gara co' un orologio, ti scoccio\nPerch\u00e9 i miei pensieri sono di coccio\nMi concio (Come?)

No, calci in faccia per gli artisti\nChe parlano di [?] e hanno tatuaggi e piercing\nMoralisti, li ho gi\u00e0 visti, sono sempre loro questi\nI party boy si incazzano se sentono i miei testi\nFanno la faccia seria, poi saltano dalla sedia\nFanno fuoco sopra Kento sopra il forum di Indymedia\nNon critico n\u00e9 giudico, ma son fatto di sicuro\nOra vogliono anche i figli ma si amano col culo\nRester\u00f2 al mio posto e combatto da peso massimo\nScrivendo un testo avendo in testa il prossimo\nMastico veleno, gusto amaro tra le labbra\nTalkin' 'bout a revolution come Tracy Chapman\nIn Condomino la strada \u00e8 la scuola, figli dei nostri tempi\nSi ma non di Ronald McDonald\nI mostri sono ancora qui e avverti i vicini\nOgni frame di sto film \u00e8 un Hall Of Fame per gli Inquilini\n\n[Strofa 3: Profeta Matto]\nNon vede un cazzo, gente senza fede\nSo sceso all\u2019inferno, i vostri problemi fanno ride'\nIl successo, la voglia venale\nLa mia missione \u00e8 fa' a pezzi le forze del male\nEcco perch\u00e9 sono sceso sulla tera\nNun me frega un cazzo del rap\nIo sto qua pe' fa' la guera\nEr nemico \u00e8 il padrone ed \u00e8 pi\u00f9 grave\nChe brigate avanza, una moschea \u00e8 la mia base\nEr punto de non ritorno: questa \u00e8 la mia vita\nIo combatto nel nome della croce greca\nPropaganda, esperimenti la vojia a piede libero\nA rischio della vita prima linea senza per\u00f2\nUn mondo pieno de creature infernali, vien co' me\nCancello peccati capitali\nNun s'ammazza un fantasma dal passato\nSerpe di merda [?] il tuo volto impagliato\nYou might also

\u00e8 alquanto seria\nVoglio cervelli pi\u00f9 aperti, che sta roba vi esalta\nCome il commendatore Zampetti\nC'ho du mila passioni, le infilo nelle canzoni\nE non ci sono paragoni come Trony\nMi immagino a Sanremo con Baudo\nFinisce in rissa come il Zequila contro Pappalardo\nPolverizzo i tuoi ridicoli idoli\nLe mie rime per le loro teste sono come spigoli\n\n[Outro]\nDon't give a

my\u2005part\u2005is\nI hear my\u2005own voice\nI make my own choice\nI\u2005guess, we're fuckin' doing it\nThe horse is out the gates\nIt's\u205ftime\u205fto\u205fstart the race\nShoutout\u205fto Kathy Bates\u205fand also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld\nOr maybe it's more like Larry David\nBecause you know we're not playing\nShoutout to the Jews, the chosen people\nYou know that you cannot fuckin' lose\nBut also, shoutout to the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I don't care that I got seizures\nI got my fuckin' pills\nI'm gonna take 'em right around midnight\nSo I can get right\nI think that's what I gotta do\nShout out to the medical commun-\nItty I just get gritty\nI hope my rhymes are not shitty\nUmm, mic check are you with me?\nShout-out Bobby and Whitney\nBut not shout out to the bad things he did\nI don't know if I'm gonna have a kid\nI don't know if I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to drop it hot for you\n'Cause this is why I'm hot\nThis is why I'm not\nShoutout to Mims\nShoutout to Hims\nThat's that brand of underwear\nThat I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway\nI'm drivin' down the one way\nI'm cruisin' up the runway\nSpreading my wings\nLike I am a Cessna\nLike I am a chestnut\nRoastin' on an open fire, bing!\nCrosby, you got me\nMe, hot see?\nMe Watsky\nSee?\nSittin' in the hot seat\nNo, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat\nBut that word, beats droppin' me\nAnd meha coppin'\nShoutout to Frank Macoppin\nPlayground\nIn the fuckin' San Francisco SFC\nBecause you know how this go\nWe are the best in Dolores Park\nWe have a chorus singin' in the dark\nHark, the angel\nShoutout to Chuck Rangel\nRangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but\nIn December maybe I will be dismembered\nBy a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa\nComin' down my chimney\nWavin' fuckin' butcher knives\nThat\u2019d be fucking crazy\nWho is he\nWho is this robotic crazy Santa\nOh my \u2018lanta\nI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the ground\nMy fuckin' whole brood around me\nAnd I got my whole butt out\nHe's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away\nCut-out\nCut it out like on Full House\nJohn Stamos\nJohn Stains-Most in his pants\nBut that's okay\nWe don't judge people who like to dance away the day\nIf they need a Pepto-Bismol\nMy throat is not abysmal\nThis all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt\nI will not repent\nAnd I\u2019m not demented\nBut I meant it\nWhen I sent it\nFrom my brain\nI'm not plain\nIm not fuckin' around\nI\u2019m not cluckin' the ground\nJust right there it\u2019s only two feet\nThat\u2019s pretty cool man I eat\nFrom that cup right there\nThe one that\u2019s floatin' up in the air\nIt\u2019s got a fuckin' strawber-\n-ry smoothie\nI flow very smoothly\nBut you cannot do me\nDo me, do me like that\nI got that roomie type rap\nIt\u2019s mad philosophical\nI just keep on droppin' all\nOf the marbles in my brain\nThey\u2019re comin' out my nose\nAnd then they just remain\nOn the ground\nEven the cat\u2019s eye\nThat is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by\nDid you know at places\nPeople on the internet watch marble races\nI watched one\nIt was mad fun\nI picked the fuckin' blue marble\nAnd my pick wasn't all garbled\nIt came down the shoot\nIt was going all fuckin' cool\nAnd then it fuckin scooted past the red one\nThat kid from The Shining like Red-Rum\nMeaning murder\nWorder\nWordier\nAll my flows are so dirtier\nThan you could even fuckin' guess\nI'm not even fucking stressed\nI'm so damn relaxy\nShout out to a Maxi-Pad\nFor being so absorbent\nThat's a good fuckin' fuction\nMy girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it\nPut her hands in the air\nMaxi Pads doing what they do down there\nIf you are shaved or if you've got hair\nIt doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare\nDo what you wanna\nWord to your mama\nYour dude can't tell you what you gotta do\nGotta do what you wanna\nMake your own choice\nWith your body or your voice\nIf you are moist\nI know some people don't like that word\nPalabra\nBut you know you gotta like what you like\nThere was this one time this dude named Ike\nRan to be Prez\nAnd he fuckin' won\nEisenhower, that's what I said\nI's a power-rapper\nYes I am\nSo fuckin' dapper\nThe clapper\nDoesn't work on the lights on this green screen\nMan, that would be a dream scene\nIf I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want\nWhat I want, damn\nThat would be no scam\nI don't eat no Spam\nThat's 'cause I am a soft boy\nAnd I only eat Bok-Choy\n'Cause I'm a little veggie human\nAnd that's what I be doin'\nLet me clarify\nLike clarified butter\nAgain, word to your mother\nAnd also not to digress\nBut I gotta get it off of my chest\nWord to Mark Wahlberg\nWord to ballers\nWait, okay, let me make my main point\nAs I rap over this joint\nAnd that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy\nI also eat soy\nI also as a Jewish type dude not a goy\nGet lots of joy out of eatin' carrots\nOut of eatin' broccoli\nOut of eatin' lots of trees\nOut of smokin' lots of trees\nThat is true\nThat is not\nI don't smoke a lot\nBut I do when I party\nBut during COVID, I party hardly\nAnd I guess that's kinda sad\nBut I've had some calls with my dad\nPaul Watsky\nAnd Claire Watsky\nIt's rare, stop me\nIt's not, lots of Sundays\nI call my parentals\nAnd I just steal out my fuckin' mentals\nBut I don't pull out my dentals\nI go sometimes I do in a dream\nWhen I am on the scene\nAnd the ghost come and make me scream\nIt's like you are doing the most\nAnd I gotta fuckin' boast\nShout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast\nThat is some shit if you take a gander\nThat was said by Mr. Ned Flanders\nMr. Homer Simpson\nI'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on\nThey're like \u201cWatsky, I'll do everything for you\nI'll white knight for you and your fucking crew\u201d\nI'm like \u201cDude, don't be a simp\nActually, DO be a simp\nYou could be pimp\nYou could be wimp\nYou could fucking walk with a limp\nYou can have a crimp in your dimp-le\u201d\nI just get the whole tent pole\nUp in the sky cause I meant\nLots of people can come in\nCause I got a big tent\nSo if you are a lame\nFucking get bent\nAnd by lame, what I mean in this game\nIs the type of person who says that you're lame\nIs the type of person who judges\nIs the type of person who never budges\nWhen they get stubborn\nCause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard\n[?] 00:18:04\nWord!\nI think I got this whole thing turn-ed up\nBut that is bound to happen\n34 hours when you keep on rappin'\nSome words are going to collide like trains\nComing head to head, but it remains\nTo be seen that I get back on the track\nWith the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*\nWith my fucking clapping gums\nSo don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb\nSometimes\nCause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes\nBut it happens and I think that is the lesson\nThat you cannot achieve perfection\nAnd it's not even a worthy goal\nYou just gotta try to put that ball in the hole\nMore times than not\nThis is why I'm hot, as I said\nBut, you know Man's Not Hot?\nAlthough the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am\n'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham\nOn the microphone-o oh no\nCan't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno\nIce skatin' all over the beat\nMakin' it repeat\nI do not want to beat my meat, on the camera\nThat would be a bad fuckin' PR move\nWhen I'm all up in the groove with my meat out\nThey would be like \"oh, shout out\nThat will ruin my career\nIs that fuckin' clear?\nShowin' his whole rear?\nHe got fuckin' nakey\nMake me, take me\nYou cannot bake me\nIn my EZ bake oven\nNo Sara Lee\nI just keep on flowing, so merrily\nVerily, forsooth, did he do that shit\nOh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it\nHe's just Frank Coppin it\nAnd there is no halting' it\nI just put some fuckin malt in it\nMake it like some Yoo-hoo\nYoo-hoo!\nDid you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed\n[00:20:00]\n'Cause you could not rhyme\nLike I do, do the crime and you know that I'm\nJust puttin' lime on top of this shit\nAnd that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me\n'Cause you know when I put it on top\nThat I am going to make it drop\nTo the bottom of the urinal\nYou're all in my brain\nAnd I'm hearing y'all\nBut I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments\nI be too scared to see the tools\nBut I got to just remain bold\nAnd I've got to stay in the hold\nMy whole nuts life, oh, my nuts\nRemember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?\nRemember jungle?\n[00:20:41]\n\n[00:30:00]\nThey got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate\nVerbally, vocally, stoking the fire\nOf the couress I retired\nI feel one year\n'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear\nSee how I could sing, that took many years\nBefore I try to do with the din\nAnd now I only rapped\nAnd now I only try to cap, no cap\nI just try to get that back\nThat back, uh, back\nAnd I'm gone\nOver the fence\nNo shout out to my pens\n\nYou know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda\n\n[00:40:00]\nI'm sittin' on the veranda\nJust sippin' on my water\nLookin' at my ink blotter\nFeelin' like the best\nStarin' at my Rorschach test\nAnd it's tellin' me some dark crap\nIt's tellin' some star type of stuff\nLike oh shit, I'm gruff\nI'm like Scruff, Scruff, Scruff, my gruff\nScruff, my gruff, Chicago, Illinois\n6-0-6-5-2 that I'm\nYou might also like(00:44:22)\nYou know that a bat kills\nUsing sonar\nGoing through the cave\nWith the

Hey, what\u2019s up young world? My names sleep. And if you don't know me, hopefully you will soon. I'mma bring it to you like this\n\n[Verse 1]\nCheck it out, back in the day when I was a teenager\nI used to daydream about my escape of, how to be normal hey wait wait-a\nMinute let me grab the microphone and kick major lyrics off the top off the b-b-b-b-brain-a yea\nYea I know this ain't every day behavior  (but hey) what can I say I got a lot to say\nAnd I'm often on display cause I'm a bit of show boat but not today\nYea I'm thinking about just keeping it easy right now you know really simple stuff\nThe art of simplistic minimalistic you know mellowing out on the cut not trying to devour the cut\nOr rap with so much technical savvy that you just can\u2019t understand what's happening\nYea that would be bragging and I'm not really a braggadocios kind of rapper know what I'm saying?\nI'm one of those kick it back in the corner kind of rappers\nNot trying to be the center of attention kind of rapper. Well maybe a little bit\nBut how could you not be when the skills that you posses are fucking ridiculous\nMake your brain ticklish and I made up my mind to commit to this\nInserted my mind and interests, and you can see all the microphones I broke on Pinterest\nYea I think you can say I'm into this, in fact me and the beat are getting intimate\n[Hook] (x2)\nOkay, okay, there you are (are you with me? Are you with me where you at?)\nOh, oh shit, there you are (are you with me? Are you with me where you at?)\nOh, oh, okay, there you are (are you with me? Are you with me where you at?)\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh, there you are (are you with me? Are you with me where you at?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh there you are I made a splash like a cannon ball\nI'm trying to feed you my heart like a suicidal Hannibal\nHalf animal half amazing with lungs looking like California raisins\nAnd I heard it through the grape vine that I'm not taking anybody's shit no more\nRight now I'm entertaining that\u2019s all, yup, and I'm making the call\nAnd you can never understand unless you taking my falls\nCause it's a long way down but I made my way back up\nAnd I made my way around with original sound spilling in my cup\nAnd I made a play ground of the world, been around it with a loud mouth strut\nThey said I wouldn't amount to anything special but I found my calling uh huh, mhh mhh\nWhat up? Now let me tell you something, they love to hurt you like everyone's got munchin-housin\nOr however the fuck you pronounce it, It don\u2019t take away from the fact that they're putting poison in your mouth shit\n\n[Hook] (x2)You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1558154", "artist_names": "The Cars", "full_title": "Strap Me In

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nOur dad would send us to our room\nHe'd be the voice of doom\nHe said that we would thank him later\nAll day, he was solid as a rock\nBut by eight o'clock\nWe'd be crumbling\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne night, my brother Joe and me\nClimbed down the family tree\nThat grew outside our bedroom window\nWe ran, though we knew it couldn't last\nRunning from the past\nFrom things that we were born to be\n[Chorus]\nLooking back, it's so bizarre\nIt runs in the family\nAll the things we are\nOn the back seat of the car\nWith Joseph and Emily\nWe only see so far\nAnd we all have our daddy's eyes\nLooking back, it's so bizarre\n\n[Verse 3]\nDad rang the officer in charge\nA man so large\nHe barely fit his circumstances\nHe said two kids out on the street\nWere picked up on the beat\nAnd in the station\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo there's me, with Emily and Joe\nDaddy driving home\nAll heading in the same direction\nHe knew, no matter what the breaks\nWe'd make the same mistakes\nCouldn't take his eyes off Joe and me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nLooking back, it's so bizarre\nIt runs in the family\nAll the things we are\nOn the back seat of the car\nWith Joseph and Emily\nWe only see so far\nAnd we all have our daddy's eyes\nLooking back, it's so bizarre\nIt runs in the family\nAll the things we are\nLooking back, it's so bizarre\n\n[Bridge]\nLike a dream within a dream\nWe're all somewhere in between\nLike a drummer plays his drum\nLike a father, like a son\n\nYou're gonna have to face the music, oh yeah\nFace the music\n\nHey hey, we keep it running in the family\nHey hey, we keep it coming in the family\n\n[Chorus]\nLooking back, it's so bizarre\nIt runs in the family\nAll the things we are\nOn the back seat of the car\nWith Joseph and Emily\nWe only see so far\n'Cause we all have our daddy's eyes\nLooking back, it's so bizarre, whoa yeah\nRunning in the family\nRunning in the family\nAnd we all have our daddy's eyes\nLooking back, it's so bizarre, whoa yeah\nRunning
