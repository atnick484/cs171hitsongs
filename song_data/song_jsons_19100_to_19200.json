We\u2005give\u2005them medicine, we\u2005give them advice. And most of\u2005the time, we give them our undivided attention.\n\n(Alex, Lexie and\u205fa\u205fbunch\u205fof interns are\u205fin the elevator)\n\nMale\u205fIntern: I heard he saved a guy who coded yesterday, by himself.\n\nFemale Intern: He just knows things...never messes up in rounds, always has the answer.\n\nFemale Intern 2: And he's so calm. I'm always terrified, but he's, like, steady.\nMale Intern 2: Best intern ever.\n\nAlex: Hey, who are they talking about?\n\nLexie: George O'Malley.\n\nAlex: Seriously? Don't they know that he...\n\n(Lexie shhs him)\n\n(Alex exits the elevator where is)\n\nMVO: But by far the hardest thing you can give a patient is the truth.\n\nAlex: You know O'Malley's got these morons snowed? They don't even know he's a repeater.\n\nIzzie: Yeah, whatever.\n\n(Derek, Meredith and Cristina are in the same elevator)\n\nMeredith: Hey.\n\nDerek: Hey.\n\nMeredith: How are you today?\nDerek: Good.\n\nMeredith: Great.\n\nMVO: The truth is hard. The truth... is awkward. And very often...the truth hurts.\n\n(They all exit the elevator where Izzie is standing. Derek and Meredith walk away)\n\nIzzie: Damn it.\n\nMeredith: Bye.\n\nDerek: Bye.\n\nCristina: She's doing McDreamy. She's doing McDreamy and lying about it.\n\nIzzie: That's great.\n\nCristina: She thinks I'm weak, that I'm fragile. Like I can't handle it 'cause of Burke.\n\nIzzie: Poor Cristina. All alone.\n\nCristina: Damn right. Poor Cristina.\n\n(George finally exits the elevator)\nIzzie: George, what happened?\n\nMVO: I mean, people say they want the truth. But do they really?\n\n(Derek and Meredith have just finished having s*x in a supply closet)\n\nMeredith: Do I have s*x hair?\n\nDerek: Uh, if I did my job right.\n\nMeredith: You go ahead.\n\nDerek: What?\n\nMeredith: You go ahead. I'll wait a minute.\n\nDerek: So this isn't just breakup s*x. This is secret breakup s*x. Is this about cristina, this\n\nmorning in the elevator?\n\nMeredith: I don't know. I don't know what to do, you know? We don't talk about\n\nit, the whole Burke thing. I mean, I want to be a good friend. I want to take care of her. But you don't take care of Cristina.\n\nDerek: Okay, so by being with me you're cheating on Cristina?\n\nMeredith: Just, if she knew about you and me...\n\nDerek: You'd have to talk about it. You'd have to talk about you and me, and it'd be a long\n\nconversation, and there'd be no time left over to talk about her.\n\nMeredith: I told you, we don't talk about it.\n\n(Alex is at the nurse's station with his interns)\n\nAlex: Pierce, you're in the pit. James, need you in peds. Laura, you're on scut.\n\nLaura: I was on scut yesterday.\n\nAlex: Oh, and just for that, you're on scut tomorrow get lost.\n\n(Richard walks up)\n\nRichard: Dr. Karev, this is dr. Normal Shales.\n\nAlex: Hey.\n\nNorman: Oh, a strong handshake. That's a good sign.\n\nRichard: Norman is transferring in from UCLA. I want him to work with you.\n\nAlex: Oh, are you the new OBGYN guy?\n\nNorman: I don't have a specialty yet.\n\nRichard: Norman is an intern. You'll be his resident.\n\nAlex: He's my intern?\n\nNorman: Don't worry, son. This tugboat's ready to pull his own weight.\n\nRichard: Age is just a number, right, Norman.\n\nNorman: Absolutely.\n\nAlex: Pretty important number.\n\n(Meredith walks up to the nurses station where Cristina is)\n\nMeredith: Hey.\n\nCristina: Hey.\n\n(Cristina sounds sad)\n\nMeredith: You okay?\n\nCristina: I don't know. I think it's all just hitting me...you know, stupid Burke dumping me and then stupid mama coming to reclaim her...magic necklace.\n\nMeredith: Do you want to talk about it?\n\nCristina: No, not really, not... yet.\n\nMeredith: Okay. Well, if there's anything I can do...\n\nCristina: You know, I just wish I had a good, bloody surgery. You know, bloody surgeries make me feel better. One, two, three, four... follow me.\n\n(Mark, Richard Meredith and her interns enter Connie's room)\n\nElaine: Oh, Joanne, this is why you and I need to get sick, these doctors.\n\nJoanne: One's more handsome than the next.\n\nConnie: Oh, and here comes the handsomest one of them all. Hi, Dr. Webber.\n\nRichard: Connie.\n\nConnie: He took my appendix out three years ago. Barely left a scar. How's Adele?\n\nRichard: Um, oh, she's good, good. Uh, marriage is hard. Uh, but we're dating again. Uh, and she agreed to date me tonight...but, um...more...more importantly, how...how are you doing?\n\nConnie: Oh, I just had a little bump on my tongue removed is all. Couple of taste buds. Turns out it was a little touch of cancer. So I'm here to have the rest out. I mean, you know, the cancer, not the taste buds. I don't know exactly how bad it is because Dr. Sloan over there has been awfully quiet.\n\nJoanne: 'Cause you don't let him get a word in edgewise is why.\n\nRichard: Uh, how is she, Dr. Sloan?\n\nMark: Well, we just got back the pathology report. Connie, unfortunately, the cancer is a\n\nbit more widespread than we'd hoped. It's over 60% of your tongue.\n\nJoanne: Well, what... what does she do, chemo?\n\nMark: I think the, uh, best bet is a micro-vascular free flap. Dr. Grey?\n\nMeredith: Uh, he'll remove the cancerous part of the tongue, and then reconstruct it with a strip of flesh from your legs. George?\n\nGeorge: Uh, the extra flesh will provide the bulk your tongue needs to breathe properly, chew, swallow.\n\nConnie: And talk? Dr. Sloan...I'll be able to talk, won't I?\n\nMark: You will be able to talk, Connie. I just don't know how well you'll be understood.\n\nElaine: You'll be okay.\n\n(Alex and Norman enter the clinic)\n\nBailey: What are you doing in my clinic, Karev? I thought you didn't work in the clinic anymore.\n\nAlex: Oh, I don't, but I thought I could get my new intern Norman here settled in with you. Bailey's the best. You'll really learn from her.\n\nBailey: Oh, pleased to meet you. You want to leave Norman with me while you troll for surgeries.\n\nAlex: The dude's got a bum hip, and he smells like arthritis cream. He can't keep up. Come on. Do me a favor ,and I'll do you a favor.\n\nBailey: I'm calling in my favor now. Curtain five. You can take your intern and show him how we do an H&P. Nice to meet you, Norman.\n\nNorman: Thank you.\n\n(They walk over to curtain five)\n\nAlex: Hunter, uh, I'm Dr. Karev. This is Dr. Shales. What's, uh,what's going on?\n\nMrs. Chapman: My son is on drugs.\n\nHunter: I'm not on drugs, mom.\n\nMrs. Chapman: I wasn't born yesterday. I know the signs. He's lethargic, irritable, and the last two months, his schoolwork's gone down the drain.\n\nHunter: I'm not on drugs.\n\nAlex: Okay, there... there are a host of reasons why your son could be exhibiting those symptoms. Um, I think we should run some tests, see if there's any...\n\nMrs. Chapman: But first a drug test, Dr. Shales. I'm right to want a drug test.\n\nAlex: Yeah, I...I just said that...\n\nNorman: Mrs. Chapman, you are not wrong. My Mary Beth, god rest her soul, was just like you. When one of our kids started heading down that slippery slope, she just knew it. You have a mother's instinct. Right, Dr. Karev?\n\nAlex: Yeah, right.\n\n(Izzie drags George into really old guy's room)\n\nIzzie: Okay. What happened? George, it's really old guy. We could bring a marching band in here, and he wouldn't know the difference. What happened with Callie?\n\nGeorge: What happened? I...\n\nIzzie: I thought you were gonna tell her last night.\n\nGeorge: I tried, but she would not let me. She... she wouldn't let me. I wanted to kill her, but then I couldn't kill her because she did help me through a lot of stuff. And it was a lot of stuff and, you know, she did help me through it. But then I wanted to kill her again, because who marries someone who just buried their father? And then I went to bed.\n\nIzzie: So what does this mean?\n\n(Izzie's interns enter)\n\nIzzie: What do you guys want? I told you I needed a minute before rounds.\n\nIntern: We heard you saved a guy yesterday.\n\nGeorge: What?\n\nIzzie: Rounds.\n\nGeorge: Excuse me.\n\nIzzie: We'll start in here. Graciella, what can you tell us about really old guy?\n\nGraciella: He has a name.\n\nIzzie: I know he has a name. We call him really old guy. Catch up.\n\nGraciella: 82-year-old,semicomatose male, uh, came in a year ago, status post fall and is post-op day 352 from...\n\nIzzie: Which basically means that he hasn't woken up for a year. So what's the treatment plan?\n\n(They all hesitate)\n\nIzzie: It's really very simple. Daily labs and dialysis three times a week.\n\nReally Old Guy: Don't bother with any more dialysis. I plan to die today, so it won't be necessary. Nice to meet you. And while I think really old guy is charming, in a \"neglected patient\" kind of way, my name is Charlie. Charlie Yost.\n\n(Izzie is in Charlie's room. Alex and Meredith enter)\n\nMeredith: Hey, I just heard. Welcome back.\n\nAlex: Is it true? Really old guy woke up?\n\nIzzie: He has a name.\n\nCharlie: This time tomorrow, you can call me really dead guy.\n\nIzzie: Guys, I don't think Mr. Yost knows who you are.\n\nCharlie: Sure I do. That's Meredith. She and the brain doctor are always running hot and cold. And you're, uh, Alex. You still got a thing for that old patient of yours? I was semi-comatose, blondie. I could still hear you guys.\n\nIzzie: Get a CT, a CBC and chemistries. Your kidneys may be working again, which may be why you woke up. That's good news.\n\nCharlie: Oh, it just means now I got two things to do today, take a pee and die.\n\nIzzie: Nobody's dying.\n\n(Richard walks up to Mark who is at the nurse's station)\n\nRichard: Functional muscle transfer.\n\nMark: What?\n\nRichard: For Connie Williams. I was reading up on glossectomies and saw the procedure. Could micro-surgically re-innervate her hypo-glossal nerve.\n\nMark: A nerve graft? It's too risky. A free flap's still your best bet.\n\nRichard: Oh, even if that goes well, you and I both know she'll never speak the same. That woman loves to talk more than anyone I know.\n\n(George walks up)\n\nGeorge: What's a functional muscle transfer?\n\nRichard: You won't find it in the books, O'Malley. It's cutting-edge. You connect the nerves from the leg with the nerves from the tongue. Gives her a shot at really speaking.\n\nMark: If it works. They've only done a half a dozen of them.\n\nRichard: Better than none. Sometimes you gotta push the envelope, Sloan.\n\nGeorge: Why? Why is it better to do a surgery that neither of you have done than to do a surgery that you know at least gives her a chance to he a normal life? Do you know how to do this procedure?\n\nRichard: Are you saying that we're too old to learn new ways, O'Malley?\n\nGeorge: No.\n\nRichard: Are you saying we're old dogs who can't learn new tricks?\n\nGeorge: No, I just...\n\nMark: We're not old dogs.\n\nRichard: We still got it.\n\nGeorge: Okay.\n\nMark: I did do a functional muscle transfer to restore elbow function once.\n\nRichard: Elbow, tongue... that's pretty close. Come on. What do you say? Let's light this candle.\n\nMark: Yes, sir.\n\nRichard: Age is just a number, O'Malley.\n\nGeorge: Oh, yes, sir.\n\n(Bailey enters the room where Callis)\n\nBailey: I got Karev down in the clinic all day. Hope that's not a problem.\n\nCallie: Nope.\n\nBailey: I know how you like to be told these things, so I'm telling you.\n\nCallie: Thank you.\n\nBailey: Oh, he tried to dump a new intern on me... Karev. Clearly he's not interested in teaching.\n\n(George walks past the window)\n\nBailey: Thank you for letting me know.\n\n(Mark and Derek are in an office)\n\nMark: Do you ever feel old?\n\nDerek: I'm young. I'm a fetus.\n\nMark: Nah, I mean you ever feel like there's gonna be a time when new techniques pass you by?\n\nDerek: I'm a genius and a scholar.\n\nMark: Shut up.\n\nDerek: Meredith isn't telling Cristina about us. And, well, she tells Cristina everything.\n\nMark: I thought you broke that off.\n\nDerek: I meant to.\n\nMark: You think she's gonna want to get back together.\n\nDerek: No.\n\nMark: You think she's gonna grow up and get all whole and...want a relationship.\n\nDerek: I do not.\n\nMark: You're a bad liar.\n\nDerek: You're old.\n\nMark: I'm just gettin' started, my friend.\n\n(Meredith walks up to the nurse's station where Cristina is)\n\nMeredith: Hey. You feeling any better?\n\nCristina: I heard you're on that hemi-glossectomy.\n\nMeredith: The tongue surgery? Yeah.\n\nCristina: Oh, here I am stuck in the pit with those know-nothing interns. You'd think eventually I'd catch a break.\n\nMeredith: Cristina...are we ever gonna talk about this, the Burke thing?\n\nCristina: I'm not Izzie. I'm not gonna lie on the bathroom floor all day. I'm gonna lie here on the counter.\n\nMeredith: I'll trade you the hemi-glossectomy.\n\nCristina: What?\n\nMeredith: You take the hemi-glossectomy, and I will take the ER. And your interns.\n\nCristina: Are you sure?\n\nMeredith: Take the surgery if it makes you feel better. You're starting to freak me out.\n\n(Meredith walks away and Alex walks up)\n\nAlex: I saw the whole thing, Yang. You can stop pretending.\n\nCristina: Oh, I'm not pretending. I'm sad. I'm very sad. Me so sad.\n\nAlex: Maybe I should try it, see if I can get Grey to take my new intern.\n\nCristina: No. Hey, forget it. Sad is mine. Go find your own pretend emotion.\n\n(Charlie is yelling to Izzie who is outside his room)\n\nCharlie: Blondie! Hey, blondie.\n\nIzzie: Charlie...I have a million charts to update. I'm busy.\n\nCharlie: I want lobster.\n\nIzzie: What?\n\nCharlie: For my last meal. It's traditional. The dying man gets to choose what he wants to eat.\n\nI want lobster.\n\nIzzie: I'm not getting you lobster because you're not dying. I won't allow it.\n\nCharlie: A man can only hang on for so long, blondie. After a while, it's just not worth it.\n\nIzzie: Don't you have any friends, family, anyone?\n\nCharlie: They're all dead or on their way to dead. You'll understand someday when you're older, less naive.\n\nIzzie: I'm not naive.\n\nCharlie: You and what's his face, that's not naive?\n\nIzzie: I don't know what you're...we're not...he's not...you know about what's his face?\n\nCharlie: I know you're crazy if you think he's leaving his wife. Guys always say that.\n\nIzzie: Well, not that it's any of your business, but this is completely different.\n\nCharlie: I'm sure it's true love. I'm sure he's told his wife. I'm sure he's moved out. And I'm sure all your friends know, right?\n\nIzzie: Yeah.\n\nCharlie: By the way, I want real lobster, not that fake whitefish crap.\n\n(Meredith walks up to Lexie who is at a desk in the ER)\n\nMeredith: Hey, I'm filling in for Cristina. So how's it going?\n\nLexie: I pulled a splinter out of a guy's toe, and now I'm writing about it.\n\nMeredith: Okay. Well, if you have any questions...\n\nLexie: I have a lot of questions, just not about a splinter.\n\nMeredith: Okay.\n\nLexie: Okay.\n\n(Ambulance driver enters with gurney)\n\nAmbulance Driver: 40-year-old unrestrained driver in a rollover MVC\n\nMeredith: Trauma one.\n\nAmbulance Driver: Lost vitals on the scene, and we were unable to intubate.\n\nMeredith: Lexie, let's go. Open the intubation tray. How long's he been down?\n\nAmbulance Driver: Took ten minutes to load him,14 to get here, so 24.\n\nMeredith: Push another epi. You know how to intubate?\n\nLexie: Uh, I've never done it.\n\nMeredith: But you've seen it done?\n\nLexie: Yeah, a couple of times.\n\nMeredith: Okay, come do one now.\n\nLexie: Are you sure?\n\nMeredith: Visualize the cords, pull straight up, watch the tube go through the cords.\n\nLexie: I...I...I can't see the cords. You should do this.\n\nMeredith: Okay, you can do it. Just don't rock up against the teeth. Just pull straight up.\n\nNurse: Pulse ox is down to 86.\n\n(Meredith and Lexie are alone and the patient has obviously died)\n\nMeredith: That wasn't bad\n\nLexie: What\n\nMeredith: That wasn't bad for your first intubation.\n\nLexie: Is that some kind of joke? The guy is dead. He died.\n\nMeredith: He was dead when he came in here. He was dead on the scene. He was dead for 15 minutes in the ambulance. He was dead before I asked you to intubate.\n\nLexie: You're pretty cavalier, don't you think? I mean, they brought him here for help.\n\nMeredith: They brought him here because they're legally required to. And I had you intubate because I'm required to teach you, and that is how you learn.\n\nLexie: No. No, you should have done everything that you could.\n\nMeredith: That was everything I could.\n\nLexie: Well, what kind of doctor are you?\n\nMeredith: What is this about? If you don't want to learn from me, that's fine. But I have to cover the pit today. So why don't you do both of us a favor and go help Bailey in the clinic?\n\nLexie: Fine.\n\nMeredith: Fine.\n\n(Izzie sits down at a table with George)\n\nIzzie: Pretend I'm not here. Pretend I'm not busting in on you and pictures of... really disturbing tongues. But really old guy is giving me a hard time. I liked him so much better when he was sleeping, which he's not. He's awake. You've probably already heard. But my point is, is that he's stubborn. He's stubborn and really old, and he's telling me I'm an idiot for thinking yore gonna leave Callie. Seriously? We're in this together. You're gonna tell her tonight, right? George?\n\nGeorge: I...I...I have to get this research done.\n\nIzzie: You're not gonna tell her.\n\nGeorge: Wasn't it just yesterday when you said that you didn't want me to tell her?\n\nIzzie: Fine! Forget it. Just play with your stupid pictures of tongues.\n\n(Alex, and Norman go to talk to Mrs. Chapman)\n\nNorman: We got the tox screen back, Mrs. Chapman. Your son's not on drugs.\n\nMrs. Chapman: You're sure? There's no drugs in his system?\n\nNorman: No, came back clean. Your son is fine.\n\nMrs. Chapman: This is not my son, Dr. Shales. It's... not.\n\nAlex: Maybe we should order some more tests.\n\nNorman: You know, he's a teenager. I've raised four of 'em myself. Teenagers don't like to do their homework, they talk back to their parents, and they never come out of their rooms.\n\nHunter: You have apple hair. I threw a pancake in the river, a pancake!\n\nMrs. Chapman: Hunter...\n\nAlex: Do you know what you just said?\n\nHunter: I'm... I'm not sure.\n\nAlex: Did you mean to say it?\n\nHunter: No, I...I was trying to say that I wanted to go home.\n\nMrs. Chapman: Oh, my god.\n\nAlex: Yeah, we need to do a full neuro exam. Order a head CT and labs, now.\n\n(Connie Williams room)\n\nJoanne: It's gonna be okay, you know? It is. It's gonna be okay.\n\nConnie: Do you think so?\n\nJoanne: Dr. Sloan's gonna do this fancy new surgery. Maybe you'll make it into the medical journals. Maybe be famous.\n\nConnie: What if the surgery doesn't work? What if this is my last chance to talk? I still have so much to say.\n\nElaine: Say it now, Connie.\n\nJoanne: Don't be so morbid. The surgery will work. You'll be fine.\n\nElaine: She should say it all now, Jo, just in case. She shouldn't have any more regrets. You can tell us anything, Connie. We're your best friends.\n\nGeorge: You should tell them. I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry. But if you have something you\n\nwant to say, you should say it. I've been here a while. I've been here long enough to know that things don't always go the way that you want them to, and if there's something you want to say, you should say it.\n\nConnie: Joanne, you've gotta stop wearing those pants.\n\nJoanne: What?\n\nConnie: Those pants make your ass look like two puppies are struggling to get out.\n\nAs a matter of fact, all of your pants are too tight. You have to buy some new pants. And, Elaine, your breath is god-awful.\n\nElaine: My breath?\n\nConnie: I mean, you need to see a doctor or something because I know you have good hygiene, but sweet god, your breath is bad. And you've got to get a new hairdo. The '80s are over, honey.\n\n\n\n(Izzie enters Charlie's room, Tyler is there)\n\nIzzie: What now?\n\nTyler: He keeps pulling off his monitor leads. I told him he can pull 'em off all day, he's still not gonna die.\n\nCharlie: I'm sick and tired of waiting.\n\nIzzie: Yeah? Well, I'm sick and tired of coming to your room every five minutes.\n\nCharlie: Sorry, blondie. It's time I took things into my own hands.\n\nIzzie: Oh, you know what? You want to die? Fine. Here. Let me help you. You missed this one. Damn. You're still with us. Oh, wait. This looks promising. A nice, thick wire. How's that? Any luck? No? Well, no wonder. That's why. It's attached to this lamp. okay. Well, let's see what else we got.\n\nTyler: Dr. Stevens.\n\nIzzie: What?\n\nTyler: Dr. Stevens, he's not breathing.\n\nIzzie: What?\n\nTyler: He doesn't have a pulse. He's in cardiac arrest.\n\nIzzie: I swear to god, I didn't do anything.\n\n(Izzie, Tyler and the crash team are trying to revive Charlie)\n\nIzzie: Are the epi and atropine in?\n\nTyler: Epi's in. I'm pushing atropine now.\n\nIzzie: Hold CPR, let's see what happens.\n\nTyler: Looks like v-fib.\n\nIzzie: Charge the paddles,300. Clear.\n\nTyler: No change.\n\nIzzie: Charge again. Clear.\n\nDoctor: I've got a pulse.\n\nIzzie: Charlie? Charlie?\n\nCharlie: Stop saving my life.\n\n(George is walking through the hall with Connie on her way to surgery)\n\nConnie: I can't believe I said all that. Do you believe I said all that?\n\nGeorge: Not really, no.\n\nConnie: You think I hurt their feelings? I mean, real bad hurt their feelings? You think they'll forgive me? You told me. You told me to tell them. You told me to say everything. You said it would be okay.\n\nGeorge: I'm really sorry.\n\n(Lexie enters the clinic and walks over to Bailey)\n\nLexie: Dr. Bailey, Dr. Grey sent me down here to work with you.\n\nBailey: Oh, she did, did she? And why is that?\n\nLexie: Truthfully? Uh, she didn't want to work with me anymore. She kicked me out.\n\nBailey: You can go and tell Dr. Grey that the clinic is not a dumping ground for strays. We are not the island of broken interns. Please go tell her that.\n\nLexie: Please don't make me do that. I...I can't work with her, with Meredith Grey. I...I...I can't work with her because I can't look at her. 'Cause she hates me, she hates my dad, she obviously hated my mother, and I am...please just...just let me work down here today. Please, Dr. Bailey.\n\nBailey: Kid in curtain three needs stitches. Go.\n\n(Derek enters the CT examining room where Alex and Norman are looking at Hunter's CT)\n\nDerek: Okay, what do you got, Karev?\n\nAlex: A teenager came in...the clinic this morning, he was lethargic, irritable, dysphasic.\n\nDerek: Right. I'm sorry. I don't know you.\n\nNorman: Uh, Norman Shales, up from UCLA.\n\nDerek: Are you neuro? I thought I knew all the neuro guys down there.\n\nAlex: Norman's an intern, Dr. Shepherd. My intern.\n\nDerek: Welcome to the program.\n\nNorman: Thank you.\n\nDerek: Good. Okay, what do we got? Oh, look at this. Kid's got hydrocephalus. It's pushing up against his Broca's area. Yeah, which explains the screwed up speech.\n\nNorman: I was sure it was drugs. Well, that's what happens when you're...you're a pharmacist for 30 years. You're sure that everybody's hooked on pills or reefer.\n\nDerek: Right.\n\nNorman: I won't make that mistake again. No, sirree.\n\nDerek: Right. Okay. Um, we need to put in a shunt. Yeah, schedule an OR. Then we'll go talk to Hunter and his mom.\n\nNorman: Will do, captain.\n\n(Norman leaves the room)\n\nAlex: Guy doesn't know when to shut up. He does it with the patients, too.\n\nDerek: Well, you're his resident.\n\nAlex: I know, I know, but it'd be like yelling at my grandfather.\n\n(Cristina walks up to Izzie who is at the nurse's station.)\n\nCristina: Hey. I heard about really old guy. What's the matter? Couldn't find his LVAD wire?\n\nIzzie: It was a coincidence, and he's still alive.\n\nCristina: Well, have fun with really old guy. I'm off to do Meredith's... hemi-glossectomy.\n\n(Cristina walks away and Meredith walks up)\n\nIzzie: Oh, hey. Hey, has George said anything to you...\n\nMeredith: She's faking. She's faking sadness, pretending to be sad to steal my surgeries.\n\nIzzie: Okay, I have a really old guy trying to kill himself and problems of my own. So I don't have time for the two of you and your fake drama.\n\n(Izzie is in Charlie's room)\n\nCharlie: A person wants to die, you let them. It's polite.\n\nIzzie: Not in a hospital, it's not. In a hospital, it's a lawsuit.\n\nCharlie: I don't like you.\n\nIzzie: Really? 'Cause I thought we were BFFs.\n\nCharlie: You know what? Just for that, I'm dying right now.\n\n(Charlie strains really hard)\n\nIzzie: That might make you poop your pants, but it's not gonna make you die.\n\nCharlie: Oh, damn it.\n\nIzzie: You really think he's not gonna leave his wife?\n\nCharlie: I think if a person wants to do something, like die, they do it. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's hope. Maybe he'll tell her, and you two will get together and end up happy.\n\nIzzie: You think?\n\nCharlie: Not that I'll be alive to see it.\n\nIzzie: You're not dying, Charlie. Not on my watch.\n\nCharlie: Dead man walking.\n\nIzzie: I don't see much walking, Charlie.\n\n(Bailey enters the room where Callie still sitting)\n\nBailey: Uh, you know Yang and Grey are playing musical chairs with their interns?\n\nCallie: Oh?\n\nBailey: I mean, I just thought that might interest you, seeing as how one of Yang's interns\n\nis actually one of Grey's relatives...and the two Grey's are having some kind of family feud.\n\nI'm just saying, it would probably be best if the residents stuck with their own interns in the future.\n\nCallie: Yeah. I got it. Thanks.\n\nBailey: You plan to hide out in here all day long, or you plan to emerge at some point and do your job?\n\nCallie: Why would I come out there to do my job when you clearly do it so much better? I'm doing paperwork, Miranda, because I don't have any more fight in me. I...I don't want to fight\n\nyou. I don't fight my...I...I don't...I don't want to fight today. So...I'm doing paperwork. Okay?\n\n(Mark and Richard are in Connie's surgery)\n\nMark: The graft's a perfect fit.\n\nRichard: It's got good vascularization.\n\nMark: And at this rate, you may actually get to go on that date with Adele.\n\nRichard: Yeah, I better. Can't very well have her take me back if I cancel our first date.\n\nGeorge: Where you taking her, chief?\n\nRichard: Oh, there's a nice little Chinese restaurant we like to go to.\n\nMark: Hmm.\n\nCristina: What happens next?\n\nRichard: Dr. Sloan, I don't...\n\nMark: I know.\n\nGeorge: Is everything okay\n\nMark: Um...we're not sure.\n\nGeorge: What does that mean?\n\nMark: It means we've never done this before.\n\n(They are still trying to figure out how to proceed with Connie's surgery)\n\nRichard: What about if we coapt the lingual nerve underneath here?\n\nMark: No, we'd end up losing the vascular supply. The graft might not work at all.\n\nRichard: She likes to talk, Sloan. She likes to talk a lot.\n\nMark: We need an extra set of hands. Someone who knows nerves.\n\nRichard: O'Malley, get Dr. Shepherd.\n\nGeorge: Yes, sir.\n\n(George is walking in the hall with Derek)\n\nDerek: A functional muscle transfer of the tongue?\n\nGeorge: It was looking good for a while, but, um...\n\n(Derek walks toward the OR and George sees Izzie)\n\nGeorge: I'll be right there.\n\nDerek: Yeah.\n\n(George enters a conference room with Izzie)\n\nGeorge: Izzie...\n\nIzzie: What? What is there to say, George, I'm a blondie. I'm the other woman. I'm a bad '50s clich'?\n\nGeorge: No, no, no. We're not in this together.\n\nIzzie: Wow. Great. Well, thank you for letting me know.\n\nGeorge: Hey no, no. No. You don't get to be mad here.\n\nIzzie: Seriously? We said...\n\nGeorge: No, no, no, no. There is no \"we. \" It's just me. I'm the one who has to tell Callie. I'm\n\nthe one who has to destroy her. This is not about you and me. This is about her and me. I'm ending a marriage to a wonderful woman. Me. I'm the one. It's not you. You... it's not something you just blurt out. It's not. I'll do it. I will do it. You have to back off and let me do it.\n\nIzzie: I'm sorry.\n\n(Bailey and Meredith are walking in the ER together)\n\nBailey: You traded...a hemi-glossectomy for the pit?\n\nMeredith: It's a long story.\n\nBailey: A long story that ends with you pawning off Lexie Grey on me?\n\nMeredith: I had her do an intubation on a dead guy. It's something you used to have us do all the time. I was trying to teach her. Whatever she told you...\n\nBailey: She told me you hate her.\n\nMeredith: I don't...\n\nBailey: And that you hated her mother...\n\nMeredith: I didn't say that.\n\nBailey: Her mother, who came to you with a case of hiccups and died in our hospital. Do you see where I'm going with this?\n\nMeredith: She's not my intern.\n\nBailey: No, she's your sister, and you haven't had a kind word to say to her since she got here. And you were her mother's doctor. Now what is she supposed to think? Look, whether you like it or not, your job is to help that girl be a better doctor. So help her.\n\n(Izzie walks up to Tyler)\n\nIzzie: You paged me?\n\nTyler: Really old guy...He's checked out AMA. He's leaving the hospital.\n\nIzzie: What? He can't leave. He's sick. He can barely walk, and I got him lobster.\n\n(Alex enters the clinic to find Hunter on the floor)\n\nAlex: I got a 911.What happened?\n\nNurse: He collapsed.\n\nMrs. Chapman: He started talking that nonsense talk and...\n\nAlex: His pupil's blown. His brain's starting to herniate. Page shepherd. Norman, take over the bag. We gotta get him up on the bed.\n\nMrs. Chapman: What's happening?\n\nAlex: Count of three. One, two, three.\n\nMrs. Chapman: What's happening to my son?\n\nAlex: Spinal fluid's backing up. It's putting pressure on his brain.\n\nNurse: Shepherd's not answering his page.\n\nAlex: Try it again.\n\n(Bailey walks up)\n\nAlex: What do I do?\n\nBailey: Uh, hyperventilation... mannitol... I don't know everything. Go. Get Shepherd. Go.\n\n(Alex runs to and enters Connie's OR)\n\nAlex: Dr. Shepherd.\n\nDerek: I'm a little busy right now making medical history, Karev.\n\nAlex: Hunter Chapman's brain is herniating. His right pupil just blew.\n\nDerek: Okay, you need to do exactly what I say, or that kid's gonna be dead in the next ten minutes. Can you do that?\n\nAlex: Yes, sir.\n\nDerek: Okay, get the biggest needle you can find.\n\n(Alex runs into the hall, grabs a needle then runs over to Hunter)\n\nMrs. Chapman: Dr. Karev, what's going on?\n\nBailey: Where's Shepherd?\n\nMrs. Chapman: Dr. Karev\n\nNorman: I...I think it might help Mrs. Chapman...\n\nMrs. Chapman: What are you doing?\n\nAlex: Get her out of here.\n\nNorman: Well, she is the boy's mom.\n\nAlex: Get her out of here, Norman. Get her out!\n\nMrs. Chapman: What are you doing?\n\nNorman: Mrs. Chapman, he's trying to help.\n\n(Norman moves Mrs. Chapman from the bedside)\n\nMrs. Chapman: What are you doing?\n\nBailey: What are you doing?\n\nAlex: Hold his head. Shepherd told me what to do.\n\n(Alex sticks the needle in behind Hunter's eye)\n\n(Izzie enters Charlie's room)\n\nIzzie: Charlie...you can't go. I know that you think your life is over. I know you feel like\n\nyou don't have anybody. But your life's not over and...and you have me. You have me. I need you. I need somebody to talk to. Because I think you may have been right before. I don't think George is gonna leave his wife. And I need you to tell me what to do. I...I need some...you can't go, Charlie. Charlie? (She walks over to him and finds that he has died) Charlie? Crap.\n\n(Alex and Mrs. Chapman are at Hunter's side)\n\nMrs. Chapman: All this time he was telling me the truth\n\nAlex: Once we get the shunt in, any excess spinal fluid will drain to his abdomen. He's gonna be okay. Excuse me.\n\n(Alex walks over to Norman)\n\nAlex: I'm sorry I unloaded on you, Norman. You know how it is? Heat of the moment.\n\nBailey: Don't apologize to him.\n\nAlex: What?\n\nNorman: Oh, Dr. Bailey's right. It...\n\nBailey: Shut up, Norman. I'm not talking to you. He got in your way. He's been doing it all day, and when that happens...when an intern gets in the way of a resident...you're not doing what's\n\nbest for your patient. Now you almost missed diagnosing that kid today because Norman here thought it was drugs. So don't apologize. He should be yelled at.\n\nAlex: Dr. Bailey... he's as old as the hills.\n\nBailey: I don't care how old he is, Dr. Karev. He's still an intern, and interns are basically teenagers. We are not hard on them because it's fun. We're hard on them because this is a life-and-death job. They need to learn that. There is a reason why we have a pecking order in a hospital. It saves lives.\n\n(Mark, Derek and Richard are in the scrub room cleaning up from the surgery)\n\nMark: I think that woman's gonna be able to talk for the rest of her life thanks to us.\n\nRichard: I think I still got it.\n\nMark: I think you do, too. Now we just gotta figure out what you're gonna tell Adele.\n\nRichard: Oh, man. I forgot about that.\n\nMark: Yeah. First off, don't tell her you want to move back in.\n\nRichard: No?\n\nMark: Reeks of desperation. It's a deal breaker. Trust me.\n\nDerek: You know what? I can't take this anymore. You guys are kidding yourselves. You know how close you idiots came to that woman losing her tongue, to her never speaking again? Oh, yeah, you were a couple of cowboys in there, telling yourselves you can do this, acting like the big boys. You had no business doing that surgery. No business. Lucky I came in when I did. Shame on you. And shame on you. As for Adele, tell her you can't imagine your life without her. Tell her for the last month you been walking around this hospital at night just thinking about her.\n\nTell her the truth. I'm sorry I called you an idiot.\n\n(Derek leaves the scrub room)\n\n(Meredith walks up to Cristina in the hall)\n\nMeredith: Hey. So I've been thinking about how you're sad, and what I can do to help.\n\nCristina: Oh, you have another surgery?\n\nMeredith: No, that's not what you need.\n\nCristina: Well, it kind of is.\n\nMeredith: No, what you need is me and my time. So I thought we could go back to my house and get into our pajamas. Just sit and talk about this whole Burke thing and really get to the root of your feelings. Just talk all night long if we have to.\n\nCristina: Talk.\n\nMeredith: Talk...and cry. Cry.\n\nCristina: You know.\n\nMeredith: You're damn right I know, surgery stealer.\n\nCristina: So, person-who-is-sleeping-with-Derek?\n\nMeredith: How'd you know that?\n\nCristina: What, you think I'm too fragile to handle your s*x life?\n\nMeredith: Well, he did leave you at the altar. And I'm your person.\n\nCristina: How, by...by \"protecting me\"? That's not how to be my person. That's not what we do. You know that. I'm dealing. Okay? The best I can. So if you need to take care of someone, you're gonna need to take care of someone else. Okay?\n\nMeredith: Fine. But you owe me a surgery.\n\nCristina: Yeah, well, you owe me s*x details.\n\n(Alex walks up)\n\nAlex: Are we doing this or not?\n\n(They all enter Charlie's room)\n\nCristina: What are we supposed to say? We didn't even know the guy.\n\nIzzie: We ate lunch in here for a year. The least we can do is say a few kind words about him.\n\nGeorge: Me? He...he didn't snore too loudly...\n\nMeredith: He, um... never complained. And he always took his meds.\n\nAlex: Hardly ever farted.\n\nMeredith: Alex.\n\nAlex: Fine. Uh, he had 12 surgeries this year, and he...he lived through them. That's...that's impressive.\n\nIzzie: Thank you, Alex. Cristina?\n\nCristina: Uh, I got to practice stuff on him...central lines and IVs...it was good practice.\n\nIzzie: Um...Charlie, the truth is...you were a b*st*rd. You were. You were mean and stubborn and just...a b*st*rd. But you were a b*st*rd who knew what you wanted. And you stuck to your guns and proved that if you want something badly enough, if you're...determined enough and patient enough, eventually it will happen. It will. And that gives me hope, so...thanks for that. Bye-bye, Charlie.\n\nMVO: The truth is painful...\n\n(George is in Connie's room)\n\nGeorge: It went really well. Your friends, uh...I am so sorry. I haven't seen them.\n\n(Joanne and Elaine enter)\n\nJoanne: How'd she do?\n\nGeorge: Great. She did great.\n\nJoanne: She's gonna talk again?\n\nGeorge: Yeah, the chances are very good.\n\nJoanne: In that case, we have a few things we'd like to say.\n\nyour first husband, he put his hand on my ass every chance he got.\n\nElaine: And your second husband, he spat when he talked, and plus, he was ugly. We know that you thought he was handsome, but the man was a troll.\n\nJoanne: And that guy you dated last year, comb-over guy...Oh, my god.\n\nMVO: Deep down, nobody wants to hear it, especially when it hits close to home.\n\n(Meredith walks up to Lexie who is in the clinic)\n\nLexie: What?\n\nMeredith: I have your mother's death note here. Everything that happened on the day she died is in here, and I know because I wrote it. So, I'd like to go over with you if that's okay.\n\nLexie: Yeah.\n\nMeredith: Ok first of all let me just say that everything that happened that day every set back there was one percent chance of each of those things happening one percent and your mother was the one percent. She came in complaining of persisting hiccups. We did an endoscopy out of obligation.\n\nLexie: You did an endoscopy?\n\nMeredith: So it would be out-patient procedure, we wanted to avoid major surgery. For what it's worth I was very fond of your mother. She was...I was very fond of her. She got bacterial endocarditis.\n\nMVO: Sometimes we tell the truth because the truth is all we have to give.\n\n(Bailey enters the room where Callie still is)\n\nBailey: I've been having trouble with this whole pecking order of things it's...I've been having trouble cause I'm used to be a number one. But I am not number one, not any more. So the best I can come up with is to be number two. The best damn number two this hospital has ever seen But your number two. I will... I will help you. We'll be like a team. Because...look, girl, you just seem to be having a hard time and I know I am having a hard time but together...we could... do this. I just think we can do this together.\n\nMVO: Sometimes we tell the truth because we need to say aloud to really hear for ourselves.\n\n(Ale, Lexie, George and some interns are in the elevator)\n\nFemale Intern: You got to reattach the woman's tongue.\n\nGeorge: I was there, I didn't actually do the reattaching.\n\nMale Intern: Still you are the intern they wanted on that case.\n\nAlex: He is a repeater.\n\nMale Intern: What?\n\nAlex: Your big hero here, he was an intern last year. That's why he got to know some of the stuff. He's already been through it. But if you want learn from someone really, really learn, go to a resident, not this dude.\n\nGeorge: All right, he's right if you want to emulate someone, it's definitely not me. I'm not that guy.\n\nMVO: And sometimes we tell the truth because we just can't help ourselves.\n\n(Norman stares at Alex)\n\nAlex: What the hell are you looking at? Interns.\n\nMVO: And sometimes we tell them because...we owe them at least that much\n\n(George enters the hotel room where Callie is)\n\nCallie: Just say it.\n\nGeorge: I slept with Izzie.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/467039", "artist_names": "South Park (Ft.

He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.\n\nStan:\tSparky, bad dog!\nKenny:\t(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)\n\nStan:\tWhat?!\n\nCartman:\tYeah dude, I think your dog is gay.\n\nStan:\tWhat do you mean?\n\nCartman:\tThat dog is a gay homosexual.\n\nStan:\t[looks back to study the situation, then...] He's just confused.\n\nKyle:\tI think the other dog's the one that's confused.\n\nKenny:\t(No, check his penis) [Kyle smiles]\n\nStan:\tSick, shut up dude. [Sparky pants happily while Sylvester slinks away]\n\nCartman:\tStan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo. [the bus pulls up]\n\n[Football Field, sideline]\nChef:\tOkay children, I know that you're all extremely excited and nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against the Middle Park.\n\nKyle:\tWho's Middle Park?\n\nCartman:\tWhat's homecoming?\nChef:\tBut just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. [Silence] Now, let's start practice. [blows his whistle, and the kids hit the field]\n\nPip:\tUh, Mr. Chef sir?\n\nChef:\tYes Pip, what is it?\n\nPip:\tWell, I still don't have a helmet.\n\nChef:\tI know Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.\n\nPip:\tYes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?\n\nChef:\tYes Pip, I'm afraid it does.\n\nPip:\tOh.\n\nChef:\tSorry son, now get your ass in there.\n\n[On the playing field]\nStan:\tHut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.\n\nChef:\t[impatiently] Hike the damn ball! [Cartman hikes the ball over Stan's head. Stan chases it down. Kyle runs into Pip, opening a major gash on Pip's head.]\n\nPip:\tAaaaaaaargh!\n\nJimbo:\t[arriving with Ned] Hey, how's practice coming there Chef?\n\nChef:\t[distracted] Huh? Oh fine, fine.\n\nJimbo:\tI don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park Alumni.\n\nChef:\tElementary school alumni?\n\nJimbo:\tThat's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?\n\nChef:\tI don't know. Wha- what's the spread?\n\nJimbo:\tMiddle Park by 70 points.\n\nChef:\tHmmm. [looks towards the field, where Kenny tackles Cartman, causing him to drop the ball] I don't think we have a chance.\n\nJimbo:\tNonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. Right Stanley?\n\nStan:\t[turning to see his uncle just as Cartman hikes] Huh? [the ball hits him on the side of the head. He picks it up and throws to Kyle]\n\nJimbo:\tThatta boy.\n\nChef:\tGreat pass Stan.\n\nJimbo:\tCome on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie.\n\n[On sideline after practice]\nChef:\tOkay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.\n\nKyle:\tHey Stan, isn't that your dog?\n\nStan:\tYeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.\n\nClyde:\tAh, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.\n\nStan:\tYeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- [Sees Sparky lunge after Rex] Sparky, get down!\n\nClyde:\tOh my God! What is he doing to my dog?\n\nCartman:\tThere he goes again.\n\nStan:\tGet down Sparky! Down!\n\nCartman:\tStan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.\n\nClyde:\tMake him stop!\n\nRex:\t[moving away with his tail between his legs] Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!\n\nFosse:\t[passes by laughing, with Bill] I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.\n\nBill:\tYeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.\nFosse:\tGay dog. [The bullies walk away laughing, while Sparky walks up panting]\n\n[Mr. Garrison's Classroom. Football practice must have been in the morning]\nCartman:\t...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.\n\nMr. Garrison:\tThank you for that presentation Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a \"D-\".\n\nCartman:\tAh, dammit!\n\nMr. Garrison:\tWho should we call on next Mr. Hat?\n\nMr. Hat:\tWell, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?\n\nMr. Garrison:\tOh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next.\n\nStan:\tUm, I'm not really prepared either.\n\nMr. Garrison:\tWell, just make something up, like Eric did.\n\nStan:\tOkay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-\n\nMr. Garrison:\tExcellent. \"A-\".\n\nCartman:\tEeyy!\n\nStan:\tWow, cool!\n\nCartman:\tWait a minute, why the hell does he get an \"A-\"?\n\nMr. Garrison:\tEric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better 'cause they're better people.\n\nCartman:\tThat's not fair!\n\nMr. Hat:\tLife isn't fair kiddo, get used to it.\n\nCartman:\tStupid puppet. [Dismissal bell rings]\n\nMr. Garrison:\tDon't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan.\n\nStan:\t[as everyone leaves] Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?\n\nMr. Garrison:\tWell of course Stanley, what is it?\n\nStan:\tWhat's a - homosexual?\n\nMr. Garrison:\tHoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down. [Stan sits] Stanley, gay people... well- gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Naziesque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?\n\nStan:\tI guess.\n\nMr. Garrison:\tGood, I'm glad we could have this little talk Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.\n\n[Bus stop. The kids get off the bus]\nCartman:\tYou guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.\n\nKyle:\tYou're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.\n\nCartman:\tHey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.\n\nStan:\tShut up dude! [Sparky comes up panting with a pink scarf on] Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?\n\nSparky:\tBark, bark.\n\nCartman:\tMan, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.\n\nStan:\tHe just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky. [Sparky sits] Good boy, now shake. [Sparky shakes.] Goood boy. Now, don't be gay. [waiting for the command to sink in] Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. [Sparky looks at Stan with confusion and growls]\n\nKyle:\tDid it work?\n\nStan:\tI don't know.\n\nCartman:\tHe still looks pretty gay to me.\n\nBill:\tHuh, huh.\n\nFosse:\tHey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?\n\nBill:\tHuh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbara Streisand concert. [They laugh] Stupid little gay dog.\n\nFosse:\tGay dog.\n\nStan:\tCome on you guys, I have an idea.\n\n[Sports Book, Ned and Jimbo enter. Two big-screen monitors show horse races. One of the five smaller screens above show a race as well]\n\nJimbo:\tI want $500 on the South Park Cows.\n\nBookie:\tAre you crazy?\n\nJimbo:\tNo siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.\n\nGambler 1:\tI want to put all my money on the Cows.\n\nGambler 2:\tDuh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too.\n\nGambler 3:\tHey, I want to put some money on the Cows too.\n\nFemale Gambler 1:\tI got 500 on the Cows.\n\nFemale Gambler 2:\tWell, I'll put my money on the Cows.\n\nJimbo:\tWhoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now...\n\nGambler 4:\tYou better be right about this Jimbo.\n\nJimbo:\tHehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself.\n\nNed:\tAre you sure Stan is that good?\n\nJimbo:\tNot that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?\n\nBookie:\tYou haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.\n\nNed:\tI love that song.\n\nJimbo:\t'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.\n\n[In front of Stan's house, a large crate sits next to the kids.]\nStan:\tOkay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't- [notices a pink scarf on Sparky] Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?! [grabs the scarf] No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. [the crate opens and Fifi, a French poodle, comes out]\n\nKyle:\tOolala [Fifi sniffs some. Sparky starts following her]\n\nCartman:\tThere he goes.\n\nStan:\tAtta boy Spark, get her. [Sparky goes for it] Yes! [Sparky throws Fifi's collar into the air, catching it on his neck.] Ah crap! Now what do I do?\n\nKyle:\tWho cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.\n\nCartman:\tNo way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.\n\nKenny:\t(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)\n\nStan:\tI know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.\n\nKyle:\tWell, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.\n\nStan:\tLike who?\n\n[Inside Stan's house, Jesus and Pals' title screen is on TV]\nTV Announcer:\tAnd now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.\n\nJesus:\tYea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. [Beep]\n\nRobert:\tYeah, is, is this Jesus?\n\nJesus:\tYes my son.\n\nRobert:\tThis, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife.\n\nJesus:\tOf course Robert. How are things now?\n\nRobert:\tWell, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since. I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins, that was really nice of you.\n\nJesus:\tBlessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air.\n\n[Beep]\n\nStan:\tUh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.\n\nJesus:\tMy son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-\n\nTV Announcer:\t[the station's logo pops up] That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews.\n\nStan:\tDamn it!\n\nKyle:\tWhat'd he say?\n\nStan:\tI got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.\n\nCartman:\tOh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!\n\nStan:\tIsn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?\n\nKyle:\tCome on dude, we have to get to practice.\n\nStan:\tNo, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog! [outside, Sparky overhears this] I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! [Sparky grouses, digs a hole, and makes his way out of the yard. He wanders into the mountains, looks back once more, and is gone]\n\n[On the sideline at practice]\nChef:\tNow children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover. [Music starts] Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! [Sinks into the mood.]\nJust like makin' sweet love to the football.\nFeelin' naughty with the football.\nMmmm.\n\nKyle:\tUh, Chef?\n\nChef:\tSpank it, ever so gently.\n\nKyle:\tChef.\n\nChef:\tSpank it.\n\nKyle:\tChef!\n\nChef:\tOh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.\n\nPip:\tUh, Mr. Chef sir?\n\nChef:\tNo Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.\n\nPip:\tRighto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?\nChef:\tThat wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?\n\nPip:\tNo um, I guess not.\n\n[Carl's Bomb's And Explosives and Accessories]\nJimbo:\tWhat we'll have to do here Carl is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.\n\nCarl:\tWhat moment would that be?\n\nJimbo:\tWell, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.\n\nCarl:\tWhat high F?\n\nJimbo:\tYou know, Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah\n\nCarl:\tRight, right, so you want the trigger on the doo-nn-doo?\n\nJimbo:\tNo, dammit!

You of all people should be sympathetic.\n\nMr. Garrison:\tWhat do you mean?\n\nChef:\tWell, you're gay aren't you?\n\nMr. Garrison:\tWhat?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.\n\nChef:\tWell, you sure do act like it.\n\nMr. Garrison:\tI just act that way to get chicks, dumb ass. [Chef looks puzzled, wondering]\n\n[On the field]\nKyle:\t[running up from behind] What's the matter dude?\n\nStan:\tI don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.\n\nCartman:\tMaybe he went shopping for some leather pants. [Stan punches him] Ow!\n\n[Snowy mountains. Sparky is trekking through the snow, stops, and looks around. A floating castle nears him. It's Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary]\nBig Gay Al:\tHello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al. [Sparky looks at him] Have you been outcast? [Sparky pants an affirmative] Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us? [Sparky pants an affirmative] Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here.\n\n[Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman are at the Bus Stop. Stan walks up]\nStan:\tHave you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.\n\nKyle:\tWow, it's been like two days.\n\nStan:\tI think he might've run away.\n\nCartman:\tDid you check the shopping ma- [Stan punches him] Ow!\n\nKyle:\tWe'll help you look for him after the game Stan.\n\nStan:\tI'm not playing.\n\nKyle:\tYou what?!\n\nStan:\tI'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog.\n\n[leaves]\n\n[Middle Park Elementary School]\nJimbo:\t[Whispering] Come on Ned, and keep quiet.\n\nNed:\t[Louder] Okay [They climb over the fence and approach the Middle Park mascot, a horse]\n\nJimbo:\tHello there, Enrique.\n\nNed:\tWhat are we doing here?\n\nJimbo:\tWell Ned, we always kidnapped Middle Park's mascot. But this year we're gonna booby-trap it instead. [puts bomb on Enrique's back] And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in Loving You, Boom! [Enrique gets wide-eyed] No more Middle Park players. [Enrique starts to tremble]\n\nNed:\tHahahahaha. Hahahahaha.\n\nJimbo:\t[laughs] God damn, I love football!\n\n[Stormy mountains]\nStan:\tSparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?\n\n[South Park Elementary.]\nCowboys:\t[exiting the bus] Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!\n\n[South Park Football Field.

Even Ike is wearing a GO COWS shirt and bouncing about.]\nFrank Hammond:\tHello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows. [pounds the table, and Phil's mike falls over. He scans the sidelines] Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up.\n\nChef:\t[between his teeth] Oohh, come on Stan.\n\nPip:\tUh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?\n\nChef:\tNo Pip, I'm sorry!\n\n[Stormy mountains]\nStan:\tSparky!

[Middle Park's mascot is shown] They've got Enrique on their sideline, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.\n\nNed:\tYay.\n\n[Stan follows his dog's footprints and finds himself facing Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary]\nBig Gay Al:\tHi little fella, how are you doing today?\n\nStan:\tFine, how are you?\n\nBig Gay Al:\tI'm super, thanks for asking.\n\nStan:\tMy gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.\n\nBig Gay Al:\tWell, let's see. Come on in. Hmm. [they enter]\n\nStan:\tD'you have lots of gay dogs here?\n\nBig Gay Al:\tWe have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion. [and three gay bunnies]\n\nGay Lion:\tRooaar\n\nBig Gay Al:\tAnd we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!\n\nStan:\tWow, seems like the animals here are really happy.\n\nBig Gay Al:\tOf course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Would you like to dance?\n\n[They enter the techno-dance floor as disco music plays. Animals pour in to dance, even a dolphin on its tail]\n\nVocalist:\tOww, we can both be gay!\n\n[In the huddle. The Cows win the coin toss]\n\nKyle:\tCartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something.

[Cartman farts long and nasty. Kyle quickly retreats] Damn it Cartman!\n\nChef:\tWhat's the matter?\n\nKyle:\tCartman farted!\n\nCartman:\tNo I didn't. That was just my shoes.\n\nChef:\tCome on, Cows. We'll get a delay of game penalty.\n\nKyle:\tNo way dude!\n\nChef:\tHike the ball.\n\nKyle:\t[back in position, with his shirt covering his nose.] Ah, dude, weak.\n\nCartman:\tThat's right, you get back there.\n\nKyle:\tHut.\n\nFrank:\tThe ball is snapped. Middle Park blitzes. [Screaming as Kyle is tackled] Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. they run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nJimbo:\tHell's bells.\n\nFrank:\tWhy, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King.\n\nPhil:\t[quickly covers the mike] Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again.\n\nFrank:\tRight, right, uh. I gotta watch that.\n\nTownsman 1:\tWe lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo.\n\nJimbo:\tDon't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, hehe.\n\n[Big Gay Al's dance floor]\nVocalist:\t...both be gay.\n\nStan:\t[dancing with a monkey, then sees Sparky] Sparky!

[Sparky follows Stan] We can work on making you not gay together. [Sparky stops and sits] Sparky?\n\nBig Gay Al:\tYoung man, it appears you still don't understand.\n\nStan:\tWhat don't I understand?\n\nBig Gay Al:\tCome this way, I have to show you something.\n\n[South Park Football Field, second quarter]\nFrank:\tWith just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0.\n\nKyle:\tHut, hut. [Cartman snaps the ball to Kyle. The Cowboys blitz. Kyle flips the ball back to Pip, who is still without a helmet. The Cowboys players descend on him as soon as he catches the ball]\n\nFrank:\tOh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant.\n\nPhil:\t[muffling Frank] Dude! Now that is not cool.\n\nFrank:\tSorry, sorry.\n\n[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]\nBig Gay Al:\tOkay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride.

On this adventure we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time.\n\n[South Park Football Field. South Park's final drive before the halftime show]\nFrank:\tAnd the South Park Cows are set to receive... [Cowboys kick off] There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick.

You Bastards!\n\nPhil:\tThat's gotta hurt, Frank.\n\nFrank:\tHow terue!\n\nChef:\tHey, come on. That was roughing. At least let us scrape him off the field.\n\nFrank:\tLooks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread. Not by a long shot.\n\n[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride]\nBig Gay Al:\tYou see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan. [they cross swords] Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors. Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my! [fires off a shot with his revolver] Ohhh! Oh God, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely. [Doors open to reveal a scene right out of 'It's a Small World.']\n\nBoat Ride Singers:\nWe're all gay, and it's okay\n'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.\nWe're not sad anymore, cause we're out the closet door.\nIt's okay, hey, to be gay!\n\nBig Gay Al:\tSooo, what do you think Stan?

Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?\n\nStan:\tNo thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! [they start to walk off]\n\nBig Gay Al:\tOh Stan? [they halt] When you get back to town, [earnest music plays] tell them about us, will you?

out in the sand and lightly shaded by gray-green tamarisks and cottonwoods. A few people were trying to make soft maples grow in their turfed lawns, but the fashion of planting incongruous trees from the North Atlantic States had not become general then, and the frail, brightly painted desert town was shaded by the light-reflecting, wind-loving trees of the desert, whose roots are always seeking water and whose leaves are always talking about it, making the sound of rain. The long porous roots of the cottonwood are irrepressible. They break into the wells as rats do into granaries, and thieve the water.\n\nThe long street which connected Moonstone with the depot settlement traversed in its course a considerable stretch of rough open country, staked out in lots but not built up at all, a weedy hiatus between the town and the railroad. When you set out along this street to go to the station, you noticed that the houses became smaller and farther apart, until they ceased altogether, and the board sidewalk continued its uneven course through sunflower patches, until you reached the solitary, new brick Catholic Church. The church stood there because the land was given to the parish by the man who owned the adjoining waste lots, in the hope of making them more salable\u2014\"Farrier's Addition,\" this patch of prairie was called in the clerk's office. An eighth of a mile beyond the church was a washout, a deep sand-gully, where the board sidewalk became a bridge for perhaps fifty feet. Just beyond the gully was old Uncle Billy Beemer's grove,\u2014twelve town lots set out in fine, well-grown cottonwood trees, delightful to look upon, or to listen to, as they swayed and rippled in the wind. Uncle Billy had been one of the most worthless old drunkards who ever sat on a store box and told filthy stories. One night he played hide-and-seek with a switch engine and got his sodden brains knocked out. But his grove, the one creditable thing he had ever done in his life, rustled on. Beyond this grove the houses of the depot settlement began, and the naked board walk, that had run in out of the sunflowers, again became a link between human dwellings.\n\nOne afternoon, late in the summer, Dr. Howard Archie was fighting his way back to town along this walk through a blinding sandstorm, a silk handkerchief tied over his mouth. He had been to see a sick woman down in the depot settlement, and he was walking because his ponies had been out for a hard drive that morning.\n\nAs he passed the Catholic Church he came upon Thea and Thor. Thea was sitting in a child's express wagon, her feet out behind, kicking the wagon along and steering by the tongue. Thor was on her lap and she held him with one arm. He had grown to be a big cub of a baby, with a constitutional grievance, and he had to be continually amused. Thea took him philosophically, and tugged and pulled him about, getting as much fun as she could under her encumbrance. Her hair was blowing about her face, and her eyes were squinting so intently at the uneven board sidewalk in front of her that she did not see the doctor until he spoke to her.\n\n\"Look out, Thea. You'll steer that youngster into the ditch.\"\n\nThe wagon stopped. Thea released the tongue, wiped her hot, sandy face, and pushed back her hair. \"Oh, no, I won't! I never ran off but once, and then he didn't get anything but a bump. He likes this better than a baby buggy, and so do I.\"\n\"Are you going to kick that cart all the way home?\"\n\n\"Of course. We take long trips; wherever there is a sidewalk. It's no good on the road.\"\n\n\"Looks to me like working pretty hard for your fun. Are you going to be busy to-night? Want to make a call with me? Spanish Johnny's come home again, all used up. His wife sent me word this morning, and I said I'd go over to see him to-night. He's an old chum of yours, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm glad. She's been crying her eyes out. When did he come?\"\n\n\"Last night, on Number Six. Paid his fare, they tell me. Too sick to beat it. There'll come a time when that boy won't get back, I'm afraid. Come around to my office about eight o'clock,\u2014and you needn't bring that!\"\n\nThor seemed to understand that he had been insulted, for he scowled and began to kick the side of the wagon, shouting, \"Go-go, go-go!\" Thea leaned forward and grabbed the wagon tongue. Dr. Archie stepped in front of her and blocked the way. \"Why don't you make him wait? What do you let him boss you like that for?\"\n\n\"If he gets mad he throws himself, and then I can't do anything with him. When he's mad he's lots stronger than me, aren't you, Thor?\" Thea spoke with pride, and the idol was appeased. He grunted approvingly as his sister began to kick rapidly behind her, and the wagon rattled off and soon disappeared in the flying currents of sand.\n\nThat evening Dr. Archie was seated in his office, his desk chair tilted back, reading by the light of a hot coal-oil lamp. All the windows were open, but the night was breathless after the sandstorm, and his hair was moist where it hung over his forehead. He was deeply engrossed in his book and sometimes smiled thoughtfully as he read. When Thea Kronborg entered quietly and slipped into a seat, he nodded, finished his paragraph, inserted a bookmark, and rose to put the book back into the case. It was one out of the long row of uniform volumes on the top shelf.\n\n\"Nearly every time I come in, when you're alone, you're reading one of those books,\" Thea remarked thoughtfully. \"They must be very nice.\"\n\nThe doctor dropped back into his swivel chair, the mottled volume still in his hand. \"They aren't exactly books, Thea,\" he said seriously.\n\n\"They're a city.\"\n\n\"A history, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, and no. They're a history of a live city, not a dead one. A Frenchman undertook to write about a whole cityful of people, all the kinds he knew. And he got them nearly all in, I guess. Yes, it's very interesting. You'll like to read it some day, when you're grown up.\"\nThea leaned forward and made out the title on the back, \"A Distinguished Provincial in Paris.\"\n\n\"It doesn't sound very interesting.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, but it is.\" The doctor scrutinized her broad face, low enough to be in the direct light from under the green lamp shade. \"Yes,\" he went on with some satisfaction, \"I think you'll like them some day. You're always curious about people, and I expect this man knew more about people than anybody that ever lived.\"\n\n\"City people or country people?\"\n\n\"Both. People are pretty much the same everywhere.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, they're not. The people who go through in the dining-car aren't like us.\"\n\n\"What makes you think they aren't, my girl? Their clothes?\"\n\nThea shook her head. \"No, it's something else. I don't know.\" Her eyes shifted under the doctor's searching gaze and she glanced up at the row of books. \"How soon will I be old enough to read them?\"\n\n\"Soon enough, soon enough, little girl.\" The doctor patted her hand and looked at her index finger. \"The nail's coming all right, isn't it? But I think that man makes you practice too much. You have it on your mind all the time.\" He had noticed that when she talked to him she was always opening and shutting her hands. \"It makes you nervous.\"\n\n\"No, he don't,\" Thea replied stubbornly, watching Dr. Archie return the book to its niche.\n\nHe took up a black leather case, put on his hat, and they went down the dark stairs into the street. The summer moon hung full in the sky. For the time being, it was the great fact in the world. Beyond the edge of the town the plain was so white that every clump of sage stood out distinct from the sand, and the dunes looked like a shining lake. The doctor took off his straw hat and carried it in his hand as they walked toward Mexican Town, across the sand.\n\nNorth of Pueblo, Mexican settlements were rare in Colorado then. This one had come about accidentally. Spanish Johnny was the first Mexican who came to Moonstone. He was a painter and decorator, and had been working in Trinidad, when Ray Kennedy told him there was a \"boom\" on in Moonstone, and a good many new buildings were going up. A year after Johnny settled in Moonstone, his cousin, Famos Serrenos, came to work in the brickyard; then Serrenos' cousins came to help him. During the strike, the master mechanic put a gang of Mexicans to work in the roundhouse. The Mexicans had arrived so quietly, with their blankets and musical instruments, that before Moonstone was awake to the fact, there was a Mexican quarter; a dozen families or more.\n\nAs Thea and the doctor approached the 'dobe houses, they heard a guitar, and a rich barytone voice\u2014that of Famos Serrenos\u2014singing \"La Golandrina.\" All the Mexican houses had neat little yards, with tamarisk hedges and flowers, and walks bordered with shells or whitewashed stones. Johnny's house was dark. His wife, Mrs. Tellamantez, was sitting on the doorstep, combing her long, blue-black hair. (Mexican women are like the Spartans; when they are in trouble, in love, under stress of any kind, they comb and comb their hair.) She rose without embarrassment or apology, comb in hand, and greeted the doctor.\n\"Good-evening; will you go in?\" she asked in a low, musical voice. \"He is in the back room. I will make a light.\" She followed them indoors, lit a candle and handed it to the doctor, pointing toward the bedroom. Then she went back and sat down on her doorstep.\n\nDr. Archie and Thea went into the bedroom, which was dark and quiet. There was a bed in the corner, and a man was lying on the clean sheets. On the table beside him was a glass pitcher, half-full of water. Spanish Johnny looked younger than his wife, and when he was in health he was very handsome: slender, gold-colored, with wavy black hair, a round, smooth throat, white teeth, and burning black eyes. His profile was strong and severe, like an Indian's. What was termed his \"wildness\" showed itself only in his feverish eyes and in the color that burned on his tawny cheeks. That night he was a coppery green, and his eyes were like black holes. He opened them when the doctor held the candle before his face.\n\n\"MI TESTA!\" he muttered, \"MI TESTA,\" doctor. \"LA FIEBRE!\" Seeing the doctor's companion at the foot of the bed, he attempted a smile.\n\n\"MUCHACHA!\" he exclaimed deprecatingly.\n\nDr. Archie stuck a thermometer into his mouth. \"Now, Thea, you can run outside and wait for me.\"\n\nThea slipped noiselessly through the dark house and joined Mrs. Tellamantez. The somber Mexican woman did not seem inclined to talk, but her nod was friendly. Thea sat down on the warm sand, her back to the moon, facing Mrs. Tellamantez on her doorstep, and began to count the moon flowers on the vine that ran over the house. Mrs. Tellamantez was always considered a very homely woman. Her face was of a strongly marked type not sympathetic to Americans. Such long, oval faces, with a full chin, a large, mobile mouth, a high nose, are not uncommon in Spain. Mrs. Tellamantez could not write her name, and could read but little. Her strong nature lived upon itself. She was chiefly known in Moonstone for her forbearance with her incorrigible husband.\n\nNobody knew exactly what was the matter with Johnny, and everybody liked him. His popularity would have been unusual for a white man, for a Mexican it was unprecedented. His talents were his undoing. He had a high, uncertain tenor voice, and he played the mandolin with exceptional skill. Periodically he went crazy. There was no other way to explain his behavior. He was a clever workman, and, when he worked, as regular and faithful as a burro. Then some night he would fall in with a crowd at the saloon and begin to sing. He would go on until he had no voice left, until he wheezed and rasped. Then he would play his mandolin furiously, and drink until his eyes sank back into his head. At last, when he was put out of the saloon at closing time, and could get nobody to listen to him, he would run away\u2014along the railroad track, straight across the desert. He always managed to get aboard a freight somewhere. Once beyond Denver, he played his way southward from saloon to saloon until he got across the border. He never wrote to his wife; but she would soon begin to get newspapers from La Junta, Albuquerque, Chihuahua, with marked paragraphs announcing that Juan Tellamantez and his wonderful mandolin could be heard at the Jack Rabbit Grill, or the Pearl of Cadiz Saloon. Mrs. Tellamantez waited and wept and combed her hair. When he was completely wrung out and burned up,\u2014all but destroyed,\u2014her Juan always came back to her to be taken care of,\u2014once with an ugly knife wound in the neck, once with a finger missing from his right hand,\u2014but he played just as well with three fingers as he had with four.\n\nPublic sentiment was lenient toward Johnny, but everybody was disgusted with Mrs. Tellamantez for putting up with him. She ought to discipline him, people said; she ought to leave him; she had no self-respect. In short, Mrs. Tellamantez got all the blame. Even Thea thought she was much too humble. To-night, as she sat with her back to the moon, looking at the moon flowers and Mrs. Tellamantez's somber face, she was thinking that there is nothing so sad in the world as that kind of patience and resignation. It was much worse than Johnny's craziness. She even wondered whether it did not help to make Johnny crazy. People had no right to be so passive and resigned. She would like to roll over and over in the sand and screech at Mrs. Tellamantez. She was glad when the doctor came out.\n\nThe Mexican woman rose and stood respectful and expectant. The doctor held his hat in his hand and looked kindly at her.\n\n\"Same old thing, Mrs. Tellamantez. He's no worse than he's been before. I've left some medicine. Don't give him anything but toast water until I see him again. You're a good nurse; you'll get him out.\" Dr. Archie smiled encouragingly. He glanced about the little garden and wrinkled his brows. \"I can't see what makes him behave so. He's killing himself, and he's not a rowdy sort of fellow. Can't you tie him up someway? Can't you tell when these fits are coming on?\"\n\nMrs. Tellamantez put her hand to her forehead. \"The saloon, doctor, the excitement; that is what makes him. People listen to him, and it excites him.\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head. \"Maybe. He's too much for my calculations. I don't see what he gets out of it.\"\n\n\"He is always fooled,\"\u2014the Mexican woman spoke rapidly and tremulously, her long under lip quivering.\n\n\"He is good at heart, but he has no head. He fools himself. You do not understand in this country, you are progressive. But he has no judgment, and he is fooled.\" She stooped quickly, took up one of the white conch-shells that bordered the walk, and, with an apologetic inclination of her head, held it to Dr. Archie's ear. \"Listen, doctor. You hear something in there? You hear the sea; and yet the sea is very far from here. You have judgment, and you know that. But he is fooled. To him, it is the sea itself. A little thing is big to him.\" She bent and placed the shell in the white row, with its fellows. Thea took it up softly and pressed it to her own ear. The sound in it startled her; it was like something calling one. So that was why Johnny ran away. There was something awe-inspiring about Mrs. Tellamantez and her shell.\nThea caught Dr. Archie's hand and squeezed it hard as she skipped along beside him back toward Moonstone. She went home, and the doctor went back to his lamp and his book. He never left his office until after midnight. If he did not play whist or pool in the evening, he read. It had become a habit with him to lose himself.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1503998", "artist_names": "Bobby Vinton", "full_title": "Long Lonely Nights

Burton", "lyrics": "Arabian Nights, Vol. 3 (Chap. 13) LyricsTale Of Kamar Al Zaman\n\nThat there was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a King called Shahrim\u00e1n,[FN#220] who was lord of many troops and guards, and officers, and who reigned over certain islands, known as the Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n Islands,[FN#221] on the borders of the land of the Persians. But he was stricken in years and his bones were wasted, without having been blessed with a son, albeit he had four wives, daughters of Kings, and threescore concubines, with each of whom he was wont to lie one night in turn.[FN#222] This preyed upon his mind and disquieted him, so that he complained thereof to one of his Wazirs, saying, \"Verily I fear lest my kingdom be lost when I die, for that I have no son to succeed me.\" The Minister answered, \"O King, peradventure Allah shall yet bring something to pass; so rely upon the Almighty and be instant in prayer. It is also my counsel that thou spread a banquet and invite to it the poor and needy, and let them eat of thy food; and supplicate the Lord to vouchsafe thee a son; for perchance there may be among thy guests a righteous soul whose prayers find acceptance; and thereby thou shalt win thy wish.\" So the King rose, made the lesser ablution, and prayed a two-bow prayer,[FN#223] then he cried upon Allah with pure intention; after which he called his chief wife to bed and lay with her forthright. By grace of God she conceived and, when her months were accomplished, she bore a male child, like the moon on the night of fulness. The King named him Kamar al-Zam\u00e1n,[FN#224] and rejoiced in him with extreme joy and bade the city be dressed out in his honour; so they decorated the streets seven days, whilst the drums beat and the messengers bore the glad tidings abroad. Then wet and dry nurses were provided for the boy and he was reared in splendour and delight, until he reached the age of fifteen. He grew up of surpassing beauty and seemlihead and symmetry, and his father loved him so dear that he could not brook to be parted from him day or night. One day he complained to a certain of his Ministers anent the excess of his love for his only child, saying, \"O thou the Wazir, of a truth I fear for my son, Kamar al-Zaman, the shifts and accidents which befal man and fain would I marry him in my life-time.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O King, know thou that marriage is one of the most honourable of moral actions, and thou wouldst indeed do well and right to marry thy son in thy lifetime, ere thou make him Sultan.\" On this quoth the King, \"Hither with my son Kamar al-Zaman;\" so he came and bowed his head to the ground in modesty before his sire. \"O Kamar al Zaman,\" said King Shahriman, \"of a truth I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee during my lifetime.\" Replied he, \"O my father, know that I have no lust to marry nor cloth my soul incline to women; for that concerning their craft and perfidy I have read many books and heard much talk, even as saith the poet,\n\n'Now, an of women ask ye, I reply:\u2014*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affairs I'm versed a doctor rare!\nWhen man's head grizzles and his money dwindles, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affections he hath naught for share.'\n\nAnd another said:\u2014\n'Rebel against women and so shalt thou serve Allah the more; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The youth who gives women the rein must forfeit all hope to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     soar.\nThey'll baulk him when seeking the strange device, Excelsior, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tho' waste he a thousand of years in the study of science\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and lore.' \"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verses he continued, \"O my father, wedlock is a thing whereto I will never consent; no, not though I drink the cup of death.\" When Sultan Shahriman heard these words from his son, light became darkness in his sight and he grieved thereat with great grief.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman heard these words from his son, the light became darkness in his sight and he grieved over his son's lack of obedience to his directions in the matter of marriage; yet, for the great love he bore him, he was unwilling to repeat his wishes and was not wroth with him, but caressed him and spake him fair and showed him all manner of kindness such as tendeth to induce affection. All this, and Kamar al-Zaman increased daily in beauty and loveliness and amorous grace; and the King bore with him for a whole year till he became perfect in eloquence and elegant wit. All men were ravished with his charms; and every breeze that blew bore the tidings of his gracious favour; his fair sight was a seduction to the loving and a garden of delight to the longing, for he was honey-sweet of speech and the sheen of his face shamed the full moon; he was a model of symmetry and blandishment and engaging ways; his shape was as the willow-wand or the rattan- cane and his cheeks might take the place of rose or red anemone. He was, in fine the pink of perfection, even as the poet hath said of him,\n\n\"He came and cried they, 'Now be Allah blest! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Praise Him that clad that soul in so fair vest!'\nHe's King of Beauty where the beauteous be; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All are his Ryots,[FN#225] all obey his hest:\nHis lip-dew's sweeter than the virgin honey; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His teeth are pearls in double row close press:\nAll charms are congregate in him alone, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And deals his loveliness to man unrest.\nBeauty wrote on those cheeks for worlds to see *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I testify there is none good but He.'\"[FN#226]\n\nWhen the year came to an end, the King called his son to him and said, \"O my son, wilt thou not hearken to me?\" Whereupon Kamar al-Zaman fell down for respect and shame before his sire and replied, \"O my father, how should I not hearken to thee, seeing that Allah commandeth me to obey thee and not gain-say thee?\" Rejoined King Shahriman, \"O my son, know that I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee whilst yet I live, and make thee King over my realm, before my death.\" When the Prince heard his sire pronounce these words he bowed his head awhile, then raised it and said, \"O my father, this is a thing which I will never do; no, not though I drink the cup of death! I know of a surety that the Almighty hath made obedience to thee a duty in religion; but, Allah upon thee! press me not in this matter of marriage, nor fancy that I will ever marry my life long; for that I have read the books both of the ancients and the moderns, and have come to know all the mischiefs and miseries which have befallen them through women and their endless artifices. And how excellent is the saying of the poet,\n'He whom the randy motts entrap *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall never see deliverance!\nThough build he forts a thousand-fold, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose mighty strength lead-plates enhance,[FN#227]\nTheir force shall be of no avail; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     These fortresses have not a chance!\nWomen aye deal in treachery *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To far and near o'er earth's expanse\nWith fingers dipt in Henna-blood *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And locks in braids that mad the glance;\nAnd eyelids painted o'er with Kohl *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  They gar us drink of dire mischance.'\n\nAnd how excellently saith another,\n\n'Women, for all the chastity they claim, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Are offal cast by kites where'er they list:\nThis night their talk and secret charms are shine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That night another joyeth calf and wrist:\nLike inn, whence after night thou far'st at dawn, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lodges other wight thou hast not wist.'\"[FN#228]\n\nNow when King Shahriman heard these his son's words and learnt the import of his verses and poetical quotations, he made no answer, of his excessive love for him, but redoubled in graciousness and kindness to him. He at once broke up the audience and, as soon as the seance was over, he summoned his Minister and taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir! tell me how I shall deal with my son in the matter of marriage.\"- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted stay.\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King summoned his Minister; and, taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir, tell me what I shall do with my son in the matter of marriage. Of a truth I took counsel with thee thereon and thou didst counsel me to marry him, before making him King. I have spoken with him of wedlock time after time and he still gainsaid me; so do thou, O Wazir, forthright advise me what to do.\" Answered the Minister, \"O King, wait another year and, if after that thou be minded to speak to him on the matter of marriage, speak not to him privily, but address him on a day of state, when all the Emirs and Wazirs are present with the whole of the army standing before thee. And when all are in crowd then send for thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and summon him; and, when he cometh, broach to him the matter of marriage before the Wazirs and Grandees and Officers of state and Captains; for he will surely be bashful and daunted by their presence and will not dare to oppose thy will.\" Now when King Shahriman heard his Wazir's words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, seeing success in the project, and bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour. Then he took patience with his son another year, whilst, with every day that passed over him, Kamar al-Zaman increased in beauty and loveliness, and elegance and perfect grace, till he was nigh twenty years old. Indeed Allah had clad him in the cloak of comeliness and had crowned him with the crown of completion: his eye-glance was more bewitching than H\u00e1r\u00fat and Mar\u00fat[FN#229] and the play of his luring looks more misleading than T\u00e1gh\u00fat;[FN#230] and his cheeks shone like the dawn rosy-red and his eyelashes stormed the keen-edged blade: the whiteness of his brow resembled the moon shining bright, and the blackness of his locks was as the murky night; and his waist was more slender than the gossamer[FN#231] and his back parts than two sand heaps bulkier, making a Babel of the heart with their softness; but his waist complained of the weight of his hips and loins; and his charms ravished all mankind, even as one of the poets saith in these couplets,\n\"By his eyelash tendril curled, by his slender waist I swear,\nBy the dart his witchery feathers, fatal hurtling through the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   air;\nBy the just roundness of his shape, by his glances bright and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   keen\nBy the swart limping of his locks, and his fair forehead shining\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sheen;\nBy his eyebrows which deny that she who looks on them should\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sleep,\nWhich now commanding, now forbidding, o'er me high dominion keep;\nBy the roses of his cheek, his face as fresh as myrtle wreath\nHis tulip lips, and those pure pearls that hold the places of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     teeth;\nBy his noble form, which rises featly turned in even swell\nTo where upon his jutting chest two young pomegranates seem to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   dwell\nBy his supple moving hips, his taper waist, the silky skin,\nBy all he robbed Perfection of, and holds enchained his form\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     within;\nBy his tongue of steadfastness, his nature true, and excellent,\nBy the greatness of his rank, his noble birth, and high descent,\nMusk from my love her savour steals, who musk exhales from every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     limb\nAnd all the airs ambergris breathes are but the Zephyr's blow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     o'er him.\nThe sun, methinks, the broad bright sun, as low before my love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     should quail\nAs would my love himself transcend the paltry paring of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     nail!\"[FN#232]\nSo King Shahriman, having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shahriman having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival, a day of state when the audience hall was filled with his Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of his reign and Officers of State and Captains of might and main. Thereupon he sent for his son Kamar al-Zaman who came, and kissing the ground before him three times, stood in presence of his sire with his hands behind his back the right grasping the left.[FN#233] Then said the King to him, \"Know O my son, that I have not sent for thee on this occasion and summoned thee to appear before this assembly and all these officers of estate here awaiting our orders save and except that I may lay a commandment on thee, wherein do thou not disobey me; and my commandment is that thou marry, for I am minded to wed thee to a King's daughter and rejoice in thee ere I die.\" When the Prince heard this much from his royal sire, he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then raising it towards his father and being moved thereto at that time by youthful folly and boyish ignorance, replied, \"But for myself I will never marry; no, not though I drink the cup of death! As for thee, thou art great in age and small of wit: hast thou not, twice ere this day and before this occasion, questioned me of the matter of marriage and I refused my consent? Indeed thou dotest and are not fit to govern a flock of sheep!\" So saying Kamar al-Zaman unclasped his hands from behind his back and tucked up his sleeves above his elbows before his father, being in a fit of fury; moreover, he added many words to his sire, knowing not what he said in the trouble of his spirits. The King was confounded and ashamed, for that this befel in the presence of his grandees and soldier-officers assembled on a high festival and a state occasion; but presently the majesty of Kingship took him, and he cried out at his son and made him tremble. Then he called to the guards standing before him and said, \"Seize him!' So they came forward and laid hands on him and, binding him, brought him before his sire, who bade them pinion his elbows behind his back and in this guise make him stand before the presence. And the Prince bowed down his head for fear and apprehension, and his brow and face were beaded and spangled with sweat; and shame and confusion troubled him sorely. Thereupon his father abused him and reviled him and cried, \"Woe to thee, thou son of adultery and nursling of abomination![FN#234] How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman cried out to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee. Knowest thou not that this deed thou hast done were a disgrace to him had it been done by the meanest of my subjects?\" And the King commanded his Mamelukes to loose his elbow bonds and imprison him in one of the bastions of the citadel. So they took the Prince and thrust him into an old tower, wherein there was a dilapidated saloon and in its middle a ruined well, after having first swept it and cleansed its floor-flags and set therein a couch on which they laid a mattress, a leathern rug and a cushion; and then they brought a great lanthorn and a wax candle, for that place was dark, even by day. And lastly the Mamelukes led Kamar al-Zaman thither, and stationed an eunuch at the door. And when all this was done, the Prince threw himself on the couch, sad-spirited, and heavy- hearted; blaming himself and repenting of his injurious conduct to his father, whenas repentance availed him naught, and saying, \"Allah curse marriage and marriageable and married women, the traitresses all! Would I had hearkened to my father and accepted a wife! Had I so done it had been better for me than this jail.\" This is how it fared with him; but as regards King Shahri man, he remained seated on his throne all through the day until sundown; then he took the Minister apart and said to him \"Know thou, O Wazir, that thou and thou only west the cause of all this that hath come to pass between me and my son by the advice thou west pleased to devise; and so what dost thou counsel me to do now?\" Answered he, \"O King, leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days: then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, said to King Shahriman, \"Leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days; then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\" The King accepted the Wazir's opinion and lay down to sleep that night troubled at heart concerning his son; for he loved him with dearest love because he had no other child but this; and it was his wont every night not to sleep, save after placing his arm under his son's neck. So he passed that night in trouble and unease on the Prince 's account, tossing from side to side, as he were laid on coals of Artemisia-wood[FN#235]: for he was overcome with doubts and fears and sleep visited him not all that livelong night; but his eyes ran over with tears and he began repeating, ;\n\n\"While slanderers slumber, longsome is my night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Suffice thee a heart so sad in parting-plight;\nI say, while night in care slow moments by, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'What! no return for thee, fair morning light?'\"\n\nAnd the saying of another,\n\n\"When saw I Pleiad-stars his glance escape *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And Pole star draught of sleep upon him pour;\nAnd the Bier-daughters[FN#236] wend in mourning dight, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I knew that morning was for him no more!\"\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, when the night came upon him the eunuch set the lanthorn before him and lighting the wax-candle, placed it in the candlestick; then brought him somewhat of food. The Prince ate a little and continually reproached himself for his unseemly treatment of his father, saying to himself, \"O my soul, knowest thou not that a son of Adam is the hostage of his tongue, and that a man's tongue is what casteth him into deadly perils?\" Then his eyes ran over with tears and he bewailed that which he had done, from anguished vitals and aching heart, repenting him with exceeding repentance of the wrong wherewith he had wronged his father and repeating,\n\n\"Fair youth shall die by stumbling of the tongue: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Stumble of foot works not man's life such wrong:\nThe slip of lip shall oft smite off the head, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     While slip of foot shall never harm one long.\"\n\nNow when he had made an end of eating, he asked for the wherewithal to wash his hands and when the Mameluke had washed them clean of the remnants of food, he arose and made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the prayers of sundown and nightfall, conjoining them in one; after which he sat down.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince Kamar al-Zaman had prayed (conjoining them in one) the prayers of sundown and nightfall, he sat down on the well and began reciting the Koran, and he repeated \"The Cow,\" the \"House of Imr\u00e1n,\" and \"Y. S.;\" \"The Compassionate,\" \"Blessed be the King,\" \"Unity\" and \"The two Talismans''[FN#237]; and he ended with blessing and supplication and with saying, \"I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned.\"[FN#238] Then he lay down upon his couch which was covered with a mattress of satin from al- Ma'adin town, the same on both sides and stuffed with the raw silk of Irak; and under his head was a pillow filled with ostrich-down And when ready for sleep, he doffed his outer clothes and drew off his bag-trousers and lay down in a shirt of delicate stuff smooth as wax; and he donned a head-kerchief of azure Mar\u00e1zi[FN#239] cloth; and at such time and on this guise Kamar al-Zaman was like the full-orbed moon, when it riseth on its fourteenth night. Then, drawing over his head a coverlet of silk, he fell asleep with the lanthorn burning at his feet and the wax-candle over his head, and he ceased not sleeping through the first third of the night, not knowing what lurked for him in the womb of the Future, and what the Omniscient had decreed for him. Now, as Fate and Fortune would have it, both tower and saloon were old and had been many years deserted; and there was therein a Roman well inhabited by a Jinniyah of the seed of Iblis[FN#240] the Accursed, by name Maym\u00fanah, daughter of Al- Dimiry\u00e1t, a renowned King of the J\u00e1nn.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the name of the Jinniyah in question was Maymunah, daughter of Al-Dimiryat; a renowned King of the Jann. And as Kamar al-Zaman continued sleeping till the first third of the night, Maymunah came up out of the Roman well and made for the firmament, thinking to listen by stealth to the converse of the angels; but when she reached the mouth of the well, she saw a light shining in the tower, contrary to custom; and having dwelt there many years without seeing the like, she said to herself, \"Never have I witnessed aught like this\"; and, marvelling much at the matter, determined that there must be some cause therefor. So she made for the light and found the eunuch sleeping within the door; and inside she saw a couch spread, whereon was a human form with the wax-candle burning at his head and the lanthorn at his feet, and she wondered to see the light and stole towards it little by little. Then she folded her wings and stood by the bed and, drawing back the coverlid, discovered Kamar al-Zaman's face. She was motionless for a full hour in admiration and wonderment; for the lustre of his visage outshone that of the candle; his face beamed like a pearl with light; his eyelids were languorous like those of the gazelle; the pupils of his eyes were intensely black and brilliant[FN#241]; his cheeks were rosy red; his eye-brows were arched like bows and his breath exhaled a scent of musk, even as saith of him the poet,\n\n\"I kissed him: darker grew those pupils,[FN#242] which *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Seduce my soul, and cheeks flushed rosier hue;\nO heart, if slanderers dare to deem there be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His like in chasms, Say 'Bring him hither, you!' \"\n\nNow when Maymunah saw him, she pronounced the formula of praise,[FN#243] and said, \"Blessed be Allah, the best of Creators!\"; for she was of the true-believing Jinn; and she stood awhile gazing on his face, exclaiming and envying the youth his beauty and loveliness. And she said in herself, \"By Allah! I will do no hurt to him nor let any harm him; nay, from all of evil will I ransom him, for this fair face deserveth not but that folk should gaze upon it and for it praise the Lord. Yet how could his family find it in their hearts to leave him in such desert place where, if one of our M\u00e1rids came upon him at this hour, he would assuredly slay him.\" Then the Ifritah Maymunah bent over him and kissed him between the eyes, and presently drew back the sheet over his face which she covered up; and after this she spread her wings and soaring into the air, flew upwards. And after rising high from the circle of the saloon she ceased not winging her way through air and ascending skywards till she drew near the heaven of this world, the lowest of the heavens. And behold, she heard the noisy flapping of wings cleaving the welkin and, directing herself by the sound, she found when she drew near it that the noise came from an Ifrit called Dahnash. So she swooped down on him like a sparrow-hawk and, when he was aware of her and knew her to be Maymunah, the daughter of the King of the Jinn, he feared her and his side-muscles quivered; and he implored her forbearance, saying, I conjure thee by the Most Great and August Name and by the most noble talisman graven upon the seal-ring of Solomon, entreat me kindly and harm me not!\" When she heard these words her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Verily, thou conjurest me, O accursed, with a mighty conjuration. Nevertheless, I will not let thee go, till thou tell me whence thou comest at this hour.\" He replied, \"O Princess, Know that I come from the uttermost end of China-land and from among the Islands, and I will tell thee of a wonderful thing I have seen this night. If thou kind my words true, let me wend my way and write me a patent under thy hand and with thy sign manual that I am thy freedman, so none of the Jinn-hosts, whether of the upper who fly or of the lower who walk the earth or of those who dive beneath the waters, do me let or hindrance.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"And what is it thou hast seen this night, O liar, O accursed! Tell me without leasing and think not to escape from my hand with falses, for I swear to thee by the letters graven upon the bezel of the seal-ring of Solomon David son (on both of whom be peace!), except thy speech be true, I will pluck out thy feathers with mine own hand and strip off thy skin and break thy bones!\" Quoth the Ifrit Dahnash son of Shamh\u00farish[FN#244] the Flyer, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-eight Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash spoke thus to Maymunah, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\" Then he resumed, \"Know, O my mistress, that I come to-night from the Islands of the Inland Sea in the parts of China, which are the realms of King Ghay\u00far, lord of the Islands and the Seas and the Seven Palaces. There I saw a daughter of his, than whom Allah hath made none fairer in her time: I cannot picture her to thee, for my tongue would fail to describe her with her due of praise; but I will name to thee a somewhat of her charms by way of approach. Now her hair is like the nights of disunion and separation and her face like the days of union and delectation; and right well hath the poet said when picturing her,\n\n'She dispread the locks from her head one night, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Showing four fold nights into one night run\nAnd she turned her visage towards the moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And two moons showed at moment one.'\n\nShe hath a nose like the edge of the burnished blade and cheeks like purple wine or anemones blood-red: her lips as coral and carnelian shine and the water of her mouth is sweeter than old wine; its taste would quench Hell's fiery pain. Her tongue is moved by wit of high degree and ready repartee: her breast is a seduction to all that see it (glory be to Him who fashioned it and finished it!); and joined thereto are two upper arms smooth and rounded; even as saith of her the poet Al-Walah\u00e1n,[FN#245]\n\n'She hath wrists which, did her bangles not contain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would run from out her sleeves in silvern rain.'\n\nShe hath breasts like two globes of ivory, from whose brightness the moons borrow light, and a stomach with little waves as it were a figured cloth of the finest Egyptian linen made by the Copts, with creases like folded scrolls, ending in a waist slender past all power of imagination; based upon back parts like a hillock of blown sand, that force her to sit when she would fief stand, and awaken her, when she fain would sleep, even as saith of her and describeth her the poet,\n\n\n'She hath those hips conjoined by thread of waist, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Hips that o'er me and her too tyrannise\nMy thoughts they daze whene'er I think of them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And weigh her down whene'er she would uprise.'[FN#246]\n\nAnd those back parts are upborne by thighs smooth and round and by a calf like a column of pearl, and all this reposeth upon two feet, narrow, slender and pointed like spear-blades,[FN#247] the handiwork of the Protector and Requiter, I wonder how, of their littleness, they can sustain what is above them. But I cut short my praises of her charms fearing lest I be tedious.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash bin Shamhurish said to the Ifritah Maymunah, \"Of a truth I cut short my praises fearing lest I be tedious.\" Now when Maymunah heard the description of that Princess and her beauty and loveliness, she stood silent in astonishment; whereupon Dahnash resumed, \"The father of this fair maiden is a mighty King, a fierce knight, immersed night and day in fray and fight; for whom death hath no fright and the escape of his foe no dread, for that he is a tyrant masterful and a conqueror irresistible, lord of troops and armies and continents and islands, and cities and villages, and his name is King Ghayur, Lord of the Islands and of the Seas and of the Seven Palaces. Now he loveth his daughter, the young maiden whom I have described to thee, with dearest love and, for affection of her, he hath heaped together the treasures of all the kings and built her therewith seven palaces, each of a different fashion; the first of crystal, the second of marble, the third of China steel, the fourth of precious stones and gems of price, the fifth of porcelain and many-hued onyxes and ring bezels, the sixth of silver and the seventh of gold. And he hath filled the seven palaces with all sorts of sumptuous furniture, rich silken carpets and hangings and vessels of gold and silver and all manner of gear that kings require; and hath bidden his daughter to abide in each by turns for a certain season of the year; and her name is the Princess Budur.[FN#248] Now when her beauty became known and her name and fame were bruited abroad in the neighbouring countries, all the kings sent to her father to demand her of him in marriage, and he consulted her on the matter, but she disliked the very word wedlock with a manner of abhorrence and said, O my father, I have no mind to marry; no, not at all; for I am a sovereign Lady and a Queen suzerain ruling over men, and I have no desire for a man who shall rule over me. And the more suits she refused, the more her suitors' eagerness increased and all the Royalties of the Inner Islands of China sent presents and rarities to her father with letters asking her in marriage. So he pressed her again and again with advice on the matter of espousals; but she ever opposed to him refusals, till at last she turned upon him angrily and cried, 'O my father, if thou name matrimony to me once more, I will go into my chamber and take a sword and, fixing its hilt in the ground, will set its point to my waist; then will I press upon it, till it come forth from my back, and so slay myself.' Now when the King heard these her words, the light became darkness in his sight and his heart burned for her as with a flame of fire, because he feared lest she should kill herself; and he was filled with perplexity concerning her affair and the kings her suitors. So he said to her 'If thou be determined not to marry and there be no help for it abstain from going and coming in and out.' Then he placed her in a house and shut her up in a chamber, appointing ten old women as duennas to guard her, and forbade her to go forth to the Seven Palaces; moreover, he made it appear that he was incensed against her, and sent letters to all the kings, giving them to know that she had been stricken with madness by the Jinns; and it is now a year since she hath thus been secluded.\" Then continued the Ifrit Dahnash, addressing the Ifritah Maymunah, \"And I, O my lady go to her every night and take my fill of feeding my sight on her face and I kiss her between the eyes: yet, of my love to her, I do her no hurt neither mount her, for that her youth is fair and her grace surpassing: every one who seeth her jealouseth himself for her. I conjure thee, therefore, O my lady, to go back with me and look on her beauty and loveliness and stature and perfection of proportion; and after, if thou wilt, chastise me or enslave me; and win to thy will, for it is shine to bid and to forbid.\" So saying, the Ifrit Dahnash bowed his head towards the earth and drooped his wings downward; but Maymunah laughed at his words and spat in his face and answered, \"What is this girl of whom thou pratest but a potsherd wherewith to wipe after making water?[FN#249] Faugh! Faugh! By Allah, O accursed, I thought thou hadst some wondrous tale to tell me or some marvellous news to give me. How would it be if thou were to sight my beloved? Verily, this night I have seen a young man, whom if thou saw though but in a dream, thou wouldst be palsied with admiration and spittle would flow from thy mouth.\" Asked the Ifrit, \"And who and what is this youth?\"; and she answered, \"Know, O Dahnash, that there hath befallen the young man the like of what thou tellest me befel thy mistress; for his father pressed him again and again to marry, but he refused, till at length his sire waxed wroth at being opposed and imprisoned him in the tower where I dwell: and I came up to-night and saw him.\" Said Dahnash, \"O my lady, shew me this youth, that I may see if he be indeed handsomer than my mistress, the Princess Budur, or not; for I cannot believe that the like of her liveth in this our age.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed, O most ill-omened of Marids and vilest of Satans![FN#250] Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the One Hundred and Eightieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifritah Maymunah spake thus to the Ifrit Dahnash, \"Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world! Art thou mad to fellow thy beloved with my beloved?\" He said, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady, go back with me and look upon my mistress, and after I will with thee and look upon thy beloved.\" She answered, \"It must needs be so, O accursed, for thou art a knavish devil; but I will not go with thee nor shalt thou come with me, save upon condition of a wager which is this. If the lover thou lovest and of whom thou boastest so bravely, prove handsomer than mine whom I mentioned and whom I love and of whom I boast, the bet shall be shine against me; but if my beloved prove the handsomer the bet shall be mine against thee.\" Quoth Dahnash the Ifrit, \"O my lady, I accept this thy wager and am satisfied thereat; so come with me to the Islands.\" Quoth Maymunah; \"No! for the abode of my beloved is nearer than the abode of shine: here it is under us; so come down with me to see my beloved and after we will go look upon thy mistress.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" said Dahnash. So they descended to earth and alighted in the saloon which the tower contained; then Maymunah stationed Dahnash beside the bed and, putting out her hand, drew back the silken coverlet from Kamar al-Zaman's face, when it glittered and glistened and shimmered and shone like the rising sun. She gazed at him for a moment, then turning sharply round upon Dahnash said, \"Look, O accursed, and be not the basest of madmen; I am a maid, yet my heart he hath waylaid.\" So Dahnash looked at the Prince and long continued gazing steadfastly on him then, shaking his head, said to Maymunah, \"By Allah, O my lady, thou art excusable; but there is yet another thing to be considered, and this is, that the estate female differeth from the male. By Allah's might, this thy beloved is the likest of all created things to my mistress in beauty and loveliness and grace and perfection; and it is as though they were both cast alike in the mould of seemlihead.\" Now when Maymunah heard these words, the light became darkness in her sight and she dealt him with her wing so fierce a buffet on the head as well-nigh made an end of him. Then quoth she to him, \"I conjure thee, by the light of his glorious countenance, go at once, O accursed, and bring hither thy mistress whom thou lovest so fondly and foolishly, and return in haste that we may lay the twain together and look on them both as they lie asleep side by side; so shall it appear to us which be the goodlier and more beautiful of the two. Except thou obey me this very moment, O accursed, I will dart my sparks at thee with my fire and consume thee; yea, in pieces I will rend thee and into the deserts cast thee, that to stay at home and wayfarer an example thou be!\" Quoth Dahnash, \"O my lady, I will do thy behests, for I know forsure that my mistress is the fairer and the sweeter.\" So saying the If rit flew away and Maymunah flew with him to guard him. They were absent awhile and presently returned, bearing the young lady, who was clad in a shift of fine Venetian silk, with a double edging of gold and purfled with the most exquisite of embroidery having these couplets worked upon the ends of the sleeves,\n\n\"Three matters hinder her from visiting us, in fear *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Of hate-full, slandering envier and his hired spies:\nThe shining light of brow, the trinkets' tinkling voice, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And scent of essences that tell whene'er she tries:\nGi'en that she hide her brow with edge of sleeve, and leave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     At home her trinketry, how shall her scent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     disguise?''[FN#251]\n\nAnd Dahnash and Maymunah stinted not bearing that young lady till they had carried her into the saloon and had laid her beside the youth Kamar al-Zaman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash and the Ifritah Maymunah stinted not bearing Princess Budur till they descended and laid her on the couch beside Kamar al- Zaman. Then they uncovered both their faces, and they were the likest of all folk, each to other, as they were twins or an only brother and sister; and indeed they were a seduction to the pious, even as saith of them the poet Al-Mub\u00edn,\n\n\"O heart! be not thy love confined to one, *\nLest thou by doting or disdain be undone:\nLove all the fair, and thou shalt find with them *\nIf this be lost, to thee that shall be won.\"\n\nAnd quoth another,\n\n\"Mine eyes beheld two lying on the ground; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Both had I loved if on these eyne they lay!\"\n\nSo Dahnash and Maymunah gazed on them awhile, and he said, \"By Allah, O my lady, it is good! My mistress is assuredly the fairer.\" She replied, \"Not so, my beloved is the fairer; woe to thee, O Dahnash! Art blind of eye and heart that lean from fat thou canst not depart? Wilt thou hide the truth? Dost thou not see his beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetry? Out on thee, hear what I purpose to say in praise of my beloved and, if thou be a lover true to her thou dost love, do thou the like for her thou Lovest.\" Then she kissed Kamar al-Zaman again and again between the eyes and improvised this ode,\n\n\"How is this? Why should the blamer abuse thee in his pride?\nWhat shall console my heart for thee, that art but slender bough?\n\nA Nature Kohl'd[FN#252] eye thou hast that witcheth far and wide;\nFrom pure platonic love[FN#253] of it deliverance none I trow!\n\nThose glances, fell as plundering Turk, to heart such havoc deal\nAs never havocked scymitar made keenest at the curve.\n\nOn me thou layest load of love the heaviest while I feel\nSo feeble grown that under weight of chemisette I swerve.\n\nMy love for thee as wottest well is habit, and my lowe\nIs nature; to all others false is all the love I tender:\n\nNow were my heart but like to shine I never would say No;\nOnly my wasted form is like thy waist so gracious slender:\n\nOut on him who in Beauty's robe for moon like charms hath fame,\nAnd who is claimed by mouth of men as marvel of his tribe!\n\n'Of man what manner may he be' (ask they who flyte and blame)\n'For whom thy heart is so distressed?'

Those eyne wherein white jostles black![FN#255] That dearling dainty frame!\"\n\nWhen Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he joyed with exceeding joy and marvelled with excessive wonderment.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Ifrit Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he shook for exceeding joy and said, \"Thou hast celebrated thy beloved in song and thou hast indeed done well in praise of him whom thou lovest! And there is no help for it but that I also in my turn do my best to enfame my mistress, and recite somewhat in her honour.\" Then the Ifrit went up to the Lady Budur; and' kissing her between the eyes, looked at Maymunah and at his beloved Princess and recited the following verses, albeit he had no skill in poesy,\n\n\"Love for my fair they chide in angry way; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unjust for ignorance, yea unjustest they!\nAh lavish favours on the love mad, whom *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Taste of thy wrath and parting woe shall slay:\nIn sooth for love I'm wet with railing tears, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That rail mine eyelids blood thou mightest say:\nNo marvel what I bear for love, 'tis marvel *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That any know my \"me\" while thou'rt away:\nUnlawful were our union did I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thy love, or heart incline to other May.\"\n\nAnd eke these words:\u2014\n\n\"I feed eyes on their stead by the valley's side, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And I'm slain and my slaver[FN#256] aside hath tried:\nGrief-wine have I drunken, and down my cheeks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Dance tears to the song of the camel-guide:\nFor union-blessing I strive though sure, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In Budur and Su'ad all my bliss shall bide:[FN#257]\nWot I not which of three gave me most to 'plain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So hear them numbered ere thou decide:\nThose Sworders her eyne, that Lancer her fig- *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     -ure, or ring-mail'd Locks which her forehead hide.\nQuoth she (and I ask of her what so wights *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or abide in towns or in desert ride[FN#258] )\nTo me, 'In thy heart I dwell, look there!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Where's my heart ah where? ah where?'\"\n\nWhen Maymunah heard these lines from the Ifrit, she said, \"Thou hast done well, O Dahnash! But say thou which of the two is the handsomer?\" And he answered, \"My mistress Budur is handsomer than thy beloved!\" Cried Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed. Nay, my beloved is more beautiful than shine!\" But Dahnash persisted, \"Mine is the fairer.\" And they ceased not to wrangle and challenge each other's words till Maymunah cried out at Dahnash and would have laid violent hands on him, but he humbled himself to her and, softening his speech, said, \"Let not the truth be a grief to thee, and cease we this talk, for all we say is to testify in favour of our lovers; rather let each of us withdraw the claim and seek we one who shall judge fairly between us which of the two be fairer; and by his sentence we will abide.\" \"I agree to this,\" answered she and smote the earth with her foot, whereupon there came out of it an Ifrit blind of an eye, humpbacked and scurvy-skinned, with eye-orbits slit up and down his face.[FN#259] On his head were seven horns and four locks of hair fell to his heels; his hands were pitchfork-like and his legs mast-like and he had nails as the claws of a lion, and feet as the hoofs of the wild ass.[FN#260] When that If rit rose out of the earth and sighted Maymunah, he kissed the ground before her and, standing with his hands clasped behind him, said, \"What is thy will, O my mistress, O daughter of my King?\"[FN#261] She replied, \"O Kashkash, I would have thee judge between me and this accursed Dahnash.\" And she made known to him the matter, from first to last, whereupon the Ifrit Kashkash looked at the face of the youth and then at the face of the girl; and saw them lying asleep, embraced, each with an arm under the other's neck, alike in beauty and loveliness and equal in grace and goodliness. The Marid gazed long upon them, marvelling at their seemlihead; and, after carefully observing the twain, he turned to Maymunah and Dahnash, and reseated these couplets.\n\n\"Go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not\nThe words detractors utter, envious churls\nCan never favour love. Oh! sure the Merciful\nNe'er made a thing more fair to look upon,\nThan two fond lovers in each others' arms,\nSpeaking their passion in a mute embrace.\nWhen heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them\nStrike idly on cold steel. So when thou'st found\nOne purely, wholly shine, accept her true heart,\nAnd live for her alone. Oh! thou that blamest\nThe love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk,\nHow canst thou minister to a mind diseased?\"[FN#262]\n\nThen he turned again to Maymunah and Dahnash and said to them, \"By Allah, if you will have the truth, I tell you fairly the twain be equal in beauty, and loveliness and perfect grace and goodliness, nor can I make any difference between them on account of their being man and woman. But I have another thought which is that we wake each of them in turn, without the knowledge of the other, and whichever is the more enamoured shall be held inferior in seemlihead and comeliness.\" Quoth Maymunah, \"Right is this recking,\" and quoth Dahnash, \"I consent to this.\" Then Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman, whereupon he started from sleep in a fright.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-third Night,\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman who started from sleep in a fright and rubbed the bitten part, his neck, and scratched it hard because of the smart. Then turning sideways, he found lying by him something whose breath was sweeter than musk and whose skin was softer than cream. Hereat marvelled he with great marvel and he sat up and looked at what lay beside him; when he saw it to be a young lady like an union pearl, or a shining sun, or a dome seen from afar on a well built wall; for she was five feet tall, with a shape like the letter Alif[FN#263], bosomed high and rosy checked; even as saith of her the poet,\n\n\"Four things which ne'er conjoin, unless it be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To storm my vitals and to shed my blood:\nBrow white as day and tresses black as night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cheeks rosy red and lips which smiles o'erflood.\"\n\nAnd also quoth another,\n\n\"A Moon she rises, Willow wand she waves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Breathes Ambergris, and gazes, a Gazelle:\nMeseems that sorrow woes my heart and wins *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, when she wendeth hastes therein to dwell!\"\n\nAnd when Kamar al-Zaman saw the Lady Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, and her beauty and comeliness, she was sleeping clad in a shift of Venetian silk, without her petticoat-trousers, and wore on her head a kerchief embroidered with gold and set with stones of price: her ears were hung with twin earrings which shone like constellations and round her neck was a collar of union pearls, of size unique, past the competence of any King. When he saw this, his reason was confounded and natural heat began to stir in him; Allah awoke in him the desire of coition and he said to himself, \"Whatso Allah willeth, that shall be, and what He willeth not shall never be!\" So saying, he put out his hand and, turning her over, loosed the collar of her chemise; then arose before his sight her bosom, with its breasts like double globes of ivory; whereat his inclination for her redoubled and he desired her with exceeding hot desire, He would have awakened her but she would not awake, for Dahnash had made her sleep heavy; so he shook her and moved her, saying, \"O my beloved, awake and look on me; I am Kamar al-Zaman.\" But she awoke not, neither moved her head; where-upon he considered her case for a long hour and said to himself, \"If I guess aright, this is the damsel to whom my father would have married me and these three years past I have refused her; but Inshallah!\u2014God willing\u2014as soon as it is dawn, I will say to him, 'Marry me to her, that I may enjoy her.'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to himself, \"By Allah, when I see dawn I will say to my sire, 'Marry me to her that I may enjoy her'; nor will I let half the day pass ere I possess her and take my fill of her beauty and loveliness.\" Then he bent over Budur to buss her, whereat the Jinniyah Maymunah trembled and was abashed and Dahnash, the Ifrit, was like to fly for joy. But, as Kamar al- Zaman was about to kiss her upon the mouth, he was ashamed before Allah and turned away his head and averted his face, saying to his heart, \"Have patience.\" Then he took thought awhile and said, \"I will be patient; haply my father when he was wroth with me and sent me to this jail, may have brought my young lady and made her lie by my side to try me with her, and may have charged her not to be readily awakened when I would arouse her, and may have said to her, 'Whatever thing Kamar al-Zaman do to thee, make me ware thereof'; or belike my sire standeth hidden in some stead whence (being himself unseen) he can see all I do with this young lady; and to morrow he will scold me and cry, 'How cometh it that thou sayest, I have no mind to marry; and yet thou didst kiss and embrace yonder damsel?' So I will withhold myself lest I be ashamed before my sire; and the right and proper thing to do is not to touch her at this present, nor even to look upon her, except to take from her somewhat which shall serve as a token to me and a memorial of her; that some sign endure between me and her.\" Then Kamar al-Zaman raised the young lady's hand and took from her little finger a seal-ring worth an immense amount of money, for that its bezel was a precious jewel and around it were graven these couplets,\n\n\"Count not that I your promises forgot, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Despite the length of your delinquencies\nBe generous, O my lord, to me inclining; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply your mouth and cheeks these lips may kiss:\nBy Allah, ne'er will I relinquish you *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Albe you will transgress love's boundaries.\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman took the seal-ring from the little finger of Queen Budur and set it on his own; then, turning his back to her, went to sleep.[FN#264] When Maymunah the Jinniyah saw this, she was glad and said to Dahnash and Kashkash, \"Saw ye how my beloved Kamar al-Zaman bore himself chastely towards this young lady? Verily, this was of the perfection of his good gifts; for observe you twain how he looked on her and noted her beauty and loveliness, and yet embraced her not neither kissed her nor put his hand to her, but turned his back and slept.\" Answered they, \"Even so!\" Thereupon Maymunah changed herself into a flea and entering into the raiment of Budur, the loved of Dahnash, crept up her calf and came upon her thigh and, reaching a place some four carats[FN#265] below her navel, there bit her. Thereupon she opened her eyes and sitting up in bed, saw a youth lying beside her and breathing heavily in his sleep, the loveliest of Almighty Allah's creatures, with eyes that put to shame the fairest Houris of Heaven; and a mouth like Solomon's seal, whose water was sweeter to the taste and more efficacious than a theriack, and lips the colour of coral-stone, and cheeks like the blood red anemone, even as saith one, describing him in these couplets,\n\n\"My mind's withdrawn from Zaynab and Naw\u00e1r[FN#266] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     By rosy cheeks that growth of myrtle bear;\nI love a fawn, a tunic-vested boy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And leave the love of bracelet-wearing Fair:\nMy mate in hall and closet is unlike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her that I play with, as at home we pair.\nOh thou, who blam'st my flight from Hind and Zaynab, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The cause is clear as dawn uplighting air!\nWould'st have me fare[FN#267] a slave, the thrall of thrall, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cribbed, pent, confined behind the bar and wall?\"\n\nNow when Princess Budur saw him, she was seized by a transport of passion and yearning and love-longing,\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur saw Kamar al-Zaman she was forthwith seized with a transport of passion and yearning and love longing, and she said to herself, \"Alas, my shame! This is a strange youth and I know him not. How cometh he to be lying by my side on one bed?\" Then she looked at him a second time and, noting his beauty and loveliness, said, \"By Allah, he is indeed a comely youth and my heart[FN#268] is well-nigh torn in sunder with longing for him! But alas, how am I shamed by him! By the Almighty, had I known it was this youth who sought me in marriage of my father, I had not rejected him, but had wived with him and enjoyed his loveliness!\" Then she gazed in his face and said, \"O my lord and light of mine eyes, awake from sleep and take thy pleasure in my beauty and grace.\" And she moved him with her hand; but Maymunah the Jinniyah let down sleep upon him as it were a curtain, and pressed heavily on his head with her wings so that Kamar al-Zaman awoke not. Then Princess Budur shook him with her hands and said, \"My life on thee, hearken to me; awake and up from thy sleep and look on the narcissus and the tender down thereon, and enjoy the sight of naked waist and navel; and touzle me and tumble me from this moment till break of day! Allah upon thee, O my lord, sit up and prop thee against the pillow and slumber not!\" Still Kamar al-Zaman made her no reply but breathed hard in his sleep. Continued she, \"Alas! Alas! thou art insolent in thy beauty and comeliness and grace and loving looks! But if thou art handsome, so am I handsome; what then is this thou dost? Have they taught thee to flout me or hath my father, the wretched old fellow,[FN#269] made thee swear not to speak to me to-night?\" But Kamar al-Zaman opened not his mouth neither awoke, whereat her passion for him redoubled and Allah inflamed her heart with love of him. She stole one glance of eyes that cost her a thousand sighs: her heart fluttered, and her vitals throbbed and her hands and feet quivered; and she said to Kamar al-Zaman \"Talk to me, O my lord! Speak to me, O my friend! Answer me, O my beloved, and tell me thy name, for indeed thou hast ravished my wit!\" And during all this time he abode drowned in sleep and answered her not a word, and Princess Budur sighed and said, \"Alas! Alas! why art thou so proud and self satisfied?\" Then she shook him and turning his hand over, saw her seal-ring on his little finger, whereat she cried a loud cry, and followed it with a sigh of passion and said, \"Alack! Alack! By Allah, thou art my beloved and thou lovest me! Yet thou seemest to turn thee away from me out of coquetry, for all, O my darling, thou camest to me, whilst I was asleep and knew not what thou didst with me, and tookest my seal-ring; and yet I will not pull it off thy finger.\" So saying, she opened the bosom of his shirt and bent over him and kissed him and put forth her hand to him, seeking somewhat that she might take as a token, but found nothing. Then she thrust her hand into his breast and, because of the smoothness of his body, it slipped down to his waist and thence to his navel and thence to his yard, whereupon her heart ached and her vitals quivered and lust was sore upon her, for that the desire of women is fiercer than the desire of men,[FN#270] and she was ashamed of her own shamelessness. Then she plucked his seal-ring from his finger, and put it on her own instead of the ring he had taken, and bussed his inner lips and hands, nor did she leave any part of him unkissed; after which she took him to her breast and embraced him and, laying one of her hands under his neck and the other under his arm-pit, nestled close to him and fell asleep by his side.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur fell asleep by the side of Kamar al-Zaman, after doing that which she did, quoth Maymunah to Dahnash, Night thou, O accursed, how proudly and coquettishly my beloved bore himself, and how hotly and passionately thy mistress showed herself to my dearling? There can be no doubt that my beloved is handsomer than shine; nevertheless I pardon thee.\" Then she wrote him a document of manumission and turned to Kashkash and said, \"Go, help Dahnash to take up his mistress and aid him to carry her back to her own place, for the night waneth apace and there is but little left of it.\" \"I hear and I obey;\" answered Kashkash. So the two Ifrits went forward to Princess Budur and upraising her flew away with her; then, bearing her back to her own place, they laid her on her bed, whilst Maymunah abode alone with Kamar al-Zaman, gazing upon him as he slept, till the night was all but spent, when she went her way. As soon as morning morrowed, the Prince awoke from sleep and turned right and left, but found not the maiden by him and said in his mind, \"What is this business? It is as if my father would incline me to marriage with the damsel who was with me and have now taken her away by stealth, to the intent that my desire for wedlock may redouble.\" Then he called out to the eunuch who slept at the door, saying, \"Woe to thee, O damned one, arise at once!\" So the eunuch rose, bemused with sleep, and brought him basin and ewer, whereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered the water closet and did his need;[FN#271] then, coming out made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the dawn-prayer, after which he sat telling on his beads the ninety-and-nine names of Almighty Allah. Then he looked up and, seeing the eunuch standing in service upon him, said, \"Out on thee, O Saw\u00e1b! Who was it came hither and took away the young lady from my side and I still sleeping?\" Asked the eunuch, 'O my lord, what manner of young lady?\" \"The young lady who lay with me last night,\" replied Kamar al-Zaman. The eunuch was startled at his words and said to him, \"By Allah, there hath been with thee neither young lady nor other! How should young lady have come in to thee, when I was sleeping in the doorway and the door was locked? By Allah, O my lord, neither male nor female hath come in to thee!\" Exclaimed the Prince, \"Thou liest, O pestilent slave!: is it of thy competence also to hoodwink me and refuse to tell me what is become of the young lady who lay with me last night and decline to inform me who took her away?\" Replied the eunuch (and he was affrighted at him), \"By Allah, O my lord, I have seen neither young lady nor young lord!\" His words only angered Kamar al-Zaman the more and he said to him, \"O accursed one, my father hath indeed taught thee deceit! Come hither.\" So the eunuch came up to him, and the Prince took him by the collar and dashed him to the ground; whereupon he let fly a loud fart[FN#272] and Kamar al-Zaman, kneeling upon him, kicked him and throttled him till he fainted away. Then he dragged him forth and tied him to the well-rope, and let him down like a bucket into the well and plunged him into the water, then drew him up and lowered him down again. Now it was hard winter weather, and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not to plunge the eunuch into the water and pull him up again and douse him and haul him whilst he screamed and called for help; and the Prince kept on saying \"By Allah, O damned one, I will not draw thee up out of this well till thou tell me and fully acquaint me with the story of the young lady and who it was took her away, whilst I slept.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One and Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to the eunuch, \"By Allah! I will not draw thee up out of this well until thou tell me the story of the young lady and who it was took her away whilst I slept.\" Answered the eunuch, after he had seen death staring him in the face; \"O my lord, let me go and I will relate to thee the truth and the whole tale.\" So Kamar al-Zaman pulled him up out of the well, all but dead for suffering, what with cold and the pain of dipping and dousing, drubbing and dread of drowning. He shook like cane in hurricane, his teeth were clenched as by cramp and his clothes were drenched and his body befouled and torn by the rough sides of the well: briefly he was in a sad pickle. Now when Kamar al-Zaman saw him in this sorry plight, he was concerned for him; but, as soon as the eunuch found himself on the floor, he said to him, \"O my lord, let me go and doff my clothes and wring them out and spread them in the sun to dry, and don others; after which I will return to thee forthwith and tell thee the truth of the matter.\" Answered the Prince, \"O rascal slave! hadst thou not seen death face to face, never hadst thou confessed to fact nor told me a word; but go now and do thy will, and then come back to me at once and tell me the truth.\" Thereupon the eunuch went out, hardly crediting his escape, and ceased not running, stumbling and rising in his haste, till he came in to King Shahriman, whom he found sitting at talk with his Wazir of Kamar al-Zaman's case. The King was saying to the Minister, \"I slept not last night, for anxiety concerning my son, Kamar al-Zaman and indeed I fear lest some harm befal him in that old tower. What good was there in imprisoning him?\" Answered the Wazir, \"Have no care for him. By Allah, no harm will befal him! None at all! Leave him in prison for a month till his temper yield and his spirit be broken and he return to his senses.\" As the two spoke behold, up rushed the eunuch, in the aforesaid plight, making to the King who was troubled at sight of him; and he cried \"O our lord the Sultan! Verily, thy son's wits are fled and he hath gone mad, he hath dealt with me thus and thus, so that I am become as thou seest me, and he kept saying, 'A young lady lay with me this night and stole away secretly whilst I slept. Where is she?' And he insisteth on my letting him know where she is and on my telling him who took her away. But I have seen neither girl nor boy: the door was locked all through the night, for I slept before it with the key under my head, and I opened to him in the morning with my own hand. When King Shahriman heard this, he cried out, saying, \"Alas, my son!;\" and he was enraged with sore rage against the Wazir, who had been the cause of all this case and said to him, \"Go up, bring me news of my son and see what hath befallen his mind.\" So the Wazir rose and, stumbling over his long skirts, in his fear of the King's wrath, hastened with the slave to the tower. Now the sun had risen and when the Minister came in to Kamar al-Zaman, he found him sitting on the couch reciting the Koran; so he saluted him and seated himself by his side, and said to him, \"O my lord, this wretched eunuch brought us tidings which troubled and alarmed us and which incensed the King.\" Asked Kamar al-Zaman, \"And what hath he told you of me to trouble my father? In good sooth he hath troubled none but me.\" Answered the Wazir, \"He came to us in fulsome state and told us of thee a thing which Heaven forfend; and the slave added a lie which it befitteth not to repeat, Allah preserve thy youth and sound sense and tongue of eloquence, and forbid to come from thee aught of offense!\" Quoth the Prince, \"O Wazir, and what thing did this pestilent slave say of me?\" The Minister replied, \"He told us that thy wits had taken leave of thee and thou wouldst have it that a young lady lay with thee last night, and thou west instant with him to tell thee whither she went and thou diddest torture him to that end.\" But when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was enraged with sore rage and he said to the Wazir, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her per misted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman heard the words of the Wazir he was enraged with sore rage and said to him, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did and forbade him to tell me what became of the young lady who lay with me last night. But thou, O Wazir, art cleverer than the eunuch, so do thou tell me without stay or delay, whither went the young lady who slept on my bosom last night; for it was you who sent her and bade her steep in my embrace and we lay together till dawn; but, when I awoke, I found her not. So where is she now?\" Said the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al-Zaman, Allah's name encompass thee about! By the Almighty, we sent none to thee last night, but thou layest alone, with the door locked on thee and the eunuch sleeping behind it, nor did there come to thee young lady or any other. Regain thy reason, O my lord, and stablish thy senses and occupy not thy mind with vanities.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman who was incensed at his words, \"O Wazir, the young lady in question is my beloved, the fair one with the black eyes and rosy cheeks, whom I held in my arms all last night.\" So the Minister wondered at his words and asked him, \"Didst thou see this damsel last night with shine own eyes on wake or in sleep?\" Answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O ill- omened old man, dost thou fancy I saw her with my ears? Indeed, I saw her with my very eyes and awake, and I touched her with my hand, and I watched by her full half the night, feeding my vision on her beauty and loveliness and grace and tempting looks. But you had schooled her and charged her to speak no word to me; so she feigned sleep and I lay by her side till dawn, when I awoke and found her gone.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al- Zaman, haply thou sawest this in thy sleep; it must have been a delusion of dreams or a deception caused by eating various kinds of food, or a suggestion of the accursed devils.\" Cried the Prince, \"O pestilent old man! wilt thou too make a mock of me and tell me this was haply a delusion of dreams, when that eunuch confessed to the young lady, saying, 'At once I will return to thee and tell thee all about her?'\" With these words, he sprang up and rushed at the Wazir and gripped hold of his beard (which was long[FN#273]) and, after gripping it, he twisted his hand in it and haling him off the couch, threw him on the floor. It seemed to the Minister as though his soul departed his body for the violent plucking at his beard; and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not kicking the Wazir and basting his breast and ribs and cuffing him with open hand on the nape of his neck till he had well-nigh beaten him to death. Then said the old man in his mind, \"Just as the eunuch-slave saved his life from this lunatic youth by telling him a lie, thus it is even fitter that I do likewise; else he will destroy me. So now for my lie to save myself, he being mad beyond a doubt.\" Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O my lord, pardon me; for indeed thy father charged me to conceal from thee this affair of the young lady; but now I am weak and weary and wounded with funding; for I am an old man and lack strength and bottom to endure blows. Have, therefore, a little patience with me and I will tell thee all and acquaint thee with the story of the young woman.\" When the Prince heard this, he left off drubbing him and said, \"Wherefore couldst thou not tell me the tale until after shame and blows? Rise now, unlucky old man that thou art, and tell me her story.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"Say, dost thou ask of the young lady with the fair face and perfect form?\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"Even so! Tell me, O Wazir, who it was that led her to me and laid her by my side, and who was it that took her away from me by night; and let me know forthright whither she is gone, that I myself may go to her at once. If my father did this deed to me that he might try me by means of that beautiful girl, with a view to our marriage, I consent to wed her and free myself of this trouble; for he did all these dealings with me only because I refused wedlock. But now I consent and I say again, I consent to matrimony: so tell this to my father, O Wazir, and advise him to marry me to that young lady; for I will have none other and my heart loveth none save her alone. Now rise up at once and haste thee to my father and counsel him to hurry on our wedding and bring me his answer within this very hour.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"'Tis well!\" and went forth from him, hardly believing himself out of his hands. Then he set off from the tower, walking and tripping up as he went, for excess of fright and agitation, and he ceased not hurrying till he came in to King Shahriman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-nineth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, fared forth from the tower, and ceased not running till he came in to King Shahriman, who said to him as he sighted him, \"O thou Wazir, what man hath brought thee to grief and whose mischief hath treated thee in way unlief; how happeneth it that I see thee dumb foundered and coming to me thus astounded?\" Replied the Wazir, \"O King! I bring thee good news.\" \"And what is it?\" quoth Shahriman, and quoth the Wazir, \"Know that thy son Kamar al- Zaman's wits are clean gone and that he hath become stark mad.\" Now when the King heard these words of the Minister, light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O Wazir, make clear to me the nature of his madness.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O my lord, I hear and I obey.\" Then he told him that such and such had passed and acquainted him with all that his son had done; whereupon the King said to him, \"Hear, O Wazir, the good tidings which I give thee in return for this thy fair news of my son's insanity; and it shall be the cutting off of thy head and the forfeiture of my favour, O most ill-omened of Wazirs and foulest of Emirs! for I feel that thou hast caused my son's disorder by the wicked advice and the sinister counsel thou hast given me first and last. By Allah, if aught of mischief or madness have befallen my son I will most assuredly nail thee upon the palace dome and make thee drain the bitterest draught of death!'' Then he sprang up and, taking the Wazir, with him, fared straight for the tower and entered it. And when Kamar al-Zaman saw the two, he rose to his father in haste from the couch whereon he sat and kissing his hands drew back and hung down his head and stood before him with his arms behind him, and thus remained for a full hour. Then he raised his head towards his sire; the tears gushed from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks and he began repeating,\n\n\"Forgive the sin 'neath which my limbs are trembling,\nFor the slave seeks for mercy from his master;\nI've done a fault, which calls for free confession,\nWhere shall it call for mercy, and forgiveness?''[FN#274]\n\nWhen the King heard this, he arose and embraced his son, and kissing him between the eyes, made him sit by his side on the couch; then he turned to the Wazir, and, looking on him with eyes of wrath, said, \"O dog of Wazirs, how didst thou say of my son such and such things and make my heart quake for him?\" Then he turned to the Prince and said, \"O my son, what is to-day called?\" He answered, \"O my father, this day is the Sabbath, and to morrow is First day: then come Second day, Third, Fourth, Fifth day and lastly Friday.\"[FN#275] Exclaimed the King, \"O my son, O Kamar al-Zaman, praised be Allah for the preservation of thy reason! What is the present month called in our Arabic?\" \"Z\u00fa'l Ka'adah,\" answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"and it is followed by Z\u00fa'l hijjah; then cometh Muharram, then Safar, then Rab\u00ed'a the First and Rab\u00ed'a the Second, the two Jam\u00e1d\u00e1s, Rajab, Sha'aban, Ramaz\u00e1n and Shaww\u00e1l.\" At this the King rejoiced exceedingly and spat in the Wazir's face, saying, \"O wicked old man, how canst thou say that my son is mad? And now none is mad but thou.\" Hereupon the Minister shook his head and would have spoken, but bethought himself to wait awhile and see what might next befal. Then the King said to his child, \"O my son, what words be these thou saddest to the eunuch and the Wazir, declaring, 'I was sleeping with a fair damsel this night?'[FN#276] What damsel is this of whom thou speakest?\" Then Kamar al-Zaman laughed at his father's words and replied, \"O my father, know that I can bear no more jesting; so add me not another mock or even a single word on the matter, for my temper hath waxed short by that you have done with me. And know, O my father, with assured knowledge, that I consent to marry, but on condition that thou give me to wife her who lay by my side this night; for I am certain it was thou sentest her to me and madest me in love with her and then despatchedst a message to her before the dawn and tookest her away from beside me.\" Rejoined the King, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth King Shahriman to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness! What thing be this young lady whom thou fanciest I sent to thee last night and then again that I sent to withdraw her from thee before dawn? By the Lord, O my son, I know nothing of this affair, and Allah upon thee, tell me if it be a delusion of dreaming or a deception caused by indisposition. For verily thou layest down to sleep last night with thy mind occupied anent marriage and troubled with the talk of it (Allah damn marriage and the hour when I spake of it and curse him who counselled it!); and without doubt or diffidence I can say that being moved in mind by the mention of wedlock thou dreamedst that a handsome young lady embraced thee and didst fancy thou sawest her when awake. But all this, O my son, is but an imbroglio of dreams.\" Replied Kamar al-Zaman, \"Leave this talk and swear to me by Allah, the All creator, the Omniscient; the Humbler of the tyrant Caesars and the Destroyer of the Chosroes, that thou knowest naught of the young lady nor of her woning-place.\" Quoth the King, \"By the Might of Allah Almighty, the God of Moses and Abraham, I know naught of all this and never even heard of it; it is assuredly a delusion of dreams thou hast seen in sleep.' Then the Prince replied to his sire, \"I will give thee a self evident proof that it happened to me when on wake.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al Zamar said to his sire, \"I will give thee a self-evident proof that this happened to me when on wake. Now let me ask thee, did it ever befal any man to dream that he was battling a sore battle and after to awake from sleep and find in his hand a sword-blade besmeared with blood? Answered the King, \"No, by Allah, O my son, this hath never been.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, \"I will tell thee what happened to me and it was this. Meseemed I awoke from sleep in the middle of the past night and found a girl lying by my side, whose form was like mine and whose favour was as mine. I embraced her and turned her about with my hand and took her seal- ring, which I put on my finger, and she pulled off my ring and put it on hers. Then I went to sleep by her side, but refrained from her for shame of thee, deeming that thou hadst sent her to me, intending to tempt me with her and incline me to marriage, and suspecting thee to be hidden somewhere whence thou couldst see what I did with her. And I was ashamed even to kiss her on the mouth for thy account, thinking over this temptation to wedlock; and, when I awoke at point of day, I found no trace of her, nor could I come at any news of her, and there befel me what thou knowest of with the eunuch and with the Wazir. How then can this case have been a dream and a delusion, when the ring is a reality? Save for her ring on my finger I should indeed have deemed it a dream; but here is the ring on my little finger: look at it, O King, and see what is its worth.\" So saying he handed the ring to his father, who examined it and turned it over, then looked to his son and said, \"Verily, there is in this ring some mighty mystery and some strange secret. What befel thee last night with the girl is indeed a hard nut to crack, and I know not how intruded upon us this intruder. None is the cause of all this posher save the Wazir; but, Allah upon thee, O my son, take patience, so haply the Lord may turn to gladness this thy grief and to thy sadness bring complete relief: as quoth one of the poets,\n\n'Haply shall Fortune draw her rein, and bring *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fair chance, for she is changeful, jealous, vain:\nStill I may woo my want and wishes win, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And see on heels of care unfair, the fain.'\n\nAnd now, O my son, I am certified at this hour that thou art not mad; but thy case is a strange one which none can clear up for thee save the Almighty.\" Cried the Prince, \"By Allah, O my father, deal kindly with me and seek out this young lady and hasten her coming to me; else I shall die of woe and of my death shall no one know.\" Then he betrayed the ardour of his passion; and turned towards his father and repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"If your promise of personal call prove untrue, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Deign in vision to grant me an interview:\nQuoth they, 'How can phantom[FN#277] appear to the sight *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of a youth, whose sight is fordone, perdue?'\"\n\nThen, after ending his poetry, Kamar al-Zaman again turned to his father, with submission and despondency, and shedding tears in flood, began repeating these lines.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman had repeated to his father these verses, he wept and complained and groaned from a wounded heart; and added these lines,\n\n\"Beware that eye glance which hath magic might; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherever turn those orbs it bars our flight:\nNor be deceived by low sweet voice, that breeds *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    A fever festering in the heart and sprite:\nSo soft that silky skin, were rose to touch it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She'd cry and tear-drops rain for pain and fright:\nDid Zephyr e'en in sleep pass o'er her land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Scented he'd choose to dwell in scented site:\nHer necklets vie with tinkling of her belt; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her wrists strike either wristlet dumb with spite:\nWhen would her bangles buss those rings in ear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Upon the lover's eyne high mysteries 'light:\nI'm blamed for love of her, nor pardon claim; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Eyes are not profiting which lack foresight:\nHeaven strip thee, blamer mine! unjust art thou; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Before this fawn must every eye low bow.\"[FN#278]\n\nAfter which he said, \"By Allah, O my father, I cannot endure to be parted from her even for an hour.\" The King smote hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! No cunning contrivance can profit us in this affair.\" Then he took his son by the hand and carried him to the palace, where Kamar al-Zaman lay down on the bed of languor and the King sat at his head, weeping and mourning over him and leaving him not, night or day, till at last the Wazir came in to him and said, \"O King of the age and the time, how long wilt thou remain shut up with thy son and hide thyself from thy troops. Haply, the order of thy realm may be deranged, by reason of shine absence from thy Grandees and Officers of State. It behoveth the man of understanding, if he have various wounds in his body, to apply him first to medicine the most dangerous; so it is my counsel to thee that thou remove thy son from this place to the pavilion which is in the palace overlooking the sea; and shut thyself up with him there, setting apart in every week two days, Thursday and Monday, for state receptions and progresses and reviews. On these days let shine Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and high Officials and Grandees of the realm and the rest of the levies and the lieges have access to thee and submit their affairs to thee; and do thou their needs and judge among them and give and take with them and bid and forbid. And the rest of the week thou shalt pass with thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and cease not thus doing till Allah shall vouchsafe relief to you twain. Think not, O King, that thou art safe from the shifts of Time and the strokes of Change which come like a traveller in the night; for the wise man is ever on his guard and how well saith the poet,\n\n'Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And fearedst not what ills might bring thee Fate:\nThe Nights so fair and restful cozened thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For peaceful Nights bring woes of heavy weight.\nOh children of mankind whom Time befriends, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware of Time's deceits or soon or late!'''[FN#279]\n\nWhen the Sultan heard his Wazir's words he saw that they were right and deemed his counsel wise, and it had effect upon him for he feared lest the order of the state be deranged; so he rose at once and bade transport his son from his sick room to the pavilion in the palace overlooking the sea. Now this palace was girt round by the waters and was approached by a causeway twenty cubits wide. It had windows on all sides commanding an ocean- view; its floor was paved with parti-coloured marbles and its ceiling was painted in the richest pigments and figured with gold and lapis-lazuli. They furnished it for Kamar al-Zaman with splendid upholstery, embroidered rugs and carpets of the richest silk; and they clothed the walls with choice brocades and hung curtains bespangled with gems of price. In the midst they set him a couch of juniper[FN#280]-wood inlaid with pearls and jewels, and Kamar al-Zaman sat down thereon, but the excess of his concern and passion for the young lady had wasted his charms and emaciated his body; he could neither eat nor drink nor sleep; and he was like a man who had been sick twenty years of sore sickness. His father seated himself at his head, grieving for him with the deepest grief, and every Monday and Thursday he gave his Wazirs and Emirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and Lords of the realm and levies and the rest of his lieges leave to come up to him in that pavilion. So they entered and did their several service and duties and abode with him till the end of the day, when they went their ways and the King returned to his son in the pavilion whom he left not night nor day; and he ceased not doing on this wise for many days and nights. Such was the case with Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman; but as regards Princess Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seven Palaces, when the two Jinns bore her up and laid her on her bed, she slept till daybreak, when she awoke and sitting upright looked right and left, but saw not the youth who had lain in her bosom. At this her vitals fluttered, her reason fled and she shrieked a loud shriek which awoke all her slave girls and nurses and duennas. They flocked in to her; and the chief of them came forward and asked, \"What aileth thee, O my lady?\" Answered the Princess, \"O wretched old woman, where is my beloved, the handsome youth who lay last night in my bosom? Tell me whither he is gone.\" Now when the duenna heard this, the light starkened in her sight and she feared from her mischief with sore affright, and said to her, \"O my Lady Budur, what unseemly words are these?\" Cried the Princess, \"Woe to thee pestilent crone that thou art! I ask thee again where is my beloved, the goodly youth with the shining face and the slender form, the jetty eyes and the joined eyebrows, who lay with me last night from supper-tide until near daybreak?\" She rejoined \"By Allah, O my lady, I have seen no young man nor any other. I conjure thee, carry not this unseemly jest too far lest we all lose our lives; for perhaps the joke may come to thy father's ears and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the duenna bespake the Lady Budur in these words, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady! carry not this unseemly jest too far; for perhaps it may come to thy father's ears, and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\" The Princess rejoined, \"In very sooth a youth lay with me last night, one of the fairest-faced of men.\" Exclaimed the duenna, \"Heaven preserve thy reason! indeed no one lay with thee last night.\" Thereupon the Princess looked at her hand and, finding Kamar al-Zaman's seal-ring on her finger in stead of her own, said to her, \"Woe to thee, thou accursed! thou traitress! wilt thou lie to me and tell me that none lay with me last night and swear to me a falsehood in the name of the Lord?\" Replied the duenna, \"By Allah, I do not lie to thee nor have I sworn falsely.\" Then the Princess was incensed by her words and, drawing a sword she had by her, she smote the old woman with it and slew her;[FN#281] whereupon the eunuch and the waiting-women and the concubines cried out at her, and ran to her father and, without stay or delay, acquainted him with her case. So the King went to her, and asked her, \"O my daughter, what aileth thee?\"; and she answered, \"O my father, where is the youth who lay with me last night?\" Then her reason fled from her head and she cast her eyes right and left and rent her raiment even to the skirt. When her sire saw this, he bade the women lay hands on her; so they seized her and manacled her, then putting a chain of iron about her neck, made her fast to one of the palace-windows and there left her.[FN#282] Thus far concerning Princess Budur; but as regards her father, King Ghayur, the world was straitened upon him when he saw what had befallen his daughter, for that he loved her and her case was not a little grievous to him. So he summoned on it the doctors and astrologers and men skilled in talisman- writing and said to them, \"Whoso healeth my daughter of what ill she hath, I will marry him to her and give him half of my kingdom; but whoso cometh to her and cureth her not, I will strike off his head and hang it over her palace-gate.\" Accordingly, all who went in to her, but failed to heal her, he beheaded and hung their heads over the palace-gates, till he had beheaded on her account forty doctors and crucified forty astrologers; wherefor the general held aloof from her, all the physicians having failed to medicine her malady; and her case was a puzzle to the men of science and the adepts in cabalistic characters. And as her longing and passion redoubled and love and distraction were sore upon her, she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"My fondness, O my moon, for thee my foeman is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to thy comradeship the nights my thought compel:\nIn gloom I bide with fire that flames below my ribs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose lowe I make comparison with heat of Hell:\nI'm plagued with sorest stress of pine and ecstasy; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor clearest noon tide can that horrid pain dispel.\"\n\nThen she sighed and repeated these also,\n\n\"Salams fro' me to friends in every stead; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Indeed to all dear friends do I incline:\nSalams, but not salams that bid adieu; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Salams that growth of good for you design:\nI love you dear, indeed, nor less your land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But bide I far from every need of mine!\"\n\nAnd when the Lady Budur ceased repeating her poetry, she wept till her eyes waxed sore and her cheeks changed form and hue, and in this condition she continued three years. Now she had a foster-brother, by name Marzaw\u00e1n,[FN#283] who was travelling in far lands and absent from her the whole of this time. He loved her with an exceeding love, passing the love of brothers; so when he came back he went in to his mother and asked for his sister, the Princess Budur. She answered him, \"O my son, thy sister hath been smitten with madness and hath passed these three years with a chain of iron about her neck; and all the physicians and men of science have failed of healing her.\" When Marzawan heard these words he said, \"I must needs go in to her; peradventure I may discover what she hath, and be able to medicine her;\" and his mother replied, \"Needs must thou visit her, but wait till to morrow, that I may contrive some thing to suit thy case.\" Then she went a-foot to the palace of the Lady Budur and, accosting the eunuch in charge of the gates, made him a present and said to him, \"I have a daughter, who was brought up with thy mistress and since then I married her; and, when that befel the Princess which befel her, she became troubled and sore concerned, and I desire of thy favour that my daughter may go in to her for an hour and look on her; and then return whence she came, so shall none know of it.\" Quoth the eunuch, \"This may not be except by night, after the King hath visited his child and gone away; then come thou and thy daughter.\" So she kissed the eunuch's hand and, returning home, waited till the morrow at nightfall; and when it was time she arose and sought her son Marzawan and attired him in woman's apparel; then, taking his hand in hers, led him towards the palace, and ceased not walking with him till she came upon the eunuch after the Sultan had ended his visit to the Princess. Now when the eunuch saw her, he rose to her, and said, \"Enter, but do not prolong thy stay!\" So they went in and when Marzawan beheld the Lady Budur in the aforesaid plight, he saluted her, after his mother had doffed his woman's garb: then he took out of their satchel books he had brought with him; and, lighting a wax- candle, he began to recite certain conjurations Thereupon the Princess looked at him and recognising him, said, \"O my brother, thou hast been absent on thy travels' and thy news have been cut off from us.\" He replied, \"True! but Allah hath brought me back safe and sound, I am now minded to set out again nor hath aught delayed me but the news I hear of thee; wherefore my heart burned for thee and I came to thee, so haply I may free thee of thy malady.\" She rejoined, O my brother, thinkest thou it is madness aileth me?\" \"Yes.\" answered he, and she said, \"Not so, by Allah! 'tis even as saith the poet,\n\n'Quoth they 'Thou rav'st on him thou lov'st': quoth I, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'The sweets of love are only for th' insane!'\nLove never maketh Time his friend befriend; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Only the Jinn-struck wight such boon can gain:\nWell! yes, I'm mad: bring him who madded me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, if he cure m: madness, blame restrain!'\"\n\nThen she let Marzawan know that she was love-daft and he said \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply there may be in my hand something which shall be a means of deliverance for thee.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of da, and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Marzawar thus addressed Princess Budur, \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply Allah may inspire me with a means of deliverance for thee.\" Quoth she, \"O my brother, hear my story which is this. One night I awoke from sleep, in the last third of the night[FN#284] and, sitting up, saw by my side the handsomest of youths that be, and tongue faileth to describe him, for he was as a willow-wand or an Indian rattan-cane. So methought it was my father who had done on this wise in order thereby to try me, for that he had consulted me concerning wedlock, when the Kings sought me of him to wife, and I had refused. It was this though withheld me from arousing him, for I feared that, if I did aught of embraced him, he would peradventure inform my father of m, doings. But in the morning, I found on my finger his seal-ring, in place of my own which he had taken. And, O my brother, m, heart was seized with love of him at first sight; and, for the violence of my passion and longing, I have never savoured the taste of sleep and have no occupation save weeping alway and repeating verses night and day. And this, O my brother, is my story and the cause of my madness.\" Then she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Now Love hast banished all that bred delight; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With that heart-nibbling fawn my joys took flight:\nLightest of trifles lover's blood to him *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who wastes the vitals of the hapless wight!\nFor him I'm jealous of my sight and thought; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart acts spy upon my thought and sight:\nThose long-lashed eyelids rain on me their shafts *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Guileful, destroying hearts where'er they light:\nNow, while my portion in the world endures, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall I behold him ere I quit world-site?\nWhat bear I for his sake I'd hide, but tears *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Betray my feelings to the spy's despight.\nWhen near, our union seemeth ever far; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When far, my thoughts to him aye nearest are.\"\n\nAnd presently she continued, \"See then, O my brother, how thou mayest aid me in mine affliction.\" So Marzawan bowed his head ground-wards awhile, wondering and not knowing what to do, then he raised it and said to her, \"All thou hast spoken to me I hold to be true, though the case of the young man pass my understanding: but I will go round about all lands and will seek for what may heal thee; haply Allah shall appoint thy healing to be at my hand. Meanwhile, take patience and be not disquieted.\" Thereupon Marzawan farewelled her, praying that she might be constant and left her repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Thine image ever companies my sprite, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    For all thou'rt distant from the pilgrim's sight:\nBut my heart-wishes e'er attract thee near: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    What is the lightning's speed to Thought's swift flight?\nThen go not thou, my very light of eyes *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which, when thou'rt gone, lack all the Kohl of light.\"\n\nThen Marzawan returned to his mother's house, where he passed the night. And when the morrow dawned, having equipped himself for his journey, he fared forth and ceased not faring from city to city and from island to island for a whole month, till he came to a town named Al-Tayrab.[FN#285] Here he went about scenting news of the townsfolk, so haply he might light on a cure for the Princess's malady, for in every capital he entered or passed by, it was reported that Queen Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, had lost her wits. But arriving at Al-Tayrab city, he heard that Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, was fallen sick and afflicted with melancholy madness. So Marzawan asked the name of the Prince's capital and they said to him, \"It is on the Islands of Khalidan and it lieth distant from our city a whole month's journey by sea, but by land it is six months' march.\" So he went down to the sea in a ship which was bound for the Khalidan Isles, and she sailed with a favouring breeze for a whole month, till they came in sight of the capital; and there remained for them but to make the land when, behold, there came out on them a tempestuous wind which carried away the masts and rent the canvas, so that the sails fell into the sea and the ship capsized, with all on board,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship capsized with all on board, each sought his own safety; and as for Marzawan the set of the sea carried him under the King's palace, wherein was Kamar al-Zaman. And by the decree of destiny it so happened that this was the day on which King Shahriman gave audience to his Grandees and high officers, and he was sitting, with his son's head on his lap, whilst an eunuch fanned away the flies; and the Prince had not spoken neither had he eaten nor drunk for two days, and he was grown thinner than a spindle.[FN#286] Now the Wazir was standing respectfully a-foot near the latticed window giving on the sea and, raising his eyes, saw Marzawan being beaten by the billows and at his last gasp; whereupon his heart was moved to pity for him, so he drew near to the King and moving his head towards him said, \"I crave thy leave, O King, to go down to the court of the pavilion and open the water-gate that I may rescue a man who is at the point of drowning in the sea and bring him forth of danger into deliverance; peradventure, on this account Allah may free thy son from what he hath!\" The King replied, \"O thou Wazir, enough is that which hath befallen my son through thee and on shine account. Haply, if thou rescue this drowning man, he will come to know our affairs, and look on my son who is in this state and exult over me; but I swear by Allah, that if this half-drowned wretch come hither and learn our condition and look upon my son and then fare forth and speak of our secrets to any, I will assuredly strike off thy head before his; for thou, O my Minister art the cause of all that hath betided us, first and last. Now do as thou wilt.\" Thereupon the Wazir sprang up and, opening the private pastern which gave upon the sea, descended to the causeway; then walked on twenty steps and came to the water where he saw Marzawan nigh unto death. So he put out his hand to him and, catching him by his hair, drew him ashore in a state of insensibility, with belly full of water and eyes half out of his head. The Wazir waited till he came to himself, when he pulled off his wet clothes and clad him in a fresh suit, covering his head with one of his servants' turbands; after which he said to him, Know that I have been the means of saving thee from drowning: do not thou requite me by causing my death and shine own.\"\u00c4And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir did to Marzawan what he did, he thus addressed him Know that I have been the cause of saving thee from drowning so requite me not by causing my death and shine own.\" Asked Marzawan, And how so?\"; and the Wazir answered, \"Thou art at this hour about to go up and pass among Emirs and Wazirs all of them silent and none speaking, because of Kamar al-Zaman the son of the Sultan.\" Now when Marzawan heard the name of Kamar al-Zaman, he knew that this was he whom he had heard spoken of in sundry cities and of whom he came in search, but he feigned ignorance and asked the Wazir, \"And who is Kamar al-Zaman? Answered the Minister, \"He is the son of Sultan Shahriman and he is sore sick and lieth strown on his couch restless alway, eating not nor drinking neither sleeping night or day; indeed he is nigh upon death and we have lost hope of his living and are certain that he is dying. Beware lest thou look too long on him, or thou look on any other than that where thou settest thy feet: else thou art a lost man, and I also.\" He replied, \"Allah upon thee, O Wazir, I implore thee, of thy favour, acquaint me touching this youth thou describest, what is the cause of the condition in which he is.\" The Wazir replied, \"I know none, save that, three years ago, his father required him to wed, but he refused; whereat the King was wroth and imprisoned him. And when he awoke on the morrow, he fancied that during the night he had been roused from sleep and had seen by his side a young lady of passing loveliness, whose charms tongue can never express; and he assured us that he had plucked off her seal-ring from her finger and had put it on his own and that she had done likewise; but we know not the secret of all this business. So by Allah, O my son, when thou comest up with me into the palace, look not on the Prince, but go thy way; for the Sultan's heart is full of wrath against me.\" So said Marzawan to himself, \"By Allah; this is the one I sought!\" Then he followed the Wazir up to the palace, where the Minister seated himself at the Prince's feet; but Marzawan found forsooth nothing to do but go up to Kamar al-Zaman and stand before him at gaze. Upon this the Wazir, died of affright in his skin, and kept looking at Marzawan and signalling him to wend his way; but he feigned not to see him and gave not over gazing upon Kamar al- Zaman, till he was well assured that it was indeed he whom he was seeking,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan looked upon Kamar al-Zaman and knew that it was indeed he whom he was seeking, he cried, \"Exalted be Allah, Who hath made his shape even as her shape and his complexion as her complexion and his cheek as her cheek!'' Upon this Kamar al-Zaman opened his eyes and gave earnest ear to his speech; and, when Marzawan saw him inclining to hear, he repeated these couplets[FN#287],\n\n\"I see thee full of song and plaint and love's own ecstasy;\nDelighting in describing all the charms of loveliness:\n\nArt smit by stroke of Love or hath shaft-shot wounded thee?\nNone save the wounded ever show such signals of distress!\nHo thou! crown the wine cup and sing me singular\nPraises to Sulaym\u00e1, Al-Rab\u00e1b, Tan'oum addrest;[FN#288]\n\nGo round the grape-vine sun[FN#289] which for mansion hath a jar;\nWhose East the cup boy is, and here my mouth that opes for West.\n\nI'm jealous of the very clothes that dare her sides enroll\nWhen she veils her dainty body of the delicatest grace:\n\nI envy every goblet of her lips that taketh toll\nWhen she sets the kissing cup on that sweetest kissing-place.\n\nBut deem not by the keen-edged scymitar I'm slain\u2014\nThe hurts and harms I dree are from arrows of her eyes.\n\nI found her finger tips, as I met her once again,\nDeep-reddened with the juice of the wood that ruddy dyes;[FN#290]\n\nAnd cried, 'Thy palms thou stainedst when far away was I\nAnd this is how thou payest one distracted by his pine!'\n\nQuoth she (enkindling in my heart a flame that burned high\nSpeaking as one who cannot hide of longing love the sign),\n\n'By thy life, this is no dye used for dyeing; so forbear\nThy blame, nor in charging me with falsing Love persist!\n\nBut when upon our parting-day I saw thee haste to fare,\n\nThe while were bared my hand and my elbow and my wrist;\n\n'I shed a flood of blood-red tears and with fingers brushed away; Hence blood-reddened were the tips and still blood-red they remain.'\n\nHad I wept before she wept, to my longing-love a prey,\nBefore repentance came, I had quit my soul of pain;\n\nBut she wept before I wept and I wept to see her care\nAnd I said, 'All the merit to precedent;'[FN#291]\n\nBlame me not for loving her, now on self of Love I swear\nFor her sake, for her only, these pains my soul torment.\n\nShe hath all the lere of Lukm\u00e1n[FN#292] and Y\u00fasuf's beauty lief;\nSweet singer David's voice and Maryam's chastity:\n\nWhile I've all Jacob's mourning and Jonah's prison-grief,\nAnd the sufferings of Job and old Adam's history:\n\nYet kill her not, albeit of my love for her I die;\nBut ask her why my blood to her was lawful. ask her why?\"\n\nWhen Marzawan recited this ode, the words fell upon Kamar al- Zaman's heart as freshness after fever and returning health; and he sighed and, turning his tongue in his mouth, said to his sire, \"O my father, let this youth come and sit by my side.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to his sire, \"O my father, allow this youth to come and sit by my side.\" Now when the King heard these words from his son, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, though at the first his heart had been set against Marzawan and he had determined that the stranger's head needs must be stricken off: but when he heard Kamar al-Zaman speak, his anger left him and he arose and drawing Marzawan to him, seated him by his son and turning to him said, \"Praised be Allah for thy safety!\" He replied, \"Allah preserve thee! and preserve thy son to thee!\" and called down blessings on the King. Then the King asked, \"From what country art thou?\"; and he answered, \"From the Islands of the Inland Sea, the kingdom of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas and the Seven Palaces.\" Quoth King Shahriman, \"Maybe thy coming shall be blessed to my son and Allah vouchsafe to heal what is in him.\" Quoth Marzawan, \"Inshallah, naught shall be save what shall be well!\" Then turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he said to him in his ear unheard of the King and his court, 'O my lord! be of good cheer, and hearten thy heart and let shine eyes be cool and clear and, with respect to her for whose sake thou art thus, ask not of her case on shine account. But thou keptest thy secret and fellest sick, while she told her secret and they said she had gone mad; so she is now in prison, with an iron chain about her neck, in most piteous plight; but, Allah willing, the healing of both of you shall come from my hand.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, his life returned to him and he took heart and felt a thrill of joy and signed to his father to help him sit up; and the King was like to fly for gladness and rose hastily and lifted him up. Presently, of his fear for his son, he shook the kerchief of dismissal[FN#293]; and all the Emirs and Wazirs withdrew; then he set two pillows for his son to lean upon, after which he bade them perfume the palace with saffron and decorate the city, saying to Marzawan, \"By Allah, O my son, of a truth shine aspect be a lucky and a blessed!\" And he made as much of him as he might and called for food, and when they brought it, Marzawan came up to the Prince and said, \"Rise, eat with me.\" So he obeyed him and ate with him, and all the while the King invoked blessings on Marzawan and said, \"How auspicious is thy coming, O my son!\" And when the father saw his boy eat, his joy and gladness redoubled, and he went out and told the Prince's mother and all the household. Then he spread throughout the palace the good news of the Prince's recovery and the King commanded the decoration of the city and it was a day of high festival. Marzawan passed that night with Kamar al-Zaman, and the King also slept with them in joy and delight for his son's recovery.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman also passed that night with them in the excess of his joy for his son's recovery. And when the next morning dawned, and the King had gone away and the two young men were left alone, Kamar al-Zaman told his story from beginning to end to Marzawan who said, \"In very sooth I know her with whom thou didst foregather; her name is the Princess Budur and she is daughter to King Ghayur.\" Then he related to him all that had passed with the Princess from first to last and acquainted him with the excessive love she bore him, saying, \"All that befel thee with thy father hath befallen her with hers, and thou art without doubt her beloved, even as she is shine; so brace up thy resolution and take heart, for I will bring thee to her and unite you both anon and deal with you even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Albe to lover adverse be his love, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And show aversion howso may he care;\nYet will I manage that their persons[FN#294] meet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'en as the pivot of a scissor pair.\"\n\nAnd he ceased not to comfort and solace and encourage Kamar al- Zaman and urged him to eat and drink till he ate food and drank wine, and life returned to him and he was saved from his ill case; and Marzawan cheered him and diverted him with talk and songs and stories, and in good time he became free of his disorder and stood up and sought to go to the Hammam.[FN#295] So Marzawan took him by the hand and both went to the bath, where they washed their bodies and made them clean.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundredth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, went to the Hammam, his father in his joy at this event freed the prisoners, and presented splendid dresses to his grandees and bestowed large alm-gifts upon the poor and bade decorate the city seven days. Then quoth Marzawan to Kamar al-Zaman, \"Know, O my lord, that I came not from the Lady Budur save for this purpose, and the object of my journey was to deliver her from her present case; and it remaineth for us only to devise how we may get to her, since thy father cannot brook the thought of parting from thee. So it is my counsel that to-morrow thou ask his leave to go abroad hunting. Then do thou take with thee a pair of saddle-bags full of money and mount a swift steed, and lead a spare horse, and I will do the like, and say to thy sire, 'I have a mind to divert myself with hunting the desert and to see the open country and there to pass one night.' Suffer not any servant to follow us, for as soon as we reach the open country, we will go our ways.\" Kamar al- Zaman rejoiced in this plan with great joy and cried, \"It is good.\" Then he stiffened his back and, going in to his father, sought his leave and spoke as he had been taught, and the King consented to his going forth a-hunting and said, \"O my son, blessed be the day that restoreth thee to health! I will not gainsay thee in this; but pass not more than one night in the desert and return to me on the morrow; for thou knowest that life is not good to me without thee, and indeed I can hardly believe thee to be wholly recovered from what thou hadst,[FN#296] because thou art to me as he of whom quoth the poet,\n\n'Albe by me I had through day and night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Solomon's carpet and the Chosroes' might,\nBoth were in value less than wing of gnat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unless these eyne could hold thee aye in sight.'\"[FN#297]\n\nThen the King equipped his son Kamar al-Zaman and Marzawan for the excursion, bidding make ready for them four horses, together with a dromedary to carry the money and a camel to bear the water and belly timber; and Kamar al-Zaman forbade any of his attendants to follow him. His father farewelled him and pressed him to his breast and kissed him, saying, \"I ask thee in the name of Allah, be not absent from me more than one night, wherein sleep will be unlawful to me, for I am even as saith the poet,\n\n'Thou present, in the Heaven of heavens I dwell; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Bearing shine absence is of hells my Hell:\nPledged be for thee my soul! If love for thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be crime, my crime is of the fellest fell.\nDoes love-lowe burn thy heart as burns it mine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Doomed night and day Gehenna-fire to smell?'\"\n\nAnswered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O my father, Inshallah, I will lie abroad but one night!\" Then he took leave of him, and he and Marzawan mounted and leading the spare horses, the dromedary with the money and the camel with the water and victual, turned their faces towards the open country;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawning day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and First Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman and Marzawan fared forth and turned their faces towards the open country; and they travelled from the first of the day till nightfall, when they halted and ate and drank and fed their beasts and rested awhile; after which they again took horse and ceased not journeying for three days, and on the fourth they came to a spacious tract wherein was a thicket. They alighted in it and Marzawan, taking the camel and one of the horses, slaughtered them and cut off their flesh and stripped their bones. Then he doffed from Kamar al-Zaman his shirt and trousers which he smeared with the horse's blood and he took the Prince's coat which he tore to shreds and befouled with gore; and he cast them down in the fork of the road. Then they ate and drank and mounting set forward again; and, when Kamar al- Zaman asked why this was done, and said, \"What is this O my brother, and how shall it profit us?\"; Marzawan replied, \"Know that thy father, when we have outstayed the second night after the night for which we had his leave, and yet we return not, will mount and follow in our track till he come hither; and, when he happeneth upon this blood which I have spilt and he seeth thy shirt and trousers rent and gore-fouled, he will fancy that some accident befel thee from bandits or wild-beasts, so he will give up hope of thee and return to his city, and by this device we shall win our wishes.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"By Allah, this be indeed a rare device! Thou hast done right well.''[FN#298] Then the two fared on days and nights and all that while Kamar al-Zaman did naught but complain when he found himself alone, and he ceased not weeping till they drew near their journeys end, when he rejoiced and repeated these verses,\n\n\"Wilt tyrant play with truest friend who thinks of thee each\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     hour, * And after showing love-desire betray indifference?\nMay I forfeit every favour if in love I falsed thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thee I left, abandon me by way of recompense:\nBut I've been guilty of no crime such harshness to deserve, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if I aught offended thee I bring my penitence;\nOf Fortune's wonders one it is thou hast abandoned me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Fortune never wearieth of showing wonderments.\"\n\nWhen he had made an end of his verses, Marzawan said to him, \"Look! these be King Ghayur's Islands;\" whereat Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done, and kissed him between the eyes and strained him\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan said \"Look! these be the Islands of King Ghayur;\" Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done and kissed him between the eyes and strained him to his bosom. And after reaching the Islands and entering the city they took up their lodging in a khan, where they rested three days from the fatigues of their wayfare; after which Marzawan carried Kamar al-Zaman to the bath and, clothing him in merchant's gear, provided him with a geomantic tablet of gold,[FN#299] with a set of astrological instruments and with an astrolabe of silver, plated with gold. Then he said to him, \"Arise, O my lord, and take thy stand under the walls of the King's palace and cry out, 'I am the ready Reckoner; I am the Scrivener; I am he who weeteth the Sought and the Seeker; I am the finished man of Science; I am the Astrologer accomplished in experience! Where then is he that seeketh?' As soon as the King heareth this, he will send after thee and carry thee in to his daughter the Princess Budur, thy lover; but when about going in to her do thou say to him, 'Grant me three days' delay, and if she recover, give her to me to wife; and if not, deal with me as thou dealest with those who forewent me.' He will assuredly agree to this, so as soon as thou art alone with her, discover thyself to her; and when she seeth thee, she will recover strength and her madness will cease from her and she will be made whole in one night. Then do thou give her to eat and drink. and her father, rejoicing in her recovery, will marry thee to her and share his kingdom with thee; for he hath imposed on himself this condition and so peace be upon thee.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words he exclaimed, \"May I never lack thy benefits!\", and, taking the set of instruments aforesaid, sallied forth from the caravanserai in the dress of his order. He walked on till he stood under the walls of King Ghayur's palace, where he began to cry out, saying, \"I am the Scribe, I am the ready Reckoner, I am he who knoweth the Sought and the Seeker; I am he who openeth the Volume and summeth up the Sums;[FN#300] who Dreams can expound whereby the sought is found! Where then is the seeker?\" Now when the city people heard this, they flocked to him, for it was long since they had seen Scribe or Astrologer, and they stood round him and, looking upon him, they saw one in the prime of beauty and grace and perfect elegance, and they marvelled at his loveliness, and his fine stature and symmetry. Presently one of them accosted him and said, \"Allah upon thee, O thou fair and young, with the eloquent tongue! incur not this affray; nor throw thy life away in thine ambition to marry the Princess Budur. Only cast shine eyes upon yonder heads hung up; all their owners have lost their lives in this same venture.\" Yet Kamar al-Zaman paid no heed to them, but cried out at the top of his voice, saying, \"I am the Doctor, the Scrivener! I am the Astrologer, the Calculator!\" And all the townsfolk forbade him from this, but he regarded them not at all, saying in his mind, \"None knoweth desire save whoso suffereth it.\" Then he began again to cry his loudest, shouting, \"I am the Scrivener, I am the Astrologer!\"\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman in no wise heeded the words of the citizens, but continued to cry out, \"I am the Calculator! I am the Astrologer!\" Thereupon all the townsfolk were wroth with him and said to him, \"Thou art nothing but an imbecile, silly, self-willed lad! Have pity on shine own youth and tender years and beauty and loveliness.\" But he cried all the more, \"I am the Astrologer, I am the Calculator! Is there any one that seeketh?\" As he was thus crying and the people forbidding him, behold, King Ghayur heard his voice and the clamour of the lieges and said to his Wazir, \"Go down and bring me yon Astrologer.\" So the Wazir, went down in haste, and taking Kamar al-Zaman from the midst of the crowd led him up to the King; and when in the presence he kissed the ground and began versifying,\n\n\"Eight glories meet, all, all conjoined in thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby may Fortune aye thy servant be:\nLere, lordliness, grace, generosity; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Plain words, deep meaning, honour, victory!\"\n\nWhen the King looked upon him, he seated him by his side and said to him, \"By Allah, O my son, an thou be not an astrologer, venture not thy life nor comply with my condition; for I have bound myself that whoso goeth in to my daughter and healeth her not of that which hath befallen her I will strike off his head; but whoso healeth her him I will marry to her. So let not thy beauty and loveliness delude thee: for, by Allah! and again, by Allah! If thou cure her not, I will assuredly cut off thy head.\" And Kamar al-Zaman replied, \"This is thy right; and I consent, for I wot of this ere came I hither.\" Then King Ghayur took the Kazis to witness against him and delivered him to the eunuch, saying, \"Carry this one to the Lady Budur.\" So the eunuch took him by the hand and led him along the passage; but Kamar al-Zaman outstripped him and pushed on before, whilst the eunuch ran after him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Hasten not to shine own ruin: never yet saw I astrologer so eager for his proper destruction; but thou weetest not what calamities are before thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman turned away his face from the eunuch,\u2014And Shah razed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the eunuch thus addressed Kamar al-Zaman, \"Patience, and no indecent hurry!\"; the Prince turned away his face and began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"A Sage, I feel a fool before thy charms; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Distraught, I wot not what the words I say:\nIf say I 'Sun,' away thou dost not pass *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From eyes of me, while suns go down with day:\nThou hast completed Beauty, in whose praise *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Speech-makers fail, and talkers lose their way.\"\n\nThen the eunuch stationed Kamar al-Zaman behind the curtain of the Princess's door and the Prince said to him, \"Which of the two ways will please thee more, treat and cure thy lady from here or go in and heal her within the curtain?\" The eunuch marvelled at his words and answered, \"An thou heal her from here it were better proof of thy skill.\" Upon this Kamar al-Zaman sat down behind the curtain and, taking out ink case, pen and paper, wrote the following: \"This is the writ of one whom passion swayeth,* and whom longing waylayeth * and wakeful misery slayeth * one who despaireth of living * and looketh for naught but dying * with whose mourning heart * nor comforter nor helper taketh part * One whose sleepless eyes * none succoureth from anxieties * whose day is passed in fire * and his night in torturing desire * whose body is wasted for much emaciation * and no messenger from his beloved bringeth him consolation.\" And after this he indited the following couplets,\n\n\"I write with heart devoted to thy thought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And eyelids chafed by tears of blood they bled;\nAnd body clad, by loving pine and pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In shirt of leanness, and worn down to thread,\nTo thee complain I of Love's tormentry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which ousted hapless Patience from her stead:\nA toi! show favour and some mercy deign, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For Passion's cruel hands my vitals shred.\"\n\nAnd beneath his lines he wrote these cadenced sentences, \"The heart's pain is removed * by union with the beloved * and whomso his lover paineth * only Allah assaineth! * If we or you have wrought deceit * may the deceiver win defeat! * There is naught goodlier than a lover who keeps faith * with the beloved who works him scathe.\" Then, by way of subscription, he wrote, \"From the distracted and despairing man * whom love and longing trepan * from the lover under passion's ban * the prisoner of transport and distraction * from this Kamar al-Zaman * son of Shahriman * to the peerless one * of the fair Houris the pearl-union * to the Lady Budur * daughter of King Al Ghayur * Know thou that by night I am sleepless * and by day in distress * consumed with increasing wasting and pain * and longing and love unfain * abounding in sighs * with tear flooded eyes * by passion captive ta'en * of Desire the slain * with heart seared by the parting of us twain * the debtor of longing bane, of sickness cup-companion * I am the sleepless one, who never closeth eye * the slave of love, whose tears run never dry * for the fire of my heart is still burning * and never hidden is the flame of my yearning.\" Then on the margin Kamar al-Zaman wrote this admired verse,\n\n\"Salem from graces hoarded by my Lord *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To her, who holds my heart and soul in hoard!\"\n\nAnd also these,\n\n\"Pray'ee grant me some words from your lips, belike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Such mercy may comfort and cool these eyne:\nFrom the stress of my love and my pine for you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I make light of what makes me despised, indign:\nAllah guard a folk whose abode was far, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And whose secret I kept in the holiest shrine:\nNow Fortune in kindness hath favoured me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thrown on threshold dust of this love o' mine:\nBy me bedded I looked on Bud\u00far, whose sun *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The moon of my fortunes hath made to shine.\"\n\nThen, having affixed his seal-ring to the missive, he wrote these couplets in the place of address,\n\n\"Ask of my writ what wrote my pen in dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And hear my tale of misery from this scroll;\nMy hand is writing while my tears down flow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to the paper 'plains my longing soul:\nMy tears cease not to roll upon this sheet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if they stopped I'd cause blood-gouts to roll.\"\n\nAnd at the end he added this other verse,\n\n\"I've sent the ring from off thy finger bore *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I when we met, now deign my ring restore!\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman set the Lady Budur's ring inside the letter and sealed it and gave it to the eunuch, who took it and went in with it to his mistress.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman, after setting the seal-ring inside the epistle, gave it to the eunuch who took it and went in with it to his mistress; and, when the Lady Budur opened it, she found therein her own very ring. Then she read the paper and when she understood its purport and knew that it was from her beloved, and that he in person stood behind the curtain, her reason began to fly and her breast swelled for joy and rose high; and she repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Long, long have I bewailed the sev'rance of our loves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With tears that from my lids streamed down like burning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rain;\nAnd vowed that, if the days deign reunite us two, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My lips should never speak of severance again:\nJoy hath o'erwhelmed me so that, for the very stress *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of that which gladdens me to weeping I am fain.\nTears are become to you a habit, O my eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So that ye weep as well for gladness as for pain.''[FN#301]\n\nAnd having finished her verse, the Lady Budur stood up forthwith and, firmly setting her feet to the wall, strained with all her might upon the collar of iron, till she brake it from her neck and snapped the chains. Then going forth from behind the curtain she threw herself on Kamar al-Zaman and kissed him on the mouth, like a pigeon feeding its young.[FN#302] And she embraced him with all the stress of her love and longing and said to him, \"O my lord do I wake or sleep and hath the Almighty indeed vouchsafe] us reunion after disunion? Laud be to Allah who hath our loves repaired, even after we despaired!\" Now when the eunuch saw her in this case, he went off running to King Ghayur and, kissing the ground before him, said, \"O my lord, know that this Astrologer is indeed the Shaykh of all astrologers, who are fools to him, all of them; for verily he hath cured thy daughter while standing behind the curtain and without going in to her.\" Quoth the King, \"Look well to it, is this news true?\" Answered the eunuch, \"O my lord, rise and come and see for thyself how she hath found strength to break the iron chains and is come forth to the Astrologer, kissing and embracing him.\" Thereupon the King arose and went in to his daughter who, when she saw him, stood up in haste and covered her head,[FN#303] and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"The toothstick love I not; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Siw\u00e1k,'[FN#304] I miss thee, for it sounds 'Siw\u00e1-ka'.\nThe caper-tree I love; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Ar\u00e1k'[FN#305] it sounds I look on thee, 'Ar\u00e1-ka.'\"\n\nThereupon the King was so transported for joy at her recovery that he felt like to fly and kissed her between the eyes, for he loved her with dearest love; then, turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he asked him who he was, and said, \"What countryman art thou?\" So the Prince told him his name and rank, and informed him that he was the son of King Shahriman, and presently related to him the whole story from beginning to end; and acquainted him with what happened between himself and the Lady Budur; and how he had taken her seal-ring from her finger and had placed it on his own; whereat Ghayur marvelled and said, \"Verily your story deserveth in books to be chronicled, and when you are dead and gone age after age be read.\" Then he summoned Kazis and witnesses forthright and married the Lady Budur to Prince Kamar al-Zaman; after which he bade decorate the city seven days long. So they spread the tables with all manner of meats, whilst the drums beat and the criers anounced the glad tidings, and all the troops donned their richest clothes; and they illuminated the city and held high festival. Then Kamar al-Zaman went in to the Lady Budur and the King rejoiced in her recovery and in her marriage; and praised Allah for that He had made her to fall in love with a goodly youth of the sons of Kings. So they unveiled her and displayed the bride before the bridegroom; and both were the living likeness of each other in beauty and comeliness and grace and love-allurement. Then Kamar al-Zaman lay with her that night and took his will of her, whilst she in like manner fulfilled her desire of him and enjoyed his charms and grace; and they slept in each other's arms till the morning. On the morrow, the King made a wedding-feast to which he gathered all comers from the Islands of the Inner and Outer Seas, and he spread the tables with choicest viands nor ceased the banquetting for a whole month. Now when Kamar al-Zaman had thus fulfilled his will and attained his inmost desire, and whenas he had tarried awhile with the Princess Budur, he bethought him of his father, King Shahriman, and saw him in a dream, saying, \"O my son, is it thus thou dealest with me?\" and recited in the vision these two couplets,\n\n\"Indeed to watch the darkness-moon he blighted me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to star-gaze through longsome night he plighted me:\nEasy, my heart! for haply he'll unite with thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And patience, Sprite! with whatso ills he dight to thee.\"\n\nNow after seeing his father in the dream and hearing his re preaches, Kamar al-Zaman awoke in the morning, afflicted and troubled, whereupon the Lady Budur questioned him and he told her what he had seen.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman acquainted the Lady Budur with what he had seen in his dream, she and he went in to her sire and, telling him what had passed, besought his leave to travel. He gave the Prince the permission he sought; but the Princess said, \"O my father, I cannot bear to be parted from him.\" Quoth Ghayur, her sire, \"Then go thou with him,\" and gave her leave to be absent a whole twelvemonth and afterwards to visit him in every year once; so she kissed his hand and Kamar al-Zaman did the like. Thereupon King Ghayur proceeded to equip his daughter and her bridegroom for the journey, and furnished them with outfit and appointments for the march; and brought out of his stables horses marked with his own brand, blood-dromedaries[FN#306] which can journey ten days without water, and prepared a litter for his daughter, besides loading mules and camels with victual; moreover, he gave them slaves and eunuchs to serve them and all manner of travellinggear; and on the day of departure, when King Ghayur took leave of Kamar al-Zaman, he bestowed on him ten splendid suits of cloth of gold embroidered with stones of price, together with ten riding horses and ten she-camels, and a treasury of money;[FN#307] and he charged him to love and cherish his daughter the Lady Budur. Then the King accompanied them to the farthest limits of his Islands where, going in to his daughter Budur in the litter, he kissed her and strained her to his bosom, weeping and repeating,\n\n\"O thou who wooest Severance, easy fare! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For love-embrace belongs to lover-friend:\nFare softly! Fortune's nature falsehood is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And parting shall love's every meeting end.\"\n\nThen leaving his daughter, he went to her husband and bade him farewell and kissed him; after which he parted from them and, giving the order for the march he returned to his capital with his troops. The Prince and Princess and their suite fared on without stopping through the first day and the second and the third and the fourth, nor did they cease faring for a whole month till they came to a spacious champaign, abounding in pasturage, where they pitched their tents; and they ate and drank and rested, and the Princess Budur lay down to sleep. Presently, Kamar al-Zaman went in to her and found her lying asleep clad in a shift of apricot-coloured silk that showed all and everything; and on her head was a coif of gold-cloth embroidered with pearls and jewels. The breeze raised her shift which laid bare her navel and showed her breasts and displayed a stomach whiter than snow, each one of whose dimples would contain an ounce of benzoin- ointment.[FN#308] At this sight, his love and longing redoubled, and he began reating,\n\n\"An were it asked me when by hell-fire burnt, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When flames of heart my vitals hold and hem,\n'Which wouldst thou chose, say wouldst thou rather them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or drink sweet cooling draught?' I'd answer, 'Them!' \"\n\nThen he put his hand to the band of her petticoat-trousers and drew it and loosed it, for his soul lusted after her, when he saw a jewel, red as dye-wood, made fast to the band. He untied it and examined it and, seeing two lines of writing graven thereon, in a character not to be read, marvelled and said in his mind, \"Were not this bezel something to her very dear she had not bound it to her trousers-band nor hidden it in the most privy and precious place about her person, that she might not be parted from it. Would I knew what she cloth with this and what is the secret that is in it.\" So saying, he took it and went outside the tent to look at it in the light,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he took the bezel to look at it in the light, the while he was holding it behold, a bird swooped down on him and, snatching the same from his hand, flew off with it and then lighted on the ground. There-upon Kamar al-Zaman fearing to lose the jewel, ran after the bird; but it flew on before him, keeping just out of his reach, and ceased not to draw him on from dale to dale and from hill to hill, till the night starkened and the firmament darkened, when it roosted on a high tree. So Kamar al-Zaman stopped under the tree confounded in thought and faint for famine and fatigue, and giving himself up for lost, would have turned back, but knew not the way whereby he came, for that darkness had overtaken him. Then he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious the Great!\"; and laying him down under the tree (whereon was the bird) slept till the morning, when he awoke and saw the bird also wake up and fly away. He arose and walked after it, and it flew on little by little before him, after the measure of his faring; at which he smiled and said, \"By Allah, a strange thing! Yesterday, this bird flew before me as fast as I could run, and to-day, knowing that I have awoke tired and cannot run, he flieth after the measure of my faring. By Allah, this is wonderful! But I must needs follow this bird whether it lead me to death or to life; and I will go wherever it goeth, for at all events it will not abide save in some inhabited land.[FN#309] So he continued to follow the bird which roosted every night upon a tree; and he ceased not pursuing it for a space of ten days, feeding on the fruits of the earth and drinking of its waters. At the end of this time, he came in sight of an inhabited city, whereupon the bird darted off like the glance of the eye and, entering the town, disappeared from Kamar al-Zaman, who knew not what it meant or whither it was gone; so he marvelled at this and exclaimed, \"Praise be to Allah who hath brought me in safety to this city!\" Then he sat down by a stream and washed his hands and feet and face and rested awhile; and, recalling his late easy and pleasant life of union with his beloved and contrasting it with his present plight of trouble and fatigue and distress and strangerhood and famine and severance, the tears streamed from his eyes and he began repeating these cinquains,\n\n\"Pain had I hid thy handwork, but it showed, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Changed sleep for wake, and wake with me abode:\nWhen thou didst spurn my heart I cried aloud *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pate, hold thy hand and cease to gird and goad:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          In dole and danger aye my sprite I spy!\nAn but the Lord of Love were just to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep fro' my eyelids ne'er were forced to flee.\nPity, my lady, one for love o' thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Prom his tribes darling brought to low degree:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Love came and doomed Wealth beggar-death to die.\nThe railers chide at thee: I ne'er gainsay, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But stop my ears and dumbly sign them Nay:\n'Thou lov'st a slender may,' say they; I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I've picked her out and cast the rest away:'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Enough; when Fate descends she blinds man's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          eye!\"[FN#310]\n\nAnd as soon as he had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he rose and walked on little by little, till he entered the city.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as Kamar al-Zaman had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he arose and entered the city-gate[FN#311] not knowing whither he should wend. He crossed the city from end to end, entering by the land-gate, and ceased not faring on till he came out at the sea- gate, for the city stood on the sea-shore. Yet he met not a single one of its citizens. And after issuing from the land-gate he fared forwards and ceased not faring till he found himself among the orchards and gardens of the place; and, passing among the trees presently came to a garden and stopped before its door; where-upon the keeper came out to him and saluted him. The Prince returned his greeting and the gardener bade him welcome, saying, \"Praised be Allah that thou hast come off safe from the dwellers of this city! Quick, come into the garth, ere any of the townfolk see thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered that garden, wondering in mind, and asked the keeper, \"What may be the history of the people of this city and who may they be?\" The other answered, \"Know that the people of this city are all Magians: but Allah upon thee, tell me how thou camest to this city and what caused thy coming to our capital.\" Accordingly Kamar al-Zaman told the gardener all that had befallen him from beginning to end, whereat he marvelled with great marvel and said, \"Know, O my son, that the cities of Al-Islam lie far from us; and between us and them is a four months' voyage by sea and a whole twelve months' journey by land. We have a ship which saileth every year with merchandise to the nearest Moslem country and which entereth the seas of the Ebony Islands and thence maketh the Khalidan Islands, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" Thereupon Kamar al- Zaman considered awhile and concluded that he could not do better than abide in the garden with the gardener and become his assistant, receiving for pay one fourth of the produce. So he said to him, \"Wilt thou take me into thy service, to help thee in this garden?\" Answered the gardener, \"To hear is to consent;\" and began teaching him to lead the water to the roots of the trees. So Kamar al-Zaman abode with him, watering the trees and hoeing up the weeds and wearing a short blue frock which reached to his knees. And he wept floods of tears; for he had no rest day or night, by reason of his strangerhood and he ceased not to repeat verses upon his beloved, amongst others the following couplets,\n\n\n\"Ye promised us and will ye not keep plight? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ye said a say and shall not deed be dight?\nWe wake for passion while ye slumber and sleep; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Watchers and wakers claim not equal right:\nWe vowed to keep our loves in secrecy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But spake the meddler and you spoke forthright:\nO friend in pain and pleasure, joy and grief, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In all case you, you only, claim my sprite!\nMid folk is one who holds my prisoned heart; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would he but show some ruth for me to sight.\nNot every eye like mine is wounded sore, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Not every heart like mine love-pipings blight:\nYe wronged me saying, Love is wrongous aye *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yea! ye were right, events have proved that quite.\nForget they one love-thralled, whose faith the world *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Robs not, though burn the fires in heart alight:\nIf an my foeman shall become my judge, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whom shall I sue to remedy his despight?\nHad not I need of love nor love had sought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart forsure were not thus love-distraught.\"\n\nSuch was the case with Kamar al-Zaman; but as regards his wife, the Lady Budur, when she awoke she sought her husband and found him not: then she saw her petticoat-trousers undone, for the band had been loosed and the bezel lost, whereupon she said to herself, \"By Allah, this is strange! Where is my husband? It would seem as if he had taken the talisman and gone away, knowing not the secret which is in it. Would to Heaven I knew whither can he have wended! But it must needs have been some extraordinary matter that drew him away, for he cannot brook to leave me a moment. Allah curse the stone and damn its hour!\" Then she considered awhile and said in her mind, \"If I go out and tell the varlets and let them learn that my husband is lost they will lust after me: there is no help for it but that I use stratagem. So she rose and donned some of her husband's clothes and riding- boots, and a turband like his, drawing one corner of it across her face for a mouth-veil.[FN#312] Then, setting a slave-girl in her litter, she went forth from the tent and called to the pages who brought her Kamar al-Zaman's steed; and she mounted and bade them load the beasts and resume the march. So they bound on the burdens and departed; and she concealed her trick, none doubting but she was Kamar al-Zaman, for she favoured him in face and form; nor did she cease journeying, she and her suite, days and nights, till they came in sight of a city overlooking the Salt Sea, where they pitched their tents without the walls and halted to rest. The Princess asked the name of the town and was told, \"It is called the City of Ebony; its King is named Arman\u00fas, and he hath a daughter Hay\u00e1t al-Nuf\u00fas[FN#313] hight,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur halted within sight of the Ebony City to take her rest, King Armanus sent a messenger, to learn what King it was who had encamped without his capital; so the messenger, coming to the tents, made inquiry anent their King, and was told that she was a King's son who had lost the way being bound for the Khalidan Islands; whereupon he returned to King Armanus with the tidings; and, when the King heard them, he straightway rode out with the lords of his land to greet the stranger on arrival. As he drew near the tents the Lady Budur came to meet him on foot, whereupon the King alighted and they saluted each other. Then he took her to the city and, bringing her up to the palace, bade them spread the tables and trays of food and commanded them to transport her company and baggage to the guess house. So they abode there three days; at the end of which time the King came in to the Lady Budur. Now she had that day gone to the Hammam and her face shone as the moon at its full, a seduction to the world and a rending of the veil of shame to mankind; and Armanus found her clad in a -suit of silk, embroidered with gold and jewels; so he said to her, 'O my son, know that I am a very old man, decrepit withal, and Allah hath blessed me with no child save one daughter, who resembleth thee in beauty and grace; and I am now waxed unfit for the conduct of the state. She is shine, O my son; and, if this my land please thee and thou be willing to abide and make thy home here, I will marry thee to her and give thee my kingdom and so be at rest.\" When Princess Budur heard this, she bowed her head and her forehead sweated for shame, and she said to herself. \"How shall I do, and I a woman? If I refuse and depart from him, I cannot be safe but that haply send after me troops to slay me; and if I consent, belike I shall be put to shame. I have lost my beloved Kamar al-Zaman and know not what is become of him; nor can I escape from this scrape save by holding my peace and consenting and abiding here, till Allah bring about what is to be.\" So she raised her head and made submission to King Armanus, saying, \"Hearkening and obedience!\"; whereat he rejoiced and bade the herald make proclamation throughout the Ebony Islands to hold high festival and decorate the houses. Then he assembled his Chamberlains and Nabobs, and Emirs and Wazirs and his officers of state and the Kazis of the city; and, formally abdicating his Sultanate, endowed Budur therewith and invested her in all the vestments of royalty. The Emirs and Grandees went in to her and did her homage, nothing doubting but that she was a young man, and all who looked on her bepissed their bag-trousers, for the excess of her beauty and loveliness. Then, after the Lady Budur had been made Sultan and the drums had been beaten in announcement of the glad event, and she had been ceremoniously enthroned, King Armanus proceeded to equip his daughter Hayat al-Nufus for marriage, and in a few days, they brought the Lady Budur in to her, when they seemed as it were two moons risen at one time or two suns in conjunction. So they entered the bridal-chamber and the doors were shut and the curtains let down upon them, after the attendants had lighted the wax-candles and spread for them the carpet-bed. When Budur found herself alone with the Princess Hayat al-Nufus, she called to mind her beloved Kamar al-Zaman and grief was sore upon her. So she wept for his absence, and estrangement and she began repeating,\n\n\"O ye who fled and left my heart in pain low li'en, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No breath of life if found within this frame of mine:\nI have an eye which e'er complains of wake, but lo! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tears occupy it would that wake content these eyne!\nAfter ye marched forth the lover 'bode behind; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Question of him what pains your absence could design!\nBut for the foods of tears mine eyelids rail and rain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My fires would flame on high and every land calcine.\nTo Allah make I moan of loved ones lost for aye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who for my pine and pain no more shall pain and pine:\nI never wronged them save that over love I nurst: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Love departs us lovers into blest and curst.\"\n\nAnd when she had finished her repeating, the Lady Budur sat down beside the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and kissed her on the mouth; after which rising abruptly, she made the minor ablution and betook herself to her devotions; nor did she leave praying till Hayat al-Nufus fell asleep, when she slips into bed and lay with her back to her till morning. And when day had broke the King and Queen came in to their daughter and asked her how she did. whereupon she told them what she had seen, and repeated to them the verses she had heard. Thus far concerning Hayat al-Nufus and her father; but as regards Queen Budur she went forth and seated herself upon the royal throne and all the Emirs and Captains and Officers of state came up to her and wished her joy of the kingship, kissing the earth before her and calling down blessings upon her. And she accosted them with smiling face and clad them in robes of honour, augmenting the fiefs of the high officials and giving largesse to the levies; wherefore all the people loved her and offered up prayers for the long endurance of her reign, doubting not but that she was a man. And she ceased not sitting all day in the hall of audience, bidding and forbidding; dispensing justice, releasing prisoners and remitting the customs-dues, till nightfall, when she withdrew to the apartment prepared for her. Here she found Hayat al-Nufus seated, so she sat down by her side and, clapping her on the back, coaxed and caressed her and kissed her between the eyes, and fell to versifying in these couplets,\n\n\"What secret kept I these my tears have told, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And my waste body must my love unfold:\nThough hid my pine, my plight on parting day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To every envious eye my secret sold:\nO ye who broke up camp, you've left behind *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My spirit wearied and my heart a-cold:\nIn my hearts core ye dwell, and now these eyne *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Roll blood-drops with the tears they whilome rolled:\nThe absent will I ransom with my soul; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All can my yearning for their sight behold:\nI have an eye whose babe,[FN#314] for love of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rejected sleep nor hath its tears controlled.\nThe foeman bids me patient bear his loss, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ne'er may mine ears accept the ruth he doled!\nI tricks their deme of me, and won my wish *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of Kamar al-Zaman's joys manifold:\nHe joins all perfect gifts like none before, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Boasted such might and main no King of old:\nSeeing his gifts, Bin Z\u00e1'idah's[FN#315] largesse *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Forget we, and Mu'\u00e1wiyah mildest-soul'd:[FN#316]\nWere verse not feeble and o'er short the time *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I had in laud of him used all of rhyme.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur stood up and wiped away her tears and, making the lesser ablution,[FN#317] applied her to pray: nor did she give over praying till drowsiness overcame the Lady Hayat al- Nufus and she slept, whereupon the Lady Budur came and lay by her till the morning. At daybreak, she arose and prayed the dawn- prayer; and presently seated herself on the royal throne and passed the day in ordering and counter ordering and giving laws and administering justice. This is how it fared with her; but as regards King Armanus he went in to his daughter and asked her how she did; so she told him all that had befallen her and repeated to him the verses which Queen Budur had recited, adding, \"O my father, never saw I one more abounding in sound sense and modesty than my husband, save that he cloth nothing but weep and sigh.\" He answered, \"O my daughter, have patience with him yet this third night, and if he go not in unto thee and do away thy maidenhead, we shall know how to proceed with him and oust him from the throne and banish him the country.\" And on this wise he agreed with his daughter what course he would take.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Tenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Armanus had agreed with his daughter on this wise and had determined what course he would take and night came on, Queen Budur arose from the throne of her kingdom and betaking herself to the palace, entered the apartment prepared for her. There she found the wax-candles lighted and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus seated and awaiting her; whereupon she bethought her of her husband and what had betided them both of sorrow and severance in so short a space; she wept and sighed and groaned groan upon groan, and began improvising these couplets,\n\n\"News of my love fill all the land, I swear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     As suns on Ghaz\u00e1[FN#318]-wold rain heat and glare:\nSpeaketh his geste but hard its sense to say; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thus never cease to grow my cark and care:\nI hate fair Patience since I loved thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'er sawest lover hate for love to bear?\nA glance that dealt love-sickness dealt me death, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Glances are deadliest things with torments rare:\nHe shook his love locks down and bared his chin, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby I spied his beauties dark and fair:\nMy care, my cure are in his hands; and he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who caused their dolour can their dole repair:\nHis belt went daft for softness of his waist; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His hips, for envy, to uprise forbear:\nHis brow curl-diademed is murky night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveil 't and lo! bright Morn shows brightest light.\"\n\nWhen she had finished her versifying, she would have risen to pray, but, lo and behold! Hayat al-Nufus caught her by the skirt and clung to her saying, \"O my lord, art thou not ashamed before my father, after all his favour, to neglect me at such a time as this?\" When Queen Budur heard her words, she sat down in the same place and said, \"O my beloved, what is this thou sayest?\" She replied, \"What I say is that I never saw any so proud of himself as thou. Is every fair one so disdainful? I say not this to incline thee to me; I say it only of my fear for thee from King Armanus; because he purposeth, unless thou go in unto me this very night, and do away my maidenhead, to strip thee of the kingship on the morrow and banish thee his kingdom; and peradventure his excessive anger may lead him to slay thee. But I, O my lord, have ruth on thee and give thee fair warning; and it is thy right to reck.\"[FN#319] Now when Queen Budur heard her speak these words, she bowed her head ground-wards awhile in sore perplexity and said in herself, \"If I refuse I'm lost; and if I obey I'm shamed. But I am now Queen of all the Ebony Islands and they are under my rule, nor shall I ever again meet my Kamar al- Zaman save in this place; for there is no way for him to his native land but through the Ebony Islands. Verily, I know not what to do in my present case, but I commit my care to Allah who directeth all for the best, for I am no man that I should arise and open this virgin girl.\" Then quoth Queen Budur to Hayat al- Nufus, \"O my beloved, that I have neglected thee and abstained from thee is in my own despite.\" And she told her her whole story from beginning to end and showed her person to her, saying, \"I conjure thee by Allah to keep my counsel, for I have concealed my case only that Allah may reunite me with my beloved Kamar al- Zaman and then come what may.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eleventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur acquainted Hayat al-Nufus with her history and bade her keep it secret, the Princess heard her with extreme wonderment and was moved to pity and prayed Allah to reunite her with her beloved, saying, \"Fear nothing, O my sister; but have patience till Allah bring to pass that which must come to pass:\" and she began repeating,\n\n\"None but the men of worth a secret keep;\nWith worthy men a secret's hidden deep;\nAs in a room, so secrets lie with me,\nWhose door is sealed, lock shot and lost the key.\"[FN#320]\n\nAnd when Hayat al-Nufus had ended her verses, she said, \"O my sister, verily the breasts of the noble and brave are of secrets the grave; and I will not discover shine.\" Then they toyed and embraced and kissed and slept till near the Mu'ezzin's call to dawn prayer, when Hayat al-Nufus arose and took a pigeon-poult,[FN#321] and cut its throat over her smock and besmeared herself with its blood. Then she pulled off her petticoat-trousers and cried aloud, where-upon her people hastened to her and raised the usual lullilooing and outcries of joy and gladness. Presently her mother came in to her and asked her how she did and busied herself about her and abode with her till evening; whilst the Lady Budur arose with the dawn, and repaired to the bath and, after washing herself pure, proceeded to the hall of audience, where she sat down on her throne and dispensed justice among the folk. Now when King Armanus heard the loud cries of joy, he asked what was the matter and was informed of the consummation of his daughter's marriage; whereat he rejoiced and his breast swelled with gladness and he made a great marriage-feast whereof the merry-making lasted a long time. Such was their case: but as regards King Shahriman it was on this wise. After his son had fared forth to the chase accompanied by Marzawan, as before related, he tarried patiently awaiting their return at nightfall; but when his son did not appear he passed a sleepless night and the dark hours were longsome upon him; his restlessness was excessive, his excitement grew upon him and he thought the morning would never dawn. Anc when day broke he sat expecting his son and waited till noon, but he came not; whereat his heart forebode separation and was fired with fears for Kamar al-Zaman; and he cried, \"Alas! my son!\" and he wept till his clothes were drenched with tears, and repeated with a beating heart,\n\n\n\"Love's votaries I ceased not to oppose, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Till doomed to taste Love's bitter and Love's sweet:\nI drained his rigour-cup to very dregs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Self humbled at its slaves' and freemen's feet:\nFortune had sworn to part the loves of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She kept her word how truly, well I weet!\"\n\nAnd when he ended his verse, he wiped away his tears and bade his troops make ready for a march and prepare for a long expedition. So they all mounted and set forth, headed by the Sultan, whose heart burnt with grief and was fired with anxiety for his son Kamar al-Zaman; and they advanced by forced marches. Now the King divided his host into six divisions, a right wing and a left wing, a vanguard and a rear guard;[FN#322] and bade them rendezvous for the morrow at the cross-roads. Accordingly they separated and scoured the country all the rest of that day till night, and they marched through the night and at noon of the ensuing day they joined company at the place where four roads met. But they knew not which the Prince followed, till they saw the sign of torn clothes and sighted shreds of flesh and beheld blood still sprinkled by the way and they noted every piece of the clothes and fragment of mangled flesh scattered on all sides. Now when King Shahriman saw this, he cried from his heart-core a loud cry, saying, \"Alas, my son!\"; and buffeted his face and plucks his beard and rent his raiment, doubting not but his son was dead. Then he gave himself up to excessive weeping and wailing, and the troops also wept for his weeping, all being assured that Prince Kamar al-Zaman had perished. They threw dust on their heads, and the night surprised them shedding tears and lamenting till they were like to die. Then the King with a heart on fire and with burning sighs spake these couplets,\n\n\"Chide not the mourner for bemourning woe; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Enough is yearning every Ill to show:\nHe weeps for stress of sorrow and of pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And these to thee best evidence his lowe:\nHappy![FN#323] of whom Love sickness swore that ne'er *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Should cease his eye lids loving tears to flow:\nHe mourns the loss of fairest, fullest Moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shining o'er all his peers in glorious glow:\nBut death made drink a brimming cup, what day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He fared from natal country fain to go:\nHis home left he and went from us to grief; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor to his brethren could he say adieu:\nYea, his loss wounded me with parting pangs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And separation cost me many a throe:\nHe fared farewelling, as he fared, our eyes; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Whenas his Lord vouch-safed him Paradise.\"\n\nAnd when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twelfth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital, giving up his son for lost, and deeming that wild beasts or banditti had set upon him and torn him to pieces; and made proclamation that all in the Khalidan Islands should don black in mourning for him. Moreover, he built, in his memory, a pavilion, naming it House of Lamentations; and on Mondays and Thursdays he devoted himself to the business of the state and ordering the affairs of his levies and lieges; and the rest of the week he was wont to spend in the House of Lamentations, mourning for his son and bewailing him with elegiac verses,[FN#324] of which the following are some:\u2014\n\n\"My day of bliss is that when thou appearest; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My day of bale[FN#325] is that whereon thou farest:\nThough through the night I quake in dread of death; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Union wi' thee is of all bliss the dearest.\"\n\nAnd again he said,\n\n\"My soul be sacrifice for one, whose going *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Afflicted hearts with sufferings sore and dread:\nLet joy her widowed term[FN#326] fulfil, for I *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Divorced joy with the divorce thrice-said.\"[FN#327]\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Queen Budur daughter of King Ghayur, she abode as ruler in the Ebony Islands, whilst the folk would point to her with their fingers, and say, \"Yonder is the son-in-law of King Armanus.\" And every night she lay with Hayat al-Nufus, to whom she lamented her desolate state and longing for her husband Kamar al-Zaman; weeping and describing to her his beauty and loveliness, and yearning to enjoy him though but in a dream: And at times she would repeat,\n\n\"Well Allah wots that since my severance from thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I wept till forced to borrow tears at usury:\n'Patience!' my blamer cried, 'Heartsease right soon shalt see!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Say, blamer, where may home of Patience be?'\"\n\nThis is how it fared with Queen Budur; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, he abode with the gardener in the garden for no short time, weeping night and day and repeating verses bewailing the past time of enjoyment and delight; whilst the gardener kept comforting him and assuring him that the ship would set sail for the land of the Moslems at the end of the year. And in this condition he continued till one day he saw the folk crowding together and wondered at this; but the gardener came in to him and said, \"O my son, give over work for this day nor lead water to the trees; for it is a festival day, whereon folk visit one another. So take thy rest and only keep shine eye on the garden, whilst I go look after the ship for thee; for yet but a little while and I send thee to the land of the Moslems.\" Upon this, he went forth from the garden leaving to himself Kamar al-Zaman, who fell to musing upon his case till his heart was like to break and the tears streamed from his eyes. So he wept with excessive weeping till he swooned away and, when he recovered, he rose and walked about the garden, pondering what Time had done with him and bewailing the long endurance of his estrangement and separation from those he loved. As he was thus absorbed in melancholy thought, his foot stumbled and he fell on his face, his forehead striking against the projecting root of a tree; and the blow cut it open and his blood ran down and mingled with his tears Then he rose and, wiping away the blood, dried his tears and bound his brow with a piece of rag; then continued his walk about the garden engrossed by sad reverie. Presently, he looked up at a tree and saw two birds quarrelling thereon, and one of them rose up and smote the other with its beak on the neck and severed from its body its head, wherewith it flew away, whilst the slain bird fell to the ground before Kamar al-Zaman. As it lay, behold, two great birds swooped down upon it alighting, one at the head and the other at the tail, and both drooped their wings and bowed their bills over it and, extending their necks towards it, wept. Kamar al-Zaman also wept when seeing the birds thus bewail their mate, and called to mind his wife and father, And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman wept and lamented his separation from spouse and sire, when he beheld those two birds weeping over their mate. Then he looked at the twain and saw them dig a grave and therein bury the slain bird; after which they flew away far into the firmament and disappeared for a while; but presently they returned with the murtherer-bird and, alighting on the grave of the murthered, stamped on the slayer till they had done him to death. Then they rent his belly and tearing out his entrails, poured the blood on the grave of the slain[FN#328]: moreover, they stripped off his skin and tare his flesh in pieces and, pulling out the rest of the bowels, scattered them hither and thither. All this while Kamar al-Zaman was watching them wonderingly; but presently, chancing to look at the place where the two birds had slain the third, he saw therein something gleaming. So he drew near to it and noted that it was the crop of the dead bird. Whereupon he took it and opened it and found the talisman which had been the cause of his separation from his wife. But when he saw it and knew it, he fell to the ground a-fainting for joy; and, when he revived, he said, \"Praised be Allah! This is a foretaste of good and a presage of reunion with my beloved.\" Then he examined the jewel and passed it over his eyes[FN#329]; after which he bound it to his forearm, rejoicing in coming weal, and walked about till nightfall awaiting the gardener's return; and when he came not, he lay down and slept in his wonted place. At daybreak he rose to his work and, girding his middle with a cord of palm- fibre, took hatchet and basket and walked down the length of the garden, till he came to a carob-tree and struck the axe into its roots. The blow rang and resounded; so he cleared away the soil from the place and discovered a trap-door and raised it.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the Two Hundred and Fourteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman raised the trap-door, he found a winding stair, which he descended and came to an ancient vault of the time of Ad and Tham\u00fad,[FN#330] hewn out of the rock. Round the vault stood many brazen vessels of the bigness of a great oil-jar which he found full of gleaming red gold: whereupon he said to himself, \"Verily sorrow is gone and solace is come!\" Then he mounted from the souterrain to the garden and, replacing the trap-door as it was before, busied himself in conducting water to the trees till the last of the day, when the gardener came back and said to him, \"O my son, rejoice at the good tidings of a speedy return to thy native land: the merchants are ready equipped for the voyage and the ship in three days' time will set sail for the City of Ebony, which is the first of the cities of the Moslems, and after making it, thou must travel by land a six months' march till thou come to the Islands of Khalidan, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" At this Kamar al-Zaman rejoiced and began repeating,\n\n\"Part not from one whose wont is not to part from you; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor with your cruel taunts an innocent mortify:\nAnother so long parted had ta'en heart from you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And had his whole condition changed,\u2014but not so I.\"\n\nThen he kissed the gardener's hand and said, \"O my father, even as thou hast brought me glad tidings, so I also have great good news for thee,' and told him anent his discovery of the vault; whereat the gardener rejoiced and said, \"O my son, fourscore years have I dwelt in this garden and have never hit on aught whilst thou, who hast not sojourned with me a year, hast discovered this thing; wherefore it is Heaven's gift to thee, which shall end thy crosses and aid thee to rejoin thy folk and foregather with her thou lovest.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"There is no help but it must be shared between me and thee.\" Then he carried him to the underground-chamber and showed him the gold, which was in twenty jars: he took ten and the gardener ten, and the old man said to him, \"O my son, fill thyself leather bottles[FN#331] with the sparrow-olives[FN#332] which grow in this garden, for they are not found except in our land; and the merchants carry them to all parts. Lay the gold in the bottles and strew it over with olives: then stop them and cover them and take them with thee in the ship.\" So Kamar al-Zaman arose without stay or delay and took fifty leather bottles and stored in each somewhat of the gold, and closed each one after placing a layer of olives over the gold; and at the bottom of one of the bottles he laid the talisman. Then sat he down to talk with the gardener, confident of speedy reunion with his own people and saying to himself, \"When I come to the Ebony Islands I will journey thence to my father's country and enquire for my beloved Budur. Would to Heaven I knew whether she returned to her own land or journeyed on to my father's country or whether there befel her any accident by the way.\" And he began versifying,\n\n\"Love in my breast they lit and fared away, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And far the land wherein my love is pent:\nFar lies the camp and those who camp therein; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Par is her tent-shrine, where I ne'er shall tent.\nPatience far deaf me when from me they fled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep failed mine eyes, endurance was forspent:\nThey left and with them left my every joy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wending with them, nor find I peace that went:\nThey made these eyes roll down love tears in flood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lacking them these eyne with tears are drent.\nWhen my taste spins once again would see them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When pine and expectation but augment,\nIn my heart's core their counterfeits I trace, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With love and yearning to behold their grace.\"\n\nThen, while he awaited the end of the term of days, he told the gardener the tale of the birds and what had passed between them; whereat the hearer wondered; and they both lay down and slept till the morning. The gardener awoke sick and abode thus two days; but on the third day, his sickness increased on him, till they despaired of his life and Kamar al-Zaman grieved with sore grief for him. Meanwhile behold, the Master and his crew came and enquired for the gardener; and, when Kamar al-Zaman told them that he was sick, they asked, \"Where be the youth who is minded to go with us to the Ebony Islands?\" \"He is your servent and he standeth before you!\" answered the Prince and bade them carry the bottles of olives to the ship; so they transported them, saying, \"Make haste, thou, for the wind is fair;\" and he replied, \"I hear and obey.\" Then he carried his provaunt on board and, returning to bid the gardener farewell, found him in the agonies of death; so he sat down at his head and closed his eyes, and his soul departed his body; whereupon he laid him out and committed him to the earth unto the mercy of Allah Almighty. Then he made for the ship but found that she had already weighed anchor and set sail; nor did she cease to cleave the seas till she disappeared from his sight. So he went back to whence he came heavy-hearted with whirling head; and neither would he address a soul nor return a reply; and reaching the garden and sitting down in cark and care he threw dust on his head and buffeted his cheeks.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship sped on her course, Kamar al-Zaman returned to the garden in cark and care; but- anon he rented the place of its owner and hired a man to help him in irrigating the trees. Moreover, he repaired the trap-door and he went to the underground chamber and bringing the rest of the gold to grass, stowed it in other fifty bottles which he filled up with a layer of olives. Then he enquired of the ship and they told him that it sailed but once a year, at which his trouble of mind redoubled and he cried sore for that which had betided him, above all for the loss of the Princess Budur's talisman, and spent his nights and days weeping and repealing verses. Such was his case; but as regards the ship she sailed with a favouring wind till she reached the Ebony Islands. Now by decree of destiny, Queen Budur was sitting at a lattice-window overlooking the sea and saw the galley cast anchor upon the strand. At this sight, her heart throbbed and she took horse with the Chamberlains and Nabobs and, riding down to the shore, halted by the ship, whilst the sailors broke bulk and bore the bales to the storehouses; after which she called the captain to her presence and asked what he had with him. He answered \"O King, I have with me in this ship aromatic drugs and cosmetics and healing powders and ointments and plasters and precious metals and rich stuffs and rugs of Yemen leather, not to be borne of mule or camel, and all manner of otters and spices and perfumes, civet and ambergris and camphor and Sumatra aloes-wood, and tamerinds[FN#333] and sparrow-olives to boot, such as are rare to find in this country.\" When she heard talk of sparrow- olives her heart longed for them and she said to the ship-master, \"How much of olives hast thou?\" He replied, \"Fifty bottles full, but their owner is not with us, so the King shall take what he will of them.\" Quoth she, \"Bring them ashore, that I may see them.'' Thereupon he called to the sailors, who brought her the fifty bottles; and she opened one and, looking at the olives, said to the captain, \"I will take the whole fifty and pay you their value, whatso it be.\" He answered, \"By Allah, O my lord, they have no value in our country; moreover their shipper tarried behind us, and he is a poor man.\" Asked she, \"And what are they worth here?\" and he answered \"A thousand dirhams.\" \"I will take them at a thousand,\" she said and bade them carry the fifty bottles to the palace. When it was night, she called for a bottle of olives and opened it, there being none in the room but herself and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then, placing a dish before her she turned into it the contents of the jar, when there fell out into the dish with the olives a heap of red gold; and she said to the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, \"This is naught but gold!\" So she sent for the rest of the bottles and found them all full of precious metal and scarce enough olives to fill a single jar. Moreover, she sought among the gold and found therein the talisman, which she took and examined and behold, it was that which Kamar al- Zaman had taken from off the band of her petticoat trousers. Thereupon she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Budur saw the talisman she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon; and when she recovered she said to herself, \"Verily, this talisman was the cause of my separation from my beloved Kamar al-Zaman; but now it is an omen of good.\" Then she showed it to Hayat al-Nufus and said to her, \"This was the cause of disunion and now, please Allah, it shall be the cause of reunion.\" As soon as day dawned she seated herself on the royal throne and sent for the ship-master, who came into the presence and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"Where didst thou leave the owner of these olives?\" Quoth he, \"O King of the age, we left him in the land of the Magians and he is a gardener there.\" She rejoined, \"Except thou bring him to me, thou knowest not the harm which awaiteth thee and thy ship.\" Then she bade them seal up the magazines of the merchants and said to them, \"Verily the owner of these olives hath borrowed of me and I have a claim upon him for debt and, unless ye bring him to me, I will without fail do you all die and seize your goods.\" So they went to the captain and promised him the hire of the ship, if he would go and return a second time, saying, \"Deliver us from this masterful tyrant.\" Accordingly the skipper embarked and set sail and Allah decreed him a prosperous voyage, till he came to the Island of the Magians and, landing by night, went up to the garden. Now the night was long upon Kamar al-Zaman, and he sat, bethinking him of his beloved, and bewailing what had befallen him and versifying,\n\n\"A night whose stars refused to run their course, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     A night of those which never seem outworn:\nLike Resurrection-day, of longsome length[FN#334] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To him that watched and waited for the morn.\"\n\nNow at this moment, the captain knocked at the garden-gate, and Kamar al-Zaman opened and went out to him, whereupon the crew seized him and went down with him on board the ship and set sail forthright; and they ceased not voyaging days and nights, whilst Kamar al-Zaman knew not why they dealt thus with him; but when he questioned them they replied, \"Thou hast offended against the Lord of the Ebony Islands, the son-in-law of King Armanus, and thou hast stolen his monies, miserable that thou art!\" Said he, \"By Allah! I never entered that country nor do I know where it is!\" However, they fared on with him, till they made the Ebony Islands and landing, carried him up to the Lady Budur, who knew him at sight and said, \"Leave him with the eunuchs, that they may take him to the bath.\" Then she relieved the merchants of the embargo and gave the captain a robe of honour worth ten thousand pieces of gold; and, after returning to the palace, she went in that night to the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and told her what had passed, saying, \"Keep thou my counsel, till I accomplish my purpose, and do a deed which shall be recorded and shall be read by Kings and commoners after we be dead and gone.\" And when she gave orders that they bear Kamar al-Zaman to the bath, they did so and clad him in a royal habit so that, when he came forth, he resembled a willow-bough or a star which shamed the greater and lesser light[FN#335] and its glow, and his life and soul returned to his frame. Then he repaired to the palace and went in to the Princess Budur; and when she saw him she schooled her heart to patience, till she should have accomplished her purpose; and she bestowed on him Mamelukes and eunuchs, camels and mules. Moreover, she gave him a treasury of money and she ceased not advancing him from dignity to dignity, till she made him Lord High Treasurer and committed to his charge all the treasures of the state; and she admitted him to familiar favour and acquainted the Emirs with his rank and dignity. And all loved him, for Queen Budur did not cease day by day to increase his allowances. As for Kamar al-Zaman, he was at a loss anent the reason of her thus honouring him; and he gave gifts and largesse out of the abundance of the wealth; and he devoted himself to the service of King Armanus; so that the King and all the Emirs and people, great and small, adored him and were wont to swear by his life. Nevertheless, he ever marvelled at the honour and favour shown him by Queen Budur and said to himself, \"By Allah, there needs must be a reason for this affection! Peradventure, this King favoureth me not with these immoderate favours save for some ill purpose and, therefore, there is no help but that I crave leave of him to depart his realm.\" So he went in to Queen Budur and said to her, \"O King, thou hast overwhelmed me with favours, but it will fulfil the measure of thy bounties if thou take from me all thou hast been pleased to bestow upon me, and permit me to depart.\" She smiled and asked, \"What maketh thee seek to depart and plunge into new perils, whenas thou art in the enjoyment of the highest favour and greatest prosperity?\" Answered Kamar al- Zaman, \"O King, verily this favour, if there be no reason for it, is indeed a wonder of wonders, more by token that thou hast advanced me to dignities such as befit men of age and experience, albeit I am as it were a young child.\" And Queen Budur rejoined, \"The reason is that I love thee for shine exceeding loveliness and thy surpassing beauty; and if thou wilt but grant me my desire of thy body, I will advance thee yet farther in honour and favour and largesse; and I will make thee Wazir, for all thy tender age even as the folk made me Sultan over them and I no older than thou; so that nowadays there is nothing strange when children take the head and by Allah, he was a gifted man who said,\n\n'It seems as though of Lot's tribe were our days, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And crave with love to advance the young in years.'\"[FN#336]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was abashed and his cheeks flushed till they seemed a-flame; and he said, \"I need not these favours which lead to the commission of sin; I will live poor in wealth but wealthy in virtue and honour.\" Quoth she, \"I am not to be duped by thy scruples, arising from prudery and coquettish ways; and Allah bless him who saith,\n\n'To him I spake of coupling, but he said to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    How long this noyous long persistency?'\nBut when gold piece I showed him, he cried, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'Who from the Almighty Sovereign e'er shall flee?'\"\n\nNow when Kamar al-Zaman, heard these words and understood her verses and their import, he said, \"O King, I have not the habit of these doings, nor have I strength to bear these heavy burthens for which elder than I have proved unable; then how will it be with my tender age?\" But she smiled at his speech and retorted, \"Indeed, it is a matter right marvellous how error springeth from the disorder of man's intendiment!! Since thou art a boy, why standest thou in fear of sin or the doing of things forbidden, seeing that thou art not yet come to years of canonical responsibility; and the offences of a child incur neither punishment nor reproof? Verily, thou hast committed thyself to a quibble for the sake of contention, and it is thy duty to bow before a proposal of fruition, so henceforward cease from denial and coyness, for the commandment of Allah is a decree foreordained:[FN#337] indeed, I have more reason than thou to fear falling and by sin to be misled; and well inspired was he who said,\n\n'My prickle is big and the little one said, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Thrust boldly in vitals with lion-like stroke!\nThen I, ' 'Tis a sin!; and he, 'No sin to me! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   So I had him at once with a counterfeit poke.\"[FN#338]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, the light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O King, thou hast in thy household fair women and female slaves, who have not their like in this age: shall not these suffice thee without me? Do thy will with them and let me go!\" She replied, \"Thou sayest sooth, but it is not with them that one who loveth thee can heal himself of torment and can abate his fever; for, when tastes and inclinations are corrupted by vice, they hear and obey other than good advice. So leave arguing and listen to what the poet saith,\n\n'Seest not the bazar with its fruit in rows? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     These men are for figs and for sycamore[FN#339] those!'\n\nAnd what another saith,\n\n'Many whose anklet rings are dumb have tinkling belts, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And this hath all content while that for want must wail:\nThou bidd'st me be a fool and quit thee for her charms; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Allah forfend I leave The Faith, turn Infidel!\nNay, by thy rights of side-beard mocking all her curls, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor mott nor maid[FN#340] from thee my heart shall spell.'\n\nAnd yet another,\n\n'O beauty's Union! love for thee's my creed, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Free choice of Faith and eke my best desire:\nWomen I have forsworn for thee; so may *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Deem me all men this day a shaveling friar.'[FN#341]\n\nAnd yet another,\n\n'Even not beardless one with girl, nor heed *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The spy who saith to thee ''Tis an amiss!'\nFar different is the girl whose feet one kisses *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And that gazelle whose feet the earth must kiss.'\n\nAnd yet another,\n\n'A boy of twice ten is fit for a King!'\n\nAnd yet another,\n\n'The penis smooth and round was made with anus best to match it, * Had it been made for cunnus' sake it had been formed like hatchet!'\n\nAnd yet another said,\n\n'My soul thy sacrifice!

So he rose up with her, on this condition, and went with her to her own boudoir, that she might quench the lowe of her lust, saying, \"There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the fated decree of the All- powerful, the All-wise!\"; and he doffed his bag-trousers, shamefull and abashed, with the tears running from his eyes for stress of affright. Thereat she smiled and making him mount upon a couch with her, said to him, \"After this night, thou shalt see naught that will offend thee.\" Then she turned to him bussing and bosoming him and bending calf over calf, and said to him, \"Put thy hand between my thighs to the accustomed place; so haply it may stand up to prayer after prostration.\" He wept and cried, \"I am not good at aught of this,\" but she said, \"By my life, an thou do as I bid thee, it shall profit thee!\" So he put out his hand, with vitals a-fire for confusion, and found her thighs cooler than cream and softer than silk. The touching of them pleasured him and he moved his hand hither and thither, till it came to a dome abounding in good gifts and movements and shifts, and said in himself, \"Perhaps this King is a hermaphrodite,[FN#348] neither man nor woman quite;\" so he said to her, \"O King, I cannot find that thou hast a tool like the tools of men; what then moved thee to do this deed?\" Then loudly laughed Queen Budur till she fell on her back,[FN#349] and said, \"O my dearling, how quickly thou hast forgotten the nights we have lain together!\" Then she made herself known to him, and he knew her for his wife, the Lady Budur, daughter of King al-Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas. So he embraced her and she embraced him, and he kissed her and she kissed him; then they lay down on the bed of pleasure voluptuous, repeating the words of the poet,\n\n\"When his softly bending shape bid him close to my embrace *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which clips him all about like the tendrils of the vine\nAnd shed a flood of softness on the hardness of his heart, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He yielded though at first he was minded to decline;\nAnd dreading lest the railer's eye should light upon his form, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Came armoured with caution to baffle his design:\nHis waist makes moan of hinder cheeks that weigh upon his feet *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Like heavy load of merchandise upon young camel li'en;\nGirt with his glances scymitar which seemed athirst for blood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And clad in mail of dusky curls that show the sheeniest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     shine,\nHis fragrance wafted happy news of footstep coming nigh, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to him like a bird uncaged I flew in straightest line:\nI spread my cheek upon his path, beneath his sandal-shoon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lo! the stibium[FN#350] of their dust healed all my hurt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     of eyne.\nWith one embrace again I bound the banner of our loves[FN#351] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And loosed the knot of my delight that bound in bonds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    malign:\nThen bade I make high festival, and straight came flocking in *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pure joys that know not grizzled age[FN#352] nor aught of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pain and pine:\nThe full moon dotted with the stars the lips and pearly teeth *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That dance right joyously upon the bubbling face of wine:\nSo in the prayer-niche of their joys I yielded me to what *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would make the humblest penitent of sinner most indign.\nI swear by all the signs[FN#353] of those glories in his face *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I'll ne'er forget the Chapter entituled Al-Ikhlas.\"[FN#354]\n\nThen Queen Budur told Kamar al-Zaman all that had befallen her from beginning to end and he did likewise; after which he began to upbraid her, saying, \"What moved thee to deal with me as thou hast done this night?\" She replied, \"Pardon me! for I did this by way of jest, and that pleasure and gladness might be increased.\" And when dawned the morn and day arose with its sheen and shone, she sent to King Armanus, sire of the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, and acquainted him with the truth of the case and that she was wife to Kamar al-Zaman. Moreover, she told him their tale and the cause of their separation, and how his daughter was a virgin, pure as when she was born. He marvelled at their story with exceeding marvel and bade them chronicle it in letters of gold. Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O King's son, art thou minded to become my son-in-law by marrying my daughter?\" Replied he, \"I must consult the Queen Budur, as she hath a claim upon me for benefits without stint.\" And when he took counsel with her, she said, \"Right is thy recking; marry her and I will be her handmaid; for I am her debtor for kindness and favour and good offices, and obligations manifold, especially as we are here in her place and as the King her father hath whelmed us with benefits.\"[FN#355] Now when he saw that she inclined to this and was not jealous of Hayat al-Nufus, he agreed with her upon this matter.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventeenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman agreed with his wife, Queen Budur, upon this matter and told King Armanus what she had said; whereat he rejoiced with great joy. Then he went out and, seating himself upon his chair of estate, assembled all the Wazirs, Emirs, Chamberlains and Grandees, to whom he related the whole story of Kamar al-Zaman and his wife, Queen Budur, from first to last; and acquainted them with his desire to marry his daughter Hayat al-Nufus to the Prince and make him King in the stead of Queen Budur. Whereupon said they all, \"Since he is the husband of Queen Budur, who hath been our King till now, whilst we deemed her son-in-law to King Armanus, we are all content to have him to Sultan over us; and we will be his servants, nor will we swerve from his allegiance.\" So Armanus rejoiced hereat and, summoning Kazis and witnesses and the chief officers of state, bade draw up the contract of marriage between Kamar al-Zaman and his daughter, the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then he held high festival, giving sumptuous marriage-feasts and bestowing costly dresses of honour upon all the Emirs and Captains of the host; moreover he distributed alms to the poor and needy and set free all the prisoners. The whole world rejoiced in the coming of Kamar al-Zaman to the throne, blessing him and wishing him endurance of glory and prosperity, renown and felicity; and, as soon as he became King, he remitted the customs-dues and released all men who remained in gaol. Thus he abode a long while, ordering himself worthily towards his lieges; and he lived with his two wives in peace, happiness, constancy and content, lying the night with each of them in turn. He ceased not after this fashion during many years, for indeed all his troubles and afflictions were blotted out from him and he forgot his father King Shahriman and his former estate of honour and favour with him. After a while Almighty Allah blessed him with two boy children, as they were two shining moons, through his two wives; the elder whose name was Prince Amjad,[FN#356] by Queen Budur, and the younger whose name was Prince As'ad by Queen Hayat al-Nufus; and this one was comelier than his brother. They were reared in splendour and tender affection, in respectful bearing and in the perfection of training; and they were instructed in penmanship and science and the arts of government and horsemanship, till they attained the extreme accomplishments and the utmost limit of beauty and loveliness; both men and women being ravished by their charms. They grew up side by side till they reached the age of seventeen, eating and drinking together and sleeping in one bed, nor ever parting at any time or tide; wherefore all the people envied them. Now when they came to man's estate and were endowed with every perfection, their father was wont, as often as he went on a journey, to make them sit in his stead by turns in the hall of judgement; and each did justice among the folk one day at a time. But it came to pass, by confirmed fate and determined lot, that love for As'ad (son of Queen Hayat al-Nufus) rose in the heart of Queen Budur, and that affection for Amjad (son of Queen Budur) rose in the heart of Queen Hayat al-Nufus.[FN#357] Hence it was that each of the women used to sport and play with the son of her sister-wife, kissing him and straining him to her bosom, whilst each mother thought that the other's behaviour arose but from maternal affection. On this wise passion got the mastery of the two women's hearts and they became madly in love with the two youths, so that when the other's son came in to either of them, she would press him to her breast and long for him never to be parted from her; till, at last, when waiting grew longsome to them and they found no path to enjoyment, they refused meat and drink and banished the solace of sleep. Presently, the King fared forth to course and chase, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day in turn as was their wont.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King fared forth to sport and hunt, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day by turn, as was their wont. Now Prince Amjad sat in judgement the first day, bidding and forbidding, appointing and deposing, giving and refusing; and Queen Hayat al-Nufus, mother of As'ad, wrote to him a letter suing for his favour and discovering to him her passion and devotion; altogether put tiny off the mask and giving him to know that she desired to enjoy him. So she took a scroll and thereon indited these cadences, \"From the love deranged * the sorrowful and estranged * whose torment is prolonged for the longing of thee! * Were I to recount to thee the extent of my care * and what of sadness I bear * the passion which my heart cloth tear * and all that I endure for weeping and unrest * and the rending of my sorrowful breast * my unremitting grief * and my woe without relief * and all my suffering for severance of thee * and sadness and love's ardency * no letter could contain it; nor calculation could compass it * Indeed earth and heaven upon me are strait; and I have no hope and no trust but what from thee I await * Upon death I am come nigh * and the horrors of dissolution I aby * Burning upon me is sore * with parting pangs and estrangement galore * Were I to set forth the yearnings that possess me more and more * no scrolls would suffice to hold such store * and of the excess of my pain and pine, I have made the following lines:- -\n\nWere I to dwell on heart-consuming heat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unease and transports in my spins meet,\nNothing were left of ink and reeden pen *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor aught of paper; no, not e'en a sheet.\n\nThen Queen Hayat al-Nufus wrapped up her letter in a niece of costly silk scented with musk and ambergris; and folded it up with her silken hair-strings[FN#358] whose cost swallowed down treasures laid it in a handkerchief and gave it to a eunuch bidding him bear it to Prince Amjad.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Nineteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that she gave her missive to the eunuch in waiting and bade him bear it to Prince Amjad. And that eunuch went forth ignoring what the future hid for him (for the Omniscient ordereth events even as He willeth); and, going in to the Prince, kissed the ground between his hands and handed to him the letter. On receiving the kerchief he opened it and, reading the epistle and recognizing its gist he was ware that his father's wife was essentially an adulteress and a traitress at heart to her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman. So he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and railed at women and their works, saying, \"Allah curse women, the traitresses, the imperfect in reason and religion!\"[FN#359] Then he drew his sword and said to the eunuch, \"Out on thee, thou wicked slave! Dost thou carry messages of disloyalty for thy lord's wife? By Allah, there is no good in thee, O black of hue and heart, O foul of face and Nature's forming!\" So he smote him on the neck and severed his head from his body; then, folding the kerchief over its contents he thrust it into his breast pocket and went in to his own mother and told her what had passed, reviling and reproaching her, and saying, \"Each one of you is viler than the other; and, by Allah the Great and Glorious, did I not fear ill-manneredly to transgress against the rights of my father, Kamar al-Zaman, and my brother, Prince As'ad, I would assuredly go in to her and cut off her head, even as I cut off that of her eunuch!\" Then he went forth from his mother in a mighty rage; and when the news reached Queen Hayat al-Nufus of what he had done with her eunuch, she abused him[FN#360] and cursed him and plotted perfidy against him. He passed the night, sick with rage, wrath and concern; nor found he pleasure in meat, drink or sleep. And when the next morning dawned Prince As'ad fared forth in his turn to rule the folk in his father's stead, whilst his mother, Hayat al-Nufus, awoke in feeble plight because of what she had heard from Prince Amjad concerning the slaughter of her eunuch. So Prince As'ad sat in the audience-chamber that day, judging and administering justice, appointing and deposing, bidding and forbidding, giving and bestowing. And he ceased not thus till near the time of afternoon-prayer, when Queen Budur sent for a crafty old woman and, discovering to her what was in her heart, wrote a letter to Prince As'ad, complaining of the excess of her affection and desire for him in these cadenced lines, \"From her who perisheth for passion and love-forlorn * to him who in nature and culture is goodliest born * to him who is conceited of his own loveliness * and glories in his amorous grace * who from those that seek to enjoy him averteth his face * and refuseth to show favour unto the self abasing and base * him who is cruel and of disdainful mood * from the lover despairing of good * to Prince As'ad * with passing beauty endowed * and of excelling grace proud * of the face moon bright * and the brow flower-white * and dazzling splendid light * This is my letter to him whose love melteth my body * and rendeth my skin and bones! * Know that my patience faileth me quite * and I am perplexed in my plight * longing and restlessness weary me * and sleep and patience deny themselves to me * but mourning and watching stick fast to me * and desire and passion torment me * and the extremes of languor and sickness have sheet me * Yet may my life be a ransom for thee * albeit thy pleasure be to slay her who loveth thee * and Allah prolong the life of thee * and preserve thee from all infirmity!\" And after these cadences she wrote these couplets,\n\n\"Fate hath commanded I become thy fere, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O shining like full moon when clearest clear!\nAll beauty dost embrace, all eloquence; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Brighter than aught within our worldly sphere:\nContent am I my torturer thou be: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply shalt alms me with one lovely leer!\nHappy her death who dieth for thy love! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No good in her who holdeth thee unclear!\"\n\nAnd also the following couplets,\n\n\"Unto thee, As'ad! I of passion-pangs complain; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Have ruth on slave of love so burnt with flaming pain:\nHow long, I ask, shall hands of Love disport with me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With longings, dolour, sleepliness and bale and bane?\nAnon I 'plain of sea in heart, anon of fire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In vitals, O strange case, dear wish, my fairest fain!\nO blamer, cease thy blame, and seek thyself to fly *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From love, which makes these eyne a rill of tears to rain.\nHow oft I cry for absence and desire, Ah grief! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But all my crying naught of gain for me shall gain:\nThy rigours dealt me sickness passing power to bear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thou art my only leach, assain me an thou deign!\nO chider, chide me not in caution, for I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That plaguey Love to thee shall also deal a bout.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur perfumed the letter-paper with a profusion of odoriferous musk and, winding it in her hairstrings which were of Iraki silk, with pendants of oblong emeralds, set with pearls and stones of price, delivered it to the old woman, bidding her carry it to Prince As'ad.[FN#361] She did so in order to pleasure her, and going in to the Prince, straightway and without stay, found him in his own rooms and delivered to him the letter in privacy; after which she stood waiting an hour or so for the answer. When As'ad had read the paper and knew its purport, he wrapped it up again in the ribbons and put it in his bosom-pocket: then (for he was wrath beyond all measure of wrath) he cursed false women and sprang up and drawing his sword, smote the old trot on the neck and cut off her pate. Thereupon he went in to his mother, Queen Hayat al-Nufus, whom he found lying on her bed in feeble case, for that which had betided her with Prince Amjad, and railed at her and cursed her; after which he left her and fore-gathered with his brother, to whom he related all that had befallen him with Queen Budur, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, but that I was ashamed before thee, I had gone in to her forthright and had smitten her head off her shoulders!\" Replied Prince Amjad, \"By Allah, O my brother, yesterday when I was sitting upon the seat of judgement, the like of what hath befallen thee this day befel me also with thy mother who sent me a letter of similar purport.\" And he told him all that had passed, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, naught but respect for thee withheld me from going in to her and dealing with her even as I dealt with the eunuch!\" They passed the rest of the night conversing and cursing womankind, and agreed to keep the matter secret, lest their father should hear of it and kill the two women. Yet they ceased not to suffer trouble and foresee affliction. And when the morrow dawned, the King returned with his suite from hunting and sat awhile in his chair of estate; after which he sent the Emirs about their business and went up to his palace, where he found his two wives lying a-bed and both exceeding sick and weak. Now they had made a plot against their two sons and concerted to do away their lives, for that they had exposed themselves before them and feared to be at their mercy and dependent upon their forbearance. When Kamar al-Zaman saw them on this wise, he said to them, \"What aileth you?\" Whereupon they rose to him and kissing his hands answered, perverting the case and saying \"Know, O King, that thy two sons, who have been reared in thy bounty, have played thee false and have dishonoured thee in the persons of thy wives.\" Now when he heard this, the light became darkness in his sight, and he raged with such wrath that his reason fled: then said he to them, \"Explain me this matter.\" Replied Queen Budur, \"O King of the age, know that these many days past thy son As'ad hath been in the persistent habit of sending me letters and messages to solicit me to lewdness and adultery while I still forbade him from this, but he would not be forbidden; and, when thou wentest forth to hunt, he rushed in on me, drunk and with a drawn sword in his hand, and smiting my eunuch, slew him. Then he mounted on my breast, still holding the sword, and I feared lest he should slay me, if I gainsaid him, even as he had slain my eunuch; so he took his wicked will of me by force. And now if thou do me not justice on him, O King, I will slay myself with my own hand, for I have no need of life in the world after this foul deed.\" And Queen Hayat al-Nufus, choking with tears, told him respecting Prince Amjad a story like that of her sister-wife.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twentieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen Hayat al-Nufus told her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman, a story like that of her sister in wedlock, Budur, and, quoth she, \"The same thing befel me with thy son Amjad;\" after which she took to weeping and wailing and said, \"Except thou do me justice on him I will tell my father, King Armanus.\" Then both women wept with sore weeping before King Kamar al-Zaman who, when he saw their tears and heard their words, concluded that their story was true and, waxing wroth beyond measure of wrath, went forth thinking to fall upon his two sons and put them to death. On his way he met his father- in-law, King Armanus who, hearing of his return from the chase, had come to salute him at that very hour and, seeing him with naked brand in hand and blood dripping from his nostrils, for excess of rage, asked what ailed him. So Kamar al-Zaman told him all that his sons Amjad and As'ad had done and added, \"And here I am now going in to them to slay them in the foulest way and make of them the most shameful of examples.\" Quoth King Armanus (and indeed he too was wroth with them), \"Thou dost well, O my son, and may Allah not bless them nor any sons that do such deed against their father's honour. But, O my son, the sayer of the old saw saith, 'Whoso looketh not to the end hath not Fortune to friend.' In any case, they are thy sons, and it befitteth not that thou kill them with shine own hand, lest thou drink of their death-agony,[FN#362] and anon repent of having slain them whenas repentance availeth thee naught. Rather do thou send them with one of thy Mamelukes into the desert and let him kill them there out of thy sight, for, as saith the adage, 'Out of sight of my friend is better and pleasanter.'[FN#363] And when Kamar al-Zaman heard his father-in-law's words, he knew them to be just; so he sheathed his sword and turning back, sat down upon the throne of his realm. There he summoned his treasurer, a very old man, versed in affairs and in fortune's vicissitudes, to whom he said, \"Go in to my sons, Amjad and As'ad; bind their hands behind them with strong bonds, lay them in two chests and load them upon a mule. Then take horse thou and carry them into mid desert, where do thou kill them both and fill two vials with their blood and bring the same to me in haste.\" Replied the treasurer, \"I hear and I obey,\" and he rose up hurriedly and went out forthright to seek the Princes; and, on his road, he met them coming out of the palace-vestibule, for they had donned their best clothes and their richest; and they were on their way to salute their sire and give him joy of his safe return from his going forth to hunt. Now when he saw them, he laid hands on them, saying, \"Omy sons, know ye that I am but a slave commanded, and that your father hath laid a commandment on me; will ye obey his commandment?\" They said, \"Yes\"; whereupon he went up to them and, after pinioning their arms, laid them in the chests which he loaded on the back of a mule he had taken from the city. And he ceased not carrying them into the open country till near noon, when he halted in a waste and desolate place and, dismounting from his mare, let down the two chests from the mule's back. Then he opened them and took out Amjad and As'ad; and when he looked upon them he wept sore for their beauty and loveliness; then drawing his sword he said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, indeed it is hard for me to deal so evilly by you; but I am to be excused in this matter, being but a slave commanded, for that your father King Kamar al-Zaman hath bidden me strike off your heads.\" They replied, \"O Emir, do the King's bidding, for we bear with patience that which Allah (to Whom be Honour, Might and Glory!) hath decreed to us; and thou art quit of our blood.\" Then they embraced and bade each other farewell, and As'ad said to the treasurer, \"Allah upon thee, O uncle, spare me the sight of my brother's death-agony and make me not drink of his anguish, but kill me first, for that were the easier for me.\" And Amjad said the like and entreated the treasurer to kill him before As'ad, saying, \"My brother is younger than I; so make me not taste of his anguish. And they both wept bitter tears whilst the treasurer wept for their weeping;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the treasurer wept for their weeping; then the two brothers embraced and bade farewell and one said to the other, \"All this cometh of the malice of those traitresses, my mother and thy mother; and this is the reward of my forbearance towards thy mother and of thy for bearance towards my mother! But there is no Might and there is no Majesty save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning.\"[FN#364] And As'ad em braced his brother, sobbing and repeating these couplets,\n\n\"O Thou to whom sad trembling wights in fear complain! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   O ever ready whatso cometh to sustain!\nThe sole resource for me is at Thy door to knock, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   At whose door knock an Thou to open wilt not deign?\nO Thou whose grace is treasured in the one word, Be![FN#365] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Favour me, I beseech, in Thee all weals contain.\"\n\nNow when Amjad heard his brother's weeping he wept also and pressing him to his bosom repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"O Thou whose boons to me are more than one! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose gifts and favours have nor count nor bound!\nNo stroke of all Fate's strokes e'er fell on me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Thee to take me by the hand I found.\"\nThen said Amjad to the treasurer, \"I conjure thee by the One, Omnipotent, the Lord of Mercy, the Beneficent! slay me before my brother As'ad, so haply shall the fire be quencht in my heart's core and in this life burn no more.\" But As'ad wept and exclaimed, \"Not so: I will die first;\" whereupon quoth Amjad, \"It were best that I embrace thee and thou embrace me, so the sword may fall upon us and slay us both at a single stroke.\" Thereupon they embraced, face to face and clung to each other straitly, whilst the treasurer tied up the twain and bound them fast with cords, weeping the while. Then he drew his blade and said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, it is indeed hard to me to slay you! But have ye no last wishes that I may fulfil or charges which I may carry out, or message which I may deliver?\" Replied Amjad, \"We have no wish; and my only charge to thee is that thou set my brother below and me above him, that the blow may fall on me first, and when thou hast killed us and returnest to the King and he asketh thee, 'What heardest thou from them before their death?'; do thou answer, 'Verily thy sons salute thee and say to thee, Thou knewest not if we were innocent or guilty, yet hast thou put us to death and hast not certified thyself of our sin nor looked into our case.' Then do thou repeat to him these two couplets,\n\n'Women are Satans made for woe o' men; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I fly to Allah from their devilish scathe:\nSource of whatever bale befel our kind, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    In wordly matters and in things of Faith.'\"\n\nContinued Amjad, \"We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was ad the Two Hundred and Twenty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad added, speaking to the treasurer, \"We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets which thou hast just now heard; and I conjure thee by Allah to have patience with us, whilst I cite to my brother this other pair of couplets.\" Then he wept with sore weeping and began,\n\n\"The Kings who fared before us showed *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Of instances full many a show:\nOf great and small and high and low *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     How many this one road have trod!\"\n\nNow when the treasurer heard these words from Amjad, he wept till his beard was wet, whilst As'ad's eyes brimmed with tears and he in turn repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Fate frights us when the thing is past and gone; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Weeping is not for form or face alone[FN#366]:\nWhat ails the Nights?[FN#367] Allah blot out our sin, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And be the Nights by other hand undone!\nEre this Zubayr-son[FN#368] felt their spiteful hate, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who fled for refuge to the House and Stone:\nWould that when Kh\u00e1rijah was for Amru slain[FN#369] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     They had ransomed Ali with all men they own.\"\n\nThen, with cheeks stained by tears down railing he recited also these verses,\n\n\"In sooth the Nights and Days are charactered *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    By traitor falsehood and as knaves they lie;\nThe Desert-reek[FN#370] recalls their teeth that shine; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    All horrid blackness is their K of eye:\nMy sin anent the world which I abhor *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Is sin of sword when sworders fighting hie.\"\n\nThen his sobs waxed louder and he said,\n\n\"O thou who woo'st a World[FN#371] unworthy, learn *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Tis house of evils, 'tis Perdition's net:\nA house where whoso laughs this day shall weep *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    The next: then perish house of fume and fret!\nEndless its frays and forays, and its thralls *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Are ne'er redeemed, while endless risks beset.\nHow many gloried in its pomps and pride, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Till proud and pompous did all bounds forget,\nThen showing back of shield she made them swill[FN#372] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Full draught, and claimed all her vengeance debt.\nFor know her strokes fall swift and sure, altho' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Long bide she and forslow the course of Fate:\nSo look thou to thy days lest life go by *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Idly, and meet thou more than thou hast met;\nAnd cut all chains of world-love and desire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And save thy soul and rise to secrets higher.\"\n\nNow when As'ad made an end of these verses, he strained his brother Amjad in his arms, till they twain were one body, and the treasurer, drawing his sword, was about to strike them, when behold, his steed took fright at the wind of his upraised hand, and breaking its tether, fled into the desert. Now the horse had cost a thousand gold pieces and on its back was a splendid saddle worth much money; so the treasurer threw down his sword, and ran after his beast.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when his horse ran away, the treasurer ran after it in huge concern, and ceased not running to catch the runaway till it entered a thicket. He followed it whilst it dashed through the wood, smiting the earth with its hoofs till it raised a dust-cloud which towered high in air; and snorting and puffing and neighing and waxing fierce and furious. Now there happened to be in this thicket a lion of terrible might; hideous to sight, with eyes sparkling light: his look was grim and his aspect struck fright into man's sprite. Presentry the treasurer turned and saw the lion making towards him; but found no way of escape nor had he his sword with him. So he said in himself, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This strait is come upon me for no other cause but because of Amjad and As'ad; and indeed this journey was unblest from the first!\" Meanwhile the two Princes were grievously oppressed by the heat and grew sore athirst, so that their tongues hung out and they cried for succour, but none came to their relief and they said, \"Would to Heaven we had been slain and were at peace from this pain! But we know not whither the horse hath fled, that the treasurer is gone and hath left us thus pinioned. If he would but come back and do us die, it were easier to us than this torture to aby.\" Said As'ad, \"O my brother, be patient, and the relief of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) shall assuredly come to us; for the horse started not away save of His favour towards us, and naught irketh us but this thirst.\" Upon this he stretched and shook himself and strained right and left, till he burst his pinion-bonds; then he rose and unbound his brother and catching up the Emir's sword, said, \"By Allah, we will not go hence, till we look after him and learn what is become of him.\" Then they took to following on the trail till it led them to the thicket and they said to each other, \"Of a surety, the horse and the treasurer have not passed out of this wood.\" Quoth As'ad, \"Stay thou here, whilst I enter the thicket and search it;\" and Amjad replied, \"I will not let thee go in alone: nor will we enter it but together; so if we escape, we shall escape together and if we perish, we shall perish together.\" Accordingly both entered and found that the lion had sprang upon the treasurer, who lay like a sparrow in his grip, calling upon Allah for aid and signing with his hands to Heaven. Now when Amjad saw this, he took the sword and, rushing upon the lion, smote him between the eyes and laid him dead on the ground. The Emir sprang up, marvelling at this escape and seeing Amjad and As'ad, his master's sons, standing there, cast himself at their feet and exclaimed, \"By Allah, O my lords, it were intolerable wrong in me to do you to death. May the man never be who would kill you! Indeed, with my very life, I will ransom you.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the treasurer to Amjad and As'ad, \"With my life will I ransom you both!\" Then he hastily rose and, at once embracing them, enquired how they had loosed their bonds and come thither; whereupon they told him how the bonds of one of them had fallen loose and he had unbound the other, whereto they were helped by the purity of their intentions, and how they had tracked his trail till they came upon him. So he thanked them for their deed and went with them forth of the thicket; and, when they were in the open country, they said to him, \"O uncle, do our father's bidding.\" He replied, \"Allah forbid that I should draw near to you with hurt! But know ye that I mean to take your clothes and clothe you with mine; then will I fill two vials with the lion's blood and go back to the King and tell him I have out vou to death. But as for you two, fare ye forth into the lands, for Allah's earth is wide; and know, O my lords, that it paineth me to part from you.\" At this, they all fell a-weeping; then the two youths put off their clothes and the treasurer habited them with his own. Moreover he made two parcels of their dress and, filling two vials with the lion's blood, set the parcels before him on his horse's back. Presently he took leave of them and, making his way to the city, ceased not faring till he went in to King Kamar al-Zaman and kissed the ground between his hands. The King saw him changed in face and troubled (which arose from his adventure with the lion) and, deeming this came of the slaughter of his two sons, rejoiced and said to him, \"Hast thou done the work?\" \"Yes, O our lord,\" replied the treasurer and gave him the two parcels of clothes and the two vials full of blood. Asked the King, \"What didst thou observe in them; and did they give thee any charge?\" Answered the treasurer, \"I found them patient and resigned to what came down upon them and they said to me, 'Verily, our father is excusable; bear him our salutation and say to him, 'Thou art quit of our killing. But we charge thee repeat to him these couplets,\n\n'Verily women are devils created for us. We seek refuge with God from the artifice of the devils. They are the source of all the misfortunes that have appeared among mankind in the affairs of the world and of religion.'''[FN#373]\n\nWhen the King heard these words of the treasurer, he bowed his head earthwards, a long while and knew his sons' words to mean that they had been wrongfully put to death. Then he bethought himself of the perfidy of women and the calamities brought about by them; and he took the two parcels and opened them and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping,\u2014And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Kamar la-Zaman opened the two bundles and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping, it so came to pass that he found, in the pocket of his son As'ad's raiment, a letter in the hand of his wife enclosing her hair strings; so he opened and read it and understanding the contents knew that the Prince had been falsely accused and wrongously. Then he searched Amjad's parcel of dress and found in his pocket a letter in the handwriting of Queen Hayat al-Nufus enclosing also her hair-strings; so he opened and read it and knew that Amjad too had been wronged; whereupon he beat hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I have slain my sons unjustly.\" And he buffeted his face, crying out, \"Alas, my sons! Alas, my long grief!\" Then he bade them build two tombs in one house, which he styled \"House of Lamentations,\" and had graved thereon his sons' names; and he threw himself on Amjad's tomb, weeping and groaning and lamenting, and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"O moon for ever set this earth below, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose loss bewail the stars which stud the sky!\nO wand, which broken, ne'er with bend and wave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall fascinate the ravisht gazer's eye;\nThese eyne for jealousy I 'reft of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nor shall they till next life thy sight descry:\nI'm drowned in sea of tears for insomny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherefore, indeed in S\u00e1hirah-stead[FN#374] I lie.\"\nThen he threw himself on As'ad's tomb, groaning and weeping and lamenting and versifying with these couplets,\n\"Indeed I longed to share unweal with thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    But Allah than my will willed otherwise:\nMy grief all blackens 'twixt mine eyes and space, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet whitens all the blackness from mine eyes:[FN#375]\nOf tears they weep these eyne run never dry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And ulcerous flow in vitals never dries:\nRight sore it irks me seeing thee in stead[FN#376] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where slave with sovran for once levelled lies.\"\n\nAnd his weeping and wailing redoubled; and, after he had ended his lamentations and his verse, he forsook his friends and intimates, and denying himself to his women and his family, cut himself off from the world in the House of Lamentations, where he passed his time in weeping for his sons. Such was his case; but as regards Amjad and As'ad they fared on into the desert eating of the fruits of the earth and drinking of the remnants of the rain for a full month, till their travel brought them to a mountain of black flint[FN#377] whose further end was unknown; and here the road forked, one line lying along the midway height and the other leading to its head. They took the way trending to the top and gave not over following it five days, but saw no end to it and were overcome with weariness, being unused to walking upon the mountains or elsewhere.[FN#378] At last, despairing of coming to the last of the road, they retraced their steps and, taking the other, that led over the midway heights,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princes Amjad and As'ad returned from the path leading to the Mountain- head and took that which ran along the midway heights, and walked through all that day till nightfall, when As'ad, weary with much travel, said to Amjad, \"O my brother, I can walk no farther, for I am exceeding weak.\" Replied Amjad, \"O my brother, take courage! May be Allah will send us relief.\" So they walked on part of the night, till the darkness closed in upon them, when As'ad became weary beyond measure of weariness and cried out, \"O my brother, I am worn out and spent with walking,\" and threw himself upon the ground and wept. Amjad took him in his arms and walked on with him, bytimes sitting down to rest till break of day, when they came to the mountain-top and found there a stream of running water and by it a pomegranate-tree and a prayer-niche.[FN#379] They could hardly believe their eyes when they saw it; but, sitting down by that spring, drank of its water and ate of the fruit of that granado-tree; after which they lay on the ground and slept till sunrise, when they washed and bathed in the spring and, eating of the pomegranates, slept again till the time of mid-afternoon prayer. Then they thought to continue their journey, but As'ad could not walk, for both his feet were swollen. So they abode there three days till they were rested, after which they set out again and fared on over the mountain days and nights, tortured by and like to die of thirst, till they sighted a city gleaming afar off, at which they rejoiced and made towards it. When they drew near it, they thanked Allah (be His Name exalted!) and Amjad said to As'ad, \"O my brother, sit here, whilst I go to yonder city and see what it is and whose it is and where we are in Allah's wide world, that we may know through what lands we have passed in crossing this mountain, whose skirts had we followed, we had not reached this city in a whole year. So praised be Allah for safety!\" Replied As'ad, \"By Allah, O my brother, none shall go down into that city save myself, and may I be thy ransom! If thou leave me alone, be it only for an hour, I shall imagine a thousand things and be drowned in a torrent of anxiety on shine account, for I cannot brook shine absence from me.\" Amjad rejoined, \"Go then and tarry not. So As'ad took some gold pieces, and leaving his brother to await him, descended the mountain and ceased not faring on till he entered the city. As he threaded the streets he was met by an old man age-decrepit, whose beard flowed down upon his breast and forked in twain;[FN#380] he bore a walking-staff in his hand and was richly clad, with a great red turband on his head. When As'ad saw him, he wondered at his dress and his mien; nevertheless, he went up to him and saluting him said, \"Where be the way to the market, O my master?\" Hearing these words the Shaykh smiled in his face and replied, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" As'ad rejoined, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Shaykh who met As'ad smiled in his face and said to him, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" and As'ad replied, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\" Then rejoined the old man, \"Verily, thou gladdenest our country with thy presence, O my son, and thou desolatest shine own land by reason of shine absence. What wantest thou of the market?\" Quoth As'ad, \"O uncle, I have a brother, with whom I have come from a far land and with whom I have journeyed these three months; and, when we sighted this city, I left him, who is my elder brother, upon the mountain and came hither, purposing to buy victual and what else, and return therewith to him, that we might feed thereon.\" Said the old man, \"Rejoice in all good, O my son, and know thou that to-day I give a marriage-feast, to which I have bidden many guests, and I have made ready plenty of meats, the best and most delicious that heart can desire. So if thou wilt come with me to my place, I will give thee freely all thou lackest without asking thee a price or aught else. Moreover I will teach thee the ways of this city; and, praised be Allah, O my son, that I, and none other have happened upon thee.\" \"As thou wilt,\" answered As'ad, \"do as thou art disposed, but make haste, for indeed my brother awaiteth me and his whole heart is with me.\" The old man took As'ad by the hand and carried him to a narrow lane, smiling in his face and saying, \"Glory be to Him who hath delivered thee from the people of this city!\" And he ceased not walking till he entered a spacious house, wherein was a saloon and behold, in the middle of it were forty old men, well stricken in years, collected together and forming a single ring as they sat round about a lighted fire, to which they were doing worship and prostrating themselves.[FN#381] When As'ad saw this, he was confounded and the hair of his body stood on end though he knew not what they were; and the Shaykh said to them, \"O Elders of the Fire, how blessed is this day!\" Then he called aloud, saying, \"Hello, Ghazb\u00e1n!\" Whereupon there came out to him a tall black slave of frightful aspect, grim-visaged and flat nosed as an ape who, when the old man made a sign to him, bent As'ad's arms behind his back and pinioned them; after which the Shaykh said to him, \"Let him down into the vault under the earth and there leave him and say to my slave girl Such-an-one, 'Torture him night and day and give him a cake of bread to eat morning and evening against the time come of the voyage to the Blue Sea and the Mountain of Fire, whereon we will slaughter him as a sacrifice.'\" So the black carried him out at another door and, raising a flag in the floor, discovered a flight of twenty steps leading to a chamber[FN#382] under the earth, into which he descended with him and, laying his feet in irons, gave him over to the slave girl and went away. Meanwhile, the old men said to one another, \"When the day of the Festival of the Fire cometh, we will sacrifice him on the mountain, as a propitiatory offering whereby we shall pleasure the Fire.\" Presently the damsel went down to him and beat him a grievous beating, till streams of blood flowed from his sides and he fainted; after which she set at his head a scone of bread and a cruse of brackish water and went away and left him. In the middle of the night, he revived and found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating: so he wept bitter tears; and recalling his former condition of honour and prosperity, lordship and dominion, and his separation from his sire and his exile from his native land.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when As'ad found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating he recalled his whilome condition of honour and prosperity and dominion and lordship, and he wept and groaned aloud and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Stand by the ruined stead and ask of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor deem we dwell there as was state of us:\nThe World, that parter, hath departed us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet soothes not hate-full hearts the fate of us:\nWith whips a cursed slave girl scourges us, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And teems her breast with rancorous hate of us:\nAllah shall haply deign to unpart our lives, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Chastise our foes, and end this strait of us.\"\n\nAnd when As'ad had spoken his poetry, he put out his hand towards his head and finding there the crust and the cruse full of brackish water he ate a bittock, just enough to keep life in him, and drank a little water, but could get no sleep till morning for the swarms of bugs[FN#383] and lice. As soon as it was day, the slave girl came down to him and changed his clothes, which were drenched with blood and stuck to him, so that his skin came off with the shirt; wherefor he shrieked aloud and cried, \"Alas!\" and said, \"O my God, if this be Thy pleasure, increase it upon me! O Lord, verily Thou art not unmindful of him that oppresseth me; do Thou then avenge me upon him!\" And he groaned and repeated the following verses,\n\n\n\"Patient, O Allah! to Thy destiny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I bow, suffice me what Thou deign decree:\nPatient to bear Thy will, O Lord of me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Patient to burn on coals of Ghaz\u00e1-tree:\nThey wrong me, visit me with hurt and harm; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply Thy grace from them shall set me free:\nFar be's, O Lord, from thee to spare the wronger *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O Lord of Destiny my hope's in Thee!\"\n\nAnd what another saith,\n\n\"Bethink thee not of worldly state, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Leave everything to course of Fate;\nFor oft a thing that irketh thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall in content eventuate;\nAnd oft what strait is shall expand, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And what expanded is wax strait.\nAllah will do what wills His will *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So be not thou importunate!\nBut 'joy the view of coming weal *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall make forget past bale and bate.\"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verse, the slave-girl came down upon him with blows till he fainted again; and, throwing him a flap of bread and a gugglet of saltish water, went away and left him sad and lonely, bound in chains of iron, with the blood streaming from his sides and far from those he loved. So he wept and called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that As'ad called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed; so he wept and groaned and complained and poured forth tears in floods and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"Easy, O Fate! how long this wrong, this injury, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Robbing each morn and eve my brotherhood fro' me?\nIs't not time now thou deem this length sufficiency *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Of woes and, O thou Heart of Rock, show clemency?\nMy friends thou wrongedst when thou madst each enemy *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Mock and exult me for thy wrongs, thy tyranny:\nMy foeman's heart is solaced by the things he saw *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   In me, of strangerhood and lonely misery:\nSuffice thee not what came upon my head of dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Friends lost for evermore, eyes wan and pale of blee?\nBut must in prison cast so narrow there is naught *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Save hand to bite, with bitten hand for company;\nAnd tears that tempest down like goodly gift of cloud, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And longing thirst whose fires weet no satiety.\nRegretful yearnings, singulfs and unceasing sighs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Repine, remembrance and pain's very ecstacy:\nDesire I suffer sore and melancholy deep, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And I must bide a prey to endless phrenesy:\nI find me ne'er a friend who looks with piteous eye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And seeks my presence to allay my misery:\nSay, liveth any intimate with trusty love *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Who for mine ills will groan, my sleepless malady?\nTo whom moan I can make and, peradventure, he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall pity eyes that sight of sleep can never see?\nThe flea and bug suck up my blood, as wight that drinks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wine from the proffering hand of fair virginity:\nAmid the lice my body aye remindeth me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of orphan's good in K\u00e1zi's claw of villainy:\nMy home's a sepulchre that measures cubits three, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where pass I morn and eve in chained agony:\nMy wines are tears, my clank of chains takes music's stead, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cares my dessert of fruit and sorrows are my bed.\"\n\nAnd when he had versed his verse and had prosed his prose, he again groaned and complained and remembered he had been and how he had been parted from his brother. Thus far concerning him; but as regards his brother Amjad, he awaited As'ad till mid-day yet he returned not to him: whereupon Amjad's vitals fluttered, the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirtieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Amjad awaited his brother As'ad till mid-day and he returned not to him, Amjad's vitals fluttered; the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears, exclaiming, \"Alas, my brother! Alas, my friend! Alas my grief! How I feared me we should be separated!\" Then he descended from the mountain-top with the tears running down his cheeks; and, entering the city, ceased not walking till he made the market. He asked the folk the name of the place and concerning its people and they said, \"This is called the City of the Magians, and its citizens are mostly given to Fire-worshipping in lieu of the Omnipotent King.\" Then he enquired of the City of Ebony and they answered, \"Of a truth it is a year's journey thither by land and six months by sea: it was governed erst by a King called Armanus; but he took to son- in-law and made King in his stead a Prince called Kamar al-Zaman distinguished for justice and munificence, equity and benevolence.\" When Amjad heard tell of his father, he groaned and wept and lamented and knew not whither to go. However, he bought a something of food and carried it to a retired spot where he sat down thinking to eat; but, recalling his brother, he fell a- weeping and swallowed but a morsel to keep breath and body together, and that against his will. Then he rose and walked about the city, seeking news of his brother, till he saw a Moslem tailor sitting in his shop so he sat down by him and told him his story; whereupon quoth the tailor, \"If he have fallen into the hands of the Magians, thou shalt hardly see him again: yet it may be Allah will reunite you twain. But thou, O my brother,\" he continued wilt thou lodge with me?\" Amjad answered, \"Yes\"; and the tailor rejoiced at this. So he abode with him many days, what while the tailor comforted him and exhorted him to patience and taught him tailoring, till he became expert in the craft. Now one day he went forth to the sea-shore and washed his clothes; after which he entered the bath and put on clean raiment; then he walked about the city, to divert himself with its sights and presently there met him on the way a woman of passing beauty and loveliness, without peer for grace and comeliness. When she saw him she raised her face-veil and signed to him by moving her eyebrows and her eyes with luring glances, and versified these couplets,\n\n\"I drooped my glance when seen thee on the way *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As though, O slim-waist! felled by Sol's hot ray:\nThou art the fairest fair that e'er appeared, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fairer to-day than fair of yesterday:[FN#384]\nWere Beauty parted, a fifth part of it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With Joseph or a part of fifth would stay;\nThe rest would fly to thee, shine ownest own; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be every soul thy sacrifice, I pray!\"\n\nWhen Amjad heard these her words, they gladdened his heart which inclined to her and his bowels yearned towards her and the hands of love sported with him; so he sighed to her in reply and spoke these couplets,\n\n\"Above the rose of cheek is thorn of lance;[FN#385] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who dareth pluck it, rashest chevisance?\nStretch not thy hand towards it, for night long *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Those lances marred because we snatched a glance!\nSay her, who tyrant is and tempter too *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     (Though justice might her tempting power enhance):\u2014\nThy face would add to errors were it veiled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveiled I see its guard hath best of chance!\nEye cannot look upon Sol's naked face; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But can, when mist-cloud dims his countenance:\nThe honey-hive is held by honey-bee;[FN#386] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ask the tribe-guards what wants their vigilance?\nAn they would slay me, let them end their ire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rancorous, and grant us freely to advance:\nThey're not more murderous, an charge the whole *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Than charging glance of her who wears the mole.\"\n\nAnd hearing these lines from Amjad she sighed with the deepest sighs and, signing to him again, repeated these couplets,\n\n\"'Tis thou hast trodden coyness path not I: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Grant me thy favours for the time draws nigh:\nO thou who makest morn with light of brow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And with loosed brow-locks night in lift to stye!\nThine idol-aspect made of me thy slave, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tempting as temptedst me in days gone by:\n'Tis just my liver fry with hottest love: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who worship fire for God must fire aby:\nThou sellest like of me for worthless price; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thou must sell, ask high of those who buy.\"\nWhen Amjad heard these her words he said to her, \"Wilt thou come to my lodging or shall I go with thee to shine?\" So she hung her head in shame to the ground and repeated the words of Him whose Name be exalted, \"Men shall have the pre-eminence above women, because of those advantages wherein Allah hath caused the one of them to excel the other.\"[FN#387] Upon this, Amjad took the hint.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad took the woman's hint and understood that she wished to go with him whither he was going; he felt himself bounder to find a place wherein to receive her, but was ashamed to carry her to the house of his host, the tailor. So he walked on and she walked after him, and the two ceased not walking from street to street and place to place, till she was tired and said to him, \"O my lord, where is thy house?\" Answered he, \"Before us a little way.\" Then he turned aside into a handsome by-street, followed by the young woman, and walked on till he came to the end, when he found it was no thoroughfare and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" Then raising his eyes, he saw, at the upper end of the lane a great doer with two stone benches; but it was locked. So Amjad sat down on one of the benches and she on the other; and she said to him, \"O my lord, wherefore waitest thou?\" He bowed his head awhile to the ground then raised it and answered, \"I am awaiting my Mameluke who hath the key; for I bade him make me ready meat and drink and flowers, to deck the wine-service against my return from the bath.\" But he said to himself, \"Haply the time will be tedious to her and she will go about her business, leaving me here, when I will wend my own way.\" However, as soon as she was weary of long waiting, she said, \"O my lord, thy Mameluke delayeth; and here are we sitting in the street;\" and she arose and took a stone and went up to the lock. Said Amjad, \"Be not in haste, but have patience till the servant come.\" However, she hearkened not to him, but smote the wooden bolt with the stone and broke it in half, whereupon the door opened. Quoth he, \"What possessed thee to do this deed?\" Quoth she, \"Pooh, pooh, my lord! what matter it? Is not the house thy house and thy place?\" He said, \"There was no need to break the bolt.\" Then the damsel entered, to the confusion of Amjad, who knew not what to do for fear of the people of the house; but she said to him, \"Why dost thou not enter, O light of mine eyes and core of my heart?\" Replied he, \"I hear and obey; but my servant tarrieth long and I know not if he have done aught of what I bade him and specially enjoined upon him, or not.\" Hereupon he entered, sore in fear of the people of the house, and found himself in a handsome saloon with four dais'd recesses, each facing other, and containing closets and raised seats, all bespread with stuffs of silk and brocade; and in the midst was a jetting fountain of costly fashion, on whose margin rested a covered tray of meats, with a leather tablecloth hanging up and gem-encrusted dishes, full of fruits and sweet- scented flowers. Hard by stood drinking vessels and a candlestick with a single wax-candle therein; and the place was full of precious stuffs and was ranged with chests and stools, and on each seat lay a parcel of clothes upon which was a purse full of monies, gold and silver. The floor was paved with marble and the house bore witness in every part to its owner's fortune. When Amjad saw all this, he was confounded at his case and said to himself, \"I am a lost man! Verily we are Allah's and to Allah we are returning!\" As for the damsel, when she sighted the place she rejoiced indeed with a joy nothing could exceed, and said to him, \"By Allah, O my lord, thy servant hath not failed of his duty; for see, he hath swept the place and cooked the meat and set on the fruit; and indeed I come at the best of times.\" But he paid no heed to her, his heart being taken up with fear of the house- folk; and she said, \"Fie, O my lord, O my heart! What aileth thee to stand thus?\" Then she sighed and, giving him a buss which sounded like the cracking of a walnut, said, \"O my lord, an thou have made an appointment with other than with me, I will gird my middle and serve her and thee. Amjad laughed from a heart full of rage and wrath and came forwards and sat down, panting and saying to himself, \"Alack, mine ill death and doom when the owner of the place shall return!\" Then she seated herself by him and fell to toying and laughing, whilst Amjad sat careful and frowning, thinking a thousand thoughts and communing with himself, \"Assuredly the master of the house cannot but come, and then what shall I say to him? he needs must kill me and my life will be lost thus foolishly.\" Presently she rose and, tucking up her sleeves, took a tray of food on which she laid the cloth and then set it before Amjad and began to eat, saying, \"Eat, O my lord.\" So he came forward and ate; but the food was not pleasant to him; on the contrary he ceased not to look towards the door, till the damsel had eaten her fill, when she took away the tray of the meats and, setting on the dessert, fell to eating of the dried fruits. Then she brought the wine service and opening the jar, filled a cup and handed it to Amjad, who took it from her hand saying to him self, ' Ah, ah! and well away, when the master of the house cometh and seeth me!\"; and he kept his eyes fixed on the threshold, even with cup in hand. While he was in this case, lo! in came the master of the house, who was a white slave, one of the chief men of the city, being Master of the Horse[FN#388] to the King. He had fitted up this saloon for his pleasures, that he might make merry therein and be private with whom he would, and he had that day bidden a youth whom he loved and had made this entertainment for him. Now the name of this slave was Bah\u00e1dur,[FN#389] and he was open of hand, generous, munificent and fain of alms-giving and charitable works.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it wad the Two Hundred and Thirty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Bahadur, the Master of the Horse and the owner of the house, came to the door of the saloon and found it open, he entered slowly and softly and looking in, with head advanced and out stretched neck, saw Amjad and the girl sitting before the dish of fruit and the wine-jar in front of them. Now Amjad at that moment had the cup in his hand and his face turned to the door; and when his glance met Bahadur's eyes his hue turned pale yellow and his side-muscles quivered, so seeing his trouble Bahadur signed to him with his finger on his lips, as much as to say, \"Be silent and come hither to me.\" Whereupon he set down the cup and rose and the damsel cried, \"Whither away?\" He shook his head and, signing to her that he wished to make water, went out into the passage barefoot. Now when he saw Bahadur he knew him for the master of the house; so he hastened to him and, kissing his hands, said to him, \"Allah upon thee, O my lord, ere thou do me a hurt, hear what I have to say.\" Then he told him who he was from first to last and acquainted him with what caused him to quit his native land and royal state, and how he had not entered his house of his free will, but that it was the girl who had broken the lock-bolt and done all this.[FN#390] When Bahadur heard his story and knew that he was a King's son, he felt for him and, taking compassion on him, said, \"Hearken to me, O Amjad, and do what I bid thee and I will guarantee thy safety from that thou fearest; but, if thou cross me, I will kill thee.\" Amjad replied, \"Command me as thou wilt: I will not gainsay thee in aught; no, never, for I am the freedman of thy bounty.\" Rejoined Bahadur, \"Then go back forthwith into the saloon, sit down in thy place and be at peace and at shine ease; I will presently come in to thee, and when thou seest me (remember my name is Bahadur) do thou revile me and rail at me, saying, 'What made thee tarry till so late?' And accept no excuse from me; nay, so far from it, rise and beat me; and, if thou spare me, I will do away thy life. Enter now and make merry and whatsoever thou seekest of me at this time I will bring thee forthwith; and do thou spend this night as thou wilt and on the morrow wend thy way. This I do in honour of thy strangerhood, for I love the stranger and hold myself bounder to do him devoir.\" So Amjad kissed his hand, and, returning to the saloon with his face clad in its natural white and red, at once said to the damsel, \"O my mistress, thy presence hath gladdened this shine own place and ours is indeed a blessed night.\" Quoth the girl, \"Verily I see a wonderful change in thee, that thou now welcomest me so cordially!\" So Amjad answered, \"By Allah, O my lady, methought my servant Bahadur had robbed me of some necklaces of jewels, worth ten thousand diners each; however, when I went out but now in concern for this, I sought for them and found them in their place. I know not why the slave tarrieth so long and needs must I punish him for it.\" She was satisfied with his answer, and they sported and drank and made merry and ceased not to be so till near sundown, when Bahadur came in to them, having changed his clothes and girt his middle and put on shoes, such as are worn of Mamelukes. He saluted and kissed the ground; then held his hands behind him and stood, with his head hanging down, as one who confesseth to a fault. So Amjad looked at him with angry eyes and asked, \"Why hast thou tarried till now, O most pestilent of slaves?\" Answered Bahadur, \"O my lord, I was busy washing my clothes and knew not of thy being here; for our appointed time was nightfall and not day-tide.\" But Amjad cried out at him, saying, \"Thou liest, O vilest of slaves! By Allah, I must needs beat thee.\" So he rose and, throwing Bahadur prone on the ground, took a stick and beat him gently; but the damsel sprang up and, snatching the stick from his hand, came down upon Bahadur so lustily, that in extreme pain the tears ran from his eyes and he ground his teeth together and called out for succour; whilst Amjad cried out to the girl \"Don't\"; and she cried out, \"Let me satisfy my anger upon him!\" till at last he pulled the stick out of her hand and pushed her away. So Bahadur rose and, wiping away his tears from his cheeks, waited upon them the while, after which he swept the hall and lighted the lamps; but as often as he went in and out, the lady abused him and cursed him till Amjad was wroth with her and said, \"For Almighty Allah's sake leave my Mameluke; he is not used to this.\" Then they sat and ceased not eating and drinking (and Bahadur waiting upon them) till midnight when, being weary with service and beating, he fell asleep in the midst of the hall and snored and snorted; whereupon the damsel, who was drunken with wine, said to Amjad, \"Arise, take the sword hanging yonder and cut me off this slave's head; and, if thou do it not, I will be the death of thee!\" \"What possesseth thee to slay my slave?\" asked Amjad; and she answered, \"Our joyaunce will not be complete but by his death. If thou wilt not kill him, I will do it myself.\" Quoth Amjad, \"By Allah's rights to thee, do not this thing!\" Quoth she, \"It must perforce be;\" and, taking down the sword, drew it and made at Bahadur to kill him; but Amjad said in his mind, \"This man hath entreated us courteously and sheltered us and done us kindness and made himself my slave: shall we requite him by slaughtering him? This shall never be!\" Then he said to the woman, \"If my Mameluke must be killed, better I should kill him than thou.\" So saying, he took the sword from her and, raising his hand, smote her on the neck and made her head fly from her body. It fell upon Bahadur who awoke and sat up and opened his eyes, when he saw Amjad standing by him and in his hand the sword dyed with blood, and the damsel lying dead. He enquired what had passed, and Amjad told him all she had said, adding, \"Nothing would satisfy her but she must slay thee; and this is her reward.\" Then Bahadur rose and, kissing the Prince's hand, said to him, \"Would to Heaven thou hadst spared her! but now there is nothing for it but to rid us of her without stay or delay, before the day-break.\" Then he girded his loins and took the body, wrapped it in an Ab\u00e1-cloak and, laying it in a large basket of palm-leaves, he shouldered it saying, \"Thou art a stranger here and knowest no one: so sit thou in this place and await my return till day-break. If I come back to thee, I will assuredly do thee great good service and use my endeavours to have news of thy brother; but if by sunrise I return not, know that all is over with me; and peace be on thee, and the house and all it containeth of stuffs and money are shine.\" Then he fared forth from the saloon bearing the basket; and, threading the streets, he made for the salt sea, thinking to throw it therein: but as he drew near the shore, he turned and saw that the Chief of Police and his officers had ranged themselves around him; and, on recognising him, they wondered and opened the basket, wherein they found the slain woman. So they seized him and laid him in bilboes all that night till the morning, when they carried him and the basket, as it was, to the King and reported the case. The King was sore enraged when he looked upon the slain and said to Bahadur, \"Woe to thee! Thou art always so doing; thou killest folk and castest them into the sea and takest their goods. How many murders hast thou done ere this?\" Thereupon Bahadur hung his head.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahadur hung down his head groundwards before the King, who cried out at him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Who killed this girl?\" He replied, \"O my lord! I killed her, and there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"[FN#391] So the King in his anger, commanded to hang him; and the hangman went down with him by the King's commandment, and the Chief of Police accompanied him with a crier who called upon all the folk to witness the execution of Bahadur, the King's Master of the Horse; and on this wise they paraded him through the main streets and the market-streets. This is how it fared with Bahadur; but as regards Amjad, he awaited his host's return till the day broke and the sun rose, and when he saw that he came not, he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Would I knew what is become of him?\" And, as he sat musing behold, he heard the crier proclaiming Bahadur's sentence and bidding the people to see the spectacle of his hanging at midday; whereat he wept and exclaimed, \"Verily, we are Allah's and to Him we are returning! He meaneth to sacrifice himself unjustly for my sake, when I it was who slew her. By Allah, this shall never be!\" Then he went from the saloon and, shutting the door after him, hurriedly threaded the streets till he overtook Bahadur, when he stood before the Chief of Police and said to him, \"O my lord, put not Bahadur to death, for he is innocent. By Allah, none killed her but I.\" Now when the Captain of Police heard these words, he took them both and, carrying them before the King, acquainted him with what Amjad had said; whereupon he looked at the Prince and asked him, \"Didst thou kill the damsel?\" He answered, \"Yes\" and the King said, \"Tell me why thou killedst her, and speak the truth.\" Replied Amjad, \"O King, it is indeed a marvellous event and a wondrous matter that hath befallen me: were it graven with needles on the eye-corners, it would serve as a warner to whoso would be warned!\" Then he told him his whole story and informed him of all that had befallen him and his brother, first and last; whereat the King was much startled and surprised and said to him, \"Know that now I find thee to be excusable; but list, O youth! Wilt thou be my Waz\u00edr?\" \"Hearkening and obedience,\" answered Amjad whereupon the King bestowed magnificent dresses of honour on him and Bahadur and gave him a handsome house, with eunuchs and officers and all things needful, appointing him stipends and allowances and bidding him make search for his brother As'ad. So Amjad sat down in the seat of the Wazirate and governed and did justice and invested and deposed and took and gave. Moreover, he sent out a crier to cry his brother throughout the city, and for many days made proclamation in the main streets and market-streets, but heard no news of As'ad nor happened on any trace of him. Such was his case; but as regards his brother, the Magi ceased not to torture As'ad night and day and eve and morn for a whole year's space, till their festival drew near, when the old man Bahram[FN#392] made ready for the voyage and fitted out a ship for himself.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahram, the Magian, having fitted out a ship for the voyage, took As'ad and put him in a chest which he locked and had it transported on board. Now it so came to pass that, at the very time of shipping it, Amjad was standing to divert himself by looking upon the sea; and when he saw the men carrying the gear and shipping it, his heart throbbed and he called to his pages to bring him his beast. Then, mounting with a company of his officers, he rode down to the sea-side and halted before the Magian's ship, which he commended his men to board and search. They did his bidding, and boarded the vessel and rummaged in every part, but found nothing; so they returned and told Amjad, who mounted again and rode back. But he felt troubled in mind; and when he reached his place and entered his palace, he cast his eyes on the wall and saw written thereon two lines which were these couplets,\n\n\"My friends! if ye are banisht from mine eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From heart and mind ye ne'er go wandering:\nBut ye have left me in my woe, and rob *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rest from my eyelids while ye are slumbering.\"\n\nAnd seeing them Amjad thought of his brother and wept. Such was his case; but as for Bahram, the Magian, he embarked and shouted and bawled to his crew to make sail in all haste. So they shook out the sails and departed and ceased not to fare on many days and nights; and, every other day, Bahram took out As'ad and gave him a bit of bread and made him drink a sup of water, till they drew near the Mountain of Fire. Then there came out on them a storm-wind and the sea rose against them, so that the ship was driven out of her course till she took a wrong line and fell into strange waters; and, at last they came in sight of a city builded upon the shore, with a castle whose windows overlooked the main. Now the ruler of this city was a Queen called Marj\u00e1nah, and the captain said to Bahram, \"O my lord, we have strayed from our course and come to the island of Queen Marjanah, who is a devout Moslemah; and, if she know that we are Magians, she will take our ship and slay us to the last man. Yet needs must we put in here to rest and refit.\" Quoth Bahram, \"Right is thy recking, and whatso thou seest fit that will I do!\" Said the ship master, \"If the Queen summon us and question us, how shall we answer her?\"; and Bahram replied, \"Let us clothe this Moslem we have with us in a Mameluke's habit and carry him ashore with us, so that when the Queen sees him, she will suppose and say, 'This is a slave.' As for me I will tell her that I am a slave-dealer[FN#393] who buys and sells white slaves, and that I had with me many but have sold all save this one, whom I retained to keep my accounts, for he can read and write.\" And the captain said \"This device should serve.\" Presently they reached the city and slackened sail and cast the anchors; and the ship lay still, when behold, Queen Marjanah came down to them, attended by her guards and, halting before the vessel, called out to the captain, who landed and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"What is the lading of this thy ship and whom hast thou with thee?\"\" Quoth he, \"O Queen of the Age, I have with me a merchant who dealeth in slaves.\" And she said, \"Hither with him to me\"; whereupon Bahram came ashore to her, with As'ad walking behind him in a slave's habit, and kissed the earth before her. She asked, \"What is thy condition?\"; and he answered, \"I am a dealer in chattels.\" Then she looked at As'ad and, taking him for a Mameluke, asked him, \"What is thy name, O youth?\" He answered, \"Dost thou ask my present or my former name?\" \"Hast thou then two names?\" enquired she, and he replied (and indeed his voice was choked with tears), \"Yes; my name aforetime was Al-As'ad, the most happy, but now it is Al- Mu'tarr\u2014Miserrimus.\" Her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Canst thou write?\" \"Yes,'' answered he, and she gave him ink- case and reed-pen and paper and said to him, \"Write somewhat that I may see it.\" So he wrote these two couplets,\n\n\"What can the slave do when pursued by Fate, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O justest Judge! whatever be his state?[FN#394]\nWhom God throws hand bound in the depths and says, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware lest water should thy body wet?\"[FN#395]\n\nNow when she read these lines, she had ruth upon him and said to Bahram, \"Sell me this slave.\" He replied, \"O my lady, I cannot sell him, for I have parted with all the rest and none is left with me but he.\" Quoth the Queen, \"I must need have him of thee, either by sale or way of gift.\" But quoth Bahram, \"I will neither sell him nor give him.\" Whereat she was wroth and, taking As'ad by the hand, carried him up to the castle and sent to Bahram, saying, \"Except thou set sail and depart our city this very night, I will seize all thy goods and break up thy ship.\" Now when the message reached the Magian, he grieved with sore grief and cried, \"Verily this voyage is on no wise to be commended.\" Then he arose and made ready and took all he needed and awaited the coming of the night to resume his voyage, saying to the sailors, \"Provide yourselves with your things and fill your water-skins, that we may set sail at the last of the night.\" So the sailors did their business and awaited the coming of darkness. Such was their case; but as regards Queen Marjanah, when she had brought As'ad into the castle, she opened the casements overlooking the sea and bade her handmaids bring food. They set food before As'ad and herself and both ate, after which the Queen called for wine.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Marjanah bade her handmaids bring wine and they set it before her, she fell to drinking with As'ad. Now, Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) filled her heart with love for the Prince and she kept filling his cup and handing it to him till his reason fled; and presently he rose and left the hall to satisfy a call of nature. As he passed out of the saloon he saw an open door through which he went and walked on till his walk brought him to a vast garden full of all manner fruits and flowers; and, sitting down under a tree, he did his occasion. Then he rose and went up to a jetting fountain in the garden and made the lesser ablution and washed his hands and face, after which he would have risen to go away; but the air smote him and he fell back, with his clothes undone and slept, and night overcame him thus. So far concerning him; but as concerns Bahram, the night being come, he cried out to his crew, saying, \"Set sail and let us away!\"; and the' answered, \"We hear and obey, but wait till we fill our water- skins and then we will set sail.\" So they landed with their water skins and went round about the castle, and found nothing but garden-walls: whereupon they climbed over into the garden and followed the track of feet, which led them to the fountain; and there they found As'ad lying on his back. They knew him and were glad to find him; and, after filling their water-skins, they bore him off and climbed the wall again with him and carried him back in haste to Bahram to whom they said, \"Hear the good tidings of thy winning thy wish; and gladden thy heart and beat thy drums and sound thy pipes; for thy prisoner, whom Queen Marjanah took from thee by force, we have found and brought back to thee\"; and they threw As'ad down before him. When Bahram saw him, his heart leapt for joy and his breast swelled with gladness. Then he bestowed largesse on the sailors and bade them set sail in haste. So they sailed forthright, intending to make the Mountain of Fire and stayed not their course till the morning. This is how it fared with them; but as regards Queen Marjanah, she abode awhile, after As'ad went down from her, awaiting his return in vain for he came not; thereupon she rose and sought him, yet found no trace of him. Then she bade her women light flambeaux and look for him, whilst she went forth in person and, seeing the garden- door open, knew that he had gone thither. So she went out into the garden and finding his sandals lying by the fountain, searched the place in every part, but came upon no sign of him; and yet she gave not over the search till morning. Then she enquired for the ship and they told her, \"The vessel set sail in the first watch of the night\"; wherefor she knew that they had taken As'ad with them, and this was grievous to her and she was sore an-angered. She bade equip ten great ships forthwith and, making ready for fight, embarked in one of the ten with her Mamelukes and slave-women and men-at-arms, all splendidly accoutred and weaponed for war. They spread the sails and she said to the captains, \"If you overtake the Magian's ship, ye shall have of me dresses of honour and largesse of money; but if you fail so to do, I will slay you to the last man.\" Whereat fear and great hope animated the crews and they sailed all that day and the night and the second day and the third day till, on the fourth they sighted the ship of Bahram, the Magian, and before evening fell the Queen's squadron had surrounded it on all sides, just as Bahram had taken As'ad forth of the chest and was beating and torturing him, whilst the Prince cried out for help and deliverance, but found neither helper nor deliverer: and the grievous bastinado sorely tormented him. Now while so occupied, Bahram chanced to look up and, seeing himself encompassed by the Queen's ships, as the white of the eye encompasseth the black, he gave himself up for lost and groaned and said, \"Woe to thee, O As'ad! This is all out of thy head.\" Then taking him by the hand he bade his men throw him overboard and cried, \"By Allah I will slay thee before I die myself!\" So they carried him along by the hands and feet and cast him into the sea and he sank; but Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) willed that his life be saved and that his doom be deferred; so He caused him to sink and rise again and he struck out with his hands and feet, till the Almighty gave him relief, and sent him deliverance; and the waves bore him far from the Magian's ship and threw him ashore. He landed, scarce crediting his escape, and once more on land he doffed his clothes and wrung them and spread them out to dry; whilst he sat naked and weeping over his condition, and bewailing his calamities and mortal dangers, and captivity and stranger hood. And presently he repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"Allah, my patience fails: I have no ward; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My breast is straitened and clean cut my cord;\nTo whom shall wretched slave of case complain *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Save to his Lord? O thou of lords the Lord!\"\n\nThen, having ended his verse, he rose and donned his clothes but he knew not whither to go or whence to come; so he fed on the herbs of the earth and the fruits of the trees and he drank of the streams, and fared on night and day till he came in sight of a city; whereupon he rejoiced and hastened his pace; but when he reached it,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it Was the Two Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he reached the city the shades of evening closed around him and the gates were shut. Now by the decrees of Pate and man's lot this was the very city wherein he had been a prisoner and to whose King his brother Amjad was Minister. When As'ad saw the gate was locked, he turned back and made for the burial-ground, where finding a tomb without a door, he entered therein and lay down and fell asleep, with his face covered by his long sleeve.[FN#396] Meanwhile, Queen Marjanah, coming up with Bahram's ship, questioned him of As'ad. Now the Magian, when Queen Marjanah overtook him with her ships, baffled her by his artifice and gramarye; swearing to her that he was not with him and that he knew nothing of him. She searched the ship, but found no trace of her friend, so she took Bahram and, carrying him back to her castle, would have put him to death, but he ransomed himself from her with all his good and his ship; and she released him and his men. They went forth from her hardly believing in their deliverance, and fared on ten days' journey till they came to their own city and found the gate shut, it being eventide. So they made for the burial-ground, thinking to lie the night there and, going round about the tombs, as Fate and Fortune would have it, saw the building wherein As'ad lay wide open; whereat Bahram marvelled and said, \"I must look into this sepulchre.\" Then he entered and found As'ad lying in a corner fast asleep, with his head covered by his sleeve; so he raised his head, and looking in his face, knew him for the man on whose account he had lost his good and his ship, and cried, \"What! art thou yet alive?\" Then he bound him and gagged him without further parley, and carried him to his house, where he clapped heavy shackles on his feet and lowered him into the underground dungeon aforesaid prepared for the tormenting of Moslems, and he bade his daughter by name Bost\u00e1n,[FN#397] torture him night and day, till the next year, when they would again visit the Mountain of Fire and there offer him up as a sacrifice. Then he beat him grievously and locking the dungeon door upon him, gave the keys to his daughter. By and by, Bostan opened the door and went down to beat him, but finding him a comely youth and a sweet-faced with arched brows and eyes black with nature's Kohl,[FN#398] she fell in love with him and asked him, \"What is thy name?\" \"My name is As'ad,\" answered he; whereat she cried, \"Mayst thou indeed be happy as thy name,[FN#399] and happy be thy days! Thou deservest not torture and blows, and I see thou hast been injuriously entreated.\" And she comforted him with kind words and loosed his bonds. Then she questioned him of the religion of Al-Islam and he told her that it was the true and right Faith and that our lord Mohammed had approved himself by surpassing miracles[FN#400] and signs manifest, and that fire-worship is harmful and not profitable; and he went on to expound to her the tenets of Al-Islam till she was persuaded and the love of the True Faith entered her heart. Then, as Almighty Allah had mixed up with her being a fond affection for As'ad, she pronounced the Two Testimonies[FN#401] of the Faith and became of the people of felicity. After this, she brought him meat and drink and talked with him and they prayed together: moreover, she made him chicken stews and fed him therewith, till he regained strength and his sickness left him and he was restored to his former health. Such things befel him with the daughter of Bahram, the Magian; and so it happened that one day she left him and stood at the house-door when behold, she heard the crier crying aloud and saying, \"Whoso hath with him a handsome young man, whose favour is thus and thus, and bringeth him forth, shall have all he seeketh of money; but if any have him and deny it, he shall be hanged over his own door and his property shall be plundered and his blood go for naught.\" Now As'ad had acquainted Bostan bint Bahram with his whole history: so, when she heard the crier, she knew that it was he who was sought for and, going down to him, told him the news. Then he fared forth and made for the mansion of the Wazir, whom, when As'ad saw, exclaimed, \"By Allah, this Minister is my brother Amjad!\" Then he went up (and the damsel walking behind him) to the Palace, where he again saw his brother, and threw himself upon him; whereupon Amjad also knew him and fell upon his neck and they embraced each other, whilst the Wazir's Mamelukes dismounted and stood round them. They lay awhile insensible and, when they came to themselves, Amjad took his brother and carried him to the Sultan, to whom he related the whole story, and the Sultan charged him to plunder Bahram's house.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Sultan ordered Amjad to plunder Bahram's house and to hang its owner. So Amjad despatched thither for that purpose a company of men, who sacked the house and took Bahram and brought his daughter to the Wazir by whom she was received with all honour, for As'ad had told his brother the torments he had suffered and the kindness she had done him. Thereupon Amjad related in his turn to As'ad all that had passed between himself and the damsel; and how he had escaped hanging and had become Wazir; and they made moan, each to other, of the anguish they had suffered for separation. Then the Sultan summoned Bahram and bade strike off his head; but he said, \"O most mighty King, art thou indeed resolved to put me to death?\" Replied the King, \"Yes, except thou save thyself by becoming a Moslem.\" Quoth Bahram, \"O King, bear with me a little while!\" Then he bowed his head groundwards and presently raising it again, made pro fession of The Faith and islamised at the hands of the Sultan. They all rejoiced at his conversion and Amjad and As'ad told him all that had befallen them, whereat he wondered and said, \"O my lords, make ready for the journey and I will depart with you and carry you back to your father's court in a ship.\" At this they rejoiced and wept with sore weeping but he said, \"O my lords, weep not for your departure, for it shall reunite you with those you love, even as were Ni'amah and Naomi.\" \"And what befel Ni'amah and Naomi?\" asked they. \"They tell,\" replied Bahram, \"(but Allah alone is All knowing) the following tale of\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n\n\n[FN#221] The \"topothesia\" is worthy of Shakespeare's day. \"Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n\" is evidently a corruption of \"Kh\u00e1lidat\u00e1ni\" (for Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1t), the Eternal, as Ibn Wardi calls the Fortunate Islands, or Canaries, which owe both their modern names to the classics of Europe. Their present history dates from A.D. 1385, unless we accept the Dieppe-Rouen legend of Labat which would place the discovery in A.D. 1326. I for one thoroughly believe in the priority on the West African Coast, of the gallant descendants of the Northmen.\n\n[FN#222] Four wives are allowed by Moslem law and for this reason. If you marry one wife she holds herself your equal, answers you and \"gives herself airs\"; two are always quarrelling and making a hell of the house; three are \"no company\" and two of them always combine against the nicest to make her hours bitter. Four are company, they can quarrel and \"make it up\" amongst themselves, and the husband enjoys comparative peace. But the Moslem is bound by his law to deal equally with the four, each must have her dresses her establishment and her night, like her sister wives. The number is taken from the Jews (Arbah Turim Ev. Hazaer, i.) \"the wise men have given good advice that a man should not marry more than four wives.\" Europeans, knowing that Moslem women are cloistered and appear veiled in public, begin with believing them to be mere articles of luxury, and only after long residence they find out that nowhere has the sex so much real liberty and power as in the Moslem East. They can possess property and will it away without the husband's leave: they can absent themselves from the house for a month without his having a right to complain; and they assist in all his counsels for the best of reasons: a man can rely only on his wives and children, being surrounded by rivals who hope to rise by his ruin. As regards political matters the Circassian women of Constantinople really rule the Sultanate and there soignez la femme! is the first lesson of getting on in the official world.\n\n[FN#223] This two-bow prayer is common on the bride-night; and at all times when issue is desired.\n\n[FN#224] The older Camaralzaman=\"Moon of the age.\" Kamar is the moon between her third and twenty-sixth day: Hil\u00e1l during the rest of the month: Badr (plur. Bud\u00far whence the name of the Princess) is the full moon.\n\n[FN#225] Arab \"Ra'\u00e1y\u00e1\" plur. of 'Ra'\u00edyat\" our Anglo-Indian Ryot, lit. a liege, a subject; secondarily a peasant, a Fellah.\n\n[FN#226] Another audacious parody of the Moslem \"testification\" to the one God, and to Mohammed the Apostle.\n\n[FN#227] Showing how long ago forts were armed with metal plates which we have applied to war-ships only of late years.\n\n[FN#228] The comparison is abominably true\u2014in the East.\n\n[FN#229] Two fallen angels who taught men the art of magic. They are mentioned in the Koran (chaps. ii.), and the commentators have extensively embroidered the simple text. Popularly they are supposed to be hanging by their feet in a well in the territory of Babel, hence the frequent allusions to \"Babylonian sorcery\" in Moslem writings; and those who would study the black art at head-quarters are supposed to go there. They are counterparts of the Egyptian Jamnes and Mambres, the Jannes and Jambres of St. Paul (2 Tim. iii. 8).\n\n[FN#230] An idol or idols of the Arabs (Allat and Ozza) before Mohammed (Koran chaps. ii. 256). Etymologically the word means \"error\" and the termination is rather Hebraic than Arabic.\n\n[FN#231] Arab. \"Khayt hamay\u00e1n\" (wandering threads of vanity), or\nMukh\u00e1t al-Shaytan (Satan's snivel),=our \"gossamer\"=God's summer\n(Mutter Gottes Sommer) or God's cymar (?).\n\n[FN#232] These lines occur in Night xvii.; so I borrow from\nTorrens (p. 163) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#233] A posture of peculiar submission; contrasting strongly with the attitude afterwards assumed by Prince Charming.\n\n[FN#234] A mere term of vulgar abuse not reflecting on either parent: I have heard a mother call her own son, \"Child of adultery.\"\n\n[FN#235] Arab. \"Ghaz\u00e1,\" the Artemisia (Euphorbia ?) before noticed. If the word be a misprint for Ghad\u00e1 it means a kind of Euphorbia which, with the Ar\u00e1k (wild caper-tree) and the Daum palm (Crucifera thebiaca), is one of the three normal growths of the Arabian desert (Pilgrimage iii. 22).\n\n[FN#236] Arab. \"Ban\u00e1t al-Na'ash,\" usually translated daughters of the bier, the three stars which represent the horses in either Bear, \"Charles' Wain,\" or Ursa Minor, the waggon being supposed to be a bier. \"Ban\u00e1t\" may be also sons, plur. of Ibn, as the word points to irrational objects. So Job (ix. 9 and xxxviii. 32) refers to U. Major as \"Ash\" or \"Aysh\" in the words, \"Canst thou guide the bier with its sons?\" (erroneously rendered \"Arcturus with his sons\") In the text the lines are enigmatical, but apparently refer to a death parting.\n\n[FN#237] The Chapters are: 2, 3, 36, 55, 67 and the two last (\"Daybreak\" cxiii. and \"Men\" cxiv.), which are called Al-Mu'izzat\u00e1ni (vulgar Al-Mu'izzatayn), the \"Two Refuge-takings or Preventives,\" because they obviate enchantment. I have translated the two latter as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Say:\u2014Refuge I take with the Lord of the Day-break *\nfrom mischief of what He did make *\nfrom mischief of moon eclipse-showing *\nand from mischief of witches on cord-knots blowing *\nand from mischief of envier when envying.\"\n\n\"Say:\u2014Refuge I take with the Lord of men *\nthe sovran of men *\nthe God of men *\nfrom the Tempter, the Demon *\nwho tempteth in whisper the breasts of men *\nand from Jinnis and (evil) men.\"\n\n[FN#238] The recitations were N\u00e1filah, or superogatory, two short chapters only being required and the taking refuge was because he slept in a ruin, a noted place in the East for Ghuls as in the West for ghosts.\n\n[FN#239] Lane (ii. 222) first read \"M\u00faroozee\" and referred it to the Mur\u00faz tribe near Herat he afterwards (iii. 748) corrected it to \"Marwazee,\" of the fabric of Marw (Margiana) the place now famed for \"Mervousness.\" As a man of Rayy (Rhages) becomes R\u00e1z\u00ed (e.g. Ibn F\u00e1ris al-Raz\u00ed), so a man of Marw is Mar\u00e1zi, not Mur\u00fazi nor M\u00e1rwazi. The \"Mikna' \" was a veil forming a kind of \"respirator,\" defending from flies by day and from mosquitos, dews and draughts by night. Easterns are too sensible to sleep with bodies kept warm by bedding, and heads bared to catch every blast. Our grandfathers and grandmothers did well to wear bonnets-de-nuit, however ridiculous they may have looked.\n\n[FN#240] Iblis, meaning the Despairer, is called in the Koran (chaps. xviii. 48) \"One of the genii (Jinnis) who departed from the command of his Lord.\" Mr. Rodwell (in loco) notes that the Satans and Jinnis represent in the Koran (ii. 32, etc.) the evil-principle and finds an admixture of the Semitic Satans and demons with the \"Genii from the Persian (Babylonian ?) and Indian (Egyptian ?) mythologies.\"\n\n[FN#241] Of course she could not see his eyes when they were shut; nor is this mere Eastern inconsequence. The writer means, \"had she seen them, they would have showed,\" etc.\n\n[FN#242] The eyes are supposed to grow darker under the influence of wine and sexual passion.\n\n[FN#243] To keep off the evil eye.\n[FN#244] Like Dahnash this is a fanciful P. N., fit only for a Jinni. As a rule the appellatives of Moslem \"genii\" end in\u00fas (oos), as Tarn\u00fas, Huliy\u00e1nus, the Jewish in\u2014nas, as Jattunas; those of the Tars\u00e1 (the \"funkers\" i.e. Christians) in\u2014d\u00fas, as Sid\u00fas, and the Hindus in\u2014t\u00fas, as Nakt\u00fas (who entered the service of the Prophet Shays, or Seth, and was converted to the Faith). The King of the Genii is Malik Katsh\u00e1n who inhabits Mount Kaf; and to the west of him lives his son-in-law, Abd al-Rahman with 33,000 domestics: these names were given by the Apostle Mohammed. \"Baktan\u00fas\" is lord of three Moslem troops of the wandering Jinns, which number a total of twelve bands and extend from Sind to Europe. The Jinns, Divs, Peris (\"fairies\") and other pre-Adamitic creatures were governed by seventy-two Sultans all known as Sulayman and the last I have said was J\u00e1n bin J\u00e1n. The angel H\u00e1ris was sent from Heaven to chastise him, but in the pride of victory he also revolted with his followers the Jinns whilst the Peris held aloof. When he refused to bow down before Adam he and his chiefs were eternally imprisoned but the other Jinns are allowed to range over earth as a security for man's obedience. The text gives the three orders. flyers. walkers and divers.\n\n[FN#245] i.e. distracted (with love); the Lakab, or poetical name, of apparently a Spanish poet.\n\n[FN#246] Nothing is more \"anti-pathetic\" to Easterns than lean hips and flat hinder-cheeks in women and they are right in insisting upon the characteristic difference of the male and female figure. Our modern sculptors and painters, whose study of the nude is usually most perfunctory, have often scandalised me by the lank and greyhound-like fining off of the frame, which thus becomes rather simian than human.\n\n[FN#247] The small fine foot is a favourite with Easterns as well as Westerns. Ovid (A.A.) is not ashamed \"ad teneros Oscula (not basia or suavia) ferre pedes.\" Ariosto ends the august person in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Il breve, asciutto, e ritondetto piece,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (The short-sized, clean-cut, roundly-moulded foot).\n\nAnd all the world over it is a sign of \"blood,\" i.e. the fine nervous temperament.\n\n[FN#248] i.e. \"full moons\": the French have corrupted it to\n\"Badoure\"; we to \"Badoura.\" winch is worse.\n\n[FN#249] As has been said a single drop of urine renders the clothes ceremoniously impure, hence a Stone or a handful of earth must be used after the manner of the torche-cul. Scrupulous Moslems, when squatting to make water, will prod the ground before them with the point o f stick or umbrella, so as to loosen it and prevent the spraying of the urine.\n\n[FN#250] It is not generally known to Christians that Satan has a wife called Aww\u00e1 (\"Haww\u00e1\" being the Moslem Eve) and, as Adam had three sons, the Tempter has nine, viz., Zu 'l-baysun who rules in bazars. Wassin who prevails in times of trouble. Awan who counsels kings; Haffan patron of wine-bibbers; Marrah of musicians and dancers; Masbut of news-spreaders (and newspapers ?); Dulh\u00e1n who frequents places of worship and interferes with devotion. Dasim, lord of mansions and dinner tables, who prevents the Faithful saying \"Bismillah\" and \"Inshallah,\" as commanded in the Koran (xviii. 23), and Lak\u00eds, lord of Fire worshippers (Herklots, chap. xxix. sect. 4).\n\n[FN#251] Strong perfumes, such as musk (which we Europeans dislike and suspect), are always insisted upon in Eastern poetry, and Mohammed's predilection for them is well known. Moreover the young and the beautiful are held (justly enough) to exhale a natural fragrance which is compared with that of the blessed in Paradise. Hence in the Mu'allakah of Imr al-Keys:\u2014\n\nBreathes the scent of musk when they rise to rove, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As the Zephyr's breath with the flavour o'clove.\n\nIt is made evident by dogs and other fine-nosed animals that every human being has his, or her, peculiar scent which varies according to age and health. Hence animals often detect the approach of death.\n\n[FN#252] Arab. \"Kahl\u00e1.\" This has been explained. Mohammed is said to have been born with \"Kohl'd eyes.\"\n\n[FN#253] Haw\u00e1 al-'uzr\u00ed, before noticed (Night cxiv.).\n\n[FN#254] These lines, with the N\u00e1zir (eye or steward), the H\u00e1jib (Groom of the Chambers or Chamberlain) and Joseph, are also repeated from Night cxiv. For the Nazir see Al-Hariri (Nos. xiii. and xxii.)\n\n[FN#255] The usual allusion to the H\u00far (Houris) from \"Hangar,\" the white and black of the eye shining in contrast. The Persian Magi also placed in their Heaven (Bihisht or Minu) \"Huran,\" or black-eyed nymphs, under the charge of the angel Zamiy\u00e1d.\n\n[FN#256] In the first hemistich, \"bi-shitt 'it w\u00e1dy\" (by the wady-bank): in the second, \"wa shatta 'l w\u00e1dy\" (\"and my slayer\"\u2014 i.e. w\u00e1dy act. part. of wady, killing\u2014\"hath paced away\").\n\n[FN#257] The double entendre is from the proper names Bud\u00far and Su'\u00e1d (Beatrice) also meaning \"auspicious (or blessed) full moons.\"\n\n[FN#258] Arab. \"H\u00e1zir\" (also Ahl al-hazer, townsmen) and B\u00e1di, a Badawi, also called \"Ahl al-Wabar,\" people of the camel's hair (tent) and A'ar\u00e1b (Nomadic) as opposed to Arab (Arab settled or not). They still boast with Ibn Abbas, cousin of Mohammed, that they have kerchiefs (not turbands) for crowns, tents for houses, loops for walls, swords for scarves and poems for registers or written laws.\n\n[FN#259] This is a peculiarity of the Jinn tribe when wearing hideous forms. It is also found in the Hindu Rakshasa.\n\n[FN#260] Which, by the by, are small and beautifully shaped. The animal is very handy with them, as I learnt by experience when trying to \"Rareyfy\" one at Bayrut.\n\n[FN#261] She being daughter of Al-Dimiry\u00e1t, King of the Jinns.\nMr. W. F. Kirby has made him the subject of a pretty poem.\n\n[FN#262] These lines have occurred in Night xxii. I give\nTorrens's version (p. 223) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#263] Arab. \"K\u00e1mat Alfiyyah,\" like an Alif, the first of the Arabic alphabet, the Heb. Aleph. The Arabs, I have said, took the flag or water leaf form and departed very far from the Egyptian original (we know from Plutarch that the hieroglyphic abecedarium began with \"a\"), which was chosen by other imitators, namely the bull's head, and which in the cursive form, especially the Phnician, became a yoke. In numerals \"Alif\" denotes one or one thousand. It inherits the traditional honours of Alpha (as opposed to Omega) and in books, letters and writings generally it is placed as a monogram over the \"Bismillah,\" an additional testimony to the Unity. (See vol. i. p. 1.) In medi\u00e6val Christianity this place of honour was occupied by the cross: none save the wildest countries have preserved it, but our vocabulary still retains Criss' (Christ-)cross Row, for horn-book, on account of the old alphabet and nine digits disposed in the form of a Latin cross. Hence Tickell (\"The Horn-book\"):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014\u2014Mortals ne'er shall know\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        More than contained of old the Chris'-cross Row.\n\n[FN#264] The young man must have been a demon of chastity.\n\n[FN#265] Arab. \"Kir\u00e1t\" from i.e. bean, the seed of the Abrus precatorius, in weight=two to three (English) grains; and in length=one finger-breadth here; 24 being the total. The Moslem system is evidently borrowed from the Roman \"as\" and \"uncia.\"\n\n[FN#266] Names of women.\n\n[FN#267] Arab. \"Amsa\" (lit. he passed the evening) like \"asbaha\" (he rose in the morning) \"Azh\u00e1\" (he spent the forenoon) and \"bata\" (he spent the night), are idiomatically used for \"to be in any state, to continue\" without specification of time or season.\n\n[FN#268] Lit. \"my liver ;\" which viscus, and not the heart, is held the seat of passion, a fancy dating from the oldest days. Theocritus says of Hercules, \"In his liver Love had fixed a wound\" (Idyl. xiii.). In the Anthologia \"Cease, Love, to wound my liver and my heart\" (lib. vii.). So Horace (Odes, i. 2); his Latin Jecur and the Persian \"Jigar\" being evident congeners. The idea was long prevalent and we find in Shakespeare:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Alas, then Love may be called appetite,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         No motion of the liver but the palate.\n\n[FN#269] A marvellous touch of nature, love ousting affection; the same trait will appear in the lover and both illustrate the deep Italian saying, \"Amor discende, non ascende.\" The further it goes down the stronger it becomes as of grand-parent for grand-child and vice versa.\n\n[FN#270] This tenet of the universal East is at once fact and unfact. As a generalism asserting that women's passion is ten times greater than man's (Pilgrimage, ii. 282), it is unfact. The world shows that while women have more philoprogenitiveness, men have more amativeness; otherwise the latter would not propose and would nurse the doll and baby. Pact, however, in low-lying lands, like Persian Mazanderan versus the Plateau; Indian Malabar compared with Mar\u00e1tha-land; California as opposed to Utah and especially Egypt contrasted with Arabia. In these hot damp climates the venereal requirements and reproductive powers of the female greatly exceed those of the male; and hence the dissoluteness of morals would be phenomenal, were it not obviated by seclusion, the sabre and the revolver. In cold-dry or hot-dry mountainous lands the reverse is the case; hence polygamy there prevails whilst the low countries require polyandry in either form, legal or illegal (i,e. prostitution) I have discussed this curious point of \"geographical morality\" (for all morality is, like conscience, both geographical and chronological), a subject so interesting to the lawgiver, the student of ethics and the anthropologist, in \"The City of the Saints \" But strange and unpleasant truths progress slowly, especially in England.\n\n[FN#271] This morning evacuation is considered, in the East, a sine qu\u00e2 non of health; and old Anglo-Indians are unanimous in their opinion of the \"bard fajar\" (as they mispronounce the dawn-clearance). The natives of India, Hind\u00fas (pagans) and Hind\u00eds (Moslems), unlike Europeans, accustom themselves to evacuate twice a day, evening as well as morning. This may, perhaps, partly account for their mildness and effeminacy; for:\u2014\n\nC'est la constipation qui rend l'homme rigoureux.\n\nThe English, since the first invasion of cholera, in October, 1831, are a different race from their costive grandparents who could not dine without a \"dinner-pill.\" Curious to say the clyster is almost unknown to the people of Hindostan although the barbarous West Africans use it daily to \"wash 'um belly,\" as the Bonney-men say. And, as Sonnini notes to propose the process in Egypt under the Beys might have cost a Frankish medico his life.\n\n[FN#272] The Egyptian author cannot refrain from this characteristic polissonnerie; and reading it out is always followed by a roar of laughter. Even serious writers like Al- Hariri do not, as I have noted, despise the indecency.\n\n[FN#273] \"'Long beard and little wits,\" is a saying throughout the East where the Kausaj (= man with thin, short beard) is looked upon as cunning and tricksy. There is a venerable Joe Miller about a schoolmaster who, wishing to singe his long beard short, burnt it off and his face to boot:\u2014which reminded him of the saying. A thick beard is defined as one which wholly conceals the skin; and in ceremonial ablution it must be combed out with the fingers till the water reach the roots. The Sunnat, or practice of the Prophet, was to wear the beard not longer than one hand and two fingers' breadth. In Persian \"K\u00faseh\" (thin beard) is an insulting term opposed to \"Khush-r\u00edsh,\" a well-bearded man. The Iranian growth is perhaps the finest in the world, often extending to the waist; but it gives infinite trouble, requiring, for instance, a bag when travelling. The Arab beard is often composed of two tufts on the chin-sides and straggling hairs upon the cheeks; and this is a severe mortification, especially to Shaykhs and elders, who not only look upon the beard as one of man's characteristics, but attach a religious importance to the appendage. Hence the enormity of Kamar al-Zaman's behaviour. The Persian festival of the vernal equinox was called Kusehnish\u00edn (Thin-beard sitting). An old man with one eye paraded the streets on an ass with a crow in one hand and a scourge and fan in the other, cooling himself, flogging the bystanders and crying heat! heat! (garm\u00e1! garm\u00e1!). For other particulars see Richardson (Dissertation, p. Iii.). This is the Italian Giorno delle Vecchie, Thursday in Mid Lent, March 12 (1885), celebrating the death of Winter and the birth of Spring.\n\n[FN#274] I quote Torrens (p. 400) as these lines have occurred in\nNight xxxviii.\n\n[FN#275] Moslems have only two names for week days, Friday,\nAl-Jum'ah or meeting-day, and Al-Sabt, Sabbath day, that is\nSaturday. The others are known by numbers after Quaker fashion\nwith us, the usage of Portugal and Scandinavia.\n\n[FN#276] Our last night.\n\n[FN#277] Arab. \"Tayf\"=phantom, the nearest approach to our \"ghost,\" that queer remnant of Fetishism imbedded in Christianity; the phantasma, the shade (not the soul) of tile dead. Hence the accurate Niebuhr declares, \"apparitions (i.e., of the departed) are unknown in Arabia.\" Haunted houses are there tenanted by Ghuls, Jinns and a host of supernatural creatures; but not by ghosts proper; and a man may live years in Arabia before he ever hears of the \"Tayf.\" With the Hindus it is otherwise (Pilgrimage iii. 144). Yet the ghost, the embodied fear of the dead and of death is common, in a greater or less degree, to all peoples; and, as modern Spiritualism proves, that ghost is not yet laid.\n\n[FN#278] Mr. Payne (iii. 133) omits the lines which are \u00e0propos de rein and read much like \"nonsense verses.\" I retain them simply because they are in the text.\n\n[FN#279] The first two couplets are the quatrain (or octave) in\nNight xxxv.\n\n[FN#280] Arab. \"Ar'ar,\" the Heb. \"Aroer,\" which Luther and the A.\nV. translate \"heath.\" The modern Aramaic name is \"Lizz\u00e1b\"\n(Unexplored Syria. i. 68).\n\n[FN#281] In the old version and the Bresl. Edit. (iii. 220) the\nPrincess beats the \"Kahram\u00e1nah,\" but does not kill her.\n\n[FN#282] 'This is still the popular Eastern treatment of the insane.\n\n[FN#283] Pers. \"Marz-b\u00e1n\" = Warden of the Marches, Margrave. The foster-brother in the East is held dear as, and often dearer than, kith and kin.\n\n[FN#284] The moderns believe most in the dawn-dream.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014Quirinus\n\nPost mediam noctem visus, quum somnia vera.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          (Horace Sat. i. 10, 33,)\n\n[FN#285] The Bresl.

Both are used by Nizami and Al-Hariri, the most \"elegant\" of Arab writers.\n\n[FN#287] These form a Kas\u00eddah, Ode or Elegy= rhymed couplets numbering more than thirteen: If shorter it is called a \"Ghazal.\" I have not thought it necessary to preserve the monorhyme.\n\n[FN#288] Sulaym\u00e1 dim. of Salm\u00e1= any beautiful woman Rab\u00e1b = the viol mostly single stringed: Tan'oum=she who is soft and gentle.

The distich is highly fanciful and the conceits would hardly occur to a\n\n[FN#290] Arab. \"Andam,\" a term applied to Brazil-wood (also called \"Bakkam\") and to \"dragon's blood,\" but not, I think, to tragacanth, the \"goat's thorn,\" which does not dye. Andam is often mentioned in The Nights.\n\n[FN#291] The superior merit of the first (explorer, etc.) is a lieu commun with Arabs. So Al-Hariri in Preface quotes his predecessor:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Justly of praise the price I pay;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          The praise is his who leads the way.\n\n[FN#292] There were two Lukmans, of whom more in a future page.\n\n[FN#293] This symbolic action is repeatedly mentioned in The\nNights.\n\n[FN#294] Arab. \"Shakhs\"=a person, primarily a dark spot. So \"Saw\u00e1d\"=blackness, in Al-Hariri means a group of people who darken the ground by their shade.\n\n[FN#295] The first bath after sickness, I have said, is called\n\"Ghusl al-Sihhah,\"\u2014the Washing of Health.\n\n[FN#296] The words \"malady\" and \"disease\" are mostly avoided during these dialogues as ill-omened words which may bring on a relapse.\n\n[FN#297] Solomon's carpet of green silk which carried him and all his host through the air is a Talmudic legend generally accepted in Al-Islam though not countenanced by the Koran. chaps xxvii. When the \"gnat's wing\" is mentioned, the reference is to Nimrod who, for boasting that he was lord of all, was tortured during four hundred years by a gnat sent by Allah up his ear or nostril.\n\n[FN#298] The absolute want of morality and filial affection in the chaste young man is supposed to be caused by the violence of his passion, and he would be pardoned because he \"loved much.\"\n\n[FN#299] I have noticed the geomantic process in my \"History of Sindh\" (chaps. vii.). It is called \"Zarb al-Ram!\" (strike the sand, the French say \"frapper le sable\") because the rudest form is to make on the ground dots at haphazard, usually in four lines one above the other: these are counted and, if even-numbered, two are taken ( ** ); if odd one ( * ); and thus the four lines will form a scheme say * * * * * * This is repeated three times, producing the same number of figures; and then the combination is sought in an explanatory table or, if the practitioner be expert, he pronounces off-hand. The Nights speak of a \"Takht Raml\" or a board, like a schoolboy's slate, upon which the dots are inked instead of points in sand. The moderns use a \"Kura'h,\" or oblong die, upon whose sides the dots, odd and even, are marked; and these dice are hand-thrown to form the e figure. By way of complication Geomancy is mixed up with astrology and then it becomes a most complicated kind of ariolation and an endless study. \"Napoleon's Book of Fate,\" a chap-book which appeared some years ago, was Geomancy in its simplest and most ignorant shape. For the rude African form see my Mission to Dahome, i. 332, and for that of Darfour, pp. 360-69 of Shaykh Mohammed's Voyage before quoted.\n\n[FN#300] Translators understand this of writing marriage contracts; I take it in a more general sense.\n\n[FN#301] These lines are repeated from Night Ixxv.: with Mr. Payne's permission I give his rendering (iii. 153) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#302] The comparison is characteristically Arab.\n\n[FN#303] Not her \"face\": the head, and especially the back of the head, must always be kept covered, even before the father.\n\n[FN#304] Arab. \"Siw\u00e1k\"=a tooth-stick; \"Siw\u00e1-ka\"=lit. other than thou.\n\n[FN#305] Arab. \"Ar\u00e1k\"=tooth stick of the wild caper-tree; \"Ar\u00e1-ka\" lit.=I see thee. The capparis spinosa is a common desert-growth and the sticks about a span long (usually called Misw\u00e1k), are sold in quantities at Meccah after being dipped in Zemzem water. In India many other woods are used, date-tree, Salvadora, Achyrantes, phyllanthus, etc. Amongst Arabs peculiar efficacy accompanies the tooth-stick of olive, \"the tree springing from Mount Sinai\" (Koran xxiii. 20); and Mohammed would use no other, because it prevents decay and scents the mouth. Hence Koran, chaps. xcv. 1. The \"Misw\u00e1k\" is held with the unused end between the ring-finger and minimus, the two others grasp the middle and the thumb is pressed against the back close to the lips. These articles have long been sold at the Medical Hall near the \"Egyptian Hall,\" Piccadilly. They are better than our unclean tooth-brushes because each tooth gets its own especial rubbing' not a general sweep; at the same time the operation is longer and more troublesome. In parts of Africa as well as Asia many men walk about with the tooth-stick hanging by a string from the neck.\n\n[FN#306] The \"Mehari,\" of which the Algerine-French speak, are the dromedaries bred by the Mahrah tribe of Al-Yaman, the descendants of Mahrat ibn Haydan. They are covered by small wild camels (?) called Al-H\u00fash, found between Oman and Al-Shihr: others explain the word to mean \"stallions of the Jinns \" and term those savage and supernatural animals, \"Naj\u00e1ib al-Mahriyah\"nobles of the Mahrah.\n\n[FN#307] Arab. \"Khaznah\"=a thousand purses; now about \u00a35000. It denotes a large sum of money, like the \"Badrah,\" a purse containing 10,000 dirhams of silver (Al-Hariri), or 80,000 (Burckhardt Prov. 380); whereas the \"Nis\u00e1b\" is a moderate sum of money, gen. 20 gold dinars=200 silver dirhams.\n\n[FN#308] As The Nights show, Arabs admire slender forms; but the hips and hinder cheeks must be highly developed and the stomach fleshy rather than lean. The reasons are obvious. The Persians who exaggerate everything say e.g. (Husayn V\u00e1iz in the Anv\u00e1r-i-Suhayli):\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          How paint her hips and waist ? Who saw\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          A mountain (Koh) dangling to a straw (k\u00e1h)?\n\nIn Antar his beloved Abla is a tamarisk (T. Orientalis). Others compare with the palm-tree (Solomon), the Cypress (Persian, esp. Hafiz and Firdausi) and the Ar\u00e1k or wild Capparis (Arab.).\n\n[FN#309] Ubi aves ibi angel). All African travellers know that a few birds flying about the bush, and a few palm-trees waving in the wind, denote the neighbourhood of a village or a camp (where angels are scarce). The reason is not any friendship for man but because food, animal and vegetable, is more plentiful Hence Albatrosses, Mother Carey's (Mater Cara, the Virgin) chickens, and Cape pigeons follow ships.\n\n[FN#310] The stanza is called Al-Mukhammas=cinquains; the quatrains and the \"bob,\" or \"burden\" always preserve the same consonance. It ends with a Koranic lieu commun of Moslem morality.\n\n[FN#311] Moslem port towns usually have (or had) only two gates. Such was the case with Bayrut, Tyre, Sidon and a host of others; the faubourg-growth of modern days has made these obsolete. The portals much resemble the entrances of old Norman castles\u2014Arques for instance. (Pilgrimage i. 185.)\n\n[FN#312] Arab. \"Lis\u00e1m\"; before explained.\n\n[FN#313] i.e. Life of Souls (persons, etc.).\n\n[FN#314] Arab. \"Ins\u00e1nu-h\u00e1\"=her (i.e. their) man: i.e. the babes of the eyes: the Assyrian Ishon, dim. of Ish=Man; which the Hebrews call \"B\u00e1bat\" or \"Bit\" (the daughter) the Arabs \"Bubu (or Hadakat) al-Aye\"; the Persians \"Mardumak-i-chashm\" (mannikin of the eye); the Greeks and the Latins pupa, pupula, pupilla. I have noted this in the Lyricks of Camoens (p. 449).\n\n[FN#315] Ma'an bin Z\u00e1'idah, a soldier and statesman of the eighth century.\n\n[FN#316] The mildness of the Caliph Mu'\u00e1wiyah, the founder of the Ommiades, proverbial among the Arabs, much resembles the \"meekness\" of Moses the Law-giver, which commentators seem to think has been foisted into Numbers xii. 3.\n\n[FN#317] Showing that there had been no consummation of the marriage which would have demanded \"Ghusl,\" or total ablution, at home or in the Hammam.\n\n[FN#318] I have noticed this notable desert-growth.\n\n[FN#319] 'The \"situation\" is admirable, solution appearing so difficult and catastrophe imminent.\n\n[FN#320] This quatrain occurs in Night ix.: I have borrowed from\nTorrens (p. 79) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#321] The belief that young pigeon's blood resembles the virginal discharge is universal; but the blood most resembling man's is that of the pig which in other points is so very human. In our day Arabs and Hindus rarely submit to inspection the nuptial sheet as practiced by the Israelites and Persians. The bride takes to bed a white kerchief with which she staunches the blood and next morning the stains are displayed in the Harem. In Darfour this is done by the bridegroom. \"Prima Venus debet esse cruenta,\" say the Easterns with much truth, and they have no faith in our complaisant creed which allows the hymen-membrane to disappear by any but one accident.\n\n[FN#322] Not meaning the two central divisions commanded by the\nKing and his Wazir.\n\n[FN#323] Ironic\u00e8.\n\n[FN#324] Arab. \"Rasy\"=praising in a funeral sermon.\n\n[FN#325] Arab. \"Man\u00e1y\u00e1,\" plur. of \"Maniyat\" = death. Mr. R. S. Poole (the Academy, April 26, 1879) reproaches Mr. Payne for confounding \"Muniyat\" (desire) with \"Maniyat\" (death) but both are written the same except when vowel-points are used.\n\n[FN#326] Arab. \"Iddat,\" alluding to the months of celibacy which, according to Moslem law, must be passed by a divorced woman before she can re-marry.\n\n[FN#327] Arab. \"Tal\u00e1k bi'l-Sal\u00e1sah\"=a triple divorce which cannot be revoked; nor can the divorcer re-marry the same woman till after consummation with another husband. This subject will continually recur.\n\n[FN#328] An allusion to a custom of the pagan Arabs in the days of ignorant Heathenism The blood or brain, soul or personality of the murdered man formed a bird called Sady or H\u00e1mah (not the Hum\u00e1 or Hum\u00e1i, usually translated \"phnix\") which sprang from the head, where four of the five senses have their seat, and haunted his tomb, crying continually, \"Usk\u00fani!\"=Give me drink (of the slayer's blood) ! and which disappeared only when the vendetta was accomplished. Mohammed forbade the belief. Amongst the Southern Slavs the cuckoo is supposed to be the sister of a murdered man ever calling or vengeance.\n\n[FN#329] To obtain a blessing and show how he valued it.\n\n[FN#330] Well-known tribes of proto-historic Arabs who flourished before the time of Abraham: see Koran (chaps. xxvi. et passim). They will be repeatedly mentioned in The Nights and notes.\n\n[FN#331] Arab. \"Amt\u00e1r\"; plur. of \"Matr,\" a large vessel of leather or wood for water, etc.\n\n[FN#332] Arab. \"As\u00e1f\u00edr\u00ed,\" so called because they attract sparrows (as\u00e1f\u00edr) a bird very fond of the ripe oily fruit. In the Romance of \"Antar\" As\u00e1f\u00edr camels are beasts that fly like birds in fleetness. The reader must not confound the olives of the text with the hard unripe berries (\"little plums pickled in stale\") which appear at English tables, nor wonder that bread and olives are the beef-steak and potatoes of many Mediterranean peoples It is an excellent diet, the highly oleaginous fruit supplying the necessary carbon,\n\n[FN#333] Arab. \"Tamer al-Hindi\"=the \"Indian-date,\" whence our word \"Tamarind.\" A sherbet of the pods, being slightly laxative, is much drunk during the great heats; and the dried fruit, made into small round cakes, is sold in the bazars. The traveller is advised not to sleep under the tamarind's shade, which is infamous for causing ague and fever. In Sind I derided the \"native nonsense,\" passed the night under an \"Indian date-tree\" and awoke with a fine specimen of ague which lasted me a week.\n\n[FN#334] Moslems are not agreed upon the length of the Day of Doom when all created things, marshalled by the angels, await final judgment; the different periods named are 40 years, 70, 300 and 50,000. Yet the trial itself will last no longer than while one may milk an ewe, or than \"the space between two milkings of a she-camel.\" This is bringing down Heaven to Earth with a witness; but, after all, the Heaven of all faiths, including \"Spiritualism,\" the latest development, is only an earth more or less glorified even as the Deity is humanity more or less perfected.\n\n[FN#335] Arab. \"Al-Kamar\u00e1ni,\" lit. \"the two moons.\" Arab rhetoric prefers it to \"Shams\u00e1ni,\" or {`two suns,\" because lighter (akhaff), to pronounce. So, albeit Omar was less worthy than Abu-Bakr the two are called \"Al-Omar\u00e1ni,\" in vulgar parlance, Omarayn.\n\n[FN#336] Alluding to the angels who appeared to the Sodomites in the shape of beautiful youths (Koran xi.).\n\n[FN#337] Koran xxxiii. 38.\n\n[FN#338] \"Niktu-hu taklidan\" i.e. not the real thing (with a woman). It may also mean \"by his incitement of me.\" All this scene is written in the worst form of Persian-Egyptian blackguardism, and forms a curious anthropological study. The \"black joke\" of the true and modest wife is inimitable.\n\n[FN#339] Arab. \"Jam\u00edz\" (in Egypt \"Jammayz\") = the fruit of the true sycomore (F. Sycomorus) a magnificent tree which produces a small tasteless fig, eaten by the poorer classes in Egypt and by monkeys. The \"T\u00edn\" or real fig here is the woman's parts; the \"mulberry- fig,\" the anus. Martial (i. 65) makes the following distinction:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficus, quas scimus in arbore nasci,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficos, Caeciliane, tuos.\n\nAnd Modern Italian preserves a difference between fico and fica.\n\n[FN#340] Arab. \"Gh\u00e1niyat Az\u00e1r\u00e1\" (plur. of Azr\u00e1 = virgin): the former is properly a woman who despises ornaments and relies on \"beauty unadorned\" (i.e. in bed).\n\n[FN#341] \"Nihil usitatius apud monachos, cardinales, sacrificulos,\" says Johannes de la Casa Beneventius Episcopus, quoted by Burton Anat. of Mel. lib. iii. Sect. 2; and the famous epitaph on the Jesuit,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Ci-git un Jesuite:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Passant, serre les fesses et passe vite!\n\n[FN#342] Arab. \"Kiblah\"=the fronting-place of prayer, Meccah for Moslems, Jerusalem for Jews and early Christians. See Pilgrimage (ii. 321) for the Moslem change from Jerusalem to Meccah and ibid. (ii. 213) for the way in which the direction was shown.\n\n[FN#343] The Koran says (chaps. ii.): \"Your wives are your tillage: go in therefore unto your tillage in what manner so ever ye will.\" Usually this is understood as meaning in any posture, standing or sitting, lying, backwards or forwards. Yet there is a popular saying about the man whom the woman rides (vulg. St. George, in France, le Postillon); \"Cursed be who maketh woman Heaven and himself earth!\" Some hold the Koranic passage to have been revealed in confutation of the Jews, who pretended that if a man lay with his wife backwards, he would beget a cleverer child. Others again understand it of preposterous venery, which is absurd: every ancient law-giver framed his code to increase the true wealth of the people\u2014population\u2014and severely punished all processes, like onanism, which impeded it. The Persians utilise the hatred of women for such misuse when they would force a wive to demand a divorce and thus forfeit her claim to Mahr (dowry); they convert them into catamites till, after a month or so, they lose all patience and leave the house.\n\n[FN#344] Koran lit 9: \"He will be turned aside from the Faith (or Truth) who shall be turned aside by the Divine decree;\" alluding, in the text, to the preposterous venery her lover demands.\n[FN#345] Arab. \"Fut\u00fah\" meaning openings, and also victories, benefits. The lover congratulates her on her mortifying self in order to please him.\n\n[FN#346] \"And the righteous work will be exalt\": (Koran xxxv. 11) applied ironically.\n\n[FN#347] A prolepsis of Tommy Moore:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Your mother says, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         There's something not quite right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               And you're in fault as much as I,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Now, on my soul, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          I swear 'twould not be right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               To let your mother tell a lie.\n\nBut the Arab is more moral than Mr. Little. as he purposes to repent.\n\n[FN#348] Arab. \"Khunsa\" flexible or flaccid, from Khans=bending inwards, i.e. the mouth of a water-skin before drinking. Like Mukhannas, it is also used for an effeminate man, a passive sodomite and even for a eunuch. Easterns still believe in what Westerns know to be an impossibility, human beings with the parts and proportions of both sexes equally developed and capable of reproduction; and Al-Islam even provides special rules for them (Pilgrimage iii. 237). We hold them to be Buffon's fourth class of (duplicate) monsters belonging essentially to one or the other sex, and related to its opposite only by some few characteristics. The old Greeks dreamed, after their fashion, a beautiful poetic dream of a human animal uniting the contradictory beauties of man and woman. The duality of the generative organs seems an old Egyptian tradition, at least we find it in Genesis (i. 27) where the image of the Deity is created male and female, before man was formed out of the dust of the ground (ii. 7). The old tradition found its way to India (if the Hindus did not borrow the idea from the Greeks); and one of the forms of Mahadeva, the third person of their triad, is entitled \"Ardhan\u00e1r\u00ed\"=the Half-woman, which has suggested to them some charming pictures. Europeans, seeing the left breast conspicuously feminine, have indulged in silly surmises about the \"Amazons.\"\n\n[FN#349] This is a mere phrase for our \"dying of laughter\": the queen was on her back. And as Easterns sit on carpets, their falling back is very different from the same movement off a chair.\n\n[FN#350] Arab. \"Ismid,\" the eye-powder before noticed.\n\n[FN#351] When the Caliph (e.g. Al-T\u00e1'i li'llah) bound a banner to a spear and handed it to an officer, he thereby appointed him Sultan or Viceregent.\n\n[FN#352] Arab. \"Sh\u00e1ib al-ingh\u00e1z\"=lit. a gray beard who shakes head in disapproval.\n\n[FN#353] Arab. \"Ay\u00e1t\" = the Hebr. \"Ototh,\" signs, wonders or\nKoranic verses.\n\n[FN#354] The Chapter \"Al-Ikhl\u00e1s\" i.e. clearing (oneself from any faith but that of Unity) is No. cxii. and runs thus:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Say, He is the One God!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                The sempiternal God,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0           He begetteth not, nor is He begot,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0              And unto Him the like is not.\n\nIt is held to be equal in value to one-third of the Koran, and is daily used in prayer. Mr. Rodwell makes it the tenth.\n\n[FN#355] The Lady Budur shows her noble blood by not objecting to her friend becoming her Zarrat (sister-wife). This word is popularly derived from \"Zarar\"=injury; and is vulgarly pronounced in Egypt \"Durrah\" sounding like Durrah = a parrot (see Burckhardt's mistake in Prov. 314). The native proverb says, \"Ayshat al-durrah murrah,\" the sister-wife hath a bitter life. We have no English equivalent; so I translate indifferently co-wife, co-consort, sister-wife or sister in wedlock.\n\n[FN#356] Lane preserves the article \"El-Amjad\" and \"El-As'ad;\" which is as necessary as to say \"the John\" or \"the James,\" because neo-Latins have \"il Giovanni\" or \"il Giacomo.\" In this matter of the article, however, it is impossible to lay down a universal rule: in some cases it must be preserved and only practice in the language can teach its use. For instance, it is always present in Al-Bahrayn and al-Yaman; but not necessarily so with Irak and Najd.\n\n[FN#357] It is hard to say why this ugly episode was introduced.\nIt is a mere false note in a tune pretty enough.\n\n[FN#358] The significance of this action will presently appear.\n\n[FN#359] An \"Had\u00eds.\"\n\n[FN#360] Arab. \"Sabb\" = using the lowest language of abuse. chiefly concerning women-relatives and their reproductive parts.\n\n[FN#361] The reader will note in the narration concerning the two Queens the parallelism of the Arab's style which recalls that of the Hebrew poets. Strings of black silk are plaited into the long locks (an \"idiot-fringe\" being worn over the brow) because a woman is cursed \"who joineth her own hair to the hair of another\" (especially human hair). Sending the bands is a sign of affectionate submission; and, in extremes\" cases the hair itself is sent.\n\n[FN#362] i.e., suffer similar pain at the spectacle, a phrase often occurring.\n\n[FN#363] i.e., when the eye sees not, the heart grieves not.\n\n[FN#364] i.e., unto Him we shall return, a sentence recurring in almost every longer chapter of the Koran.\n\n[FN#365] Arab. \"Kun,\" the creative Word (which, by the by, proves the Koran to be an uncreated Logos); the full sentence being \"Kun fa k\u00e1na\" = Be! and it became. The origin is evidently, \"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light\" (Gen. i. 3); a line grand in its simplicity and evidently borrowed from the Egyptians, even as Yahveh (Jehovah) from \"Ankh\"=He who lives (Brugsch Hist. ii. 34).\n\n[FN#366] i.e. but also for the life and the so-called \"soul.\"\n\n[FN#367] Arab. \"Lay\u00e1li\"=lit. nights which, I have said, is often applied to the whole twenty-four hours. Here it is used in the sense of \"fortune\" or \"fate ;\" like \"days\" and \"days and nights.\"\n\n[FN#368] Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr a nephew of Ayishah, who had rebuilt the Ka'abah in A.H. 64 (A.D. 683), revolted (A.D. 680) against Yezid and was proclaimed Caliph at Meccah. He was afterwards killed (A.D. 692) by the famous or infamous Hajj\u00e1j general of Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, the fifth Ommiade, surnamed \"Sweat of a stone\" (skin-flint) and \"Father of Flies,\" from his foul breath. See my Pilgrimage, etc. (iii. 192-194), where are explained the allusions to the Ka'abah and the holy Black Stone.\n\n[FN#369] These lines are part of an elegy on the downfall of one of the Moslem dynasties in Spain, composed in the twelfth century by Ibn Abdun al-Andal\u00fasi. The allusion is to the famous conspiracy of the Kh\u00e1rijites (the first sectarians in Mohammedanism) to kill Ah, Mu'awiyah and Amru (so written but pronounced \"Amr\") al-As, in order to abate intestine feuds m Al-Islam. Ali was slain with a sword-cut by Ibn Muljam a name ever damnable amongst the Persians; Mu'awiyah escaped with a wound and Kharijah, the Chief of Police at Fustat or old Cairo was murdered by mistake for Amru. After this the sectarian wars began.\n\n[FN#370] Arab. \"Sar\u00e1b\"= (Koran, chaps. xxiv.) the reek of the Desert, before explained. It is called \"Lama,\" the shine, the loom, in Al-Hariri. The world is compared with the mirage, the painted eye and the sword that breaks in the sworder's hand.\n\n[FN#371] Arab. \"Duny\u00e1,\" with the common alliteration \"d\u00e1niyah\" (=Pers. \"d\u00fan\"), in prose as well as poetry means the things or fortune of this life opp. to \"Akhirah\"=future life.\n\n[FN#372] Arab. \"Walgh,\" a strong expression primarily denoting the lapping of dogs; here and elsewhere \"to swill, saufen.\"\n\n[FN#373] The lines are repeated from Night ccxxi. I give Lane's version (ii. 162) by way of contrast and\u2014warning.\n\n[FN#374] \"S\u00e1hirah\" is the place where human souls will be gathered on Doom-day: some understand by it the Hell Sa'\u00edr (No. iv.) intended for the Sabians or the Devils generally.\n\n[FN#375] His eyes are faded like Jacob's which, after weeping for Joseph, \"became white with mourning\" (Koran, chaps. xxi.). It is a stock comparison.\n\n[FN#376] The grave.\n\n[FN#377] Arab. \"Saww\u00e1n\" (popularly pronounced Suw\u00e1n) =\"Syenite\" from Syrene; generally applied to silex, granite or any hard stone.\n\n[FN#378] A proceeding fit only for thieves and paupers: \"Alpinism\" was then unknown. \"You come from the mountain\" (al-Jabal) means, \"You are a clod-hopper\"; and \"I will sit upon the mountain\"=turn anchorite or magician. (Pilgrimage i. 106.)\n\n[FN#379] Corresponding with wayside chapels in Catholic countries. The Moslem form would be either a wall with a prayer niche (Mibr\u00e1b) fronting Meccah-wards or a small domed room. These little oratories are often found near fountains, streams or tree-clumps where travellers would be likely to alight. I have described one in Sind (\"Scinde or the Unhappy Valley\" i. 79), and have noted that scrawling on the walls is even more common in the East than in the West; witness the monuments of old Egypt bescribbled by the Greeks and Romans. Even the paws of the Sphinx are covered with such graffiti; and those of Ipsambul or Abu S\u00edmbal have proved treasures to epigraphists.\n\n[FN#380] In tales this characterises a Persian; and Hero Rustam is always so pictured.\n\n[FN#381] The Parsis, who are the representatives of the old Guebres, turn towards the sun and the fire as their Kiblah or point of prayer; all deny that they worship it. But, as in the case of saints' images, while the educated would pray before them for edification (Labia) the ignorant would adore them (Dulia); and would make scanty difference between the \"reverence of a servant\" and the \"reverence of a slave.\" The human sacrifice was quite contrary to Guebre, although not to Hindu, custom; although hate and vengeance might prompt an occasional murder.\n\n[FN#382] These oubliettes are common in old eastern houses as in the medieval Castles of Europe, and many a stranger has met his death in them. They are often so well concealed that even the modern inmates are not aware of their existence.\n\n[FN#383] Arab. \"Bakk\"; hence our \"bug\" whose derivation (like that of \"cat\" \"dog\" and \"hog\") is apparently unknown to the dictionaries, always excepting M. Littr\u00e9's.\n\n[FN#384] i.e. thy beauty is ever increasing.\n\n[FN#385] Alluding, as usual, to the eye-lashes, e.g.\nAn eyelash arrow from an eyebrow bow.\n\n[FN#386] Lane (ii. 168) reads:\u2014\"The niggardly female is protected by her niggardness;\" a change of \"Nah\u00edlah\" (bee-hive) into \"Bakh\u00edlah\" (she skin flint).\n\n[FN#387] Koran iv. 38. The advantages are bodily strength, understanding and the high privilege of Holy War. Thus far, and thus far only, woman amongst Moslems is \"lesser\n\n[FN#388] Arab. \"Amir Y\u00e1kh\u00far,\" a corruption of \"Akhor\"=stable\n(Persian).\n\n[FN#389] A servile name in Persian, meaning \"the brave,\" and a title of honour at the Court of Delhi when following the name. Many English officers have made themselves ridiculous (myself amongst the number) by having it engraved on their seal-rings, e.g. Brown S\u00e1hib Bah\u00e1dur. To write the word \"Behadir\" or \"Bah\u00e1dir\" is to adopt the wretched Turkish corruption.\n\n[FN#390] \"Jerry Sneak\" would be the English reader's comment; but in the East all charges are laid upon women.\n\n[FN#391] Here the formula means \"I am sorry for it, but I couldn't help it.\"\n\n[FN#392] A noble name of the Persian Kings (meaning the planet\nMars) corrupted in Europe to Varanes.\n\n[FN#393] Arab. \"Jall\u00e1b,\" one of the three muharram\u00e1t or forbiddens, the H\u00e1rik al-hajar (burner of stone) the K\u00e1ti' al-shajar (cutter of trees, without reference to Hawarden N. B.) and the B\u00e1yi' al-bashar (seller of men, vulg. Jall\u00e1b). The two former worked, like the Italian Carbonari, in desert places where they had especial opportunities for crime. (Pilgrimage iii. 140.) None of these things must be practiced during Pilgrimage on the holy soil of Al-Hijaz\u2014not including Jeddah.\n\n[FN#394] The verses contain the tenets of the Murjiy sect which attaches infinite importance to faith and little or none to works. Sale (sect. viii.) derives his \"Morgians\" from the \"Jabrians\" (Jabari), who are the direct opponents of the \"Kadarians\" (Kadari), denying free will and free agency to man and ascribing his actions wholly to Allah. Lane (ii. 243) gives the orthodox answer to the heretical question:\u2014\n\nWater could wet him not if God please guard His own; *\nNor need man care though bound of hands in sea he's thrown:\nBut if His Lord decree that he in sea be drowned; *\nHe'll drown albeit in the wild and wold he wone.\n\nIt is the old quarrel between Predestination and Freewill which cannot be solved except by assuming a Law without a Lawgiver.\n\n[FN#395] Our proverb says: Give a man luck and throw him into the sea.\n\n[FN#396] As a rule Easterns, I repeat, cover head and face when sleeping especially in the open air and moonlight. Europeans find the practice difficult, and can learn it only by long habit.\n\n[FN#397] Pers. = a flower-garden. In Galland, Bahram has two daughters, Bostama and Cavam a. In the Bres. Edit. the daughter is \"Bostan\" and the slave-girl \"Kaw\u00e1m.\"\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Kah\u00edl\"=eyes which look as if darkened with antimony: hence the name of the noble Arab breed of horses \"Kuhaylat\" (Al-Ajuz, etc.).\n\n[FN#399] \"As'ad\"=more (or most) fortunate.\n\n[FN#400] This is the vulgar belief, although Mohammed expressly disclaimed the power in the Koran (chaps. xiii. 8), \"Thou art commissioned to be a preacher only and not a worker of miracles.\" \"Signs\" (Arab. Ay\u00e1t) may here also mean verses of the Koran, which the Apostle of Allah held to be his standing miracles. He despised the common miracula which in the East are of everyday occurrence and are held to be easy for any holy man. Hume does not believe in miracles because he never saw one. Had he travelled in the East he would have seen (and heard of) so many that his scepticism (more likely that testimony should be false than miracles be true) would have been based on a firmer foundation. It is one of the marvels of our age that whilst two-thirds of Christendom (the Catholics and the \"Orthodox\" Greeks) believe in \"miracles\" occurring not only in ancient but even in our present days, the influential and intelligent third (Protestant) absolutely \"denies the fact.\"\n\n[FN#401] Arab. \"Al-Shah\u00e1dat\u00e1ni\"; testifying the Unity and the\nApostleship.Embed"}, {"_type":

my\u2005part\u2005is\nI hear my\u2005own voice\nI make my own choice\nI\u2005guess, we're fuckin' doing it\nThe horse is out the gates\nIt's\u205ftime\u205fto\u205fstart the race\nShoutout\u205fto Kathy Bates\u205fand also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld\nOr maybe it's more like Larry David\nBecause you know we're not playing\nShoutout to the Jews, the chosen people\nYou know that you cannot fuckin' lose\nBut also, shoutout to the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I don't care that I got seizures\nI got my fuckin' pills\nI'm gonna take 'em right around midnight\nSo I can get right\nI think that's what I gotta do\nShout out to the medical commun-\nItty I just get gritty\nI hope my rhymes are not shitty\nUmm, mic check are you with me?\nShout-out Bobby and Whitney\nBut not shout out to the bad things he did\nI don't know if I'm gonna have a kid\nI don't know if I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to drop it hot for you\n'Cause this is why I'm hot\nThis is why I'm not\nShoutout to Mims\nShoutout to Hims\nThat's that brand of underwear\nThat I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway\nI'm drivin' down the one way\nI'm cruisin' up the runway\nSpreading my wings\nLike I am a Cessna\nLike I am a chestnut\nRoastin' on an open fire, bing!\nCrosby, you got me\nMe, hot see?\nMe Watsky\nSee?\nSittin' in the hot seat\nNo, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat\nBut that word, beats droppin' me\nAnd meha coppin'\nShoutout to Frank Macoppin\nPlayground\nIn the fuckin' San Francisco SFC\nBecause you know how this go\nWe are the best in Dolores Park\nWe have a chorus singin' in the dark\nHark, the angel\nShoutout to Chuck Rangel\nRangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but\nIn December maybe I will be dismembered\nBy a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa\nComin' down my chimney\nWavin' fuckin' butcher knives\nThat\u2019d be fucking crazy\nWho is he\nWho is this robotic crazy Santa\nOh my \u2018lanta\nI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the ground\nMy fuckin' whole brood around me\nAnd I got my whole butt out\nHe's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away\nCut-out\nCut it out like on Full House\nJohn Stamos\nJohn Stains-Most in his pants\nBut that's okay\nWe don't judge people who like to dance away the day\nIf they need a Pepto-Bismol\nMy throat is not abysmal\nThis all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt\nI will not repent\nAnd I\u2019m not demented\nBut I meant it\nWhen I sent it\nFrom my brain\nI'm not plain\nIm not fuckin' around\nI\u2019m not cluckin' the ground\nJust right there it\u2019s only two feet\nThat\u2019s pretty cool man I eat\nFrom that cup right there\nThe one that\u2019s floatin' up in the air\nIt\u2019s got a fuckin' strawber-\n-ry smoothie\nI flow very smoothly\nBut you cannot do me\nDo me, do me like that\nI got that roomie type rap\nIt\u2019s mad philosophical\nI just keep on droppin' all\nOf the marbles in my brain\nThey\u2019re comin' out my nose\nAnd then they just remain\nOn the ground\nEven the cat\u2019s eye\nThat is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by\nDid you know at places\nPeople on the internet watch marble races\nI watched one\nIt was mad fun\nI picked the fuckin' blue marble\nAnd my pick wasn't all garbled\nIt came down the shoot\nIt was going all fuckin' cool\nAnd then it fuckin scooted past the red one\nThat kid from The Shining like Red-Rum\nMeaning murder\nWorder\nWordier\nAll my flows are so dirtier\nThan you could even fuckin' guess\nI'm not even fucking stressed\nI'm so damn relaxy\nShout out to a Maxi-Pad\nFor being so absorbent\nThat's a good fuckin' fuction\nMy girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it\nPut her hands in the air\nMaxi Pads doing what they do down there\nIf you are shaved or if you've got hair\nIt doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare\nDo what you wanna\nWord to your mama\nYour dude can't tell you what you gotta do\nGotta do what you wanna\nMake your own choice\nWith your body or your voice\nIf you are moist\nI know some people don't like that word\nPalabra\nBut you know you gotta like what you like\nThere was this one time this dude named Ike\nRan to be Prez\nAnd he fuckin' won\nEisenhower, that's what I said\nI's a power-rapper\nYes I am\nSo fuckin' dapper\nThe clapper\nDoesn't work on the lights on this green screen\nMan, that would be a dream scene\nIf I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want\nWhat I want, damn\nThat would be no scam\nI don't eat no Spam\nThat's 'cause I am a soft boy\nAnd I only eat Bok-Choy\n'Cause I'm a little veggie human\nAnd that's what I be doin'\nLet me clarify\nLike clarified butter\nAgain, word to your mother\nAnd also not to digress\nBut I gotta get it off of my chest\nWord to Mark Wahlberg\nWord to ballers\nWait, okay, let me make my main point\nAs I rap over this joint\nAnd that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy\nI also eat soy\nI also as a Jewish type dude not a goy\nGet lots of joy out of eatin' carrots\nOut of eatin' broccoli\nOut of eatin' lots of trees\nOut of smokin' lots of trees\nThat is true\nThat is not\nI don't smoke a lot\nBut I do when I party\nBut during COVID, I party hardly\nAnd I guess that's kinda sad\nBut I've had some calls with my dad\nPaul Watsky\nAnd Claire Watsky\nIt's rare, stop me\nIt's not, lots of Sundays\nI call my parentals\nAnd I just steal out my fuckin' mentals\nBut I don't pull out my dentals\nI go sometimes I do in a dream\nWhen I am on the scene\nAnd the ghost come and make me scream\nIt's like you are doing the most\nAnd I gotta fuckin' boast\nShout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast\nThat is some shit if you take a gander\nThat was said by Mr. Ned Flanders\nMr. Homer Simpson\nI'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on\nThey're like \u201cWatsky, I'll do everything for you\nI'll white knight for you and your fucking crew\u201d\nI'm like \u201cDude, don't be a simp\nActually, DO be a simp\nYou could be pimp\nYou could be wimp\nYou could fucking walk with a limp\nYou can have a crimp in your dimp-le\u201d\nI just get the whole tent pole\nUp in the sky cause I meant\nLots of people can come in\nCause I got a big tent\nSo if you are a lame\nFucking get bent\nAnd by lame, what I mean in this game\nIs the type of person who says that you're lame\nIs the type of person who judges\nIs the type of person who never budges\nWhen they get stubborn\nCause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard\n[?] 00:18:04\nWord!\nI think I got this whole thing turn-ed up\nBut that is bound to happen\n34 hours when you keep on rappin'\nSome words are going to collide like trains\nComing head to head, but it remains\nTo be seen that I get back on the track\nWith the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*\nWith my fucking clapping gums\nSo don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb\nSometimes\nCause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes\nBut it happens and I think that is the lesson\nThat you

Hola!\n\nWell now let's go to the serious stuff, a lot of people sitting down for a long time, it's now time to get serious. So, mi gente, vamos a ser lo serio ahora y por un momentito nos paramos despues que terminemos, seguimos.\n\nSo I'm going to start in English but I'm pretty sure I'll finish in Spanish. Let me just start by saying may God bless each one of you here today. Before anything, I would like to apologize because I'm speaking here in a second language, remember, I'm Dominican, even though I get away with English pretty well, I remain Dominican, and I have a hard time sometimes expressing myself this way. So bear with me everybody, please bear with me, and I am gonna have to translate as well, so bear with me, be patient.\n\nIf I do forget something or someone to mention, please don't feel bad. It's been 32 years before we got this opportunity to get here, and if I get emotional or I don't say something or don't mention someone, or if I don't say it appropriately, please forgive me.\n\nWell, first of all, welcome everybody. I would like to take the moment to actually, uhm, say hello to all my peers, all my colleagues, the Hall of Fame, Jane, Jeff, Brad, the whole staff. Thank you for having us. It's a great honor to be here. It's a great moment, not only for me, for my family, it's a great moment for the Dominican Republic and Latin America. I would like to also welcome my amigo, my amigo the new commissioner Rob Manfred.\n\nWe have a lot of work to do in the Dominican Republic to keep bringing people to the Hall of Fame. I would like to thank MLB Baseball, also I would also like to thank my colleagues over there,  1- 5, I got you, I got you 1 - 5, la sangre mi nino, Harold, Greg, guys, John, my colleagues, everybody, I have you here, you're hanging in my heart.\nWell, Tony Clark is not here but he represents the players association, the one that we were a part of for a long time, for me 18 years. We have you here too *points to heart*. I would like to thank the members of the media that actually voted us in, I couldn't thank you enough.  In '99 I had a little stretch where I felt you guys didn't like it, didn't like me so well but  hey you've made it  up and you've shown me you care when it really matters.\n\nI think I just made three new brothers, three guys who while competing against them, and looking at them and learning from them gave me  great joy, a lot to learn, a lot to take with me up to this moment. Craig, what a headache you were, on the bases and hitting as well, too bad I couldn't realize that I couldn't throw fast balls up and away on time, especially late on the count. You can turn on it.\n\nJohn, what a competitor. If you put me and Randy together I would say as far as stats are compared, I think Randy and I make the same stuff that you carry yourself, that's how talented you were John, I appreciate you bro.\n\nRandy Johnson, the Big Unit, my brother from another mother *laughs* how much I enjoyed getting to know you and having you coming over to this class with me, thank you bro, you are special. Hey, I just wanna ask a question. How does the weather feels when you stand up?\n\nMy class of 2015 is a unique class, today is a unique day, Today, I don't have enough words to actually thank you all enough. My peers back here, the veterans I don't know what's after me in the next diner we're going to have but I heard I'm going to be with the Punching Judy's I heard that already.\n\nUhm, I would like to also welcome all the government officials from the United States, from the Dominican Republic, we have a huge package of people from Dominican representing the government, representing the country. Also, the officials here, I know the Secretary of the Navy is here, he became my friend, he's also a fan from Boston, so welcome aboard.\n\nWell, all of you thank you for being here, hey, the Dominican parade is here. As you all know we all have people to thank, we all have different reasons that made us special and made us be here. I don't think I could have been here without having all the things that I've had happen in my life in general and also as a player. I would like to thank my people from the Dominican and my family members and all my friends from all over the country who came over.\n\nI would like to thank America for the opportunity that baseball have to offer to me. Uh, words have the power to build you or break you, and I chose two words to describe pretty much how I feel today in this special day with all of you. I have so many things that I would like to say, that I don't know if I will find the words in Spanish or English but my God I'm thankful, I'm thankful for everything.\n\nThe two words I chose today were God and thank you. Chose God because he's the reason we're all here, he's the one that allows us to be here. He's the one that pretty much builds the way for you to make it here, to make it  in anything you're going to make, to actually become who you are. I have here the reason why Pedro was so determined out there. I have here the glory of God with me and I can only look to my left a little bit and I have all the motivation I needed to be the way I was in baseball \u2014 my family.\n\nMy kids, boys, you don't know what you're taking on when you take baseball, it's really hard but my God it's rejoicing to be here. Ashley, Jerrito, Nayla, Isaiah and Pepo, I love you guys. You are actually my legacy, my generation next. It's a huge commitment as you can see, not only with baseball, not only with your peers, not only with the fans, you have a huge commitment with the legacy that I have built for you guys, so thank you God for them and I love you all.\n\nMy mom *laughs* the nucleus of our family, my dad whose not here today, but I have a second dad, Ramon. You're right here, you are my second dad. My brother Ramon, another veteran in the big leagues. I follow his footsteps and led me where I didn't expect to be today. So thank you, bro, for being my support, for cleaning the way where I was going to walk. So thank you, bro, I love you forever and respect you as well.\n\nThe rest of my family, my brother Jesus, let me say something to everybody now that I can. In 2002 I wasn't given a Cy Young supposedly because I missed a start. Well that Cy Young I didn't win because I gave an opportunity to a kid named Josh Hancock, and why do I bring it up?\n\nBecause out of the four brothers that we are: Ramon, Nelson, me and eventually Jesus, three of us made it to the big leagues. But Jesus is not in the record books, because the organization that he was playing for did not find a chance to give him one pitch in the big leagues, so that he could be in the records.\nAnd that was the main reason why decided not to take that outing, to give it to Josh Hancock because I felt bad that my brother Jesus did not experience what it was like to pitch in that game, that day. So Jesus don't feel bad, we pitch enough for you, and we're here. So love you, baseball is yours too and what we get it's ours.\n\nI could like to thank God also for my beautiful wife, my other mother, Luz Maria, my other partner in crime, Ana Lelia, my cousins, my nephews, Lilly, I don't have enough words to say how much I appreciate you. My in-laws, all the people that have some how influenced my life.\n\nBut Carolina, I must say, what you're doing, the way you\u2019re dealing with me. I know, I\u2019m not an easy out when it comes to making me keep quiet,  especially after I retired where I didn't know what I was going to do with so much time. Carolina, I love you. I appreciate what you have done for my family. The things you have gone through to get all my family here, close to a hundred people we have here, ladies and gentleman.\n\nAnd Carolina, Kerry, Pam, Nancy Lane, they were responsible for us being here and making this moment so special. I love you all, nana gracias por ser otra madre para mi. People in baseball that I feel so fortunate to have had by my side. You know, it's funny but I have so many names I want to mention. And we waited 32 years to see one more Dominican, and you have to imagine there were a lot of people involved in this.\n\nSo I'm gonna just drop a couple names of names that I would like to mention. After I thank God for the beautiful family that's witnessing what we have today. Right away I have to thank Avila, Rafael Avila, the man with the biggest history as far as ball players coming out of the Dominican Republic.\n\nJust if you didn't know, that's Rafael Avila over here, my first mentor and my papaito that signed more than 50 players that have made it to the big leagues. Rafael Avila, an icon of Latin America, and a symbol of baseball in the Dominican Republic. Eleodoro Arias, my first coach who was always there to teach me the baby steps that I needed to take to become better every day.\n\nI have a gentleman here that I think is crazy. I have a gentleman here whose name is  Dan Duquette. He was crazy twice to trade for the same little player and both times he ended up looking great. And he wanted me for a third time but I was too old.\n\nSo, Dan thank you for having so much faith in me, trusting I was gonna make you look good. I thought you were good looking without me but I guess I shaped you more. I have here a name...oh, I'm gonna say two names that I can't go without mentioning.\n\nFelipe Alou and with Felipe Alou I'm going to mention Tommy Harper. Harper, Felipe gave me the opportunity, I was trying to take advantage of it.  There was a time where I felt I was not performing to the level and you gave me the best advice I could ever take with me. T. Harp thank you for telling me that the organ kept on playing.  Because at that moment I felt like I was failing and you just told me that's only a little slump.\n\nHow did you get into the slump? You got into the slump pitching, well that's the same way you have to come out of it. And I kept my faith and I kept my head up, and I kept working and today I can say I thank you for that, and the organ, yes, kept on playing.\n\nI would like to take the moment to thank all the franchises I played for.... LA Dodgers, Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox, New York Mets, and the Philadelphia Phillies, and at the same time say to the fan bases that we appreciate you all.\n\nMontreal, I hope you get a team pretty soon, Boston I don't have enough words to say I love you. Even though LA Dodgers never got me the chance to prove what I could do. I was given an opportunity there to showcase a little bit so someone else could pick me up, thank you.  Philadelphia where I finished my career, little did I know that I was going to finish my career, but the fan base was great, the experience in Philadelphia was great, so to all of you thank you. The Mets fan, well if you look at me and you see me going wild, well that's the Mets fans, that's how we are, so Queens I love you too.\n\nA lot of people that influence your life in other ways, I have names that I have to mention as well. One of them my Dear from the Dominican Republic, and all time friend. And she has been able to put up with a lot of stuff for me, Evita Tribidad, I couldn\u2019t go without mentioning your name. My agent Fernando Cuza, he\u2019s out there.\nI have to thank Guy Conti the man that taught me the circle change up, a change up that gave those batters a lot of trouble,and his wife Janet as well. I have to thank the Hurlers family who were the ones that introduced me to the United states. All from Great Falls, Montana. Thank you, mama conchita. I know you\u2019re somewhere out here. Thank you so much.\n\nI have to thank some people in Montreal. Sam Eltes, Mark Routtenberg, the fan base in Montreal, thank you for supporting me. Thank you for being there for me and it\u2019s too bad you don\u2019t have a team.\n\nAll the coaches and trainers I was able to spend time with. Chris Correnti is one name that I could never forget. This is the guy that went through war with me, and wherever you are Chris, I love you, I appreciate it and may God bless You.\n\nI would like to thank God for all the teammates I have. Jason Varitek, (hey 1 - 5!) Kevin Millar, Manny Ramirez, David Ortiz, so many names that I could mention today, I would like to thank all of you. The the ones that  I played with and the ones I competed against because you guys helped me on the field, help me defeat those other teams and at the same time you guys built my courage, strength and desire to get out there and try to beat you. The competition, I want to acknowledge you. And I want to tell you that I respected you even though sometimes by the pitches you wouldn't tell that.  I would like to thank god for the opportunity of being here.\n\nI would like you all of you to not look at me as numbers, as baseball, as achievements, I would like you to see me as a sign of hope for a third world country, for Latin America. Someone you can look up to and feel comfortable enough to say \"I'm proud of you.\"\n\nGracias, mi gente. Today I don't want to run into numbers and games that I pitched. I just want to make sure that my people get a little message across from me. And see me as a hope for future generation. I have to switch to Spanish because I would like these people to really feel what I felt today....\n\nMuchas gracias a todos, en nombre de la Republica Dominicana, de Dios, en nombre del baseball, yo quiero darle las gracias a todos por el apoyo, por siempre estar aqui conmigo, por siempre, amarme de la forma que me han amado y respetado y respetado a nuestros familiares\n\nYo me siento hoy mas que orgulloso y comprometido con todos ustedes.....me siento eh muy agradecido con Dios, por darme la oportunidad de representarlos, de representarlos con dignida, pero no quiero hacer esto a nombre mio, ni quiero que me vean a mi como la persona que consiguio los trofeos individuales, yo quiero que todo Dominicano, todo Latino que este aqui, que vea que nosotros estamos preparando un espacio para los que han de venir en una futura generacion. Nosotros los Dominicanos no hemos tenido este chance muy a menudo. Este es el chance para nosotros, dar gracias a Dios por lo que tenemos, por lo que seremos , por lo que consiguiremos esto es el momento. Yo quiero  servir todo ustedes simplemente como una muestra de esperanza, de fe, de determinacion. Alguien que lucho por ensenar los valores que se nos inculcaron en nuestras familias a temprana edad. Una persona que se siente digna de ser Dominicana, que se siente orgulloso de su pais y su gente. Gracias, muchas gracias\n\nQuiero decirles a todos que Dios tiene maneras muy exclusivas de hacer las cosas.Yo no se si ustedes recordaran que en Enero 6 mi llamada llego y fue para decirme que yo habia entrado al salon de la fama en primera vuelta.\n\nQuiero que me escuchen bien, porque Dios tiene maneras unicas de trabajar con nosotros, ese dia era el dia de los ninos, dia de reyes, yes el dia de los ninos, kings day.\n\nToday, hoy es el dia de los Padres en la Republica Dominicana y quiero aprovechar este momento para que todos ustedes disfruten conmigo de este Dia de los Padres disfruten de este momento como un regalo mas que Dios le ofrece y que me usa a mi como  un puente para traerle a todo ustedes a todos los padres de Republica Dominicana y quiero dedicarselo al mio en especial tambien a todos los padres de Republica Dominicana que hoy celebran ese dia y los respetan. Quiero que hoy se sientan que esto es parte de ellos, se lo dedico.\n\nYo quiero que ustedes de aqui en adelante no vean al Pedro Martinez que consiguio los numeros, no quiero que ustedes vean al Pedro Martinez que entro al salon de la fama y tiene una placa. Yo quiero que ustedes se lleven en sus corazones  la esperanza que yo alcanze lo que yo pude lograr que ustedes lo vean en mi que ustedes cada uno se identifique cada vez que me vea a mi y que vea en mi una senal de esperanza, de fe, de determinacion, de esfuerzo, de trabajo digno, con dignidad. Quiero que todos los Dominicanos recordemos eso.  Este es un gran sitio para nosotros decir hoy que queremos una Republica Dominicana mas digna, que queremos una Republica Dominicana mas comprometida a la nueva generacion como decimos nosotros. Yo quiero dejarles este mensajito el legado que don Juan Marichal aqui detras, el legado que don Juan Marichal nos dejo a nosotros, yo no sabia que lo hiba al alcanzar pero yo lo alcance. Espero que don Juan Marichal y yo en este dia le estamos compartiendo a ustedes Ustedes tambien los puedan lograrlo otro dia. Vladimir Guerrero yo se que  estas por ahi, en dos anos te vemos aqui.\n\nYo quiero sin mas nada como quien dice despedirme de todos ustedes y quiero que siempre que vean esta placa o alguien se pase por Cooperstown vean la senal de esperanza que Dios nos dio, quiero que vean agradecimiento, quiero que vean todo el amor del mundo que Dios deposito en nosotros, de donde me trajo Dios para que yo llegara hasta aqui. Mama, mama es el dia de los padres quiero reconocerte, quiero reconocer a todas las madres que estan aqui porque ellas son el futuro de nosotros, son las que extienden la generacion de nosotros y el legado. Quiero darles las gracias a todos, quiero darle las gracias a mi pais. Quiero darle las gracias a Estado Unidos a la embajada americana que se fajo con nosotros para que todos estubieramos aqui, a nuestra consul alla en Republica Dominicana y tambien al embajador que tambien se envolvio para que nosotros pudieramos compartir este momento aqui tan bonito. Muchisimas gracias a todos. Yo tengo ahora como quien dice explicarle a esta gente lo que yo acabo de decir pero lo voy a resumir muy cortito.\n\nI'm going to back to English just so I can zoom in some of the stuff I said, I feel proud to represent the Dominican Republic. I just dedicated this day to all the fathers in the Dominican, because today is Father's day in the Dominican Republic. And the day I was call to be inducted into the hall of fame it was January 6th which is King's day and God has funny ways to do things.\n\nThe day I was called to be inducted into the hall of fame it King's day, and the day I'm being inducted is father's day in the Dominican Republic, so to all fathers in the Dominican Republic feel like this is your gift today. I thank you all for your patience, I would like to do something that would probably break the protocol but I would like to give my people an opportunity that we don't get very often and we had to wait 32 years for us to do.\n\nSo, I would like to invite Mister Juan Marichal to come forward and finally give the Dominican Republic a gift that they waited 32 years to get, congratulations, thank you so much. Thank you for having us.  Que Dios bendiga todos. Esto es una oportunidad que la brinda la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana . Disfrutar todo mundo, God bless you all!3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1408507", "artist_names": "Ronnie Dove", "full_title": "Hello Pretty Girl

read the Sears and Roebuck catalog\n\nI would hum a happy tune\nPeeping through the quarter moon\nAs my daddy's kin had done before\n\nIt was in that quiet spot\nDaily cares could be forgot\nIt gave

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI left my home in Norfolk, Virginia\nCalifornia on my mind\nI straddled that Greyhound and rode him into Raleigh\nAnd on across Caroline\nWe stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill\nWe never was a minute late\nWe was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown\nRolling outta the Georgia state\nWe had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle\nHalfway across Alabam'\nAnd that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded\nIn downtown Birmingham\n[Verse 2]\nRight away, I bought me a through train ticket\nRiding across Mississippi clean\nAnd I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham\nSmoking into New Orleans\nSomebody help me get out of Louisiana\nJust help me get to Houston town\nThere's people there who care a little about me\nAnd they won't let the poor boy down\nSure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit\nPut luggage in my hands\nAnd I woke up high over Albuquerque\nOn a jet to the promised land\n\n[Verse 3]\nWorking on a T-bone steak a la carte\nFlying over to the Golden State\nOh, when the pilot told me us in thirteen minutes\nHe would set us at the terminal gate\nSwing low sweet chariot, come down easy\nTaxi to the terminal zone\nCut your engines and cool your wings\nAnd let me make it to the telephone\nLos Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia\nTidewater four ten o nine\nTell the folks back home this is the promised land calling\nAnd the poor boy's on the lineYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/733941", "artist_names": "Martha Reeves & The Vandellas", "full_title":

summer's night with a magic moon\nEvery time that you walk in the room\n\nMaybe it's a dream come true\nWalking right alongside of you\nWish I could tell you how much I care\nBut I only have the nerve to stare\nI can feel a something pounding in my brain\nJust any time that someone speaks your name\nTrumpets sound and I hear thunder boom\nEvery time that you walk in the room\nEvery time that you

Two wail.\n\nA bamboo grove, all chopped down\n\nFrom it, warring songs\n\n....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is ``tires'' one syllable or two? How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line!\n\n\"Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:\nShanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people.\n\nNow these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer.\n\nBut the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender.\n\nAs every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange.\n\nNow if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks.\n\nHere's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step.\n\nSo ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day.\n\n``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers.\n\n\"The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C.\n\nShaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it:\n\nAntenna searches\n\nRetriever's nose in the wind\n\nEther's far secrets\nThis was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it.\n\nBut in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers.\n\n``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront.\n\nThe leaves of Shanghai:\n\nPale doorways in a steel sky.\n\nWinter has begun.\n\n\nBARRENS\n\nLet's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.\n\n\n\nAs nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.\n\n\n\nThe boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears.\n\n\nOne noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced.\n\nNevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal.\n\nWhen Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys.\n\nFor each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity.\n\nThe pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out.\n\nMechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity.\n\nStops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres.\n\nThe next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died.\n\nLawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school.\n\nAt this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled.\n\nThe Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers.\n\nWhen not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations.\n\nThe basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him.\n\nConsequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around.\n\nAt the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton.\n\nNow Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department.\n\nThere was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence.\n\nQuite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.\n\n\ncertain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.\n\n[equation cannot be rendered in text]\n\nwhere s is a complex number.\n\nLawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles.\n\nLawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands.\n\nBut Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view.\n\nAl delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind.\n\nOne day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing.\n\nLawrence decided that he was probably one of those people.\n\nAlan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other.\n\nAlan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker.\n\nIt got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it.\n\nThe only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful.\n\nAlan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him.\n\n``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically.\n\n``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused.\n\nThere was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle.\n\n``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered.\n\nBy this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed.\n\n``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said.\n\n``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.''\n\nLawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?''\n\n\n``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.''\n\n``Very well,'' Alan said.\n\nBut later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math.\n\n\nAlan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...''\n\n\n``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.''\n\n\n``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.''\n\n\n``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?''\n\n\n``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--''\n\n\n``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said.\n\n\n``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!''\n\n\n``Hmmm?''\n\n\n``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!''\n\n\n``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.''\n\n\n``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said.\n\n\n``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.''\n\n``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy.\n\n``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--''\n\n``I'm not talking about zat!''\n\n``And he invented matrices, but--''\n\n``I'm not talking about zat eezer!''\n\n``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--''\n\n``Zat is completely different!''\n\n``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?''\n\n``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.''\n\n``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--''\n\n``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!''\n\n``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?''\n\n``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.''\n\nAlan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....''\n\n``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began.\n\n``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.''\n\n``All right, Alan.''\n\n``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.''\n\n``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.''\n\n``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.''\n\n``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly.\n\n``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.''\n\n``But he's not German! He's Austrian!''\n\n``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?''\n\n``Ze Anschluss wasn't my idea, you don't have to look at me that way, I think Hitler is appalling.''\n\n``I've heard of Godel,'' Waterhouse put in helpfully. ``But could we back up just a sec?''\n\n``Of course Lawrence.''\n\n``Why bother? Why did Russell do it? Was there something wrong with math? I mean, two plus two equals four, right?''\n\nAlan picked up two bottlecaps and set them down on the ground. ``Two. One-two. Plus--'' He set down two more. ``Another two. One-two. Equals four. One-two-three-four.''\n\n``What's so bad about that?'' Lawrence said.\n\n``But Lawrence--when you really do math, in an abstract way, you're not counting bottlecaps, are you?''\n\n``I'm not counting anything.''\n\nRudy broke the following news: ``Zat is a very modern position for you to take.''\n\n``It is?''\n\nAlan said, ``There was this implicit belief, for a long time, that math was a sort of physics of bottlecaps. That any mathematical operation you could do on paper, no matter how complicated, could be reduced--in theory, anyway--to messing about with actual physical counters, such as bottlecaps, in the real world.''\n\n``But you can't have two point one bottlecaps.''\n\n``All right, all right, say we use bottlecaps for integers, and for real numbers like two point one, we use physical measurements, like the length of this stick.'' Alan tossed the stick down next to the bottlecaps.\n\n``Well what about pi, then? You can't have a stick that's exactly pi inches long.''\n\n``Pi is from geometry--ze same story,'' Rudy put in.\n\n``Yes, it was believed that Euclid's geometry was really a kind of physics, that his lines and so on represented properties of the physical world. But--you know Einstein?''\n\n``I'm not very good with names.''\n\n``That white-haired chap with the big mustache?''\n\n``Oh, yeah,'' Lawrence said dimly, ``I tried to ask him my sprocket question. He claimed he was late for an appointment or something.''\n\n``That fellow has come up with a general relativity theory, which is sort of a practical application, not of Euclid's, but of Riemann's geometry--''\n\n``The same Riemann of your zeta function?''\n\n``Same Riemann, different subject. Now let's not get sidetracked here Lawrence--''\n\n``Riemann showed you could have many many different geometries that were not the geometry of Euclid but that still made sense internally,'' Rudy explained.\n\n``All right, so back to P.M. then,'' Lawrence said.\n\n``Yes! Russell and Whitehead. It's like this: when mathematicians began fooling around with things like the square root of negative one, and quaternions, then they were no longer dealing with things that you could translate into sticks and bottlecaps. And yet they were still getting sound results.''\n\n``Or at least internally consistent results,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Okay. Meaning that math was more than a physics of bottlecaps.''\n\n``It appeared that way, Lawrence, but this raised the question of was mathematics really true or was it just a game played with symbols? In other words--are we discovering Truth, or just wanking?''\n\n``It has to be true because if you do physics with it, it all works out! I've heard of that general relativity thing, and I know they did experiments and figured out it was true.''\n\n``Ze great majority of mathematics does not lend itself to experimental testing,'' Rudy said.\n\n``The whole idea of this project is to sever the ties to physics,'' Alan said.\n\n``And yet not to be vanking ourselves.''\n\n``That's what P.M. was trying to do?''\n\n``Russell and Whitehead broke all mathematical concepts down into brutally simple things like sets. From there they got to integers, and so on.''\n\n``But how can you break something like pi down into a set?''\n\n``You can't,'' Alan said, ``but you can express it as a long string of digits. Three point one four one five nine, and so on.''\n\n``And digits are integers,'' Rudy said.\n\n``But no fair! Pi itself is not an integer!''\n\n``But you can calculate the digits of pi, one at a time, by using certain formulas. And you can write down the formulas like so!'' Alan scratches this in the dirt:\n\n\n\n``I have used the Leibniz series in order to placate our friend. See, Lawrence? It is a string of symbols.''\n\n``Okay. I see the string of symbols,'' Lawrence said reluctantly.\n\n``Can we move on? Godel said, just a few years ago, `Say! If you buy into this business about mathematics being just strings of symbols, guess what?' And he pointed out that any string of symbols--such as this very formula, here--can be translated into integers.''\n\n``How?''\n\n``Nothing fancy, Lawrence--it's just simple encryption. Arbitrary. The number `538' might be written down instead of this great ugly \u00a3, and so on.''\n\n``Seems pretty close to wanking, now.''\n\n``No, no. Because then Godel sprang the trap! Formulas can act on numbers, right?''\n\n``Sure. Like 2x.''\n\n``Yes. You can substitute any number for x and the formula 2x will double it. But if another mathematical formula, such as this one right here, for calculating pi, can be encoded as a number, then you can have another formula act on it. Formulas acting on formulas!''\n\n``Is that all?''\n\n``No. Then he showed, really through a very simple argument, that if formulas really can refer to themselves, it's possible to write one down saying `this statement cannot be proved.' Which was tremendously startling to Hilbert and everyone else, who expected the opposite result.''\n\n``Have you mentioned this Hilbert guy before?''\n\n``No, he is new to this discussion, Lawrence.''\n\n``Who is he?''\n\n``A man who asks difficult questions. He asked a whole list of them once. Go[audel answered one of them.''\n\n``And Turing answered another,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Who's that?''\n\n``It's me,'' Alan said. ``But Rudy's joking. `Turing' doesn't really have an umlaut in it.''\n\n``He's going to have an umlaut in him later tonight,'' Rudy said, looking at Alan in a way that, in retrospect, years later, Lawrence would understand to have been smoldering.\n\n``Well, don't keep me in suspense. Which one of his questions did you answer?''\n\n``The Entscheidungsproblem,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Meaning?''\n\nAlan explained, ``Hilbert wanted to know whether any given statement could, in principle, be found true or false.''\n\n``But after Godel got finished, it changed,'' Rudy pointed out.\n\n``That's true--after Godel it became `Can we determine whether any given statement is provable or non-provable?' In other words, is there some sort of mechanical process we could use to separate the provable statements from the nonprovable ones?''\n\n`` `Mechanical process' is supposed to be a metaphor, Alan....''\n\n``Oh, stop it, Rudy! Lawrence and I are quite comfortable with machinery.''\n\n``I get it,'' Lawrence said.\n\n``What do you mean, you get it?'' Alan said.\n\n``Your machine--not the zeta-function calculator, but the other one. The one we've been talking about building--''\n\n``It is called Universal Turing Machine,'' Rudy said.\n\n``The whole point of that gizmo is to separate provable from nonprovable statements, isn't it?''\n\n``That's why I came up with the basic idea for it,'' Alan said. ``So Hilbert's question has been answered. Now I just want to actually build one so that I can beat Rudy at chess.''\n\n``You haven't told poor Lawrence the answer yet!'' Rudy protested.\n\n``Lawrence can figure it out,'' Alan said. ``It'll give him something to do.''\n\nSoon it became clear that Alan really meant: It'll give him something to do while we're fucking. Lawrence shoved a notebook into the waistband of his trousers and rode his bicycle a few hundred yards to the fire tower, then climbed up the stairs to the platform at the top and sat down, back to the setting sun, notebook propped up on his knees to catch the light.\n\nHe could not collect his thoughts, and then he was distracted by a false sunrise that lit up the clouds off to the northeast. He thought at first that some low clouds were bouncing fragments of the sunset back to him, but it was too concentrated and flickering for that. Then he thought it was lightning. But the color of the light was not blue enough. It fluctuated sharply, modulated by (one had to assume) great, startling events that were occulted by the horizon. As the sun went down on the opposite side of the world, the light on the New Jersey horizon focused to a steady, lambent core the color of a flashlight when you shine it through the palm of your hand under the bedsheets.\n\nLawrence climbed down the stairs and got on his bicycle and rode through the Pine Barrens. Before long he came to a road that led in the general direction of the light. Most of the time he could not see anything, not even the road, but after a couple of hours the glow bouncing off the low cloud layer lit up flat stones in the road, and turned the barrens' wandering rivulets into glowing crevices.\n\nThe road began to tend in the wrong direction and so Lawrence cut directly into the woods, because he was very close now, and the light in the sky was strong enough that he could see it through the sparse carpet of scrubby pines--black sticks that appeared to have been burned, though they hadn't. The ground had turned into sand, but it was damp and compacted, and his bicycle had fat tires that rode over it well. At one point he had to stop and throw the bike over a barbed-wire fence. Then he broke out of the sticks and onto a perfectly flat expanse of white sand, stitched down with tufts of beach grass, and just then he was dazzled by a low fence of quiet steady flames that ran across a part of the horizon about as wide as the harvest moon when it sinks into the sea. Its brightness made it difficult to see anything else--Lawrence kept riding into little ditches and creeks that meandered across the flats. He learned not to stare directly at the flames. Looking off to the sides was more interesting anyway: the table-land was marked at wide intervals by the largest buildings he had ever seen, cracker-box structures built by Pharaohs, and in the mile-wide plazas between them, gnomons of triangulated steel were planted in wide stances: the internal skeletons of pyramids. The largest of these pierced the center of a perfectly circular railway line a few hundred feet in diameter: two argent curves scored on the dull ground, interrupted in one place where the tower's shadow, a stopped sundial, told the time. He rode by a building smaller than the others, with oval tanks standing next to it. Steam murmured from valves on the tops of the tanks, but instead of rising into the air it dribbled down the sides and struck the ground and spread out, coating the sea-grass with jackets of silver.\n\nA thousand sailors in white were standing in a ring around the long flame. One of them held up his hand and waved Lawrence down. Lawrence came to a stop next to the sailor and planted one foot on the sand to steady himself. He and the sailor stared at each other for a moment and then Lawrence, who could not think of anything else, said, ``I am in the Navy also.'' Then the sailor seemed to make up his mind about something. He saluted Lawrence through, and pointed him towards a small building off to the side of the fire.\n\nThe building looked only like a wall glowing in the firelight, but sometimes a barrage of magnesium blue light made its windowframes jump out of the darkness, a rectangular lightning-bolt that echoed many times across the night. Lawrence started pedaling again and rode past that building: a spiraling flock of alert fedoras, prodding at slim terse notebooks with stately Ticonderogas, crab-walking photogs turning their huge chrome daisies, crisp rows of people sleeping with blankets over their faces, a sweating man with Brilliantined hair chalking umlauted names on a blackboard. Finally coming around this building he smelled hot fuel oil, felt the heat of the flames on his face and saw beach-glass curled toward it and desiccated.\n\nHe stared down upon the world's globe, not the globe fleshed with continents and oceans but only its skeleton: a burst of meridians, curving backwards to cage an inner dome of orange flame. Against the light of the burning oil those longitudes were thin and crisp as a draftsman's ink-strokes. But coming closer he saw them resolve into clever works of rings and struts, hollow as a bird's bones. As they spread away from the pole they sooner or later began to wander, or split into bent parts, or just broke off and hung in the fire oscillating like dry stalks. The perfect geometry was also mottled, here and there, by webs of cable and harnesses of electrical wiring. Lawrence almost rode over a broken wine bottle and decided he should now walk, to spare his bicycle's tires, so he laid the bike down, the front wheel covering an aluminum vase that appeared to have been spun on a lathe, with a few charred roses hanging out of it. Some sailors had joined their hands to form a sort of throne, and were bearing along a human-shaped piece of charcoal dressed in a coverall of immaculate asbestos. As they walked the toes of their shoes caught in vast, ramified snarls of ropes and piano-wires, cables and wires, creative furtive movements in the grass and the sand dozens of yards every direction. Lawrence began planting his feet very thoughtfully one in front of the other, trying to measure the greatness of what he had come and seen. A rocket-shaped pod stuck askew from the sand, supporting an umbrella of bent-back propellers. The duralumin struts and catwalks rambled on above him for miles. There was a suitcase spilled open, with a pair of women's shoes displayed as if in the window of a downtown store, and a menu that had been charred to an oval glow, and then some tousled wall-slabs, like a whole room that had dropped out of the sky--these were decorated, one with a giant map of the world, great circles arcing away from Berlin to pounce on cities near and far, and another with a photograph of a famous, fat German in a uniform, grinning on a flowered platform, the giant horizon of a new Zeppelin behind him.\n\nAfter a while he stopped seeing new things. Then he got on his bicycle and rode back through the Pine Barrens. He got lost in the dark and so didn't find his way back to the fire tower until dawn. But he didn't mind being lost because while he rode around in the dark he thought about the Turing machine. Finally he came back to the shore of the pond where they had camped. The dawn-light shining on the saucer of calm reddish water made it look like a pool of blood. Alan Mathison Turing and Rudolf von Hacklheber were lying together like spoons on the shore, still smudged a little bit from their swim yesterday. Lawrence started a little fire and made some tea and they woke up eventually.\n\n``Did you solve the problem?'' Alan asked him.\n\n``Well you can turn that Universal Turing Machine of yours into any machine by changing the presets--''\n\n``Presets?''\n\n``Sorry, Alan, I think of your U.T.M. as being kind of like a pipe organ.''\n\n``Oh.''\n\n``Once you've done that, anyway, you can do any calculation you please, if the tape is long enough. But gosh, Alan, making a tape that's long enough, and that you can write symbols on, and erase them, is going to be sort of tricky--Atanasoff's capacitor drum would only work up to a certain size--you'd have to--''\n\n``This is a digression,'' Alan said gently.\n\n``Yeah, okay, well--if you had a machine like that, then any given preset could be represented by a number--a string of symbols. And the tape that you would feed into it to start the calculation would contain another string of symbols. So it's Go[audel's proof all over again--if any possible combination of machine and data can be represented by a string of numbers, then you can just arrange all of the possible strings of numbers into a big table, and then it turns into a Cantor diagonal type of argument, and the answer is that there must be some numbers that cannot be computed.''\n\n``And ze Entscheidungsproblem?'' Rudy reminded him.\n\n``Proving or disproving a formula--once you've encrypted the formula into numbers, that is--is just a calculation on that number. So it means that the answer to the question is, no! Some formulas cannot be proved or disproved by any mechanical process! So I guess there's some point in being human after all!''\n\nAlan looked pleased until Lawrence said this last thing, and then his face collapsed. ``Now there you go making unwarranted assumptions.''\n\n``Don't listen to him, Lawrence!'' Rudy said. ``He's going to tell you that our brains are Turing machines.''\n\n``Thank you, Rudy,'' Alan said patiently. ``Lawrence, I submit that our brains are Turing machines.''\n\n``But you proved that there's a whole lot of formulas that a Turing machine can't process!''\n\n``And you have proved it too, Lawrence.''\n\n``But don't you think that we can do some things that a Turing machine couldn't?''\n\n``Godel agrees with you, Lawrence,'' Rudy put in, ``and so does Hardy.''\n\n``Give me one example,'' Alan said.\n\n``Of a noncomputable function that a human can do, and a Turing machine can't?''\n\n``Yes. And don't give me any sentimental nonsense about creativity. I believe that a Universal Turing Machine could show behaviors that we would construe as creative.''\n\n``Well, I don't know then... I'll try to keep my eye out for that kind of thing in the future.''\n\nBut later, as they were riding back towards Princeton, he said, ``What about dreams?''\n\n``Like those angels in Virginia?''\n\n``I guess so.''\n\n``Just noise in the neurons, Lawrence.''\n\n``Also I dreamed last night that a zeppelin was burning.''\n\n\n\nSoon, Alan got his Ph.D. and went back to England. He wrote Lawrence a couple of letters. The last of these stated, simply, that he would not be able to write Lawrence any more letters ``of substance'' and that Lawrence should not take it personally. Lawrence perceived right away that Alan's society had put him to work doing something useful--probably figuring out how to keep it from being eaten alive by certain of its neighbors. Lawrence wondered what use America would find for him.\n\nHe went back to Iowa State, considered changing his major to mathematics, but didn't. It was the consensus of all whom he consulted that mathematics, like pipe-organ restoration, was a fine thing, but that one needed some way to put bread on the table. He remained in engineering and did more and more poorly at it until the middle of his senior year, when the university suggested that he enter a useful line of work, such as roofing. He walked straight out of college into the waiting arms of the Navy.\n\nThey gave him an intelligence test. The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?\n\nLawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would?\n\nThen the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.\n\nLawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.\n\nThe sack of mail carrying Lawrence's contribution to the mathematical literature arrived just in the nick of time. Lawrence's ship, and quite a few of her sisters, had until then been based in California. But at just this moment, all of them were transferred to some place called Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in order to show the Nips who was boss.\n\nLawrence had never really known what he wanted to do with his life, but he quickly decided that being glockenspiel player on a battleship in Hawaii during peacetime was a long way from the worst life you could possibly have. The harshest part of the job was sometimes having to sit or march in very warm conditions, and enduring occasional fluffed notes by other band members. He had abundant free time, which he spent working on a series of new theorems in the field of information theory. The field had been invented and pretty much encompassed by his friend Alan, but there was much detail work to be done. He and Alan and Rudy had sketched out a general plan of what needed to be proved or disproved. Lawrence tore through the list. He wondered what Alan and Rudy were up to in Britain and Germany, but he couldn't write to them and find out, so he kept his work to himself. When he wasn't playing the glockenspiel or working out theorems, there were bars and dances to go to. Waterhouse did some penis work of his own, got the clap, had it cured,* bought condoms. All of the sailors did this. They were like three-year olds who shove pencils in their ears, discover that it hurts, and stop doing it. Lawrence's first year went by almost instantly. Time just blazed by. Nowhere could be sunnier, more relaxing, than Hawaii.\n\n*1940 being a good year to begin experimenting with venereal diseases in that the new injectable penicillin was just becoming available\n\n\n\nNOVUS ORDO SECLORUM\n\n``Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people,'' avi says, ``which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons.''\n\nRandy is in Tokyo's airport, ambling down a concourse with a slowness that is infuriating to his fellow travelers. They have all spent the last half-day strapped into bad chairs, stuffed into an aluminum tube aslosh with jet fuel. Over the safety-engineered nubs molded into the jetway floor, their rolling suitcases drone like fighter planes. They graze the backs of his knees as they bank around his husky columnar body. Randy is holding his new GSM phone to the side of his head. Supposedly it works anywhere in the world, except for the United States. This is his first chance to try it out.\n\n``You sound clear as a bell,'' Avi says. ``How was the flight over?''\n\n``All right,'' Randy says. ``They had one of those animated maps up on the video screen.''\n\nAvi sighs. ``All the airlines have those now,'' he announces monotonically.\n\n``The only feature between San Francisco and Tokyo was Midway Island.''\n\n``So?''\n\n``It kind of hung there for hours. MIDWAY. Mute embarrassment all around.''\n\nRandy reaches the departure gate for Manila, and pauses to admire a five-foot-wide high-definition TV set bearing the logo of a major Nipponese consumer-electronics company. It is running a video in which a wacky cartoon professor and his adorable canine sidekick cheerfully tick off the three transmission routes of the AIDS virus.\n\n``I have a fingerprint for you,'' Randy says.\n\n``Shoot.''\n\nRandy stares at the palm of his hand, on which he has written a string of numbers and letters in ballpoint pen. ``AF 10 06 E9 99 BA 11 07 64 C1 89 E3 40 8C 72 55.''\n\n``Got it,'' Avi says. ``That's from Ordo, right?''\n\n``Right. I e-mailed you the key from SFO.''\n\n``The apartment situation is still resolving,'' Avi says. ``So I just reserved you a suite at the Manila Hotel.''\n\n``What do you mean, it's still resolving?''\n\n``The Philippines is one of those post-Spanish countries with no clear boundaries between business and personal relationships,'' Avi says. ``I don't think you can secure lodgings there without marrying into a family with a major street named after it.''\n\nRandy takes a seat in the departure area. Perky gate attendants in jaunty, improbable hats zero in on Filipinos with too many carry-ons, and subject them to a public ritual of filling out little tags and surrendering their possessions. The Filipinos roll their eyes and stare longingly out the windows. But most of the waiting passengers are Nipponese--some businessmen, mostly vacationers. They are watching an educational video about how to get mugged in foreign countries.\n\n``Huh,'' Randy says, looking out the window, ``got another 747 down to Manila.''\n\n``In Asia, no decent airline bothers to dick around anything smaller than a 747,'' Avi snaps. ``If someone tries to pack you on board a 737 or god forbid an Airbus, run, don't walk, away from the boarding lounge, and call me on my Sky Pager and I'll send in a chopper to evacuate you.''\n\nRandy laughs.\n\nAvi continues. ``Now, listen. This hotel you're going to is very old, very grand, but it's in the middle of nowhere.''\n\n``Why would they build a grand hotel in the middle of nowhere?''\n\n``It used to be a happening place--it's on the waterfront, right on the edge of Intramuros.''\n\nRandy's high-school Spanish is enough to translate that: Inside the Walls.\n\n``But Intramuros was annihilated by the Nipponese in 1945,'' Avi continues. ``Systematically. All of the business hotels and office buildings are in a new neighborhood called Makati, much closer to the airport.''\n\n``So you want to put our office in Intramuros.''\n\n``How'd you guess?'' Avi says, sounding a little spooked. He prides himself on unpredictability.\n\n``I'm not an intuitive guy generally,'' Randy says, ``but I've been on a plane for thirteen hours and my brain has been turned inside out and hung up to dry.''\n\nAvi rattles off canned justifications: office space is much cheaper in Intramuros. Government ministries are closer. Makati, the gleaming new business district, is too isolated from the real Philippines. Randy pays no attention to it.\n\n``You want to work out of Intramuros because it was systematically annihilated, and because you're obsessed with the Holocaust,'' Randy finally says, quietly and without rancor.\n\n``Yeah. So?'' Avi says.\n\nRandy stares out the window of the Manila-bound 747, sipping on a fluorescent green Nipponese soft drink made from bee extracts (at least, it has pictures of bees on it) and munching on something that a flight attendant handed him called Japanese Snack. Sky and ocean are the same color, a shade of blue that makes his teeth freeze. The plane is so high that, whether he looks up or down, he sees foreshortened views of boiling cumulonimbus stacks. The clouds erupt from the hot Pacific as if immense warships were exploding all over the place. The speed and power of their growth is alarming, the forms they adopt as bizarre and varied as those of deep-sea organisms, and all of them, he supposes, are as dangerous to an airplane as punji stakes to a barefoot pedestrian. The red-orange meatball painted on the wingtip startles him when he notices it. He feels like he's been thrown into an old war film.\n\nHe turns on his laptop. Electronic mail from Avi, encrypted to a fare-thee-well, has been piling up in his in-box. It is a gradual accumulation of tiny files, thrown at him by Avi whenever a thought popped into his head over the last three days; it would be obvious, even if Randy didn't know it, that Avi owns a portable e-mail machine that talks to the Internet by radio. Randy fires up a piece of software that is technically called Novus Ordo Seclorum but that everyone calls Ordo for short. It is a fairly strained pun based on the fact that Ordo's job, as a piece of cryptographic software, is to put a message's bits in a New Order and that it will take Centuries for nosy governments to decrypt it. A scanned image of a Great Pyramid appears in the middle of his screen, and a single eye gradually materializes at its apex.\n\nOrdo can handle this in one of two ways. The obvious way is to decrypt all of the messages and convert them into plaintext files on his hard disk, which he can then read any time he wants. The problem with this (if you are paranoid) is that anyone who gets his hands on Randy's hard disk can then read the files. For all he knows, the customs officials in Manila will decide to ransack his computer for child pornography. Or, fogged by jet lag, he'll leave his laptop in a taxi. So instead he puts Ordo into a streaming mode where it will decrypt the files just long enough for him to read them and then, when he closes the windows, expunge the plaintext from the computer's memory and from its hard drive.\n\nThe subject heading of Avi's first message is: ``Guideline 1.''\n\nWe look for places where the math is right. Meaning what? Meaning that pop. is about to explode---we can predict that just by looking at age histogram---and per capita income is about to take off the way it did in Nippon, Taiwan, Singapore. Multiply those two things together and you get the kind of exponential growth that should get us all into fuck-you money before we turn forty.\n\nThis is an allusion to a Randy/Avi conversation of two years ago wherein Avi actually calculated a specific numerical value for ``fuck-you money.'' It was not a fixed constant, however, but rather a cell in a spreadsheet linked to any number of continually fluctuating economic indicators. Sometimes when Avi is working at his computer he will leave the spreadsheet running in a tiny window in the corner so that he can see the current value of ``fuck-you money'' at a glance.\n\nThe second message, sent a couple of hours later, is called ``Guideline 2.''\n\nTwo: pick a tech where no one can compete with us. Right now, that=networking. We're kicking the crap out of everyone else in the world when it comes to networking. It's not even funny.\n\nThe next day, Avi sent a message called, simply, ``More.'' Perhaps he had lost track of the number of guidelines he'd issued so far.\n\nAnother principle: this time we retain control of the corporation. That means that we keep at least fifty percent of the shares---which means little to no outside investment until we've built up some value.\n\n``You don't have to convince me,'' Randy mumbles to himself, as he reads this.\n\nThis shapes the kinds of businesses we can get into. Forget anything that requires a big initial investment.\n\nLuzon is green-black jungle mountains gouged with rivers that would appear to be avalanches of silt. As the navy-blue ocean verges on its khaki beaches, the water takes on the shocking iridescent hue of a suburban swimming pool. Farther south, the mountains are swidden-scarred--the soil beneath is bright red and so these parts look like fresh lacerations. But most is covered with foliage that looks like the nubby green stuff that model railroaders put over their papier-mache hills, and in vast stretches of the mountains there are no signs whatsoever that human beings have ever existed. Closer to Manila, some of the slopes are deforested, sprinkled with structures, ribboned with power-line cuts. Rice paddies line the basins. The towns are accretions of shanties, nucleated around large cross-shaped churches with good roofs.\n\nThe view gets blurry as they belly down into the pall of sweaty smog above the city. The plane begins to sweat like a giant glass of iced tea. The water streams off in sheets, collects in crevices, whips off the flaps' trailing edges.\n\nSuddenly they are banking over Manila Bay, which is marked with endless streaks of brilliant red--some kind of algal bloom. Oil tankers trail long time-delayed rainbows that flourish in their wakes. Every cove is jammed with long skinny boats with dual outriggers, looking like brightly painted water skaters.\n\nAnd then they are down on the runway at NAIA, Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Guards and cops of various stripes are ambling around with M-16s or pistol-handled pump shotguns, wearing burnooses fashioned from handkerchiefs clamped to the head with American baseball caps. A man dressed in a radiant white uniform stands below the ragged maw of the jetway holding his hands downwards with fluorescent orange sticks in them, like Christ dispensing mercy on a world of sinners. Sulfurous, fulminating tropical air begins to leak in through the jumbo's air vents. Everything moistens and wilts.\n\nHe is in Manila. He takes his passport out of his shirt pocket. It says, RANDALL LAWRENCE WATERHOUSE.\n\n\n\nThis is how Epiphyte Corporation came into existence:\n\n``I am channeling the bad shit!'' Avi said.\n\nThe number came through on Randy's pager while he was sitting around a table in a grubhouse along the coast with his girlfriend's crowd. A place where, every day, they laser-printed fresh menus on 100% recycled imitation parchment, where oscilloscope tracings of neon-colored sauces scribbled across the plates, and the entrees were towering, architectonic stacks of rare ingredients carved into gemlike prisms. Randy had spent the entire meal trying to resist the temptation to invite one of Charlene's friends (any one of them, it didn't matter) out on the sidewalk for a fistfight.\n\nHe glanced at his pager expecting to see the number of the Three Siblings Computer Center, which was where he worked (technically, still does). The fell digits of Avi's phone number penetrated the core of his being in the same way that 666 would a fundamentalist's.\n\nFifteen seconds later, Randy was out on the sidewalk, swiping his card through a pay phone like an assassin drawing a single-edged razor blade across the throat of a tubby politician.\n\n``The power is coming down from On High,'' Avi continued. ``Tonight, it happens to be coming through me--you poor bastard.''\n\n``What do you want me to do?'' Randy asked, adopting a cold, almost hostile tone to mask sick excitement.\n\n``Buy a ticket to Manila,'' Avi said.\n\n``I have to talk it over with Charlene first,'' Randy said.\n\n``You don't even believe that yourself,'' Avi said.\n\n``Charlene and I have a long-standing relationsh--''\n\n``It's been ten years. You haven't married her. Fill in the fucking blanks.''\n\n(Seventy-two hours later, he would be in Manila, looking at the One-Note Flute.)\n\n``Everyone in Asia is wondering when the Philippines is finally going to get its shit together,'' Avi said, ``it's the question of the nineties.''\n\n(The One-Note Flute is the first thing you see when you make it through passport control.)\n\n``I flashed on this when I was standing in line at Passport Control at Ninoy Aquino International Airport,'' Avi said, compressing that entire name into a single, sharply articulated burst. ``You know how they have different lanes?''\n\n``I guess so,'' Randy said. A parallelpiped of seared tuna did a barrel roll in his gullet. He felt a perverse craving for a double ice-cream cone. He did not travel as much as Avi, and had only a vague idea of what he meant by lanes.\n\n``You know. One lane for citizens. One for foreigners. Maybe one for diplomats.''\n\n(Now, standing there waiting to have his passport stamped, Randy can see it clearly. For once he doesn't mind the wait. He gets in a lane next to the OCW lane and studies them. They are Epiphyte Corp.'s market. Mostly young women, many of them fashionably dressed, but still with a kind of Catholic boarding-school demureness. Exhausted from long flights, tired of the wait, they slump, then suddenly straighten up and elevate their fine chins, as if an invisible nun were making her way up the line whacking their manicured knuckles with a ruler.)\n\nBut seventy-two hours ago he hadn't really understood what Avi meant by lanes, so he just said, ``Yeah, I've seen the lane thing.''\n\n``At Manila, they have a whole lane just for returning OCWs!''\n\n``OCWs?''\n\n``Overseas Contract Workers. Filipinos working abroad--because the economy of the Philippines is so lame. As maids and nannies in Saudi. Nurses and anesthesiologists in the States. Singers in Hong Kong, whores in Bangkok.''\n\n``Whores in Bangkok?'' Randy had been there, at least, and his mind reeled at the concept of importing prostitutes to Thailand.\n\n``The Filipino women are more beautiful,'' Avi said quietly, ``and have a ferocity that makes them more interesting, to the innately masochistic business traveler, than all those grinning Thai bimbos.'' Both of them knew that this was complete bullshit; Avi was a family man and had no firsthand experience whereof he spoke. Randy didn't call him on it, though. As long as Avi retained this extemporaneous bullshitting ability there was a better than even chance of all of them making fuck-you money.\n\n(Now that he's here, it is tempting to speculate as to which of the girls in the OCW lane are hustlers. But he can't see that going anywhere but wrong, so he squares his shoulders and marches toward the yellow line.\n\nThe government has set up glass display cases in the concourse leading from passport control to the security barrier. The cases contain artifacts demonstrating the glories of pre-Magellan Filipino culture. The first one of these contains the piece de resistance: a rustic hand-carved musical instrument labeled with a long and unreadable name in Tagalog. Underneath that, in smaller letters, is the English translation: ONE-NOTE FLUTE.)\n\n``See? The Philippines is innately hedged,'' Avi said. ``You know how rare that is? When you find an innately hedged environment, Randy, you lunge into it like a rabid ferret going into a pipe full of raw meat.''\n\nA word about Avi: his father's people had just barely gotten out of Prague. As Central European Jews went, they were fairly typical. The only thing about them that was really anomalous was that they were still alive. But his mother's people were unbelievably peculiar New Mexican crypto-Jews who had been living on mesas, dodging Jesuits, shooting rattlesnakes and eating jimson weed for three hundred years; they looked like Indians and talked like cowboys. In his relations with other people, therefore, Avi dithered. Most of the time he was courtly and correct in a way that was deeply impressive to businesspeople--Nipponese ones expecially--but there were these eruptions, from time to time, as if he'd been dipping into the loco weed. Randy had learned to deal with it, which is why Avi called him at times like this.\n\n``Oh, calm down!'' Randy said. He watched a tanned girl rollerblade past him, on her way up from the beach. ``Innately hedged?''\n\n``As long as the Philippines don't have their shit together, there'll be plenty of OCWs. They will want to communicate with their families--the Filipinos are incredibly family-oriented. They make Jews look like a bunch of alienated loners.''\n\n``Okay. You know more about both groups than I do.''\n\n``They are sentimental and affectionate in a way that's very easy for us to sneer at.''\n\n``You don't have to be defensive,'' Randy said, ``I'm not sneering at them.''\n\n``When you hear their song dedications on the radio, you'll sneer,'' Avi said. ``But frankly, we could take some pointers from the Pinoys on this front.''\n\n``You are so close to being sanctimonious right now--''\n\n``I apologize,'' Avi said, with absolute sincerity. Avi's wife had been pregnant almost continuously for the four years they'd been married. He was getting more religiously observant daily and couldn't make it through a conversation without mentioning the Holocaust. Randy was a bachelor who was just about to break up with the chick he'd been living with.\n\n``I believe you, Avi,'' Randy said. ``Is it a problem with you if I buy a business-class ticket?''\n\nAvi didn't hear him, so Randy assumed that meant yes. ``As long as that's the case, there will be a big market for Pinoy-grams.''\n\n``Pinoy-grams?''\n\n``For god's sake, don't say it out loud! I'm filling out the trademark application as we speak,'' Avi said. Randy could hear a rattling sound in the background, computer keys impacting so rapidly it sounded like Avi was simply holding the keyboard between his pale, spindly hands and shaking it violently up and down. ``But if the Filipinos do get their shit together, then we see explosive growth in telecoms, as in any other Arday.''\n\n``Arday?''\n\n``R-D-A-E. Rapidly Developing Asian Economy. Either way, we win.''\n\n``I gather you want to do something with telecoms?''\n\n``Bingo.'' In the background, a baby began to cough and cry. ``Gotta go,'' Avi said, ``Shlomo's asthma is spiking again. Take down this fingerprint.''\n\n``Fingerprint?''\n\n``For my encryption key. For e-mail.''\n\n``Ordo?''\n\n``Yeah.''\n\nRandy took out a ballpoint pen and, finding no paper in his pocket, poised it over the palm of his hand. ``Shoot.''\n\n``67 81 A4 AE FF 40 25 9B 43 0E 29 8D 56 60 E3 2F.'' Then Avi hung up the phone.\n\nRandy went back into the restaurant. On his way back, he asked the waiter to bring him a half-bottle of good red wine. Charlene heard him, and glowered. Randy was still thinking about innate ferocity, and did not see it in her face; only a schoolmarmishness common among all of her friends. My god! I have to get out of California, he realized.\n\n\nSEAWEED\n\nWoman holds baby\n\nEyes pale as a muzzle flash\n\nBand chimes frozen tears\n\nThe fourth marines is marching downhill to the strains of John Philip Sousa, which ought to be second nature to a Marine. But the Fourth Marines have been in Shanghai (which ain't no halls of Montezuma nor shores of Tripoli) for too long, longer than Marines should ever stay in one place, and Bobby's already seen his sergeant, one Frick, throw up from opium withdrawal.\n\nA Marine band is several Shanghai blocks ahead. Bobby's platoon can hear the thumpity-thump of the big drums and the piercing noises from piccolos and glockenspiels but he can't follow the tune. Corporal Shaftoe is effectively their leader, because Sergeant Frick is useless.\n\nShaftoe marches alongside the formation, supposedly to keep an eye on his men, but mostly he's just staring at Shanghai.\n\nShanghai stares back, and mostly gives them a standing ovation. Of course there is a type of young street rowdy who makes it a point of honor to let the Marines know he isn't scared of them, and they are jeering the Marines from a safe distance, and setting off strings of firecrackers, which does nothing to steady anyone's nerves. The Europeans are applauding--a whole chorus line of Russian dancing girls from Delmonte's is showing thigh and blowing kisses. But most of the Chinese look pretty stonefaced, which--Bobby suspects--means they're scared shitless.\n\nThe worst thing is the women carrying half-white babies. A few of these women are rabid, hysterical, throwing themselves into formations of massed Marines, undeterred by rifle butts. But most of them are stoic: they stand with their light-eyed babies and glare, searching the ranks and files for the guilty party. They've all heard about what happened upriver in Nanjing when the Nips came there, and they know that when it's all over, the only trace that they and their babies ever existed may be a really bad memory in the mind of some American Marine.\n\nIt works for Shaftoe: he has hunted deer in Wisconsin and seen them limping across the snow, bleeding to death. He saw a man die in basic training at Parris Island. He has seen whole tangles of bodies in the Yangtze, downstream of where the Nipponese were prosecuting the China Incident, and he has seen refugees from places like Nanjing starve to death in the gutters of Shanghai. He has himself killed people who were trying to storm the riverboats it was his duty to protect. He thinks that he has never seen, and will never see, anything as terrible as those stone-faced Chinese women holding their white babies, not even blinking as the firecrackers explode all around them.\n\nUntil, that is, he looks into the faces of certain Marines who stare into that crowd and see their own faces looking back at them, pudgy with baby fat and streaked with tears. Some of them seem to think it's all a joke. But many of the Marines who march out of their empty barracks that morning sane and solid men, have, by the time they reach the gunboats waiting for them at the Bund, gone mad. They don't show it. But Shaftoe can see in their eyes that something has given way inside.\n\nThe very best men in the regiment are in a foul mood. The ones like Shaftoe, who didn't get involved with the Chinese women, are still leaving plenty behind: houses with maids and shoeshine boys and coolies, with women and opium for almost nothing. They don't know where they are being shipped off to, but it's safe to say that their twenty-one dollars a month won't go as far. They'll be in barracks and they'll have to learn to polish their own boots again. When the gangplanks are drawn in from the stone edge of the Bund, they are cut off from a whole world that they'll never see again, a world where they were kings. Now they are Marines again. It's okay with Shaftoe, who wants to be a Marine. But many of the men have become middle-aged here, and don't.\n\nThe guilty men duck belowdecks. Shaftoe remains on the deck of the gunboat, which casts off from the Bund, headed for the cruiser Augusta, which awaits in mid-channel.\n\nThe Bund is jammed with onlookers in a riot of differently colored clothing, so one patch of uniform drab catches his eye: a group of Nip soldiers who've come down to bid their Yank counterparts a sarcastic farewell. Shaftoe scans the group looking for someone tall and bulky, and picks him out easily. Goto Dengo's waving to him.\n\nShaftoe takes his helmet off and waves back. Then, on impulse, just for the hell of it, he winds up and flings the helmet directly at Goto Dengo's head. The throw goes awry and Goto Dengo has to knock down about a dozen of his comrades in order to catch it. All of them seem to think that it is a high honor, as well as tremendously amusing, to be knocked down by Goto Dengo.\n\nTwenty seconds later, a comet sails up out of the flesh cosmos of the Bund and bounces on the wooden deck of the gunboat--a hell of a throw. Goto Dengo is showing off his follow-through. The projectile is a rock with a white streamer wrapped around it. Shaftoe runs over and snatches it. The streamer is one of those thousand-stitch headbands (supposedly; he's taken a few off of unconscious Nips, but he's never bothered to count the stitches) that they tie around their heads as a good-luck charm; it has a meatball in the center and some Nip writing to either side. He unties it from around the rock. In so doing he realizes, suddenly, that it's not a rock after all; it is a hand grenade! But good old Goto Dengo was just joking--he didn't pull the pin. A nice souvenir for Bobby Shaftoe.\n\nShaftoe's first haiku (December 1940) was a quick and dirty adaptation of the Marine Creed:\n\nThis is my rifle\n\nThere are many like it but\n\nThis rifle is mine.\n\nHe wrote it under the following circumstances: Shaftoe and the rest of Fourth Marines were stationed in Shanghai so that they could guard the International Settlement and work as muscle on the gunboats of the Yangtze River Patrol. His platoon had just come back from the Last Patrol: a thousand-mile reconnaissance-in-force all the way up past what was left of Nanjing, to Hankow, and back. Marines had been doing this ever since the Boxer Rebellion, through civil wars and everything else. But towards the end of 1940, what with the Nips basically running all of northeast China now, the politicians back in D.C. had finally thrown in the towel and told the China Marines not to steam up the Yangtze any more.\n\nNow, the Old Breed Marines like Frick claimed they could tell the difference between organized brigands; armed mobs of starving peasants; rogue Nationalists; Communist guerrillas; and the irregular forces in the pay of warlords. But to Bobby Shaftoe they were all just crazy, armed slopes who wanted a piece of the Yangtze River Patrol. The Last Patrol had been a wild trip. But it was over and they were back in Shanghai now, the safest place you could be in China, and about a hundred times more dangerous than the most dangerous place you could be in America. They had climbed off the gunboat six hours ago, gone to a bar, and not come out until just now, when they had decided it was high time they went to a whorehouse. On their way, they happened to pass this Nip restaurant.\n\nBobby Shaftoe had looked in the windows of the place before, and watched the man with the knife, trying to figure out what the hell he was doing. It looked a hell of a lot like he was cutting up uncooked fish and putting the raw meat on bullets of rice and handing it over to the Nips on the other side of the counter, who were wolfing it down.\n\nIt had to be some kind of optical illusion. The fish must have been precooked in the back room.\n\nThis had been nagging at Shaftoe for about a year. As he and the other horny drunk Marines went by the place, he slowed down to peer through the window, trying to gather more evidence. He could swear that some of that fish looked ruby red, which it wouldn't have been if it were cooked.\n\nOne of his buddies, Rhodes from Shreveport, noticed him looking. He dared Shaftoe to go in there and sit down at that bar. Then another private, Gowicki from Pittsburgh, double-dared him!\n\nShaftoe sucked his teeth and considered the matter. He had already made up his mind that he was going to do it. He was a sniper scout, and it was in his nature to do crazy shit like this; but it was also part of his training to scan the terrain carefully before venturing in.\n\nThe restaurant was three-quarters full, and everyone in the place was a uniformed member of the Nipponese military. At the bar where the man was cutting up the apparently raw fish, there was a marked concentration of officers; if you only had one grenade, that's where you'd throw it. Most of the place was filled with long tables where enlisted men sat, drinking noodle soup from steaming urns. Shaftoe paid particular attention to these, because they were the ones who were going to be beating the shit out of him in about sixty seconds. Some were there alone, with reading material. A cluster of them, back in one corner, were paying attention to one fellow who was apparently telling a joke or story.\n\nThe longer Shaftoe spent reconnoitering the place, the more convinced Rhodes and Gowicki became that he was actually going to do it. They became excited and called for the other Marines, who had gone ahead of them down the block, headed for that whorehouse.\n\nShaftoe saw the others coming back--his tactical reserve. ``What the fuck,'' he said, and went into the restaurant. Behind him, he could hear the others shouting excitedly; they couldn't believe he was doing it. When Shaftoe stepped over the threshold of that Nip restaurant, he passed into the realm of legend.\n\nAll the Nips looked up at him when he came in the door. If they were surprised, they didn't show it. The chef behind the counter began to holler out some kind of ritual greeting, which faltered and trailed off as he got a look at what had just come in. The fellow in the back of the room--a husky, pink-cheeked Nip--continued telling his joke or story or whatever it was.\n\nShaftoe nodded to no one in particular, then stepped to the nearest empty chair at the bar and sat down.\n\nOther Marines would have waited until the whole squad had assembled. Then they would have invaded the restaurant en masse, knocked over a few chairs, spilled some soup. But Shaftoe had seized the initiative before the others could do any such thing and gone in by himself, as a sniper scout was supposed to do. It was not just because he was a sniper scout, though. It was also because he was Bobby Shaftoe, and he was sincerely curious about this place, and if he could, he wanted to spend a few calm minutes in here and learn a few things about it before the fun started.\n\nIt helped, of course, that Shaftoe was a quiet and contemplative drunk, not a dangerous explosive drunk. He must have reeked of beer (those Krauts in Tsingtao cranked out a brew whose taste took him right back to Wisconsin, and he was homesick). But he wasn't hollering or knocking things over.\n\nThe chef was busy crafting one of his little morsels and pretended to ignore Shaftoe. The other men at the counter stared coldly at Shaftoe for a while, then turned their attentions back to their food. Shaftoe looked at the array of raw fish laid out on shaved ice behind the bar, then looked around the room. The guy back in the corner was talking in short bursts, reading from a notebook. He would speak maybe ten or twenty words, and then his little audience would turn to one another and grin, or grimace, or sometimes even make a patter of applause. He wasn't delivering his material like a dirty joke. He spoke precisely and expressively.\n\nFuck! He was reading poetry! Shaftoe had no idea what he was saying, but he could tell, by the sound of it, that it must be poetry. Didn't rhyme though. But the Nips did everything queerly.\n\nHe noticed that the chef was glaring at him. He cleared his throat, which was useless since he couldn't speak Nip. He looked at some of that ruby red fish behind the bar, pointed to it, held up two fingers.\n\nEveryone was startled that the American had actually placed an order. The tension was broken, only a little. The chef went to work and produced two morsels, which he served up on a wooden pedestal.\n\nShaftoe had been trained to eat insects, and to bite the heads off chickens, so he figured he could handle this. He picked the morsels up in his fingers, just like the Nips were doing, and ate them. They were good. He ordered two more, of another variety. The guy in the corner kept reading poetry. Shaftoe ate his morsels and then ordered some more. For perhaps ten seconds, between the taste of the fish and the sound of the poetry, he actually felt comfortable here, and forgot that he was merely instigating a vicious racial brawl.\n\nThe third order looked different: laid over the top of the raw fish were thin translucent sheets of some kind of moist, glistening material. It looked sort of like butcher paper soaked in oil. Shaftoe gawked at it for a while, trying to identify it, but it looked like no foodstuff he knew of. He glanced left and right, hoping that one of the Nips had ordered the same stuff, so that he could watch and learn the right way to eat it. No luck.\n\nHell, they were officers. Maybe one of them spoke a little English. `` 'Scuse me. What's this?'' Shaftoe said, peeling up one corner of the eerie membrane.\n\nThe chef looked up at him nervously, then scanned the bar, polling the customers. Discussion ensued. Finally, a Nip officer at the end of the bar, a naval lieutenant, stood up and spoke to Bobby Shaftoe.\n\n``Seaweed.''\n\nShaftoe did not particularly like the lieutenant's tone of voice--hostile and sullen. This, combined with the look on his face, seemed to say, You'll never understand it, you farmer, so why don't you just think of it as seaweed.\n\nShaftoe folded his hands primly in his lap, regarded the seaweed for a few moments, and then looked up at the lieutenant, who was still gazing at him expressionlessly. ``What kind of seaweed, sir?'' he said.\n\nSignificant glances began flying around the restaurant, like semaphores before a naval engagement. The poetry reading seemed to have stopped, and a migration of enlisted men had begun from the back of the room. Meanwhile the lieutenant translated Shaftoe's inquiry to the others, who discussed it in some detail, as if it were a major policy initiative from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nThe lieutenant and the chef exchanged words. Then the lieutenant looked at Shaftoe again. ``He say, you pay now.'' The chef held up one hand and rubbed his fingers and thumb together.\n\nA year of working the Yangtze River Patrol had given Bobby Shaftoe nerves of titanium, and unlimited faith in his comrades, and so he resisted the impulse to turn his head and look out the window. He already knew exactly what he would see: Marines, shoulder to shoulder, ready to die for him. He scratched the new tattoo on his forearm: a dragon. His dirty fingernails, passing over the fresh scabs, made a rasping sound in the utterly silent restaurant.\n\n``You didn't answer my question,'' Shaftoe said, pronouncing the words with a drunk's precision.\n\nThe lieutenant translated this into Nipponese. More discussion. But this time it was curt and decisive. Shaftoe could tell that they were about to bounce him. He squared his shoulders.\n\nThe Nips were good; they mounted an organized charge out the door, onto the sidewalk, and engaged the Marines, before anyone actually laid a hand on Shaftoe. This spoiling attack prevented the Marines from invading the restaurant proper, which would have disturbed the officers' meal and, with any luck, led to untold property damage. Shaftoe then felt himself being grabbed from behind by at least three people and hoisted into the air. He made eye contact with the lieutenant while this was happening, and shouted: ``Are you bullshitting me about the seaweed?''\n\nAs brawls went, the only remarkable part of this one was the way he was carried out to the street before he could actually get started. Then it was like all the other street fights he'd been in with Nip soldiers in Shanghai. These all came down to American brawn (you didn't get picked for the Fourth Regiment unless you were an impressive-looking six-footer) versus that Nipponese chop-socky.\n\nShaftoe wasn't a boxer. He was a wrestler. This was to his advantage. The other Marines would put up their dukes and try to fight it out--Marquis of Queensberry style--no match for chop-socky. Shaftoe had no illusions about his boxing, so he would just put his head down and charge like a bull, take a few blows to the face on his way in, but usually get a solid hold on his opponent and slam him into the cobblestones. Usually that shook the Nip up enough that Shaftoe could get him in a full-nelson or a hammerlock and get him to cry uncle.\n\nThe guys who were carrying him out of the restaurant got jumped by Marines as soon as they were in the open. Shaftoe found himself going up against an opponent who was at least as tall as he was, which was unusual. This one had a solid build, too. Not like a sumo wrestler. More like a football player--a lineman, with a bit of a gut. He was a strong S.O.B. and Shaftoe knew right away that he was in for a real scrape. The guy had a different style of wrestling from the American, which (as Shaftoe learned the hard way) included some illegal maneuvers: partial strangulation and powerful, short punches to major nerve centers. The gulf between Shaftoe's mind and body, already wedged open by alcohol, was yanked open to a chasm by these techniques. He ended up lying on the sidewalk, helpless and paralyzed, staring up into the chubby face of his opponent. This was (he realized) the same guy who'd been sitting in the corner of the restaurant reading poetry. He was a good wrestler for a poet. Or maybe vice versa.\n\n``It is not seaweed,'' said the big Nip. He had a look on his face like a naughty schoolkid getting away with something. ``The English word is maybe calabash?'' Then he turned and walked back into the restaurant.\n\nSo much for legend. What none of the other Marines knows is that this was not the last encounter between Bobby Shaftoe and Goto Dengo. The incident left Shaftoe with any number of nagging questions about subjects as diverse as seaweed, poetry, and chop-socky. He sought out Goto Dengo after that, which was not that hard--he just paid some Chinese boys to follow the conspicuous Nip around town and file daily reports. From this he learned that Goto Dengo and some of his comrades gathered every morning in a certain park to practice their chop-socky. After making sure that his will was in order and writing a last letter to his parents and siblings in Oconomowoc, Shaftoe went to that park one morning, reintroduced himself to the surprised Goto Dengo, and made arrangements to serve as human punching bag. They found his self-defense skills hilariously primitive but admired his resilience, and so, for the small cost of a few broken ribs and digits, Bobby Shaftoe got a preliminary course in the particular type of chop-socky favored by Goto Dengo, which is called judo. Over time, this even led to a few social engagements in bars, and restaurants, where Shaftoe learned to recognize four types of seaweed, three types of fish eggs, and several flavors of Nip poetry. Of course he had no idea what the fuck they were saying, but he could count syllables, which, as far as he could tell, is about all there is to Nip poetry appreciation.\n\nNot that this--or any other knowledge of their culture--is going to do him any good now that it will soon be his job to kill them.\n\nIn return, Shaftoe taught Goto Dengo how not to throw like a girl. A lot of the Nips are good at baseball and so it was hilarious, even to them, to see their burly friend pushing ineffectually at a baseball. But it was Shaftoe who taught Goto Dengo to stand sideways, to rotate his shoulders, and to follow through. He's paid a lot of attention to the big Nip's throwing form during the last year, and maybe that's why the image of Goto Dengo planting his feet on the ashlars of the Bund, winding up, throwing the streamer-wrapped grenade, and following through almost daintily on one combat-booted foot stays in Shaftoe's mind all the way to Manila and beyond.\n\n\n\nA couple of days into the voyage it becomes apparent that Sergeant Frick has forgotten how to shine his boots. Every night he puts them on the deck beside his bunk, like he's expecting a coolie to come around and shine them up during the night. Every morning he wakes up and finds them in a sorrier state than before. After a few days he starts to draw reprimands from On High, starts to get a lot of potato-peeling duty.\n\nNow in and of itself this is forgivable. Frick started out his career chasing bandolier-draped desperadoes away from mail trains on the High Chaparral, for God's sake. In '27 he got shipped off to Shanghai on very short notice, and no doubt had to display some adaptability. Fine. And now he's on this miserable pre-Great War cruiser and it's a little hard on him. Fine. But he does not take all of this with the dignity that is demanded of Marines by Marines. He whines about it. He lets himself get humiliated. He gets angry. A lot of the other old China Marines see things his way.\n\nOne day Bobby Shaftoe is up on the deck of the destroyer tossing the old horsehide around with a couple of the other young Marines when he sees a few of these older guys accumulating into a sort of human booger on the afterdeck. He can tell by the looks on their faces and by their gestures that they are bellyaching.\n\nShaftoe hears a couple of the ship's crew talking to each other nearby. ``What the hell is wrong with those Marines?'' one of them says. The other one shakes his head sadly, like a doctor who has just seen a patient's eyeballs roll up into their sockets. ``Those poor bastards have gone Asiatic,'' he says.\n\nAnd then they turn and look at Shaftoe.\n\nThat evening, at mess, Bobby Shaftoe gulps his food down double-time, then stands up and approaches the table where those Old Breed Marines are sullenly gathered. ``Begging your pardon, Sergeant!'' he hollers. ``Request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''\n\nFrick's mouth drops open, revealing a half-chewed plug of boiled beef. ``Whud you say, Corporal?''\n\nThe mess has gone silent. ``Respectfully request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''\n\nFrick is not the quickest guy in the world even when he's sober, and it's pretty obvious, just from looking at his pupils, that he and his comrades have brought some opium aboard. ``Wull, uh, I guess so,'' he says. He looks around at his crew of gripers, who are a little confused and a little amused. He unlaces his boots. Bobby Shaftoe takes those disgraceful things away and returns a bit later with them resplendently shined. By this time, Frick has gotten high and mighty. ``Wull, those boots look real good, Corporal Shaftoe,'' he says in a brassy voice. ``Darned if you ain't as good a shoe-shiner as my coolie boy was.''\n\nAt lights out, Frick and crew are short-sheeted. Various other, ruder practical jokes ensue during the nighttime. One of them gets jumped in his bunk and beaten by unspecified attackers. The brass call a surprise inspection the next morning and cuss them out. The ``gone Asiatic'' crew spend most of the next day gathered in a cluster, watching each other's backs.\n\nAround midday, Frick finally gets it through his head that all of this was triggered by Shaftoe's gesture, and that Shaftoe knew, all along, what was going to happen. So he rushes Bobby Shaftoe up on the deck and tries to throw him over the rail.\n\nShaftoe's warned at the last minute by one of his compadres, and spins around just enough to throw off Frick's attack. Frick caroms off the rail, turns around, and tries to grab Shaftoe's nuts. Shaftoe pokes him in the eye, which straightens him right up. They back away from each other. The opening formalities having been finished; they put up their dukes.\n\nFrick and Shaftoe box for a couple of rounds. A large crowd of Marines gathers. On most of their cards, Frick is winning the fight. Frick was always dim-witted, and is now crazy to boot, but he knows his way around a boxing ring, and he has forty pounds on Shaftoe.\n\nShaftoe puts up with it until Frick socks him pretty hard in the mouth and gives him a bloody lip.\n\n``How far are we from Manila?'' Shaftoe hollers. This question, as usual, leaves Sergeant Frick confused and bewildered, and straightens him up for a moment.\n\n``Two days,'' answers one of the ship's officers.\n\n``Well, goddamn,'' Bobby Shaftoe says. ``How'm I gonna kiss my girl with this fat lip?''\n\nFrick answers, ``Just go out and find a cheaper one.''\n\nThat's all he needs. Shaftoe puts his head down and charges in on Frick, hollering like a Nip. Before Frick can get his brain in gear, Bobby Shaftoe has him wrapped up in one of those chop-socky holds that Goto Dengo taught him in Shanghai. He works his way up Frick's body to a choke-hold and then clamps down until Sergeant Frick's lips turn the color of the inside of an oyster shell. Then he hangs Frick over the rail, holding him upside-down by the ankles, until Frick recovers enough to shout, ``Uncle!''\n\nA disciplinary proceeding is hastily called. Shaftoe is found guilty of being courteous (by shining Frick's boots) and defending the life of a Marine (himself) from a crazed attacker. The crazed attacker goes straight to the brig. Within a few hours, the noises Frick makes lets all of the Marines know what opium withdrawal feels like.\n\nSo Sergeant Frick does not get to see their entrance into Manila Bay. Shaftoe almost feels sorry for the poor bastard.\n\nThe island of Luzon lies to port all day long, a black hulk barely visible through the haze, with glimpses of palm trees and beaches down below. All of the Marines have been this way before and so they can pick out the Cordillera Central up north, and later the Zambales Mountains, which eventually plunge down to meet the sea near Subic Bay. Subic triggers a barrage of salty anecdotes. The ship does not put in there, but continues to swing southward around Bata'an, turning inland toward the entrance of Manila Bay. The ship reeks of shoe polish, talcum powder, and after-shave lotion; the Fourth Marines may have specialized in whoring and opium abuse, but they've always been known as the best-looking Marines in the Corps.\n\nThey pass by Corregidor. An island shaped like a bead of water on a waxed boot, it is gently rounded in the middle but steeply sloping into the water. It has a long, bony, dry tail that trails off at one end. The Marines know that the island is riddled with tunnels and bristling with terrible guns, but the only sign of these fortifications is the clusters of concrete barracks up in the hills, housing the men who serve the weapons. A tangle of antennas rises up above Topside. Their shapes are familiar to Shaftoe, because many of the same antennas rose above Station Alpha in Shanghai, and he had to take them apart and load them into the truck.\n\nThere is a giant limestone cliff descending nearly into the sea, and at the base of it is the entrance to the tunnel where all the spooks and radio men have their hideaway. Nearby is a dock, quite busy at the moment, with supplies being offloaded from civilian transports and stacked right there on the beach. This detail is noticed by all of the Marines as a positive sign of approaching war. Augusta drops anchor in the cove, and all of that tarp-wrapped radio stuff is unloaded into launches and taken to that dock, along with all of the odd pencil-necked Navy men who tended that gear in Shanghai.\n\nThe swell dies as they pass Corregidor and enter the bay. Greenish-brown algae floats in swirls and curlicues near the surface. Navy ships lay brown ropes of smoke across the still sea. Undisturbed by wind, these unfold into rugged shapes like translucent mountain ranges. They pass the big military base at Cavite--a sheet of land so low and flat that its boundary with the water would be invisible except for the picket line of palm trees. A few hangars and water towers rise from it, and low dark clusters of barracks farther inland. Manila is dead ahead of them, still veiled in haze. It is getting on toward evening.\n\nThen the haze dissolves, the atmosphere suddenly becomes as limpid as a child's eyes, and for about an hour they can see to infinity. They are steaming into an arena of immense thunderheads with lightning corkscrewing down through them all around. Flat grey clouds like shards of broken slate peek out between anvils. Behind them are higher clouds vaulting halfway to the moon, glowing pink and salmon in the light of the setting sun. Behind that, more clouds nestled within banks of humidity like Christmas ornaments wrapped in tissue paper, expanses of blue sky, more thunderheads exchanging bolts of lightning twenty miles long. Skies nested within skies nested within skies.\n\nIt was cold up there in Shanghai, and it's gotten warmer every day since. Some days it's even been hot and muggy. But around the time Manila heaves into view, a warm breeze springs up over the deck and all of the Marines sigh, as if they have all ejaculated in unison.\n\nManila's perfume\n\nFanned by the coconut palms\n\nThe thighs of Glory\n\nManila's spreading tile roofs have a mestizo shape about them, half-Spanish and half-Chinese. The city has a concave seawall with a flat promenade on the top. Strollers turn and wave to the Marines; some of them blow kisses. A wedding party is gushing down the steps of a church and across the boulevard to the seawall, where they are getting their pictures taken in the flattering peach-colored light of the sunset. The men are in their fancy, gauzy Filipino shirts, or in U.S. military uniforms. The women are in spectacular gowns and dresses. The Marines holler and whistle at them and the women turn towards them, hitching up their skirts slightly so that they won't trip, and wave enthusiastically. The Marines get woozy and practically fall overboard.\n\nAs their ship is easing into its dock, a crescent-shaped formation of flying fish erupts from the water. It moves away like a dune being blown across the desert. The fish are silver and leaf-shaped. Each one strikes the water with a metallic click, and the clicks merge into a crisp ripping noise. The crescent glides beneath a pier, flowing around its pilings, and disappears in the shadows underneath.\n\nManila, the Pearl of the Orient, early on a Sunday evening, the 7th of December, 1941. In Hawaii, on the other side of the Date Line, it is only just past midnight. Bobby Shaftoe and his comrades have a few hours of freedom. The city is modern, prosperous, English-speaking, and Christian, by far the wealthiest and most advanced city in Asia, practically like being back home in the States. For all its Catholicity, it has areas that seem to have been designed, from the foundation-stones upwards, to the specifications of horny sailors. You get to those parts of town by turning right once your feet are on dry land.\n\nBobby Shaftoe turns left, politely excuses himself past a legion of excited prostitutes, and sets his course on the looming walls of Intramuros. He stops only to buy a sheaf of roses from a vendor in the park, who is doing land-office business. The park and the walls above it are crowded with strolling lovers, the men mostly in uniforms and the women in demure but stunning dresses, twirling parasols on their shoulders.\n\nA couple of fellows driving horse-drawn taxis want to do business with Bobby Shaftoe but he turns them down. A taxi will only get him there faster, and he is too nervous to get there fast. He walks through a gate in the wall and into the old Spanish city.\n\nIntramuros is a maze of buff-colored stone walls rising abruptly from narrow streets. The first-floor windows along the sidewalks are guarded by black ironwork cages. The bars swell, swirl, and sprout finedly hammered leaves. The second stories hang out overhead, sporting gas lights that are just now being lit by servants with long, smoking poles. The sound of laughter and music drifts out of the windows above, and when he passes by the archways that open into the inner courtyards, he can smell flowers back in the gardens.\n\nDamned if he can tell these places apart. He remembers the street name of Magallanes, because Glory told him once it was the same thing as ``Magellan.'' And he remembers the view of the cathedral from the Pascuals' window. He wanders around a block a couple of times, certain that he is close. Then he hears an exaltation of girlish laughter coming from a second-story window, and moves toward it like a jellyfish sucked into an intake pipe. It all comes together. This is the place. The girls are all gossiping, in English, about one of their instructors. He does not hear Glory's voice but he thinks he hears her laughter.\n\n``Glory!'' he says. Then he says it louder. If they hear him, they pay him no mind. Finally he winds up and flings the bouquet of roses like a potato-masher grenade over the wooden railing, through a narrow gap between the mother-of-pearl shutters, and into the room.\n\nMiraculous silence from within the room, and then gales of laughter. The nacre shutters part with slow, agonizing coyness. A girl of nineteen steps out onto the balcony. She is dressed in the uniform of a nursing student. It is as white as starlight shining on the North Pole. She has let her long black hair down to brush it, and it stirs languidly in the evening breeze. The last ruddy light of the sunset makes her face glow like a coal. She hides behind the bouquet for a moment, buries her nose in it, inhales deeply, peeking out at him over the blossoms with her black eyes. Then she lowers the bouquet gradually to reveal her high cheeks, her perfect little nose, the fantastic sculpture of her lips, and teeth, white but fetchingly crooked, barely visible. She is smiling.\n\n``Jesus H. Christ,'' Bobby Shaftoe says, ``your cheekbones are like a fucking snowplow.''\n\nShe puts her finger to her lips. The gesture of anything touching Glory's lips puts an invisible spear through Shaftoe's chest. She eyes him for a while, establishing, in her own mind, that she has the boy's attention and that he is not going anywhere. Then she turns her back on him. The light grazes her buttocks, showing nothing but suggesting cleavage. She goes back inside and the shutter glides shut behind her.\n\nSuddenly the room full of girls becomes quiet, except for occasional ripples of suppressed laughter. Shaftoe bites his tongue. They are screwing it all up. Mr. or Mrs. Pascual will notice their silence and become suspicious.\n\nIronwork clangs and a big gate swings open. The porter beckons him inside. Shaftoe follows the old fellow down the black, arched tunnel of the porte-cochere. The hard soles of his shiny black shoes skid on the cobblestones. A horse back in the stable whinnies at the smell of his aftershave. Sleepy American music, slow-dance stuff from the Armed Forces station, spills tinnily from a radio in the porter's nook.\n\nFlowering vines grow up the stone walls of the courtyard. It is a tidy, quiet, enclosed world, almost like being indoors. The porter waves him in the direction of one of the stairways that lead up to the second floor. Glory calls it the entresuelo and says that it's really a floor between the floors, but it looks like a full-fledged, regular floor to Bobby Shaftoe. He mounts the steps and looks up to see Mr. Pascual standing there, a tiny bald man with glasses and a trim little mustache. He is wearing a short-sleeved shirt, American style, and khaki trousers, and slippers, and is holding a glass of San Miguel in one hand and a cigarette in the other. ``Private Shaftoe! Welcome back,'' he says.\n\nSo. Glory has decided to play this one by the book. The Pascuals have been alerted. A few hours of socializing now stand between Bobby Shaftoe and his girl. But a Marine is never fazed by such setbacks.\n\n``Begging your pardon, Mr. Pascual, but I am a corporal now.''\n\nMr. Pascual puts his cigarette in his mouth and shakes Corporal Shaftoe's hand. ``Well, congratulations! I just saw your uncle Jack last week. I don't think he had any idea you were on your way back.''\n\n``It was a surprise to everyone, sir,'' Bobby Shaftoe says.\n\nNow they are on a raised walkway that runs around the courtyard. Only livestock and servants live at ground level. Mr. Pascual leads them around to a door that takes them into the entresuelo. The walls here are rough stone, the ceilings are simple painted planks. They pass through a dark, somber office where Mr. Pascual's father and grandfather used to receive the managers of the family's haciendas and plantations. For a moment, Bobby Shaftoe gets his hopes up. This level has a few rooms that back in the old days were apartments for high-ranking servants, bachelor uncles, and spinster aunts. Now that the hacienda business ain't what it used to be, the Pascuals are renting them out to female students. Perhaps Mr. Pascual is leading him directly to Glory.\n\nBut this goes the way of all foolish, horny illusions as Shaftoe finds himself at the foot of a vast staircase of polished nara wood. He can see pressed-tin ceiling up there, chandeliers, and the imposing superstructure of Mrs. Pascual, contained within a mighty bodice that looks like something dreamed up by naval engineers. They ascend the stairs into the antesala, which according to Glory is strictly for casual, drop-in visitors but is fancier than any room Bobby Shaftoe has ever seen. There are big vases and pots all over the place, supposedly old, and supposedly from Japan and China. A fresh breeze runs through; he looks out a window and sees, neatly framed in it, the green dome of the cathedral with its Celtic cross on top, just as he remembered it. Mrs. Pascual holds out her hand and Shaftoe clasps it. ``Mrs. Pascual,'' he says, ``thank you for welcoming me into your home.''\n\n``Please sit down,'' she says, ``we want to hear everything.''\n\nShaftoe sits in a fancy chair next to the piano, adjust his trousers a bit so that they will not cramp his erect penis, checks his shave. It probably has a few good hours left. A wing of airplanes drones overhead. Mrs. Pascual is giving instructions to the maid in Tagalog. Shaftoe examines the crusted lacerations on his knuckles and wonders whether Mrs. Pascual has the slightest idea of what she would be in for if he really told her everything. Perhaps a little anecdote about hand-to-hand combat with Chinese river pirates on the banks of the Yangtze would break the ice. Through a door and down the hall, he can see a corner of the family chapel, all Gothic arches, a gilded altar, and in front of it an embroidered kneeler worn threadbare by the patellas of Mrs. Pascual.\n\nCigarettes are brought round, stacked in a large lacquer box like artillery shells in a crate. They drink tea and exchange small talk for what seems like about thirty-six hours. Mrs. Pascual wants to be reassured, over and over again, that everything is fine and that there will not be a war. Mr. Pascual obviously believes that war is just around the corner, and mostly broods. Business has been good lately. He and Jack Shaftoe, Bobby's uncle, have been shipping a lot of stuff between here and Singapore. But business will get a lot worse soon, he thinks.\n\nGlory appears. She has changed out of her student's uniform and into a dress. Bobby Shaftoe nearly topples backward out of the window. Mrs. Pascual formally reintroduces them. Bobby Shaftoe kisses Glory's hand in what he thinks is more than likely a very gallant gesture. He's glad he did, because Glory is palming a tiny wadded-up note which ends up in his hand.\n\nGlory takes a seat and is duly issued her own teacup. Another eternity of small talk. Mr. Pascual asks him for the eighty-seventh time whether he has touched base with Uncle Jack yet, and Shaftoe reiterates that he literally just stepped off the boat and will certainly see Uncle Jack tomorrow morning. He excuses himself to the bathroom, which is an old-fashioned two-holer mounted above deep shafts that must descend all the way to hell. He unwads and reads Glory's note, memorizes the instructions, tears it up and sprinkles it down the hole.\n\nMrs. Pascual allows the two young lovers a full half hour of ``private'' time together, meaning that the Pascuals leave the room and only come back every five minutes or so to check up on them. There is a painfully elaborate and lengthy good-bye ceremony which ends in Shaftoe returning to the street and Glory waving to him from her balcony.\n\nHalf an hour later, they are doing tongue judo in the back of a horse-drawn taxi galloping over the cobblestones toward the nightclubs of Malate. The extraction of Glory from the Pascual residence was a simple matter for a highly motivated China Marine and a squadron of saucy nursing students.\n\nBut Glory must be kissing him with her eyes open because all of a sudden she wriggles loose and says to the taxi driver, ``Stop! Please stop, sir!''\n\n``What is it?'' Shaftoe says blurrily. He looks around and sees nothing but a great big old stone church looming up above them. This brings a preliminary stab of fear. But the church is dark, there's no Filipinas in long dresses, no Marines in dress uniforms, it can't be his wedding.\n\n``I want to show you something,'' Glory says, and clambers down out of the taxi. Shaftoe has to pursue her into the place--the Church of San Augustin. He's gone by this pile many times but he never reckoned he would come inside--on a date.\n\nShe stands at the bottom of a huge staircase and says, ``See?''\n\nShaftoe looks up into darkness, thinks there might be a stained-glass window or two up there, maybe a Laceration of Christ or an Impalement of the Blessed Thorax, but--\n\n``Look down,'' Glory says, and taps one miniature foot against the first tread of the staircase. It is a single great big huge slab of granite.\n\n``Looks like ten or twenty tons of rock there I'd estimate,'' he says authoritatively.\n\n``It came from Mexico.''\n\n``Ah, go on!''\n\nGlory smiles at him. ``Carry me up the stairs.'' And in case Shaftoe's thinking of refusing, she sort of falls into him, and he has no choice but to catch her up in his arms. She traps his nape in the crook of her arm, the better to pull her face close to his, but what he remembers is how the silk of her sleeve feels against the freshly shaved skin of his neck. He begins the ascent. Glory doesn't weigh much, but after four steps he has broken a fine sweat. She is watching him, from four inches away, for signs of fatigue, and he feels himself blushing. Good thing that the whole staircase is lit up by about two candles. There's a lovely bust of a thorn-crowned Jesus with long parallel blood-drops running down his face, and on the right--\n\n``These giant stones you are walking on were quarried in Mexico, centuries and centuries ago, before America was even a country. They were brought over in the bottoms of the Manila Galleons, as ballast.'' She pronounces it bayast.\n\n``I'll be damned.''\n\n``When those galleons arrived, the stones were brought out of their bellies, one by one, and taken here to the Church of San Agustin, and piled up. Each stone on top of the last year's stone. Until finally after many, many years this staircase was finished.''\n\nAfter a while it seems to Shaftoe as though it's going to take at least that many years to reach the top of the damn thing. The summit is adorned with a life-sized Jesus carrying a cross that appears to be at least as heavy as one of those stair-treads. So who's he to complain? Then Glory says, ``Now carry me down, so you will remember the story.''\n\n``You think I'm some horny jarhead who won't remember a story unless it's got a pretty girl in it?''\n\n``Yes,'' Glory says, and laughs in his face. He carries her down to the bottom again. Then, before she goes off on some other tangent, he carries her straight out the door and into the taxi.\n\nBobby Shaftoe is not one to lose his cool in the heat of action, but the rest of the evening is a blurry fever dream to him. Only a few impressions penetrate the haze: alighting from the taxi in front of a waterfront hotel; all of the other boys gaping at Glory; Bobby Shaftoe glaring at them, threatening to teach them some manners. Slow dancing with Glory in the ballroom, Glory's silk-clad thigh gradually slipping between his legs, her firm body pressing harder and harder against his. Strolling along the seawall, hand in hand beneath the starlight. Noticing that the tide is out. Exchanging a look. Carrying her down from the seawall to the thin strip of rocky beach beneath it.\n\nBy the time he is actually fucking her, he has more or less lost consciousness, he is off in some fantastic, libidinal dream. He and Glory fuck without the slightest hesitation, without any doubts, without any troublesome thinking whatsoever. Their bodies have spontaneously merged, like a pair of drops running together on a windowpane. If he is thinking anything at all, it is that his entire life has culminated in this moment. His upbringing in Oconomowoc, high school prom night, deer hunting in the Upper Peninsula, Parris Island boot camp, all of the brawls and struggles in China, his duel with Sergeant Frick, they are wood behind the point of a spear.\n\nSirens are blowing somewhere. He startles back to awareness. Has he been here all night long, holding Glory up against the seawall, her thighs wrapped around his waist? That would not be possible. The tide hasn't come in at all.\n\n``What is it?'' she says. Her hands are clasped around the back of his neck. She lets go and runs them down his chest.\n\nStill holding her up, his hands making a sling under her warm and flawless ass, Shaftoe backs away from the seawall and turns around on the beach, looking at the sky. He sees searchlights beginning to come on. And it ain't no Hollywood premiere.\n\n``It's war, baby,'' he says.\n\n\n\nFORAYS\n\nThe lobby of the manila hotel is about the size of a football field. It smells like last year's perfume, rare tropical orchids, and bug spray. There is a metal detector set up at the front door, because the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe happens to be staying here for a couple of days. Big Africans in good suits stand around the place in clusters of two and three. Mini-throngs of Nipponese tourists, in their Bermuda shorts, sandals and white socks, have lodged themselves in the deep, thick, wide sofas and sit quietly, waiting for a prearranged signal. Upper-class Filipino children brandish cylindrical potato chip canisters like tribal chieftains carrying ceremonial maces. A dignified old bellman carrying a hand-pumped tank circulates around the defensive perimeter and silently sprays insecticide against the baseboard. Enter Randall Lawrence Waterhouse, in a turquoise polo shirt embroidered with the logo of one of the bankrupt high-tech companies that he and Avi have founded, and relaxed-fit blue jeans held up with suspenders, and bulky athletic shoes that once were white.\n\nAs soon as he got through the formalities at the airport, he perceived that the Philippines are, like Mexico, one of those countries where Shoes Matter. He approaches the registration counter quickly so that the ravishing young woman in the navy-blue uniform will not see his feet. A couple of bellhops are engaged in a pathetic, Sisyphean contest with his bag, which has roughly the dimensions and mass of a two-drawer filing cabinet. ``You will not be able to find technical books there,'' Avi told him, ``bring anything you might conceivably need.''\n\nRandy's suite is a bedroom and living room, both with fourteen-foot ceilings, and a corridor along one side containing several closets and various plumbing-related technologies. The entire thing is lined in some kind of tropical hardwood stained to a lovely glowing auburn, which would be dismal in the northern latitudes but, here, gives it a cozy and cool feeling. The two main rooms each have huge windows with tiny signs by the latch handles warning of tropical insects. Each room is defended from its windows by a multilayered system of interlocking barriers: incredibly massive wooden shutters that rumble back and forth on tracks, like freight trains maneuvering in a switching yard; a second layer of shutters consisting of two-inch squares of nacre held in a polished wooden grid, sliding on its own set of tracks; window sheers, and finally, heavy-gauge blackout curtains, each suspended from its own set of clanging industrial rails.\n\nHe orders up a large pot of coffee, which barely keeps him awake long enough to unpack. It is late afternoon. Purple clouds tumble out of the surrounding mountains with the palpable momentum of volcanic mudflows and turn half of the sky into a blank wall striped with vertical bolts of lightning; the walls of the hotel room flash with it as though paparazzi are working outside the window. Below, food vendors in Rizal Park run up and down the sidewalks to get out of the rain, which falls, as it has been doing for about half a millennium, on the sloping black walls of Intramuros. If those walls did not run in straight lines they could be mistaken for a natural freak of geology: ridges of bare, dark volcanic rock erupting from the grass like teeth from gums. The walls have dovetail-shaped notches that converge to old gun emplacements, providing interlocking fields of fire across a dry moat.\n\nLiving in the States, you never see anything older than about two and a half centuries, and you have to visit the eastern fringe of the country to see that. The business traveler's world of airports and taxicabs looks the same everywhere. Randy never really believes he's in a different country until he sees something like Intramuros, and then he has to stand there like an idiot for a long time, ruminating.\n\nRight now, across the Pacific Ocean, in a small, tasteful Victorian town located a third of the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles, computers are seizing up, crucial files are disappearing, and e-mail is careening into intergalactic space, because Randy Waterhouse is not there to keep an eye on things. The town in question sports three small colleges: one founded by the State of California and two founded by Protestant denominations that are now actively reviled by the majority of their faculty. Taken together these colleges--the Three Siblings--comprise an academic center of middling importance. Their computer systems are linked into one. They exchange teachers and students. From time to time they host academic conferences. This part of California has beaches, mountains, redwood forests, vineyards, golf courses, and sprawling penal facilities all over the place. There are plenty of three- and four-star hotel rooms, and the Three Siblings, taken together, have enough auditoria and meeting rooms to host a conference of several thousand.\n\nAvi's telephone call, some eighty hours ago, arrived in the middle of a major interdisciplinary conference called ``The Intermediate Phase (1939\u203a45) of the Global Hegemony Struggle of the Twentieth Century (Common Era).'' This is a bit of a mouthful and so it has been given a pithy nickname: ``War as Text.''\n\nPeople are coming from places like Amsterdam and Milan. The conference's organizing committee--which includes Randy's girlfriend, Charlene, who actually gives every indication of being his ex-girlfriend now--hired an artist in San Francisco to come up with a poster. He started with a black-and-white halftone photo of a haggard World War Two infantryman with a cigarette dangling from his lower lip. He worked this image over using a photocopier, blowing the halftone dots up into rough lumps, like rubber balls chewed by a dog, and wreaking any number of other distortions on it until it had an amazingly stark, striking, jagged appearance; the soldier's pale eyes turned an eerie white. Then he added a few elements in color: red lipstick, blue eyeshadow, and a trace of a red brassiere strap peeking out from the soldier's unbuttoned uniform shirt.\n\nThe poster won some kind of an award almost the moment it came out. This led to a press release, which in turn led to the poster's being enshrined by the news media as an Official Object of Controversy. An enterprising journalist managed to track down the soldier depicted in the original photograph--a decorated combat veteran and retired tool-and-die maker who, as it happened, was not merely alive but in excellent health, and, since the death of his wife from breast cancer, had spent his retirement roaming around the Deep South in his pickup truck, helping to rebuild black churches that had been torched by drunken yahoos.\n\nThe artist who had designed the poster then confessed that he had simply copied it from a book and had made no effort whatsoever to obtain permission--the entire concept of getting permission to use other people's work was faulty, since all art was derivative of other art. High-powered trial lawyers converged, like dive bombers, on the small town in Kentucky where the aggrieved veteran was up on the roof of a black church with a mouthful of nails, hammering down slabs of A/D exterior plywood and mumbling ``no comment'' to a horde of reporters down on the lawn. After a series of conferences in a room at the town's Holiday Inn, the veteran emerged, accompanied by one of the five most famous lawyers on the face of the planet, and announced that he was filing a civil suit against the Three Siblings that would, if it succeeded, turn them and their entire community into a flat, smoking abrasion in the earth's crust. He promised to split the proceeds between the black churches and various disabled veterans' and breast cancer research groups.\n\nThe organizing committee pulled the poster from circulation, which caused thousands of bootleg copies to go up on the World Wide Web and, in general, brought it to the attention of millions who never would have seen it otherwise. They also filed suit against the artist, whose net worth could be tallied up on the back of a ticket stub: he had assets of about a thousand dollars and debts (mostly student loans) amounting to sixty-five thousand.\n\nAll of this happened before the conference even began. Randy was aware of it only because Charlene had roped him into providing computer support for the conference, which meant setting up a Web site and e-mail access for the attendees. When all of this hit the news, e-mail began to flood in, and quickly jammed up all of the lines and filled up all of the disk capacity that Randy had spent the last month setting up.\n\nConferees began to arrive. A lot of them seemed to be sleeping in the house where Randy and Charlene had been living together for seven years. It was a big old Victorian house and there was plenty of room. They stumbled in from Heidelberg and Paris and Berkeley and Boston, then sat around Randy and Charlene's kitchen table drinking coffee and talking at great length about the Spectacle. Randy inferred that the Spectacle meant the poster furor, but as they went on and on about it, he sensed that they were using the word not in a conventional sense but as part of some academic jargon; that it carried a heavy load of shadings and connotations to them, none of which Randy would ever understand unless he became one of them.\n\nTo Charlene, and to all of the people attending War as Text, it was self-evident that the veteran who filed the lawsuit was the very worst kind of human being--just the sort they had gathered together to debunk, burn in effigy, and sweep into the ash-bin of posthistorical discourse. Randy had spent a lot of time around these people, and thought he'd gotten used to them, but during those days he had a headache all the time, from clenching his teeth, and he kept jumping to his feet in the middle of meals or conversations and going out for solitary walks. This was partly to keep himself from saying something undiplomatic, and partly as a childish but fruitless tactic to get the attention he craved from Charlene.\n\nHe knew the whole poster saga was going to be a disaster from early on. He kept warning Charlene and the others. They listened coolly, clinically, as if Randy were a test subject on the wrong side of a one-way mirror.\n\n\n\nRandy forces himself to stay awake long enough for it to get dark. Then he lies in bed for a few hours trying to sleep. The container port is just north of the hotel, and all night long, Rizal Boulevard, along the base of the old Spanish wall, is jammed from one end to the other with container-carrying semis. The whole city is a cauldron of internal combustion. Manila seems to have more pistons and exhaust pipes than the rest of the world combined. Even at two in the morning the hotel's seemingly unshakable mass hums and rattles from the seismic energy pouring from all of those motors. The noise detonates car alarms down in the hotel's lot. The noise of one alarm triggers others, and so on. It is not the noise that keeps Randy awake so much as the insane stupidity of this chain reaction. It is an object lesson: the kind of nightmarish, snowballing technological fuck-up that keeps hackers awake at night even when they can't hear the results.\n\nHe paws open a Heineken from his minibar and stands in front of the window, looking. Many of the trucks are adorned with brilliant displays of multicolored lights--not quite as flashy as those of the few jeepneys that scurry and jostle among them. Seeing so many people awake and working puts sleep out of the question.\n\nHe is too jet-lagged to accomplish anything that requires actual thought--but there is one important job he can do, which requires no thinking whatsoever. He starts up his laptop again. Seeming to levitate in the center of his dark room, the screen is a perfect rectangle of light the color of diluted milk, of a Nordic dawn. This light originates in small fluorescent tubes imprisoned in the polycarbonate coffin of his computer's display. It can only escape through a pane of glass, facing Randy, which is entirely covered by small transistors arranged in a grid, which let photons through, or don't, or let through only those of a particular wavelength, cracking the pale light into colors. By turning those transistors on and off according to some systematic plan, meaning is conveyed to Randy Waterhouse. A good filmmaker could convey a whole story to Randy by seizing control of those transistors for a couple of hours.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot more laptop computers floating around than there are filmmakers worth paying attention to. The transistors are almost never put into the hands of human beings. They are controlled, instead, by software. Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't. It's hard enough to find human beings who are interesting.\n\nThe pyramid and the eyeball appear. Randy spends so much time using Ordo now that he has his machine boot it up automatically.\n\nNowadays the laptop has only one function for Randy: he uses it to communicate with other people, through e-mail. When he communicates with Avi, he has to use Ordo, which is a tool for taking his ideas and converting them into streams of bits that are almost indistinguishable from white noise, so that they can be sent to Avi in privacy. In exchange, it receives noise from Avi and converts it into Avi's thoughts. At the moment, Epiphyte has no assets other than information--it is an idea, with some facts and data to back it up. This makes it eminently stealable. So encryption is definitely a good idea. The question is: how much paranoia is really appropriate?\n\nAvi sent him encrypted e-mail:\n\nWhen you get to Manila I would like you to generate a 4096-bit key pair and keep it on a floppy disk that you carry on your person at all times. Do not keep it on your hard disk. Anyone could break into your hotel room while you're out and steal that key.\n\nNow, Randy pulls down a menu and picks an item labeled: ``New key. . . . ''\n\nA box pops up giving him several KEY LENGTH options: 768 bits, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, or Custom. Randy picks the latter option and then, wearily, types in 4096.\n\nEven a 768-bit key requires vast resources to break. Add one bit, to make it 769 bits long, and it becomes twice as difficult. A 770-bit key is twice as difficult yet, and so on. By using 768-bit keys, Randy and Avi could keep their communications secret from nearly every entity in the world for at least the next several years. A 1024-bit key would be vastly, astronomically more difficult to break.\n\nSome people go so far as to use keys 2048 or even 3072 bits in length. These will stop the very best codebreakers on the face of the earth for astronomical periods of time, barring the invention of otherworldly technologies such as quantum computers. Most encryption software--even stuff written by extremely security-conscious cryptography experts--can't even handle keys larger than that. But Avi insists on using Ordo, generally considered the best encryption software in the world, because it can handle keys of unlimited length--as long as you don't mind waiting for it to crunch all the numbers.\n\nRandy begins typing. He is not bothering to look at the screen; he is staring out the window at the lights on the trucks and the jeepneys. He is only using one hand, just flailing away loosely at the keyboard.\n\nInside Randy's computer is a precise clock. Whenever he strikes a key, Ordo uses that clock to record the current time, down to microseconds. He hits a key at 03:05:56.935788 and he hits another one at 03:05:57.290664, or about .354876 seconds later. Another .372307 seconds later, he hits another one. Ordo keeps track of all of these intervals and discards the more significant digits (in this example the .35 and the .37) because these parts will tend to be similar from one event to the next.\n\nOrdo wants randomness. It only wants the least significant digits--say, the 76 and the 07 at the very ends of these numbers. It wants a whole lot of random numbers, and it wants them to be very, very random. It is taking somewhat random numbers and feeding them through hash functions that make them even more random. It is running statistical routines on the results to make sure that they contain no hidden patterns. It has breathtakingly high standards for randomness, and it will not stop asking Randy to whack on the keyboard until those standards are met.\n\nThe longer the key you are trying to generate, the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi, in an encrypted e-mail message, that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer, and this computer was put to work trying to break a 4096-bit encryption key, it would take longer than the lifespan of the universe.\n\n``Using today's technology,'' Avi shot back, ``that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large prime numbers?''\n\n``How long do you want these messages to remain secret?'' Randy asked, in his last message before leaving San Francisco. ``Five years? Ten years? Twenty-five years?''\n\nAfter he got to the hotel this afternoon, Randy decrypted and read Avi's answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes, like the afterimage of a strobe:\n\nI want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.\n\nThe computer finally beeps. Randy rests his tired hand. Ordo politely warns him that it may be busy for a while, and then goes to work. It is searching the cosmos of pure numbers, looking for two big primes that can be multiplied by each other to produce a number 4096 bits long.\n\nIf you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large prime numbers.\n\nSo the length of the key that you use is, in and of itself, a code of sorts. A knowledgeable government eavesdropper, noting Randy's and Avi's use of a 4096-bit key, will conclude one of the following:\n\n--Avi doesn't know what he's talking about. This can be ruled out with a bit of research into his past accomplishments. Or,\n\n--Avi is clinically paranoid. This can also be ruled out with some research. Or,\n\n--Avi is extremely optimistic about the future development of computer technology, or pessimistic about the political climate, or both. Or,\n\n--Avi has a planning horizon that extends over a period of at least a century.\n\nRandy paces around his room while his computer soars through number space. The shipping containers on the backs of those trucks bear exactly the same logos as the ones that used to fill the streets of South Seattle when a ship was unloading. To Randy this is oddly satisfying, as if, by making this crazy lunge across the Pacific, he has brought some kind of antipodal symmetry to his life. He has gone from the place where things are consumed to where they are produced, from a land where onanism has been enshrined at the highest levels of the society to one where cars have ``NO to contraception!'' stickers in their windows. It feels bizarrely right. He has not felt this way since Avi and he founded their first doomed business venture twelve years ago.\n\n\n\nRandy grew up in a college town in eastern Washington State, graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, and landed a Clerk Typist II job at the library there--specifically the Interlibrary Loan Department--where his job was to process incoming loan requests mailed in from smaller libraries all over the region and, conversely, to mail out requests to other libraries. If nine-year-old Randy Waterhouse had been able to look into the future and see himself in this career, he would have been delighted beyond measure: the primary tool of the Interlibrary Loan Department was the Staple Remover. Young Randy had seen one of these devices in the hands of his fourth-grade teacher and been enthralled by its cunning and deadly appearance, so like the jaws of some futuristic robot dragon. He had, in fact, gone out of his way to staple things incorrectly just so he could prevail on his teacher to unstaple them, giving him another glimpse of the blood-chilling mandibles in action. He had gone so far as to steal a staple remover from an untended desk at church and then incorporate it into an Erector-set robot hunter-killer device with which he terrorized much of the neighborhood; its pit-viper yawn separated many a cheap plastic toy from its parts and accessories before the theft was discovered and Randy made an example of before God and man. Now, in the Interlibrary Loan office, Randy had not just one but several staple removers in his desk drawer and was actually obligated to use them for an hour or two a day.\n\nSince the UW library was well-endowed, its patrons didn't request books from other libraries unless they had been stolen from their own or were, in some way, peculiar. The ILL office (as Randy and his coworkers affectionately called it) had its regulars--people who had a whole lot of peculiar books on their wish lists. These people tended to be either tedious or scary or both. Randy always ended up dealing with the ``both'' subgroup, because Randy was the only Clerk Typist in the office who was not a lifer. It seemed clear that Randy, with his astronomy degree and his extensive knowledge of computers, would one day move on, whereas his coworkers did not harbor further ambitions. His larger sphere of interests, his somewhat broader concept of normalcy, was useful when certain patrons came into the office.\n\nBy the standards of many, Randy was himself a tedious, scary, obsessed character. He was not merely obsessed with science but also with fantasy role-playing games. The only way he could tolerate working at such a stupid job for a couple of years was that his off time was completely occupied with enacting fantasy scenarios of a depth and complexity that exercised all of the cranial circuitry that was so conspicuously going to waste in the ILL office. He was part of a group that would meet every Friday night and play until sometime on Sunday. The other stalwarts in the group were a computer science/music double major named Chester, and a history grad student named Avi.\n\nWhen a new master's degree candidate named Andrew Loeb walked into the ILL office one day, with a certain glint in his eye, and produced a three-inch-thick stack of precisely typed request forms from his shitty old knapsack, he was recognized immediately as being of a particular type, and shunted in the direction of Randy Waterhouse. It was an instant meeting of minds, though Randy did not fully realize this until the books that Loeb had requested began to arrive on the trolley from the mail room.\n\nAndy Loeb's project was to figure out the energy budgets of the local Indian tribes. A human body has to expend a certain amount of energy just to keep breathing and to maintain its body temperature. This figure goes up when it gets cold or when the body in question is doing work. The only way to obtain that energy is by eating food. Some foods have a higher energy content than others. For example, trout is highly nutritious but so low in fat and carbohydrates that you can starve to death eating it three times a day. Other foods might have lots of energy, but might require so much work to obtain and prepare that eating them would be a losing proposition, BTU-wise. Andy Loeb was trying to figure out what foods had historically been eaten by certain Northwest Indian tribes, how much energy they expended to get these foods and how much they obtained by eating them. He wanted to do this calculation for coastal Indians like the Salish (who had easy access to seafood) and for inland ones like the Cayuse (who didn't) as part of an extremely convoluted plan to prove some sort of point about the relative standards of living of these tribes and how this affected their cultural development (coastal tribes made lots of fantastically detailed art and inland ones occasionally scratched stick figures on rocks).\n\nTo Andrew Loeb it was an exercise in meta-historical scholarship. To Randy Waterhouse, it sounded like the beginnings of a pretty cool game. Strangle a muskrat and you get 136 Energy Points. Lose the muskrat and your core temp drops another degree.\n\nAndy was nothing if not methodical and so he had simply looked up every book that had ever been written on such topics, and every book mentioned in those books' bibliographies, yea, even unto four or five generations; checked out all of them that were available locally; and ordered the rest from ILL. All of the latter passed across Randy's desk. Randy read some and skimmed all. He got to learn about how much blubber the Arctic explorers had to eat in order to keep from starving to death. He perused detailed specifications for Army C-rations. After a while, he actually began sneaking into the photocopy room and making copies of key data.\n\nIn order to run a realistic fantasy role-playing game, you had to keep track of how much food the imaginary characters were getting and how much trouble was involved in getting it. Characters passing across the Gobi desert in November of the year 5000 B.C. would have to spend more time worrying about food than, say, ones who were traveling across central Illinois in 1950.\n\nRandy was hardly the first game designer to notice this. There were a few incredibly stupid games in which you didn't have to think about food, but Randy and his friends disdained them. In all of the games that he participated in, or that he himself designed, you had to devote a realistic amount of effort to getting food for your character. But it was not easy to determine what was realistic. Like most designers, Randy got over the problem by slapping together a few rudimentary equations that he basically just pulled out of thin air. But in the books, articles, and dissertations that Andrew Loeb was borrowing through ILL, he found exactly the raw data that a mathematically inclined person would need to come up with a sophisticated rules system based on scientific fact.\n\nStimulating all of the physical processes going on in each character's body was out of the question, especially in a game where you might be dealing with armies of a hundred thousand men. Even a crude simulation, tracking only a few variables and using simple equations, would involve a nightmarish amount of paperwork if you did it all by hand. But all of this was happening in the mid-1980s, when personal computers had become cheap and ubiquitous. A computer could automatically track a large database and tell you whether each character was well-fed or starving. There was no reason not to do it on a computer.\n\nUnless, like Randy Waterhouse, you had such a shitty job that you couldn't afford a computer.\n\nOf course, there's a way to dodge any problem. The university had lots of computers. If Randy could get an account on one of them, he could write his program there and run it for free.\n\nUnfortunately, accounts were only available to students or faculty members, and Randy was neither.\n\nFortunately, he started dating a grad student named Charlene at just about this time.\n\nHow the hell did a generally keg-shaped guy, a hard scientist, working a dead-end Clerk Typist job, and spending all his spare time in the consummately nerdy pastime of fantasy role-playing games, end up in a relationship with a slender and not unattractive young liberal arts student who spent her spare time sea kayaking and going to foreign films? It must have been one of those opposites-attract kind of deals, a complementary relationship. They met, naturally, in the ILL office, where the highly intelligent but steady and soothing Randy helped the highly intelligent but scattered and flighty Charlene organize a messy heap of loan requests. He should have asked her out then and there, but he was shy. Second and third opportunities came along when the books she'd requested began to filter up from the mailroom, and finally he asked her out and they went to see a film together. Both of them turned out to be not just willing but eager, and possibly even desperate. Before they knew it, Randy had given Charlene a key to his apartment, and Charlene had given Randy the password to her free university computer account, and everything was just delightful.\n\nThe university computer system was better than no computer at all. But Randy was humiliated. Like every other high-powered academic computing network, this one was based on an industrial-strength operating system called UNIX, which had a learning curve like the Matterhorn, and lacked the cuddly and stylish features of the personal computers then coming into vogue. Randy had used it quite a bit as an undergraduate and knew his way around. Even so, learning how to write good code on the thing required a lot of time. His life had changed when Charlene had come along, and now it changed more: he dropped out of the fantasy role-playing game circuit altogether, stopped going to meetings of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and began to spend all of his free time either with Charlene or in front of a computer terminal. All in all, this was probably a change for the better. With Charlene, he did things he wouldn't have done otherwise, like getting exercise, or going to see live music. And at the computer, he was learning new skills, and he was creating something. It might be something completely useless, but at least he was creating.\n\nHe spent a lot of time talking to Andrew Loeb, who actually went out and did the stuff he was writing programs for; he'd disappear for a few days and come back all wobbly and haggard, with fish scales caught in his whiskers or dried animal blood under his fingernails. He'd ram down a couple of Big Macs, sleep for twenty-four hours, then meet Randy in a bar (Charlene wasn't comfortable with having him in the house) and talk learnedly of the difficulties of day-to-day life, aboriginal style. They argued about whether aborigines would eat the more disgusting parts of certain animals or throw them away. Andrew voted for yes. Randy disagreed--just because they were primitive didn't mean they couldn't have taste. Andrew accused him of being a romantic. Finally, to settle it, they went up into the mountains together, armed with nothing but knives and Andrew's collection of exquisitely crafted vermin snares. By the third night, Randy found himself seriously thinking about eating some insects. ``Q.E.D.,'' Andrew said.\n\nAnyway, Randy finished his software after a year and a half. It was a success; Chester and Avi liked it. Randy was moderately pleased at having built something so complicated that actually worked, but he had no illusions about its being good for anything. He was sort of embarrassed at having wasted so much time and mental energy on the project. But he knew that if he hadn't been writing code, he'd have spent the same amount of time playing games or going to Society for Creative Anachronism meetings in medieval drag, so it all zeroed out in the end. Spending the time in front of the computer was arguably better, because it had honed his programming skills, which had been pretty sharp to begin with. On the other hand, he'd done it all on the UNIX system, which was for scientists and engineers--not a savvy move in an age when all the money was in personal computers.\n\nChester and Randy had nicknamed Avi ``Avid,'' because he really, really liked fantasy games. Avi had always claimed that he played them as a way of understanding what it was really like to live in ancient times, and he was a maniac about historical authenticity. That was okay; they all had half-assed excuses, and Avi's historical acumen frequently came in handy.\n\nNot long after this, Avi graduated and disappeared, and popped up a few months later in Minneapolis, where he had gotten a job with a major publisher of fantasy role-playing games. He offered to buy Randy's game software for the astonishingly large sum of $1000 plus a small cut of future profits. Randy accepted the offer in its general outlines, asked Avi to send him a contract, then went out and found Andrew boiling some fish guts in a birchbark kettle atop a Weber grill on the roof of the apartment building where he lived. He wanted to give Andrew the good news, and to cut him in on the proceeds. What ensued was a really unpleasant conversation, standing up there in a pelting, spitting, wind-blown rain.\n\nTo begin with, Andrew took this deal far more seriously than Randy did. Randy saw it as a windfall, a lark. Andrew, who was the son of a lawyer, treated it as if it were a major corporate merger, and asked many tedious and niggling questions about the contract, which did not exist yet and which would probably cover a single piece of paper when it did. Randy didn't realize it at the time, but by asking so many questions for which Randy had no answers, Andrew was, in effect, arrogating to himself the role of Business Manager. He was implicitly forming a business partnership with Randy that did not, in fact, exist.\n\nFurthermore, Andrew didn't have the first notion of how much time and effort Randy had put into writing the code. Or (as Randy was to realize later) maybe he did. In any case, Andrew assumed from the get-go that he would share a fifty-fifty split with Randy, which was wildly out of proportion to the work he'd actually done on the project. Basically, Andrew acted as if all of the work he'd ever done on the subject of aboriginal dining habits was a part of this undertaking, and that it entitled him to an equal split.\n\nBy the time Randy extricated himself from this conversation, his mind was reeling. He had gone in with one view of reality and been radically challenged by another one that was clearly preposterous; but after an hour of Andrew's browbeating he was beginning to doubt himself. After two or three sleepless nights, he decided to call the whole thing off. A paltry few hundred dollars wasn't worth all of this agony.\n\nBut Andrew (who was, by now, represented by an associate of his father's Santa Barbara law firm) vehemently objected. He and Randy had, according to his lawyer, jointly created something that had economic value, and a failure on Randy's part to sell it at market value amounted to taking money out of Andrew's pocket. It had become an unbelievable Kafkaesque nightmare, and Randy could only withdraw to a corner table at his favorite pub, drink pints of stout (frequently in the company of Chester) and watch this fantastic psychodrama unfold. He had, he now realized, blundered into some serious domestic weirdness involving Andrew's family. It turned out that Andrew's parents were divorced and, long ago, had fought savagely over custody of him, their only child. Mom had turned into a hippie and joined a religious cult in Oregon and taken Andrew with her. It was rumored that this cult engaged in sexual abuse of children. Dad had hired private dicks to kidnap Andrew back and then showered him with material possessions to demonstrate his superior love. There had followed an interminable legal battle in which Dad had hired some rather fringey psychotherapists to hypnotize Andrew and get him to dredge up repressed memories of unspeakable and improbable horrors.\n\nThis was just the executive summary of a weird life that Randy only learned about in bits and pieces as the years went on. Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the whole thing in its entirety.\n\nAnyway Randy had blundered into this life and become enveloped in the weirdness. One of the young eager beavers in Andrew's dad's law firm decided, as a preemptive move, to obtain copies of all of Randy's computer files, which were still stored on the UW computer system. Needless to say, he went about it in a heavy-handed way, and when the university's legal department began to receive his sullen letters, it responded by informing both Andrew's lawyer, and Randy, that anyone who used the university's computer system to create a commercial product had to split the proceeds with the university. So now Randy was getting ominous letters from not one but two groups of deadly lawyers. Andrew then threatened to sue him for having made this blunder, which had halved the value of Andrew's share!\n\nIn the end, just to cut his losses and get out of it clean, Randy had to hire a lawyer of his own. The final cost to him was a hair more than five thousand dollars. The software was never sold to anyone, and indeed could not have been; it was so legally encumbered by that point that it would have been like trying to sell someone a rusty Volkswagen that had been dismantled and its parts hidden in attack dog kennels all over the world.\n\nIt was the only time in his life when he had ever thought about suicide. He did not think about it very hard, or very seriously, but he did think about it.\n\nWhen it was all over, Avi sent him a handwritten letter saying, ``I enjoyed doing business with you and look forward to continuing our relationship both as friends and, should opportunities arise, as creative partners.''\n\n\nINDIGO\n\n\n\nLawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the band are up on the deck of the Nevada one morning, playing the national anthem and watching the Stars and Stripes ratchet up the mast, when they are startled to find themselves in the midst of one hundred and ninety airplanes of unfamiliar design. Some of them are down low, traveling horizontally, and others are up high, plunging nearly straight down. The latter are going so fast that they appear to be falling apart; little bits are dropping off of them. It is terrible to see--some training exercise gone miserably awry. But they pull out of their suicidal trajectories in plenty of time. The bits that have fallen off of them plunge smoothly and purposefully, not tumbling and fluttering as chunks of debris would. They are coming down all over the place. Perversely, they all seem to be headed for the berthed ships. It is incredibly dangerous--they might hit someone! Lawrence is outraged.\n\nThere is a short-lived phenomenon taking place in one of the ships down the line. Lawrence turns to look at it. This is the first real explosion he's ever seen and so it takes him a long time to recognize it as such. He can play the very hardest glockenspiel parts with his eyes closed, and The Star Spangled Banner is much easier to ding than to sing.\n\nHis scanning eyes fasten, not on the source of the explosion, but on a couple of airplanes that are headed right toward them, skimming just above the water. Each drops a long skinny egg and then their tailplanes visibly move and they angle upwards and pass overhead. The rising sun shines directly through the glass of their canopies. Lawrence is able to look into the eyes of the pilot of one of the planes. He notes that it appears to be some sort of Asian gentleman.\n\nThis is an incredibly realistic training exercise--even down to the point of using ethnically correct pilots, and detonating fake explosives on the ships. Lawrence heartily approves. Things have just been too lax around this place.\n\nA tremendous shock comes up through the deck of the ship, making his feet and legs feel as if he had just jumped off a ten-foot precipice onto solid concrete. But he's just standing there flatfooted. It makes no sense at all.\n\nThe band have finished playing the national anthem and are looking about at the spectacle. Sirens and horns are speaking up all over the place, from the Nevada, from the Arizona in the next berth, from buildings onshore. Lawrence doesn't see any antiaircraft fire going up, doesn't see any familiar planes in the air. The explosions just keep coming. Lawrence wanders over to the rail and stares across a few yards of open water towards the Arizona.\n\nAnother one of those plunging airplanes drops a projectile that shoots straight down onto Arizona's deck but then, strangely, vanishes. Lawrence blinks and sees that it has left a neat bomb-shaped hole in the deck, just like a panicky Warner Brothers cartoon character passing at high speed through a planar structure such as a wall or ceiling. Fire jets from that hole for about a microsecond before the whole deck bulges up, disintegrating, and turns into a burgeoning globe of fire and blackness. Waterhouse is vaguely aware of a lot of stuff coming at him really fast. It is so big that he feels more like he is falling into it. He freezes up. It goes by him, over him, and through him. A terrible noise pierces his skull, a chord randomly struck, discordant but not without some kind of deranged harmony. Musical qualities aside, it is so goddamned loud that it almost kills him. He claps his hands over his ears.\n\nStill the noise is there, like red-hot knitting needles through the eardrums. Hell's Bells. He spins away from it, but it follows him. He has this big thick strap around his neck, sewn together at groin level where it supports a cup. Thrust into the cup is the central support of his glockenspiel, which stands in front of him like a lyre-shaped breastplate, huge fluffy tassels dangling gaily from the upper corners. Oddly, one of the tassels is burning. That isn't the only thing now wrong with the glockenspiel, but he can't quite make it out because his vision keeps getting obscured by something that must be wiped away every few moments. All he knows is that the glockenspiel has eaten a huge quantum of pure energy and been kicked up to some incredibly high state never before achieved by such an instrument; it is a burning, glowing, shrieking, ringing, radiating monster, a comet, an archangel, a tree of flaming magnesium, strapped to his body, standing on his groin. The energy is transmitted down its humming, buzzing central axis, through the cup, and into his genitals, which would be tumescing in other circumstances.\n\nLawrence spends some time wandering aimlessly around the deck. Eventually he has to help open a hatch for some men, and then he realizes that his hands are still clapped over his ears, and have been for a long time except for when he was wiping stuff out of his eyes. When he takes them off, the ringing has stopped, and he no longer hears airplanes. He was thinking that he wanted to go belowdecks, because the bad things are coming from the sky and he would like to get some big heavy permanent-seeming stuff between him and it, but a lot of sailors are taking the opposite view. He hears that they have been hit by one and maybe two of something that rhymes with ``torpedoes,'' and that they are trying to raise steam. Officers and noncoms, black and red with smoke and blood, keep deputizing him for different, extremely urgent tasks that he doesn't quite understand, not least because he keeps putting his hands over his ears.\n\nProbably half an hour goes by before he hits upon the idea of discarding his glockenspiel, which is, after all, just getting in the way. It was issued to him by the Navy with any number of stern warnings about the consequences of misusing it. Lawrence is conscientious about this kind of thing, dating back to when he was first given organ-playing privileges in West Point, Virginia. But at this point, for the first time in his life, as he stands there watching the Arizona burn and sink, he just says to himself: Well, to heck with it! He takes that glockenspiel out of its socket and has one last look at it, it is the last time in his life he will ever touch a glockenspiel. There is no point in saving it now anyway, he realizes; several of the bars have been bent. He flips it around and discovers that chunks of blackened, distorted metal have been impact-welded onto several of the bars. Really throwing caution to the winds now, he flings it overboard in the general direction of the Arizona, a military lyre of burnished steel that sings a thousand men to their resting places on the bottom of the harbor.\n\nAs it vanishes into a patch of burning oil, the second wave of attacking airplanes arrives. The Navy's antiaircraft guns finally open up and begin to rain shells down into the surrounding community and blow up occupied buildings. He can see human-shaped flames running around in the streets, pursued by people with blankets.\n\nThe rest of the day is spent, by Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the Navy, grappling with the fact that many two-dimensional structures on this and other ships, which were put into place to prevent various fluids from commingling (e.g. fuel and air) have holes in them, and not only that but a lot of shit is on fire too and things are more than a little smoky. Certain objects that are supposed to (a) remain horizontal and (b) support heavy things have ceased to do either.\n\nNevada's engineering section manages to raise steam in a couple of boilers and the captain tries to get the ship out of the harbor. As soon as she gets underway, she comes under concerted attack, mostly by dive bombers who are eager to sink her in the channel and block the harbor altogether. Eventually, the captain runs her aground rather than see this happen. Unfortunately, what Nevada has in common with most other naval vessels is that she is not really engineered to work from a stationary position, and consequently she is hit three more times by dive bombers. So it is a pretty exciting morning overall. As a member of the band who does not even have his instrument any more, Lawrence's duties are quite poorly defined, and he spends more time than he should watching the airplanes and the explosions. He has gone back to his earlier train of thought regarding societies and their efforts to outdo each other. It is very clear to him, as wave after wave of Nipponese dive bombers hurl themselves, with calligraphic precision, at the ship he is standing on, and as the cream of his society's navy burns and explodes and sinks, putting up virtually no resistance, that his society is going to have to rethink a thing or two.\n\n\n\nAt some point he burns his hand on something. It is his right hand, which is preferable--he is left-handed. Also, he becomes more clearly aware that a portion of Arizona has tried to take his scalp off. These are minor injuries by Pearl Harbor standards and he does not stay long in the hospital. The doctor warns him that the skin on his hand might contract and limit his fingers' range of motion. As soon as he can withstand the pain, Lawrence begins to play Bach's Art of Fugue in his lap whenever he is not otherwise occupied. Most of those tunes start out simple; you can easily picture old Johann Sebastian sitting there on the bench on a cold morning in Leipzig, one or two blockflote stops yanked out, left hand in his lap, a fat choirboy or two over in the corner heaving away on the bellows, faint gasping noises coming from all the leaks in the works, and Johann's right hand wandering aimlessly across the forbidding simplicity of the Great manual, stroking those cracked and yellowed elephant tusks, searching for some melody he hadn't already invented. That is good stuff for Lawrence right now, and so he makes his right hand go through the same motions as Johann's, even though it is a gauze-wrapped hand and he is using an upside-down dinner tray as a substitute for the keyboard, and he has to hum the music under his breath. When he really gets into it, his feet skid around and piston under the sheets, playing imaginary pedals, and his neighbors complain.\n\nHe is out of the hospital in a few days, just in time for him and the rest of Nevada's band to begin their new, wartime assignment. This was evidently something of a poser for the Navy's manpower experts. These musicians were (from a killing-Nips point of view) completely useless to begin with. As of 7 December, they no longer have even a functioning ship and most of them have lost their clarinets.\n\nStill, it isn't all about loading shells and pulling triggers. No large organization can kill Nips in any kind of systematic way without doing a nearly unbelievable amount of typing and filing. It is logical to suppose that men who can play the clarinet will not botch that kind of work any worse than anyone else. And so Waterhouse and his bandmates receive orders assigning them to what would appear to be one of the typing-and-filing branches of the Navy.\n\nThis is located in a building, not a ship. There are quite a few Navy people who sneer at the whole idea of working in a building, and Lawrence and some of the other recent recruits, eager to fit in, have gotten into the habit of copping the same attitude. But now that they have seen what happens to a ship when you detonate hundreds of pounds of high explosive on, in, and around it, Waterhouse and many others are reassessing their feelings about working in buildings. They report to their new post with high morale.\n\nTheir new commanding officer is not so cheerful, and his feelings appear to be shared by everyone in the entire section. The musicians are greeted without being welcomed and saluted without being honored. The people who have been working in this building--far from being overawed by their status as guys who not only worked on an actual ship until recently but furthermore have been very close to things that were exploding, burning, etc., and not as the result of routine lapses in judgment but because bad men deliberately made it happen--do not seem to feel that Lawrence and his bandmates deserve to be entrusted with this new work, whatever the hell it is.\n\nGlumly, almost despairingly, the commanding officer and his subordinates get the musicians squared away. Even if they don't have enough desks to go around, each man can at least have a chair at a table or counter. Some ingenuity is displayed in finding places for all the new arrivals. It is clear that these people are trying their best at what they considered to be a hopeless task.\n\nThen there is some talk about secrecy. A great deal of talk about it. They run through drills intended to test their ability to throw things away properly. This goes on for a long time and the longer it continues, without an explanation as to why, the more mysterious it becomes. The musicians, who were at first a little put out by their chilly reception, start to speculate amongst themselves as to what kind of an operation they have gotten themselves into now.\n\nFinally, one morning, the musicians are assembled in a classroom in front of the cleanest chalkboard Waterhouse has ever seen. The last few days have imbued him with just enough paranoia that he suspects it is that clean for a reason--erasing chalkboards is not to be taken lightly during wartime.\n\nThey are seated in little chairs with desks attached to them, desks designed for right-handers. Lawrence puts his notepad in his lap, then rests his bandaged right hand on the desk and begins to play a ditty from Art of Fugue, grimacing and even grunting with pain as his burned skin stretches and slides over his knuckles.\n\nSomeone chucks him on the shoulder. He opens his eyes to see that he is the only person in the room sitting down; an officer is on the deck. He stands up and his weak leg nearly buckles. When he finally gets himself fully to his feet, he sees that the officer (if he even is an officer) is out of uniform. Way out of uniform. He's wearing a bathrobe and smoking a pipe. The bathrobe is extraordinarily worn, and not in the sense of, say, a hospital or hotel bathrobe that gets laundered frequently. This thing hasn't been laundered in a long time, but boy has it seen some use. The elbows are worn out and the bottom of the right sleeve is ashy grey and slippery with graphite from being dragged back and forth, tens of thousands of times, across sheets of paper dense with number-two pencil work. The terrycloth has a dandruffy appearance, but it has nothing to do with exfoliation of the scalp; these flakes are way too big, and too geometric: rectangles and circular dots of oaktag, punched out of cards and tape respectively. The pipe went out a long time ago and the officer (or whatever he is) is not even pretending to worry about getting it relit. It is there just to give him something to bite down on, which he does as vigorously as a civil war infantryman having a leg sawed off.\n\nSome other fellow--one who actually bothered to shave, shower, and put on a uniform--introduces bathrobe man as Commander Shane-spelled-s-c-h-o-e-n, but Schoen is having none of it; he turns his back on them, exposing the back side of his bathrobe, which around the buttocks is worn transparent as a negligee. Reading from a notebook, he writes out the following in block letters:\n\n19 17 17 19 14 20 23 18 19 8 12 16 19 8 3\n\n21 8 25 18 14 18 6 3 18 8 15 18 22 18 11\n\nAround the time that the fourth or fifth number is going up on the chalkboard, Waterhouse feels the hairs standing up on the back of his neck. By the time the third group of five numbers is written out, he has not failed to notice that none of them is larger than 26--that being the number of letters in the alphabet. His heart is pounding more wildly than it did when Nipponese bombs were tracing parabolic trajectories toward the deck of the grounded Nevada. He pulls a pencil out of his pocket. Finding no paper handy, he writes down the numbers from 1 to 26 on the surface of his little writing desk.\n\nBy the time the man in the bathrobe is done writing out the last group of numbers, Waterhouse is already well into his frequency count. He wraps it up as Bathrobe Man is saying something along the lines of ``this might look like a meaningless sequence of numbers to you, but to a Nip naval officer it might look like something entirely different.'' Then the man laughs nervously, shakes his head sadly, squares his jaw resolutely, and runs through a litany of other emotion-laden expressions not a single one of which is appropriate here.\n\nWaterhouse's frequency count is simply a tally of how frequently each number appears on the blackboard. It looks like this:\n\n1  14 ||\n2  15 |\n3 ||  16 |\n4  17 ||\n5  18 ||||||\n6 |  19 ||||\n7  20 |\n8 ||||  21 |\n9  22 |\n10  23 |\n11 |  24\n12 |  25 |\n13  26\n\nThe most interesting thing about this is that ten of the possible symbols (viz. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 24, and 26) are not even used. Only sixteen different numbers appear in the message. Assuming each of those sixteen represents one and only one letter of the alphabet, this message has (Lawrence reckons in his head) 111136315345735680000 possible meanings. This is a funny number because it begins with four ones and ends with four zeroes; Lawrence snickers, wipes his nose, and gets on with it.\n\nThe most common number is 18. It probably represents the letter E. If he substitutes E into the message everywhere he sees an 18, then--\n\nWell, to be honest, then he'll have to write out the whole message again, substituting Es for 18s, and it will take a long time, and it might be time wasted because he might have guessed wrong. On the other hand, if he just restrains his mind to construe 18s as Es--an operation that he thinks of as being loosely analogous to changing the presets on a pipe organ's console--then what he sees in his mind's eye when he looks at the blackboard is\n\n19 17 17 19 14 20 23 E 19 8 12 16 19 8 3\n\n21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\nwhich only has 10103301395066880000 possible meanings. This is a funny number too because of all those ones and zeroes--but it is an absolutely meaningless coincidence.\n\n``The science of making secret codes is called cryptography,'' Commander Schoen says, ``and the science of breaking them is cryptanalysis.'' Then he sighs, grapples visibly with some more widely divergent emotional states, and resignedly plods into the mandatory exercise of breaking these words down into their roots, which are either Latin or Greek (Lawrence isn't paying attention, doesn't care, only glimpses the stark word CRYPTO written in handsized capitals).\n\nThe opening sequence ``19 17 17 19'' is peculiar. 19, along with 8, is the second most common number in the list. 17 is only half as common. You can't have four vowels or four consonants in a row (unless the words are German) so either 17 is a vowel and 19 a consonant or the other way round. Since 19 appears more frequently (four times) in the message, it is more likely to be the vowel than 17 (which only appears twice). A is the most common vowel after E, so if he assumes that 19 is A, he gets\n\nA 17 17 A 14 20 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3\n\n21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\n\nThis narrows it down quite a bit, to a mere 841941782922240000 possible answers. He's already reduced the solution space by a couple of orders of magnitude!\n\nSchoen has talked himself up into a disturbingly heavy sweat, now, and is almost bodily flinging himself into a historical overview of the science of CRYPTOLOGY, as the union of cryptography and cryptanalysis is called. There's some talk about an English fellow name of Wilkins, and book called Cryptonomicon that he wrote hundreds of years ago, but (perhaps because he doesn't rate the intelligence of his audience too highly) he goes very easy on the historical background, and jumps directly from Wilkins to Paul Revere's ``one if by land, two if by sea'' code. He even makes a mathematics in-joke about this being one of the earliest practical applications of binary notation. Lawrence dutifully brays and snorts, drawing an appalled look from the saxophonist seated in front of him.\n\nEarlier in his talk, the Schoen mentioned that this message was (in what's obviously a fictional scenario ginned up to make this mathematical exercise more interesting to a bunch of musicians who are assumed not to give a shit about math) addressed to a Nip naval officer. Given that context, Lawrence cannot but guess that the first word of the message is ATTACK. This would mean that 17 represented T, 14 C, and 20 K. When he fills these in, he gets\n\nA T T A C K 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3\n\n21 T 25 E C E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\n\nand then the rest is so obvious he doesn't bother to write it out. He cannot restrain himself from jumping to his feet. He's so excited he forgets about the weak legs and topples over across a couple of his neighbors' desks, which makes a lot of noise.\n\n``Do you have a problem, sailor?'' says one of the officers in the corner, one who actually bothered to wear a uniform.\n\n``Sir! The message is, `Attack Pearl Harbor December Seven!' Sir!'' Lawrence shouts, and then sits down. His whole body is quivering with excitement. Adrenalin has taken over his body and mind. He could strangle twenty sumo wrestlers on the spot.\n\nCommander Schoen is completely impassive except that he blinks once, very slowly. He turns to one of his subordinates, who is standing against the wall with his hands clasped behind his back, and says, ``Get this one a copy of the Cryptonomicon. And a desk--as close to the coffee machine as possible. And why don't you promote the son of a bitch as long as you're at it.''\n\nThe part about the promotion turns out to be either military humor or further evidence of Commander Schoen's mental instability. Other than that small bit of drollery, the story of Waterhouse past this point, for the next ten months, is not much more complicated than the story of a bomb that has just been released from the belly of a plunging airplane. The barriers placed in his path (working his way through the Cryptonomicon, breaking the Nipponese Air Force Meteorological Code, breaking the Coral naval attache machine cipher, breaking Unnamed Nipponese Army Water Transport Code 3A, breaking the Greater East Asia Ministry Code) present about as much resistance as successive decks of a worm-eaten wooden frigate. Within a couple of months he is actually writing new chapters of the Cryptonomicon. People speak of it as though it were a book, but it's not. It is basically a compilation of all of the papers and notes that have drifted up in a particular corner of Commander Schoen's office over the roughly two-year period that he's been situated at Station Hypo, as this place is called.* It is everything that Commander Schoen knows about breaking codes, which amounts to everything that the United States of America knows. At any moment it could have been annihilated if a janitor had stepped into the room for a few minutes and tidied the place up. Understanding this, Commander Schoen's colleagues in the officers' ranks of Station Hypo have devised strenuous measures to prevent any type of tidying or hygienic operations, of any description, in the entire wing of the building that contains Commander Schoen's office. They know enough, in other words, to understand that the Cryptonomicon is terribly important, and they have the wit to take the measures necessary to keep it safe. Some of them actually consult it from time to time, and use its wisdom to break Nipponese messages, or even solve whole cryptosystems. But Waterhouse is the first guy to come along who is good enough to (at first) point out errors in what Schoen has written, and (soon) assemble the contents of the pile into something like an orderly work, and (eventually) add original material onto it.\n\n*``Hypo'' is a military way of saying the letter H. Bright boy Waterhouse infers that there must be at least seven others: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.\n\nAt some point Schoen takes him downstairs and leads him to the end of a long windowless corridor to a slab of a door guarded by hulking Myrmidons and lets him see the second coolest thing they've got at Pearl Harbor, a roomful of machinery from the Electrical Till Corporation that they use mainly for doing frequency counts on Nip intercepts.\n\nThe most remarkable machine* at Station Hypo, however--and the first coolest thing in Pearl Harbor--is even deeper in the cloaca of the building. It is contained in something that might be likened to a bank vault if it weren't all wired up with explosives so that its contents can be vaporized in the event of a total Nip invasion.\n\n*Assuming, provisionally, that Alan is wrong and that human brains are not machines.\n\nThis is the machine that Commander Schoen made, more than a year ago, for breaking the Nipponese cipher called Indigo. Apparently, as of the beginning of 1940, Schoen was a well-adjusted and mentally healthy young man into whose lap was dumped some great big long lists of numbers compiled from intercept stations around the Pacific (perhaps, Waterhouse thinks, Alpha, Bravo, etc.). These numbers were Nipponese messages that had been encrypted somehow--circumstantial evidence suggested that it had been done by some kind of machine. But absolutely nothing was known about the machine: whether it used gears or rotary switches or plugboards, or some combination thereof, or some other kind of mechanism that hadn't even been thought of by white people yet; how many such mechanisms it did or didn't use; specific details of how it used them. All that could be said was that these numbers, which seemed completely random, had been transmitted, perhaps even incorrectly. Other than that, Schoen had nothing--nothing--to work on.\n\nAs of the middle of 1941, then, this machine existed in this vault, here at Station Hypo. It existed because Schoen had built it. The machine perfectly decrypted every Indigo message that the intercept stations picked up, and was, therefore, necessarily an exact functional duplication of the Nipponese Indigo code machine, though neither Schoen nor any other American had ever laid eyes on one. Schoen had built the thing simply by looking at those great big long lists of essentially random numbers, and using some process of induction to figure it out. Somewhere along the line he had become totally debilitated psychologically, and begun to suffer nervous breakdowns at the rate of about one every week or two.\n\nAs of the actual outbreak of war with Nippon, Schoen is on disability, and taking lots of drugs. Waterhouse spends as much time with Schoen as he is allowed to, because he's pretty sure that whatever happened inside of Schoen's head, between when the lists of apparently random numbers were dumped into his lap and when he finished building his machine, is an example of a noncomputable process.\n\nWaterhouse's security clearance is upgraded about once a month, until it reaches the highest conceivable level (or so he thinks) which is Ultra/Magic. Ultra is what the Brits call the intelligence they get from having broken the German Enigma machine. Magic is what the Yanks call the intelligence they get from Indigo. In any case, Lawrence now gets to see the Ultra/Magic summaries, which are bound documents with dramatic, alternating red and black paragraphs printed on the front cover. Paragraph number three states:\n\nNO ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN ON INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED, REGARDLESS OF TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE, IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY.\n\nSeems clear enough, right? But Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is not so damn sure.\n\n. . . IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING . . .\n\nAt about the same time, Waterhouse has made a realization about himself. He has found that he works best when he is not horny, which is to say in the day or so following ejaculation. So as a part of his duty to the United States he has begun to spend a lot of time in whorehouses. But he can't have that much actual sex on what is still a glockenspiel player's pay and so he limits himself to what are euphemistically called massages.\n\n. . . ACTION. . . EFFECT . . .REVEALING . . .\n\nThe words stay with him like the clap. He lies on his back during these massages, arms crossed over his eyes, mumbling the words to himself. Something bothers him. He has learned that when something bothers him in this particular way it usually leads to his writing a new paper. But first he has to do a lot of hard mental pick-and-shovel work.\n\nIt all comes to him, explosively, during the Battle of Midway, while he and his comrades are spending twenty-four hours a day down among those ETC machines, decrypting Yamamoto's messages, telling Nimitz exactly where to find the Nip fleet.\n\nWhat are the chances of Nimitz finding that fleet by accident? That's what Yamamoto must be asking himself.\n\nIt is all a question (oddly enough!) of information theory.\n\n. . .ACTION . . .\n\nWhat is an action? It might be anything. It might be something obvious like bombing a Nipponese military installation. Everyone would agree that this would constitute an action. But it might also be something like changing the course of an aircraft carrier by five degrees--or not doing so. Or having exactly the right package of forces off Midway to hammer the Nipponese invasion fleet. It could mean something much less dramatic, like canceling plans for an action. An action, in a certain sense, might even be the total absence of activity. Any of these might be rational responses, on the part of some commander, to INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED. But any of them might be observable by the Nipponese--and hence any of them would impart information to the Nipponese. How good might those Nips be at abstracting information from a noisy channel? Do they have any Schoens?\n\n. . . EFFECT . . .\n\nSo what if the Nips did observe it? What would the effect be exactly? And under what circumstances might the effect be REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY?\n\nIf the action is one that could never have happened unless the Americans were breaking Indigo, then it will constitute proof, to the Nipponese, that the Americans have broken it. The existence of the source--the machine that Commander Schoen built--will be revealed.\n\nWaterhouse trusts that no Americans will be that stupid. But what if it isn't that clear-cut? What if the action is one that would merely be really improbable unless the Americans were breaking the code? What if the Americans, in the long run, are just too damn lucky?\n\nAnd how closely can you play that game? A pair of loaded dice that comes up sevens every time is detected in a few throws. A pair that comes up sevens only one percent more frequently than a straight pair is harder to detect--you have to throw the dice many more times in order for your opponent to prove anything.\n\nIf the Nips keep getting ambushed--if they keep finding their own ambushes spoiled--if their merchant ships happen to cross paths with American subs more often than pure probability would suggest--how long until they figure it out?\n\nWaterhouse writes papers on the subject, keeps pestering people with them. Then, one day, Waterhouse receives a new set of orders.\n\nThe orders arrive encrypted into groups of five random-looking letters, printed out on the blue tissue paper that is used for top-secret cablegrams. The message has been encrypted in Washington using a one-time pad, which is a slow and awkward but, in theory, perfectly unbreakable cipher used for the most important messages. Waterhouse knows this because he is one of the only two persons in Pearl Harbor who has clearance to decrypt it. The other one is Commander Schoen, and he is under sedation today. The duty officer opens up the appropriate safe and gives him the one-time pad for the day, which is basically a piece of graph paper covered with numbers printed in groups of five. The numbers have been chosen by secretaries in a basement in Washington by shuffling cards or drawing chits out of a hat. They are pure noise. One copy of the pure noise is in Waterhouse's hands, and the other copy is used by the person who encrypted this message in Washington.\n\nWaterhouse sits down and gets to work, subtracting noise from ciphertext to produce plaintext.\n\nThe first thing he sees is that this message's classification is not merely Top Secret, or even Ultra, but something entirely new: ULTRA MEGA.\n\nThe messages states that after thoroughly destroying this message, he--Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse--is to proceed to London, England, by the fastest available means. All ships, trains, and airplanes, even submarines, will be made available to him. Though a member of the U.S. Navy, he is even to be provided with an extra uniform--an Army uniform--in case it simplifies matters for him.\n\nThe one thing he must never, ever do is place himself in a situation where he could be captured by the enemy. In this sense, the war is suddenly over for Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/461889", "artist_names": "Lou Johnson", "full_title":

Johnson, Rousseau, Burns\n[May 19, 1840.]\n\nHero-Gods, Prophets, Poets, Priests are forms of Heroism that belong to the old ages, make their appearance in the remotest times; some of them have ceased to be possible long since, and cannot any more show themselves in this world. The Hero as Man of Letters, again, of which class we are to speak to-day, is altogether a product of these new ages; and so long as the wondrous art of Writing, or of Ready-writing which we call Printing, subsists, he may be expected to continue, as one of the main forms of Heroism for all future ages. He is, in various respects, a very singular phenomenon.\n\nHe is new, I say; he has hardly lasted above a century in the world yet. Never, till about a hundred years ago, was there seen any figure of a Great Soul living apart in that anomalous manner; endeavoring to speak forth the inspiration that was in him by Printed Books, and find place and subsistence by what the world would please to give him for doing that. Much had been sold and bought, and left to make its own bargain in the market-place; but the inspired wisdom of a Heroic Soul never till then, in that naked manner. He, with his copy-rights and copy-wrongs, in his squalid garret, in his rusty coat; ruling (for this is what he does), from his grave, after death, whole nations and generations who would, or would not, give him bread while living,\u2014is a rather curious spectacle! Few shapes of Heroism can be more unexpected.\n\nAlas, the Hero from of old has had to cramp himself into strange shapes: the world knows not well at any time what to do with him, so foreign is his aspect in the world! It seemed absurd to us, that men, in their rude admiration, should take some wise great Odin for a god, and worship him as such; some wise great Mahomet for one god-inspired, and religiously follow his Law for twelve centuries: but that a wise great Johnson, a Burns, a Rousseau, should be taken for some idle nondescript, extant in the world to amuse idleness, and have a few coins and applauses thrown him, that he might live thereby; this perhaps, as before hinted, will one day seem a still absurder phasis of things!\u2014Meanwhile, since it is the spiritual always that determines the material, this same Man-of-Letters Hero must be regarded as our most important modern person. He, such as he may be, is the soul of all. What he teaches, the whole world will do and make. The world's manner of dealing with him is the most significant feature of the world's general position. Looking well at his life, we may get a glance, as deep as is readily possible for us, into the life of those singular centuries which have produced him, in which we ourselves live and work.\n\nThere are genuine Men of Letters, and not genuine; as in every kind there is a genuine and a spurious. If hero be taken to mean genuine, then I say the Hero as Man of Letters will be found discharging a function for us which is ever honorable, ever the highest; and was once well known to be the highest. He is uttering forth, in such way as he has, the inspired soul of him; all that a man, in any case, can do. I say inspired; for what we call \u201coriginality,\u201d \u201csincerity,\u201d \u201cgenius,\u201d the heroic quality we have no good name for, signifies that. The Hero is he who lives in the inward sphere of things, in the True, Divine and Eternal, which exists always, unseen to most, under the Temporary, Trivial: his being is in that; he declares that abroad, by act or speech as it may be in declaring himself abroad. His life, as we said before, is a piece of the everlasting heart of Nature herself: all men's life is,\u2014but the weak many know not the fact, and are untrue to it, in most times; the strong few are strong, heroic, perennial, because it cannot be hidden from them. The Man of Letters, like every Hero, is there to proclaim this in such sort as he can. Intrinsically it is the same function which the old generations named a man Prophet, Priest, Divinity for doing; which all manner of Heroes, by speech or by act, are sent into the world to do.\nFichte the German Philosopher delivered, some forty years ago at Erlangen, a highly remarkable Course of Lectures on this subject: \u201cUeber das Wesen des Gelehrten, On the Nature of the Literary Man.\u201d Fichte, in conformity with the Transcendental Philosophy, of which he was a distinguished teacher, declares first: That all things which we see or work with in this Earth, especially we ourselves and all persons, are as a kind of vesture or sensuous Appearance: that under all there lies, as the essence of them, what he calls the \u201cDivine Idea of the World;\u201d this is the Reality which \u201clies at the bottom of all Appearance.\u201d To the mass of men no such Divine Idea is recognizable in the world; they live merely, says Fichte, among the superficialities, practicalities and shows of the world, not dreaming that there is anything divine under them. But the Man of Letters is sent hither specially that he may discern for himself, and make manifest to us, this same Divine Idea: in every new generation it will manifest itself in a new dialect; and he is there for the purpose of doing that. Such is Fichte's phraseology; with which we need not quarrel. It is his way of naming what I here, by other words, am striving imperfectly to name; what there is at present no name for: The unspeakable Divine Significance, full of splendor, of wonder and terror, that lies in the being of every man, of every thing,\u2014the Presence of the God who made every man and thing. Mahomet taught this in his dialect; Odin in his: it is the thing which all thinking hearts, in one dialect or another, are here to teach.\n\nFichte calls the Man of Letters, therefore, a Prophet, or as he prefers to phrase it, a Priest, continually unfolding the Godlike to men: Men of Letters are a perpetual Priesthood, from age to age, teaching all men that a God is still present in their life, that all \u201cAppearance,\u201d whatsoever we see in the world, is but as a vesture for the \u201cDivine Idea of the World,\u201d for \u201cthat which lies at the bottom of Appearance.\u201d In the true Literary Man there is thus ever, acknowledged or not by the world, a sacredness: he is the light of the world; the world's Priest;\u2014guiding it, like a sacred Pillar of Fire, in its dark pilgrimage through the waste of Time. Fichte discriminates with sharp zeal the true Literary Man, what we here call the Hero as Man of Letters, from multitudes of false unheroic. Whoever lives not wholly in this Divine Idea, or living partially in it, struggles not, as for the one good, to live wholly in it,\u2014he is, let him live where else he like, in what pomps and prosperities he like, no Literary Man; he is, says Fichte, a \u201cBungler, Stumper.\u201d Or at best, if he belong to the prosaic provinces, he may be a \u201cHodman;\u201d Fichte even calls him elsewhere a \u201cNonentity,\u201d and has in short no mercy for him, no wish that he should continue happy among us! This is Fichte's notion of the Man of Letters. It means, in its own form, precisely what we here mean.\n\nIn this point of view, I consider that, for the last hundred years, by far the notablest of all Literary Men is Fichte's countryman, Goethe. To that man too, in a strange way, there was given what we may call a life in the Divine Idea of the World; vision of the inward divine mystery: and strangely, out of his Books, the world rises imaged once more as godlike, the workmanship and temple of a God. Illuminated all, not in fierce impure fire-splendor as of Mahomet, but in mild celestial radiance;\u2014really a Prophecy in these most unprophetic times; to my mind, by far the greatest, though one of the quietest, among all the great things that have come to pass in them. Our chosen specimen of the Hero as Literary Man would be this Goethe. And it were a very pleasant plan for me here to discourse of his heroism: for I consider him to be a true Hero; heroic in what he said and did, and perhaps still more in what he did not say and did not do; to me a noble spectacle: a great heroic ancient man, speaking and keeping silence as an ancient Hero, in the guise of a most modern, high-bred, high-cultivated Man of Letters! We have had no such spectacle; no man capable of affording such, for the last hundred and fifty years.\n\nBut at present, such is the general state of knowledge about Goethe, it were worse than useless to attempt speaking of him in this case. Speak as I might, Goethe, to the great majority of you, would remain problematic, vague; no impression but a false one could be realized. Him we must leave to future times. Johnson, Burns, Rousseau, three great figures from a prior time, from a far inferior state of circumstances, will suit us better here. Three men of the Eighteenth Century; the conditions of their life far more resemble what those of ours still are in England, than what Goethe's in Germany were. Alas, these men did not conquer like him; they fought bravely, and fell. They were not heroic bringers of the light, but heroic seekers of it. They lived under galling conditions; struggling as under mountains of impediment, and could not unfold themselves into clearness, or victorious interpretation of that \u201cDivine Idea.\u201d It is rather the Tombs of three Literary Heroes that I have to show you. There are the monumental heaps, under which three spiritual giants lie buried. Very mournful, but also great and full of interest for us. We will linger by them for a while.\n\nComplaint is often made, in these times, of what we call the disorganized condition of society: how ill many forces of society fulfil their work; how many powerful are seen working in a wasteful, chaotic, altogether unarranged manner. It is too just a complaint, as we all know. But perhaps if we look at this of Books and the Writers of Books, we shall find here, as it were, the summary of all other disorganizations;\u2014a sort of heart, from which, and to which all other confusion circulates in the world! Considering what Book writers do in the world, and what the world does with Book writers, I should say, It is the most anomalous thing the world at present has to show.\u2014We should get into a sea far beyond sounding, did we attempt to give account of this: but we must glance at it for the sake of our subject. The worst element in the life of these three Literary Heroes was, that they found their business and position such a chaos. On the beaten road there is tolerable travelling; but it is sore work, and many have to perish, fashioning a path through the impassable!\n\nOur pious Fathers, feeling well what importance lay in the speaking of man to men, founded churches, made endowments, regulations; everywhere in the civilized world there is a Pulpit, environed with all manner of complex dignified appurtenances and furtherances, that therefrom a man with the tongue may, to best advantage, address his fellow-men. They felt that this was the most important thing; that without this there was no good thing. It is a right pious work, that of theirs; beautiful to behold! But now with the art of Writing, with the art of Printing, a total change has come over that business. The Writer of a Book, is not he a Preacher preaching not to this parish or that, on this day or that, but to all men in all times and places? Surely it is of the last importance that he do his work right, whoever do it wrong;\u2014that the eye report not falsely, for then all the other members are astray! Well; how he may do his work, whether he do it right or wrong, or do it at all, is a point which no man in the world has taken the pains to think of. To a certain shopkeeper, trying to get some money for his books, if lucky, he is of some importance; to no other man of any. Whence he came, whither he is bound, by what ways he arrived, by what he might be furthered on his course, no one asks. He is an accident in society. He wanders like a wild Ishmaelite, in a world of which he is as the spiritual light, either the guidance or the misguidance!\n\nCertainly the Art of Writing is the most miraculous of all things man has devised. Odin's Runes were the first form of the work of a Hero; Books written words, are still miraculous Runes, the latest form! In Books lies the soul of the whole Past Time; the articulate audible voice of the Past, when the body and material substance of it has altogether vanished like a dream. Mighty fleets and armies, harbors and arsenals, vast cities, high-domed, many-engined,\u2014they are precious, great: but what do they become? Agamemnon, the many Agamemnons, Pericleses, and their Greece; all is gone now to some ruined fragments, dumb mournful wrecks and blocks: but the Books of Greece! There Greece, to every thinker, still very literally lives: can be called up again into life. No magic Rune is stranger than a Book. All that Mankind has done, thought, gained or been: it is lying as in magic preservation in the pages of Books. They are the chosen possession of men.\n\nDo not Books still accomplish miracles, as Runes were fabled to do? They persuade men. Not the wretchedest circulating-library novel, which foolish girls thumb and con in remote villages, but will help to regulate the actual practical weddings and households of those foolish girls. So \u201cCelia\u201d felt, so \u201cClifford\u201d acted: the foolish Theorem of Life, stamped into those young brains, comes out as a solid Practice one day. Consider whether any Rune in the wildest imagination of Mythologist ever did such wonders as, on the actual firm Earth, some Books have done! What built St. Paul's Cathedral? Look at the heart of the matter, it was that divine Hebrew BOOK,\u2014the word partly of the man Moses, an outlaw tending his Midianitish herds, four thousand years ago, in the wildernesses of Sinai! It is the strangest of things, yet nothing is truer. With the art of Writing, of which Printing is a simple, an inevitable and comparatively insignificant corollary, the true reign of miracles for mankind commenced. It related, with a wondrous new contiguity and perpetual closeness, the Past and Distant with the Present in time and place; all times and all places with this our actual Here and Now. All things were altered for men; all modes of important work of men: teaching, preaching, governing, and all else.\n\nTo look at Teaching, for instance. Universities are a notable, respectable product of the modern ages. Their existence too is modified, to the very basis of it, by the existence of Books. Universities arose while there were yet no Books procurable; while a man, for a single Book, had to give an estate of land. That, in those circumstances, when a man had some knowledge to communicate, he should do it by gathering the learners round him, face to face, was a necessity for him. If you wanted to know what Abelard knew, you must go and listen to Abelard. Thousands, as many as thirty thousand, went to hear Abelard and that metaphysical theology of his. And now for any other teacher who had also something of his own to teach, there was a great convenience opened: so many thousands eager to learn were already assembled yonder; of all places the best place for him was that. For any third teacher it was better still; and grew ever the better, the more teachers there came. It only needed now that the King took notice of this new phenomenon; combined or agglomerated the various schools into one school; gave it edifices, privileges, encouragements, and named it Universitas, or School of all Sciences: the University of Paris, in its essential characters, was there. The model of all subsequent Universities; which down even to these days, for six centuries now, have gone on to found themselves. Such, I conceive, was the origin of Universities.\n\nIt is clear, however, that with this simple circumstance, facility of getting Books, the whole conditions of the business from top to bottom were changed. Once invent Printing, you metamorphosed all Universities, or superseded them! The Teacher needed not now to gather men personally round him, that he might speak to them what he knew: print it in a Book, and all learners far and wide, for a trifle, had it each at his own fireside, much more effectually to learn it!\u2014Doubtless there is still peculiar virtue in Speech; even writers of Books may still, in some circumstances, find it convenient to speak also,\u2014witness our present meeting here! There is, one would say, and must ever remain while man has a tongue, a distinct province for Speech as well as for Writing and Printing. In regard to all things this must remain; to Universities among others. But the limits of the two have nowhere yet been pointed out, ascertained; much less put in practice: the University which would completely take in that great new fact, of the existence of Printed Books, and stand on a clear footing for the Nineteenth Century as the Paris one did for the Thirteenth, has not yet come into existence. If we think of it, all that a University, or final highest School can do for us, is still but what the first School began doing,\u2014teach us to read. We learn to read, in various languages, in various sciences; we learn the alphabet and letters of all manner of Books. But the place where we are to get knowledge, even theoretic knowledge, is the Books themselves! It depends on what we read, after all manner of Professors have done their best for us. The true University of these days is a Collection of Books.\n\nBut to the Church itself, as I hinted already, all is changed, in its preaching, in its working, by the introduction of Books. The Church is the working recognized Union of our Priests or Prophets, of those who by wise teaching guide the souls of men. While there was no Writing, even while there was no Easy-writing, or Printing, the preaching of the voice was the natural sole method of performing this. But now with Books!\u2014He that can write a true Book, to persuade England, is not he the Bishop and Archbishop, the Primate of England and of All England? I many a time say, the writers of Newspapers, Pamphlets, Poems, Books, these are the real working effective Church of a modern country. Nay not only our preaching, but even our worship, is not it too accomplished by means of Printed Books? The noble sentiment which a gifted soul has clothed for us in melodious words, which brings melody into our hearts,\u2014is not this essentially, if we will understand it, of the nature of worship? There are many, in all countries, who, in this confused time, have no other method of worship. He who, in any way, shows us better than we knew before that a lily of the fields is beautiful, does he not show it us as an effluence of the Fountain of all Beauty; as the handwriting, made visible there, of the great Maker of the Universe? He has sung for us, made us sing with him, a little verse of a sacred Psalm. Essentially so. How much more he who sings, who says, or in any way brings home to our heart the noble doings, feelings, darings and endurances of a brother man! He has verily touched our hearts as with a live coal from the altar. Perhaps there is no worship more authentic.\n\nLiterature, so far as it is Literature, is an \u201capocalypse of Nature,\u201d a revealing of the \u201copen secret.\u201d It may well enough be named, in Fichte's style, a \u201ccontinuous revelation\u201d of the Godlike in the Terrestrial and Common. The Godlike does ever, in very truth, endure there; is brought out, now in this dialect, now in that, with various degrees of clearness: all true gifted Singers and Speakers are, consciously or unconsciously, doing so. The dark stormful indignation of a Byron, so wayward and perverse, may have touches of it; nay the withered mockery of a French sceptic,\u2014his mockery of the False, a love and worship of the True. How much more the sphere-harmony of a Shakspeare, of a Goethe; the cathedral music of a Milton! They are something too, those humble genuine lark-notes of a Burns,\u2014skylark, starting from the humble furrow, far overhead into the blue depths, and singing to us so genuinely there! For all true singing is of the nature of worship; as indeed all true working may be said to be,\u2014whereof such singing is but the record, and fit melodious representation, to us. Fragments of a real \u201cChurch Liturgy\u201d and \u201cBody of Homilies,\u201d strangely disguised from the common eye, are to be found weltering in that huge froth-ocean of Printed Speech we loosely call Literature! Books are our Church too.\n\nOr turning now to the Government of men. Witenagemote, old Parliament, was a great thing. The affairs of the nation were there deliberated and decided; what we were to do as a nation. But does not, though the name Parliament subsists, the parliamentary debate go on now, everywhere and at all times, in a far more comprehensive way, out of Parliament altogether? Burke said there were Three Estates in Parliament; but, in the Reporters' Gallery yonder, there sat a Fourth Estate more important far than they all. It is not a figure of speech, or a witty saying; it is a literal fact,\u2014very momentous to us in these times. Literature is our Parliament too. Printing, which comes necessarily out of Writing, I say often, is equivalent to Democracy: invent Writing, Democracy is inevitable. Writing brings Printing; brings universal everyday extempore Printing, as we see at present. Whoever can speak, speaking now to the whole nation, becomes a power, a branch of government, with inalienable weight in law-making, in all acts of authority. It matters not what rank he has, what revenues or garnitures. the requisite thing is, that he have a tongue which others will listen to; this and nothing more is requisite. The nation is governed by all that has tongue in the nation: Democracy is virtually there. Add only, that whatsoever power exists will have itself, by and by, organized; working secretly under bandages, obscurations, obstructions, it will never rest till it get to work free, unencumbered, visible to all. Democracy virtually extant will insist on becoming palpably extant.\u2014\nOn all sides, are we not driven to the conclusion that, of the things which man can do or make here below, by far the most momentous, wonderful and worthy are the things we call Books! Those poor bits of rag-paper with black ink on them;\u2014from the Daily Newspaper to the sacred Hebrew BOOK, what have they not done, what are they not doing!\u2014For indeed, whatever be the outward form of the thing (bits of paper, as we say, and black ink), is it not verily, at bottom, the highest act of man's faculty that produces a Book? It is the Thought of man; the true thaumaturgic virtue; by which man works all things whatsoever. All that he does, and brings to pass, is the vesture of a Thought. This London City, with all its houses, palaces, steam-engines, cathedrals, and huge immeasurable traffic and tumult, what is it but a Thought, but millions of Thoughts made into One;\u2014a huge immeasurable Spirit of a THOUGHT, embodied in brick, in iron, smoke, dust, Palaces, Parliaments, Hackney Coaches, Katherine Docks, and the rest of it! Not a brick was made but some man had to think of the making of that brick.\u2014The thing we called \u201cbits of paper with traces of black ink,\u201d is the purest embodiment a Thought of man can have. No wonder it is, in all ways, the activest and noblest.\n\nAll this, of the importance and supreme importance of the Man of Letters in modern Society, and how the Press is to such a degree superseding the Pulpit, the Senate, the Senatus Academicus and much else, has been admitted for a good while; and recognized often enough, in late times, with a sort of sentimental triumph and wonderment. It seems to me, the Sentimental by and by will have to give place to the Practical. If Men of Letters are so incalculably influential, actually performing such work for us from age to age, and even from day to day, then I think we may conclude that Men of Letters will not always wander like unrecognized unregulated Ishmaelites among us! Whatsoever thing, as I said above, has virtual unnoticed power will cast off its wrappages, bandages, and step forth one day with palpably articulated, universally visible power. That one man wear the clothes, and take the wages, of a function which is done by quite another: there can be no profit in this; this is not right, it is wrong. And yet, alas, the making of it right,\u2014what a business, for long times to come! Sure enough, this that we call Organization of the Literary Guild is still a great way off, encumbered with all manner of complexities. If you asked me what were the best possible organization for the Men of Letters in modern society; the arrangement of furtherance and regulation, grounded the most accurately on the actual facts of their position and of the world's position,\u2014I should beg to say that the problem far exceeded my faculty! It is not one man's faculty; it is that of many successive men turned earnestly upon it, that will bring out even an approximate solution. What the best arrangement were, none of us could say. But if you ask, Which is the worst? I answer: This which we now have, that Chaos should sit umpire in it; this is the worst. To the best, or any good one, there is yet a long way.\n\nOne remark I must not omit, That royal or parliamentary grants of money are by no means the chief thing wanted! To give our Men of Letters stipends, endowments and all furtherance of cash, will do little towards the business. On the whole, one is weary of hearing about the omnipotence of money. I will say rather that, for a genuine man, it is no evil to be poor; that there ought to be Literary Men poor,\u2014to show whether they are genuine or not! Mendicant Orders, bodies of good men doomed to beg, were instituted in the Christian Church; a most natural and even necessary development of the spirit of Christianity. It was itself founded on Poverty, on Sorrow, Contradiction, Crucifixion, every species of worldly Distress and Degradation. We may say, that he who has not known those things, and learned from them the priceless lessons they have to teach, has missed a good opportunity of schooling. To beg, and go barefoot, in coarse woollen cloak with a rope round your loins, and be despised of all the world, was no beautiful business;\u2014nor an honorable one in any eye, till the nobleness of those who did so had made it honored of some!\n\nBegging is not in our course at the present time: but for the rest of it, who will say that a Johnson is not perhaps the better for being poor? It is needful for him, at all rates, to know that outward profit, that success of any kind is not the goal he has to aim at. Pride, vanity, ill-conditioned egoism of all sorts, are bred in his heart, as in every heart; need, above all, to be cast out of his heart,\u2014to be, with whatever pangs, torn out of it, cast forth from it, as a thing worthless. Byron, born rich and noble, made out even less than Burns, poor and plebeian. Who knows but, in that same \u201cbest possible organization\u201d as yet far off, Poverty may still enter as an important element? What if our Men of Letters, men setting up to be Spiritual Heroes, were still then, as they now are, a kind of \u201cinvoluntary monastic order;\u201d bound still to this same ugly Poverty,\u2014till they had tried what was in it too, till they had learned to make it too do for them! Money, in truth, can do much, but it cannot do all. We must know the province of it, and confine it there; and even spurn it back, when it wishes to get farther.\n\nBesides, were the money-furtherances, the proper season for them, the fit assigner of them, all settled,\u2014how is the Burns to be recognized that merits these? He must pass through the ordeal, and prove himself. This ordeal; this wild welter of a chaos which is called Literary Life: this too is a kind of ordeal! There is clear truth in the idea that a struggle from the lower classes of society, towards the upper regions and rewards of society, must ever continue. Strong men are born there, who ought to stand elsewhere than there. The manifold, inextricably complex, universal struggle of these constitutes, and must constitute, what is called the progress of society. For Men of Letters, as for all other sorts of men. How to regulate that struggle? There is the whole question. To leave it as it is, at the mercy of blind Chance; a whirl of distracted atoms, one cancelling the other; one of the thousand arriving saved, nine hundred and ninety-nine lost by the way; your royal Johnson languishing inactive in garrets, or harnessed to the yoke of Printer Cave; your Burns dying broken-hearted as a Gauger; your Rousseau driven into mad exasperation, kindling French Revolutions by his paradoxes: this, as we said, is clearly enough the worst regulation. The best, alas, is far from us!\n\nAnd yet there can be no doubt but it is coming; advancing on us, as yet hidden in the bosom of centuries: this is a prophecy one can risk. For so soon as men get to discern the importance of a thing, they do infallibly set about arranging it, facilitating, forwarding it; and rest not till, in some approximate degree, they have accomplished that. I say, of all Priesthoods, Aristocracies, Governing Classes at present extant in the world, there is no class comparable for importance to that Priesthood of the Writers of Books. This is a fact which he who runs may read,\u2014and draw inferences from. \u201cLiterature will take care of itself,\u201d answered Mr. Pitt, when applied to for some help for Burns. \u201cYes,\u201d adds Mr. Southey, \u201cit will take care of itself; and of you too, if you do not look to it!\u201d\n\nThe result to individual Men of Letters is not the momentous one; they are but individuals, an infinitesimal fraction of the great body; they can struggle on, and live or else die, as they have been wont. But it deeply concerns the whole society, whether it will set its light on high places, to walk thereby; or trample it under foot, and scatter it in all ways of wild waste (not without conflagration), as heretofore! Light is the one thing wanted for the world. Put wisdom in the head of the world, the world will fight its battle victoriously, and be the best world man can make it. I called this anomaly of a disorganic Literary Class the heart of all other anomalies, at once product and parent; some good arrangement for that would be as the punctum saliens of a new vitality and just arrangement for all. Already, in some European countries, in France, in Prussia, one traces some beginnings of an arrangement for the Literary Class; indicating the gradual possibility of such. I believe that it is possible; that it will have to be possible.\n\nBy far the most interesting fact I hear about the Chinese is one on which we cannot arrive at clearness, but which excites endless curiosity even in the dim state: this namely, that they do attempt to make their Men of Letters their Governors! It would be rash to say, one understood how this was done, or with what degree of success it was done. All such things must be very unsuccessful; yet a small degree of success is precious; the very attempt how precious! There does seem to be, all over China, a more or less active search everywhere to discover the men of talent that grow up in the young generation. Schools there are for every one: a foolish sort of training, yet still a sort. The youths who distinguish themselves in the lower school are promoted into favorable stations in the higher, that they may still more distinguish themselves,\u2014forward and forward: it appears to be out of these that the Official Persons, and incipient Governors, are taken. These are they whom they try first, whether they can govern or not. And surely with the best hope: for they are the men that have already shown intellect. Try them: they have not governed or administered as yet; perhaps they cannot; but there is no doubt they have some Understanding,\u2014without which no man can! Neither is Understanding a tool, as we are too apt to figure; \u201cit is a hand which can handle any tool.\u201d Try these men: they are of all others the best worth trying.\u2014Surely there is no kind of government, constitution, revolution, social apparatus or arrangement, that I know of in this world, so promising to one's scientific curiosity as this. The man of intellect at the top of affairs: this is the aim of all constitutions and revolutions, if they have any aim. For the man of true intellect, as I assert and believe always, is the noble-hearted man withal, the true, just, humane and valiant man. Get him for governor, all is got; fail to get him, though you had Constitutions plentiful as blackberries, and a Parliament in every village, there is nothing yet got\u2014!\n\nThese things look strange, truly; and are not such as we commonly speculate upon. But we are fallen into strange times; these things will require to be speculated upon; to be rendered practicable, to be in some way put in practice. These, and many others. On all hands of us, there is the announcement, audible enough, that the old Empire of Routine has ended; that to say a thing has long been, is no reason for its continuing to be. The things which have been are fallen into decay, are fallen into incompetence; large masses of mankind, in every society of our Europe, are no longer capable of living at all by the things which have been. When millions of men can no longer by their utmost exertion gain food for themselves, and \u201cthe third man for thirty-six weeks each year is short of third-rate potatoes,\u201d the things which have been must decidedly prepare to alter themselves!\u2014I will now quit this of the organization of Men of Letters.\n\nAlas, the evil that pressed heaviest on those Literary Heroes of ours was not the want of organization for Men of Letters, but a far deeper one; out of which, indeed, this and so many other evils for the Literary Man, and for all men, had, as from their fountain, taken rise. That our Hero as Man of Letters had to travel without highway, companionless, through an inorganic chaos,\u2014and to leave his own life and faculty lying there, as a partial contribution towards pushing some highway through it: this, had not his faculty itself been so perverted and paralyzed, he might have put up with, might have considered to be but the common lot of Heroes. His fatal misery was the spiritual paralysis, so we may name it, of the Age in which his life lay; whereby his life too, do what he might, was half paralyzed! The Eighteenth was a Sceptical Century; in which little word there is a whole Pandora's Box of miseries. Scepticism means not intellectual Doubt alone, but moral Doubt; all sorts of infidelity, insincerity, spiritual paralysis. Perhaps, in few centuries that one could specify since the world began, was a life of Heroism more difficult for a man. That was not an age of Faith,\u2014an age of Heroes! The very possibility of Heroism had been, as it were, formally abnegated in the minds of all. Heroism was gone forever; Triviality, Formulism and Commonplace were come forever. The \u201cage of miracles\u201d had been, or perhaps had not been; but it was not any longer. An effete world; wherein Wonder, Greatness, Godhood could not now dwell;\u2014in one word, a godless world!\n\nHow mean, dwarfish are their ways of thinking, in this time,\u2014compared not with the Christian Shakspeares and Miltons, but with the old Pagan Skalds, with any species of believing men! The living TREE Igdrasil, with the melodious prophetic waving of its world-wide boughs, deep-rooted as Hela, has died out into the clanking of a World-MACHINE. \u201cTree\u201d and \u201cMachine:\u201d contrast these two things. I, for my share, declare the world to be no machine! I say that it does not go by wheel-and-pinion \u201cmotives\u201d self-interests, checks, balances; that there is something far other in it than the clank of spinning-jennies, and parliamentary majorities; and, on the whole, that it is not a machine at all!\u2014The old Norse Heathen had a truer motion of God's-world than these poor Machine-Sceptics: the old Heathen Norse were sincere men. But for these poor Sceptics there was no sincerity, no truth. Half-truth and hearsay was called truth. Truth, for most men, meant plausibility; to be measured by the number of votes you could get. They had lost any notion that sincerity was possible, or of what sincerity was. How many Plausibilities asking, with unaffected surprise and the air of offended virtue, What! am not I sincere? Spiritual Paralysis, I say, nothing left but a Mechanical life, was the characteristic of that century. For the common man, unless happily he stood below his century and belonged to another prior one, it was impossible to be a Believer, a Hero; he lay buried, unconscious, under these baleful influences. To the strongest man, only with infinite struggle and confusion was it possible to work himself half loose; and lead as it were, in an enchanted, most tragical way, a spiritual death-in-life, and be a Half-Hero!\n\nScepticism is the name we give to all this; as the chief symptom, as the chief origin of all this. Concerning which so much were to be said! It would take many Discourses, not a small fraction of one Discourse, to state what one feels about that Eighteenth Century and its ways. As indeed this, and the like of this, which we now call Scepticism, is precisely the black malady and life-foe, against which all teaching and discoursing since man's life began has directed itself: the battle of Belief against Unbelief is the never-ending battle! Neither is it in the way of crimination that one would wish to speak. Scepticism, for that century, we must consider as the decay of old ways of believing, the preparation afar off for new better and wider ways,\u2014an inevitable thing. We will not blame men for it; we will lament their hard fate. We will understand that destruction of old forms is not destruction of everlasting substances; that Scepticism, as sorrowful and hateful as we see it, is not an end but a beginning.\n\nThe other day speaking, without prior purpose that way, of Bentham's theory of man and man's life, I chanced to call it a more beggarly one than Mahomet's. I am bound to say, now when it is once uttered, that such is my deliberate opinion. Not that one would mean offence against the man Jeremy Bentham, or those who respect and believe him. Bentham himself, and even the creed of Bentham, seems to me comparatively worthy of praise. It is a determinate being what all the world, in a cowardly half-and-half manner, was tending to be. Let us have the crisis; we shall either have death or the cure. I call this gross, steam-engine Utilitarianism an approach towards new Faith. It was a laying-down of cant; a saying to oneself: \u201cWell then, this world is a dead iron machine, the god of it Gravitation and selfish Hunger; let us see what, by checking and balancing, and good adjustment of tooth and pinion, can be made of it!\u201d Benthamism has something complete, manful, in such fearless committal of itself to what it finds true; you may call it Heroic, though a Heroism with its eyes put out! It is the culminating point, and fearless ultimatum, of what lay in the half-and-half state, pervading man's whole existence in that Eighteenth Century. It seems to me, all deniers of Godhood, and all lip-believers of it, are bound to be Benthamites, if they have courage and honesty. Benthamism is an eyeless Heroism: the Human Species, like a hapless blinded Samson grinding in the Philistine Mill, clasps convulsively the pillars of its Mill; brings huge ruin down, but ultimately deliverance withal. Of Bentham I meant to say no harm.\nBut this I do say, and would wish all men to know and lay to heart, that he who discerns nothing but Mechanism in the Universe has in the fatalest way missed the secret of the Universe altogether. That all Godhood should vanish out of men's conception of this Universe seems to me precisely the most brutal error,\u2014I will not disparage Heathenism by calling it a Heathen error,\u2014that men could fall into. It is not true; it is false at the very heart of it. A man who thinks so will think wrong about all things in the world; this original sin will vitiate all other conclusions he can form. One might call it the most lamentable of Delusions,\u2014not forgetting Witchcraft itself! Witchcraft worshipped at least a living Devil; but this worships a dead iron Devil; no God, not even a Devil! Whatsoever is noble, divine, inspired, drops thereby out of life. There remains everywhere in life a despicable caput-mortuum; the mechanical hull, all soul fled out of it. How can a man act heroically? The \u201cDoctrine of Motives\u201d will teach him that it is, under more or less disguise, nothing but a wretched love of Pleasure, fear of Pain; that Hunger, of applause, of cash, of whatsoever victual it may be, is the ultimate fact of man's life. Atheism, in brief;\u2014which does indeed frightfully punish itself. The man, I say, is become spiritually a paralytic man; this godlike Universe a dead mechanical steam-engine, all working by motives, checks, balances, and I know not what; wherein, as in the detestable belly of some Phalaris'-Bull of his own contriving, he the poor Phalaris sits miserably dying!\n\nBelief I define to be the healthy act of a man's mind. It is a mysterious indescribable process, that of getting to believe;\u2014indescribable, as all vital acts are. We have our mind given us, not that it may cavil and argue, but that it may see into something, give us clear belief and understanding about something, whereon we are then to proceed to act. Doubt, truly, is not itself a crime. Certainly we do not rush out, clutch up the first thing we find, and straightway believe that! All manner of doubt, inquiry, [Gr.] skepsis as it is named, about all manner of objects, dwells in every reasonable mind. It is the mystic working of the mind, on the object it is getting to know and believe. Belief comes out of all this, above ground, like the tree from its hidden roots. But now if, even on common things, we require that a man keep his doubts silent, and not babble of them till they in some measure become affirmations or denials; how much more in regard to the highest things, impossible to speak of in words at all! That a man parade his doubt, and get to imagine that debating and logic (which means at best only the manner of telling us your thought, your belief or disbelief, about a thing) is the triumph and true work of what intellect he has: alas, this is as if you should overturn the tree, and instead of green boughs, leaves and fruits, show us ugly taloned roots turned up into the air,\u2014and no growth, only death and misery going on!\n\nFor the Scepticism, as I said, is not intellectual only; it is moral also; a chronic atrophy and disease of the whole soul. A man lives by believing something; not by debating and arguing about many things. A sad case for him when all that he can manage to believe is something he can button in his pocket, and with one or the other organ eat and digest! Lower than that he will not get. We call those ages in which he gets so low the mournfulest, sickest and meanest of all ages. The world's heart is palsied, sick: how can any limb of it be whole? Genuine Acting ceases in all departments of the world's work; dexterous Similitude of Acting begins. The world's wages are pocketed, the world's work is not done. Heroes have gone out; Quacks have come in. Accordingly, what Century, since the end of the Roman world, which also was a time of scepticism, simulacra and universal decadence, so abounds with Quacks as that Eighteenth? Consider them, with their tumid sentimental vaporing about virtue, benevolence,\u2014the wretched Quack-squadron, Cagliostro at the head of them! Few men were without quackery; they had got to consider it a necessary ingredient and amalgam for truth. Chatham, our brave Chatham himself, comes down to the House, all wrapt and bandaged; he \u201chas crawled out in great bodily suffering,\u201d and so on;\u2014forgets, says Walpole, that he is acting the sick man; in the fire of debate, snatches his arm from the sling, and oratorically swings and brandishes it! Chatham himself lives the strangest mimetic life, half-hero, half-quack, all along. For indeed the world is full of dupes; and you have to gain the world's suffrage! How the duties of the world will be done in that case, what quantities of error, which means failure, which means sorrow and misery, to some and to many, will gradually accumulate in all provinces of the world's business, we need not compute.\n\nIt seems to me, you lay your finger here on the heart of the world's maladies, when you call it a Sceptical World. An insincere world; a godless untruth of a world! It is out of this, as I consider, that the whole tribe of social pestilences, French Revolutions, Chartisms, and what not, have derived their being,\u2014their chief necessity to be. This must alter. Till this alter, nothing can beneficially alter. My one hope of the world, my inexpugnable consolation in looking at the miseries of the world, is that this is altering. Here and there one does now find a man who knows, as of old, that this world is a Truth, and no Plausibility and Falsity; that he himself is alive, not dead or paralytic; and that the world is alive, instinct with Godhood, beautiful and awful, even as in the beginning of days! One man once knowing this, many men, all men, must by and by come to know it. It lies there clear, for whosoever will take the spectacles off his eyes and honestly look, to know! For such a man the Unbelieving Century, with its unblessed Products, is already past; a new century is already come. The old unblessed Products and Performances, as solid as they look, are Phantasms, preparing speedily to vanish. To this and the other noisy, very great-looking Simulacrum with the whole world huzzaing at its heels, he can say, composedly stepping aside: Thou art not true; thou art not extant, only semblant; go thy way!\u2014Yes, hollow Formulism, gross Benthamism, and other unheroic atheistic Insincerity is visibly and even rapidly declining. An unbelieving Eighteenth Century is but an exception,\u2014such as now and then occurs. I prophesy that the world will once more become sincere; a believing world; with many Heroes in it, a heroic world! It will then be a victorious world; never till then.\n\nOr indeed what of the world and its victories? Men speak too much about the world. Each one of us here, let the world go how it will, and be victorious or not victorious, has he not a Life of his own to lead? One Life; a little gleam of Time between two Eternities; no second chance to us forevermore! It were well for us to live not as fools and simulacra, but as wise and realities. The world's being saved will not save us; nor the world's being lost destroy us. We should look to ourselves: there is great merit here in the \u201cduty of staying at home\u201d! And, on the whole, to say truth, I never heard of \u201cworld's\u201d being \u201csaved\u201d in any other way. That mania of saving worlds is itself a piece of the Eighteenth Century with its windy sentimentalism. Let us not follow it too far. For the saving of the world I will trust confidently to the Maker of the world; and look a little to my own saving, which I am more competent to!\u2014In brief, for the world's sake, and for our own, we will rejoice greatly that Scepticism, Insincerity, Mechanical Atheism, with all their poison-dews, are going, and as good as gone.\u2014\n\nNow it was under such conditions, in those times of Johnson, that our Men of Letters had to live. Times in which there was properly no truth in life. Old truths had fallen nigh dumb; the new lay yet hidden, not trying to speak. That Man's Life here below was a Sincerity and Fact, and would forever continue such, no new intimation, in that dusk of the world, had yet dawned. No intimation; not even any French Revolution,\u2014which we define to be a Truth once more, though a Truth clad in hell-fire! How different was the Luther's pilgrimage, with its assured goal, from the Johnson's, girt with mere traditions, suppositions, grown now incredible, unintelligible! Mahomet's Formulas were of \u201cwood waxed and oiled,\u201d and could be burnt out of one's way: poor Johnson's were far more difficult to burn.\u2014The strong man will ever find work, which means difficulty, pain, to the full measure of his strength. But to make out a victory, in those circumstances of our poor Hero as Man of Letters, was perhaps more difficult than in any. Not obstruction, disorganization, Bookseller Osborne and Fourpence-halfpenny a day; not this alone; but the light of his own soul was taken from him. No landmark on the Earth; and, alas, what is that to having no loadstar in the Heaven! We need not wonder that none of those Three men rose to victory. That they fought truly is the highest praise. With a mournful sympathy we will contemplate, if not three living victorious Heroes, as I said, the Tombs of three fallen Heroes! They fell for us too; making a way for us. There are the mountains which they hurled abroad in their confused War of the Giants; under which, their strength and life spent, they now lie buried.\n\nI have already written of these three Literary Heroes, expressly or incidentally; what I suppose is known to most of you; what need not be spoken or written a second time. They concern us here as the singular Prophets of that singular age; for such they virtually were; and the aspect they and their world exhibit, under this point of view, might lead us into reflections enough! I call them, all three, Genuine Men more or less; faithfully, for most part unconsciously, struggling to be genuine, and plant themselves on the everlasting truth of things. This to a degree that eminently distinguishes them from the poor artificial mass of their contemporaries; and renders them worthy to be considered as Speakers, in some measure, of the everlasting truth, as Prophets in that age of theirs. By Nature herself a noble necessity was laid on them to be so. They were men of such magnitude that they could not live on unrealities,\u2014clouds, froth and all inanity gave way under them: there was no footing for them but on firm earth; no rest or regular motion for them, if they got not footing there. To a certain extent, they were Sons of Nature once more in an age of Artifice; once more, Original Men.\n\nAs for Johnson, I have always considered him to be, by nature, one of our great English souls. A strong and noble man; so much left undeveloped in him to the last: in a kindlier element what might he not have been,\u2014Poet, Priest, sovereign Ruler! On the whole, a man must not complain of his \u201celement,\u201d of his \u201ctime,\u201d or the like; it is thriftless work doing so. His time is bad: well then, he is there to make it better!\u2014Johnson's youth was poor, isolated, hopeless, very miserable. Indeed, it does not seem possible that, in any the favorablest outward circumstances, Johnson's life could have been other than a painful one. The world might have had more of profitable work out of him, or less; but his effort against the world's work could never have been a light one. Nature, in return for his nobleness, had said to him, Live in an element of diseased sorrow. Nay, perhaps the sorrow and the nobleness were intimately and even inseparably connected with each other. At all events, poor Johnson had to go about girt with continual hypochondria, physical and spiritual pain. Like a Hercules with the burning Nessus'-shirt on him, which shoots in on him dull incurable misery: the Nessus'-shirt not to be stript off, which is his own natural skin! In this manner he had to live. Figure him there, with his scrofulous diseases, with his great greedy heart, and unspeakable chaos of thoughts; stalking mournful as a stranger in this Earth; eagerly devouring what spiritual thing he could come at: school-languages and other merely grammatical stuff, if there were nothing better! The largest soul that was in all England; and provision made for it of \u201cfourpence-halfpenny a day.\u201d Yet a giant invincible soul; a true man's. One remembers always that story of the shoes at Oxford: the rough, seamy-faced, rawboned College Servitor stalking about, in winter-season, with his shoes worn out; how the charitable Gentleman Commoner secretly places a new pair at his door; and the rawboned Servitor, lifting them, looking at them near, with his dim eyes, with what thoughts,\u2014pitches them out of window! Wet feet, mud, frost, hunger or what you will; but not beggary: we cannot stand beggary! Rude stubborn self-help here; a whole world of squalor, rudeness, confused misery and want, yet of nobleness and manfulness withal. It is a type of the man's life, this pitching away of the shoes. An original man;\u2014not a second-hand, borrowing or begging man. Let us stand on our own basis, at any rate! On such shoes as we ourselves can get. On frost and mud, if you will, but honestly on that;\u2014on the reality and substance which Nature gives us, not on the semblance, on the thing she has given another than us\u2014!\n\nAnd yet with all this rugged pride of manhood and self-help, was there ever soul more tenderly affectionate, loyally submissive to what was really higher than he? Great souls are always loyally submissive, reverent to what is over them; only small mean souls are otherwise. I could not find a better proof of what I said the other day, That the sincere man was by nature the obedient man; that only in a World of Heroes was there loyal Obedience to the Heroic. The essence of originality is not that it be new: Johnson believed altogether in the old; he found the old opinions credible for him, fit for him; and in a right heroic manner lived under them. He is well worth study in regard to that. For we are to say that Johnson was far other than a mere man of words and formulas; he was a man of truths and facts. He stood by the old formulas; the happier was it for him that he could so stand: but in all formulas that he could stand by, there needed to be a most genuine substance. Very curious how, in that poor Paper-age, so barren, artificial, thick-quilted with Pedantries, Hearsays, the great Fact of this Universe glared in, forever wonderful, indubitable, unspeakable, divine-infernal, upon this man too! How he harmonized his Formulas with it, how he managed at all under such circumstances: that is a thing worth seeing. A thing \u201cto be looked at with reverence, with pity, with awe.\u201d That Church of St. Clement Danes, where Johnson still worshipped in the era of Voltaire, is to me a venerable place.\n\nIt was in virtue of his sincerity, of his speaking still in some sort from the heart of Nature, though in the current artificial dialect, that Johnson was a Prophet. Are not all dialects \u201cartificial\u201d? Artificial things are not all false;\u2014nay every true Product of Nature will infallibly shape itself; we may say all artificial things are, at the starting of them, true. What we call \u201cFormulas\u201d are not in their origin bad; they are indispensably good. Formula is method, habitude; found wherever man is found. Formulas fashion themselves as Paths do, as beaten Highways, leading toward some sacred or high object, whither many men are bent. Consider it. One man, full of heartfelt earnest impulse, finds out a way of doing somewhat,\u2014were it of uttering his soul's reverence for the Highest, were it but of fitly saluting his fellow-man. An inventor was needed to do that, a poet; he has articulated the dim-struggling thought that dwelt in his own and many hearts. This is his way of doing that; these are his footsteps, the beginning of a \u201cPath.\u201d And now see: the second men travels naturally in the footsteps of his foregoer, it is the easiest method. In the footsteps of his foregoer; yet with improvements, with changes where such seem good; at all events with enlargements, the Path ever widening itself as more travel it;\u2014till at last there is a broad Highway whereon the whole world may travel and drive. While there remains a City or Shrine, or any Reality to drive to, at the farther end, the Highway shall be right welcome! When the City is gone, we will forsake the Highway. In this manner all Institutions, Practices, Regulated Things in the world have come into existence, and gone out of existence. Formulas all begin by being full of substance; you may call them the skin, the articulation into shape, into limbs and skin, of a substance that is already there: they had not been there otherwise. Idols, as we said, are not idolatrous till they become doubtful, empty for the worshipper's heart. Much as we talk against Formulas, I hope no one of us is ignorant withal of the high significance of true Formulas; that they were, and will ever be, the indispensablest furniture of our habitation in this world.\u2014\n\nMark, too, how little Johnson boasts of his \u201csincerity.\u201d He has no suspicion of his being particularly sincere,\u2014of his being particularly anything! A hard-struggling, weary-hearted man, or \u201cscholar\u201d as he calls himself, trying hard to get some honest livelihood in the world, not to starve, but to live\u2014without stealing! A noble unconsciousness is in him. He does not \u201cengrave Truth on his watch-seal;\u201d no, but he stands by truth, speaks by it, works and lives by it. Thus it ever is. Think of it once more. The man whom Nature has appointed to do great things is, first of all, furnished with that openness to Nature which renders him incapable of being insincere! To his large, open, deep-feeling heart Nature is a Fact: all hearsay is hearsay; the unspeakable greatness of this Mystery of Life, let him acknowledge it or not, nay even though he seem to forget it or deny it, is ever present to him,\u2014fearful and wonderful, on this hand and on that. He has a basis of sincerity; unrecognized, because never questioned or capable of question. Mirabeau, Mahomet, Cromwell, Napoleon: all the Great Men I ever heard of have this as the primary material of them. Innumerable commonplace men are debating, are talking everywhere their commonplace doctrines, which they have learned by logic, by rote, at second-hand: to that kind of man all this is still nothing. He must have truth; truth which he feels to be true. How shall he stand otherwise? His whole soul, at all moments, in all ways, tells him that there is no standing. He is under the noble necessity of being true. Johnson's way of thinking about this world is not mine, any more than Mahomet's was: but I recognize the everlasting element of heart-sincerity in both; and see with pleasure how neither of them remains ineffectual. Neither of them is as chaff sown; in both of them is something which the seedfield will grow.\n\nJohnson was a Prophet to his people; preached a Gospel to them,\u2014as all like him always do. The highest Gospel he preached we may describe as a kind of Moral Prudence: \u201cin a world where much is to be done, and little is to be known,\u201d see how you will do it! A thing well worth preaching. \u201cA world where much is to be done, and little is to be known:\u201d do not sink yourselves in boundless bottomless abysses of Doubt, of wretched god-forgetting Unbelief;\u2014you were miserable then, powerless, mad: how could you do or work at all? Such Gospel Johnson preached and taught;\u2014coupled, theoretically and practically, with this other great Gospel, \u201cClear your mind of Cant!\u201d Have no trade with Cant: stand on the cold mud in the frosty weather, but let it be in your own real torn shoes: \u201cthat will be better for you,\u201d as Mahomet says! I call this, I call these two things joined together, a great Gospel, the greatest perhaps that was possible at that time.\n\nJohnson's Writings, which once had such currency and celebrity, are now as it were disowned by the young generation. It is not wonderful; Johnson's opinions are fast becoming obsolete: but his style of thinking and of living, we may hope, will never become obsolete. I find in Johnson's Books the indisputablest traces of a great intellect and great heart;\u2014ever welcome, under what obstructions and perversions soever. They are sincere words, those of his; he means things by them. A wondrous buckram style,\u2014the best he could get to then; a measured grandiloquence, stepping or rather stalking along in a very solemn way, grown obsolete now; sometimes a tumid size of phraseology not in proportion to the contents of it: all this you will put up with. For the phraseology, tumid or not, has always something within it. So many beautiful styles and books, with nothing in them;\u2014a man is a malefactor to the world who writes such! They are the avoidable kind!\u2014Had Johnson left nothing but his Dictionary, one might have traced there a great intellect, a genuine man. Looking to its clearness of definition, its general solidity, honesty, insight and successful method, it may be called the best of all Dictionaries. There is in it a kind of architectural nobleness; it stands there like a great solid square-built edifice, finished, symmetrically complete: you judge that a true Builder did it.\n\nOne word, in spite of our haste, must be granted to poor Bozzy. He passes for a mean, inflated, gluttonous creature; and was so in many senses. Yet the fact of his reverence for Johnson will ever remain noteworthy. The foolish conceited Scotch Laird, the most conceited man of his time, approaching in such awe-struck attitude the great dusty irascible Pedagogue in his mean garret there: it is a genuine reverence for Excellence; a worship for Heroes, at a time when neither Heroes nor worship were surmised to exist. Heroes, it would seem, exist always, and a certain worship of them! We will also take the liberty to deny altogether that of the witty Frenchman, that no man is a Hero to his valet-de-chambre. Or if so, it is not the Hero's blame, but the Valet's: that his soul, namely, is a mean valet-soul! He expects his Hero to advance in royal stage-trappings, with measured step, trains borne behind him, trumpets sounding before him. It should stand rather, No man can be a Grand-Monarque to his valet-de-chambre. Strip your Louis Quatorze of his king-gear, and there is left nothing but a poor forked radish with a head fantastically carved;\u2014admirable to no valet. The Valet does not know a Hero when he sees him! Alas, no: it requires a kind of Hero to do that;\u2014and one of the world's wants, in this as in other senses, is for most part want of such.\n\nOn the whole, shall we not say, that Boswell's admiration was well bestowed; that he could have found no soul in all England so worthy of bending down before? Shall we not say, of this great mournful Johnson too, that he guided his difficult confused existence wisely; led it well, like a right valiant man? That waste chaos of Authorship by trade; that waste chaos of Scepticism in religion and politics, in life-theory and life-practice; in his poverty, in his dust and dimness, with the sick body and the rusty coat: he made it do for him, like a brave man. Not wholly without a loadstar in the Eternal; he had still a loadstar, as the brave all need to have: with his eye set on that, he would change his course for nothing in these confused vortices of the lower sea of Time. \u201cTo the Spirit of Lies, bearing death and hunger, he would in nowise strike his flag.\u201d Brave old Samuel: ultimus Romanorum!\n\nOf Rousseau and his Heroism I cannot say so much. He is not what I call a strong man. A morbid, excitable, spasmodic man; at best, intense rather than strong. He had not \u201cthe talent of Silence,\u201d an invaluable talent; which few Frenchmen, or indeed men of any sort in these times, excel in! The suffering man ought really \u201cto consume his own smoke;\u201d there is no good in emitting smoke till you have made it into fire,\u2014which, in the metaphorical sense too, all smoke is capable of becoming! Rousseau has not depth or width, not calm force for difficulty; the first characteristic of true greatness. A fundamental mistake to call vehemence and rigidity strength! A man is not strong who takes convulsion-fits; though six men cannot hold him then. He that can walk under the heaviest weight without staggering, he is the strong man. We need forever, especially in these loud-shrieking days, to remind ourselves of that. A man who cannot hold his peace, till the time come for speaking and acting, is no right man.\n\nPoor Rousseau's face is to me expressive of him. A high but narrow contracted intensity in it: bony brows; deep, strait-set eyes, in which there is something bewildered-looking,\u2014bewildered, peering with lynx-eagerness. A face full of misery, even ignoble misery, and also of the antagonism against that; something mean, plebeian there, redeemed only by intensity: the face of what is called a Fanatic,\u2014a sadly contracted Hero! We name him here because, with all his drawbacks, and they are many, he has the first and chief characteristic of a Hero: he is heartily in earnest. In earnest, if ever man was; as none of these French Philosophers were. Nay, one would say, of an earnestness too great for his otherwise sensitive, rather feeble nature; and which indeed in the end drove him into the strangest incoherences, almost delirations. There had come, at last, to be a kind of madness in him: his Ideas possessed him like demons; hurried him so about, drove him over steep places\u2014!\n\nThe fault and misery of Rousseau was what we easily name by a single word, Egoism; which is indeed the source and summary of all faults and miseries whatsoever. He had not perfected himself into victory over mere Desire; a mean Hunger, in many sorts, was still the motive principle of him. I am afraid he was a very vain man; hungry for the praises of men. You remember Genlis's experience of him. She took Jean Jacques to the Theatre; he bargaining for a strict incognito,\u2014\u201dHe would not be seen there for the world!\u201d The curtain did happen nevertheless to be drawn aside: the Pit recognized Jean Jacques, but took no great notice of him! He expressed the bitterest indignation; gloomed all evening, spake no other than surly words. The glib Countess remained entirely convinced that his anger was not at being seen, but at not being applauded when seen. How the whole nature of the man is poisoned; nothing but suspicion, self-isolation, fierce moody ways! He could not live with anybody. A man of some rank from the country, who visited him often, and used to sit with him, expressing all reverence and affection for him, comes one day; finds Jean Jacques full of the sourest unintelligible humor. \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said Jean Jacques, with flaming eyes, \u201cI know why you come here. You come to see what a poor life I lead; how little is in my poor pot that is boiling there. Well, look into the pot! There is half a pound of meat, one carrot and three onions; that is all: go and tell the whole world that, if you like, Monsieur!\u201d\u2014A man of this sort was far gone. The whole world got itself supplied with anecdotes, for light laughter, for a certain theatrical interest, from these perversions and contortions of poor Jean Jacques. Alas, to him they were not laughing or theatrical; too real to him! The contortions of a dying gladiator: the crowded amphitheatre looks on with entertainment; but the gladiator is in agonies and dying.\n\nAnd yet this Rousseau, as we say, with his passionate appeals to Mothers, with his contrat-social, with his celebrations of Nature, even of savage life in Nature, did once more touch upon Reality, struggle towards Reality; was doing the function of a Prophet to his Time. As he could, and as the Time could! Strangely through all that defacement, degradation and almost madness, there is in the inmost heart of poor Rousseau a spark of real heavenly fire. Once more, out of the element of that withered mocking Philosophism, Scepticism and Persiflage, there has arisen in this man the ineradicable feeling and knowledge that this Life of ours is true: not a Scepticism, Theorem, or Persiflage, but a Fact, an awful Reality. Nature had made that revelation to him; had ordered him to speak it out. He got it spoken out; if not well and clearly, then ill and dimly,\u2014as clearly as he could. Nay what are all errors and perversities of his, even those stealings of ribbons, aimless confused miseries and vagabondisms, if we will interpret them kindly, but the blinkard dazzlement and staggerings to and fro of a man sent on an errand he is too weak for, by a path he cannot yet find? Men are led by strange ways. One should have tolerance for a man, hope of him; leave him to try yet what he will do. While life lasts, hope lasts for every man.\n\nOf Rousseau's literary talents, greatly celebrated still among his countrymen, I do not say much. His Books, like himself, are what I call unhealthy; not the good sort of Books. There is a sensuality in Rousseau. Combined with such an intellectual gift as his, it makes pictures of a certain gorgeous attractiveness: but they are not genuinely poetical. Not white sunlight: something operatic; a kind of rose-pink, artificial bedizenment. It is frequent, or rather it is universal, among the French since his time. Madame de Stael has something of it; St. Pierre; and down onwards to the present astonishing convulsionary \u201cLiterature of Desperation,\u201d it is everywhere abundant. That same rose-pink is not the right hue. Look at a Shakspeare, at a Goethe, even at a Walter Scott! He who has once seen into this, has seen the difference of the True from the Sham-True, and will discriminate them ever afterwards.\n\nWe had to observe in Johnson how much good a Prophet, under all disadvantages and disorganizations, can accomplish for the world. In Rousseau we are called to look rather at the fearful amount of evil which, under such disorganization, may accompany the good. Historically it is a most pregnant spectacle, that of Rousseau. Banished into Paris garrets, in the gloomy company of his own Thoughts and Necessities there; driven from post to pillar; fretted, exasperated till the heart of him went mad, he had grown to feel deeply that the world was not his friend nor the world's law. It was expedient, if any way possible, that such a man should not have been set in flat hostility with the world. He could be cooped into garrets, laughed at as a maniac, left to starve like a wild beast in his cage;\u2014but he could not be hindered from setting the world on fire. The French Revolution found its Evangelist in Rousseau. His semi-delirious speculations on the miseries of civilized life, the preferability of the savage to the civilized, and such like, helped well to produce a whole delirium in France generally. True, you may well ask, What could the world, the governors of the world, do with such a man? Difficult to say what the governors of the world could do with him! What he could do with them is unhappily clear enough,\u2014guillotine a great many of them! Enough now of Rousseau.\n\nIt was a curious phenomenon, in the withered, unbelieving second-hand Eighteenth Century, that of a Hero starting up, among the artificial pasteboard figures and productions, in the guise of a Robert Burns. Like a little well in the rocky desert places,\u2014like a sudden splendor of Heaven in the artificial Vauxhall! People knew not what to make of it. They took it for a piece of the Vauxhall fire-work; alas, it let itself be so taken, though struggling half-blindly, as in bitterness of death, against that! Perhaps no man had such a false reception from his fellow-men. Once more a very wasteful life-drama was enacted under the sun.\n\nThe tragedy of Burns's life is known to all of you. Surely we may say, if discrepancy between place held and place merited constitute perverseness of lot for a man, no lot could be more perverse then Burns's. Among those second-hand acting-figures, mimes for most part, of the Eighteenth Century, once more a giant Original Man; one of those men who reach down to the perennial Deeps, who take rank with the Heroic among men: and he was born in a poor Ayrshire hut. The largest soul of all the British lands came among us in the shape of a hard-handed Scottish Peasant.\n\nHis Father, a poor toiling man, tried various things; did not succeed in any; was involved in continual difficulties. The Steward, Factor as the Scotch call him, used to send letters and threatenings, Burns says, \u201cwhich threw us all into tears.\u201d The brave, hard-toiling, hard-suffering Father, his brave heroine of a wife; and those children, of whom Robert was one! In this Earth, so wide otherwise, no shelter for them. The letters \u201cthrew us all into tears:\u201d figure it. The brave Father, I say always;\u2014a silent Hero and Poet; without whom the son had never been a speaking one! Burns's Schoolmaster came afterwards to London, learnt what good society was; but declares that in no meeting of men did he ever enjoy better discourse than at the hearth of this peasant. And his poor \u201cseven acres of nursery-ground,\u201d\u2014not that, nor the miserable patch of clay-farm, nor anything he tried to get a living by, would prosper with him; he had a sore unequal battle all his days. But he stood to it valiantly; a wise, faithful, unconquerable man;\u2014swallowing down how many sore sufferings daily into silence; fighting like an unseen Hero,\u2014nobody publishing newspaper paragraphs about his nobleness; voting pieces of plate to him! However, he was not lost; nothing is lost. Robert is there the outcome of him,\u2014and indeed of many generations of such as him.\n\nThis Burns appeared under every disadvantage: uninstructed, poor, born only to hard manual toil; and writing, when it came to that, in a rustic special dialect, known only to a small province of the country he lived in. Had he written, even what he did write, in the general language of England, I doubt not he had already become universally recognized as being, or capable to be, one of our greatest men. That he should have tempted so many to penetrate through the rough husk of that dialect of his, is proof that there lay something far from common within it. He has gained a certain recognition, and is continuing to do so over all quarters of our wide Saxon world: wheresoever a Saxon dialect is spoken, it begins to be understood, by personal inspection of this and the other, that one of the most considerable Saxon men of the Eighteenth Century was an Ayrshire Peasant named Robert Burns. Yes, I will say, here too was a piece of the right Saxon stuff: strong as the Harz-rock, rooted in the depths of the world;\u2014rock, yet with wells of living softness in it! A wild impetuous whirlwind of passion and faculty slumbered quiet there; such heavenly melody dwelling in the heart of it. A noble rough genuineness; homely, rustic, honest; true simplicity of strength; with its lightning-fire, with its soft dewy pity;\u2014like the old Norse Thor, the Peasant-god!\n\nBurns's Brother Gilbert, a man of much sense and worth, has told me that Robert, in his young days, in spite of their hardship, was usually the gayest of speech; a fellow of infinite frolic, laughter, sense and heart; far pleasanter to hear there, stript cutting peats in the bog, or such like, than he ever afterwards knew him. I can well believe it. This basis of mirth (\u201cfond gaillard,\u201d as old Marquis Mirabeau calls it), a primal element of sunshine and joyfulness, coupled with his other deep and earnest qualities, is one of the most attractive characteristics of Burns. A large fund of Hope dwells in him; spite of his tragical history, he is not a mourning man. He shakes his sorrows gallantly aside; bounds forth victorious over them. It is as the lion shaking \u201cdew-drops from his mane;\u201d as the swift-bounding horse, that laughs at the shaking of the spear.\u2014But indeed, Hope, Mirth, of the sort like Burns's, are they not the outcome properly of warm generous affection,\u2014such as is the beginning of all to every man?\n\nYou would think it strange if I called Burns the most gifted British soul we had in all that century of his: and yet I believe the day is coming when there will be little danger in saying so. His writings, all that he did under such obstructions, are only a poor fragment of him. Professor Stewart remarked very justly, what indeed is true of all Poets good for much, that his poetry was not any particular faculty; but the general result of a naturally vigorous original mind expressing itself in that way. Burns's gifts, expressed in conversation, are the theme of all that ever heard him. All kinds of gifts: from the gracefulest utterances of courtesy, to the highest fire of passionate speech; loud floods of mirth, soft wailings of affection, laconic emphasis, clear piercing insight; all was in him. Witty duchesses celebrate him as a man whose speech \u201cled them off their feet.\u201d This is beautiful: but still more beautiful that which Mr. Lockhart has recorded, which I have more than once alluded to, How the waiters and ostlers at inns would get out of bed, and come crowding to hear this man speak! Waiters and ostlers:\u2014they too were men, and here was a man! I have heard much about his speech; but one of the best things I ever heard of it was, last year, from a venerable gentleman long familiar with him. That it was speech distinguished by always having something in it. \u201cHe spoke rather little than much,\u201d this old man told me; \u201csat rather silent in those early days, as in the company of persons above him; and always when he did speak, it was to throw new light on the matter.\u201d I know not why any one should ever speak otherwise!\u2014But if we look at his general force of soul, his healthy robustness every way, the rugged downrightness, penetration, generous valor and manfulness that was in him,\u2014where shall we readily find a better-gifted man?\n\nAmong the great men of the Eighteenth Century, I sometimes feel as if Burns might be found to resemble Mirabeau more than any other. They differ widely in vesture; yet look at them intrinsically. There is the same burly thick-necked strength of body as of soul;\u2014built, in both cases, on what the old Marquis calls a fond gaillard. By nature, by course of breeding, indeed by nation, Mirabeau has much more of bluster; a noisy, forward, unresting man. But the characteristic of Mirabeau too is veracity and sense, power of true insight, superiority of vision. The thing that he says is worth remembering. It is a flash of insight into some object or other: so do both these men speak. The same raging passions; capable too in both of manifesting themselves as the tenderest noble affections. Wit; wild laughter, energy, directness, sincerity: these were in both. The types of the two men are not dissimilar. Burns too could have governed, debated in National Assemblies; politicized, as few could. Alas, the courage which had to exhibit itself in capture of smuggling schooners in the Solway Frith; in keeping silence over so much, where no good speech, but only inarticulate rage was possible: this might have bellowed forth Ushers de Breze and the like; and made itself visible to all men, in managing of kingdoms, in ruling of great ever-memorable epochs! But they said to him reprovingly, his Official Superiors said, and wrote: \u201cYou are to work, not think.\u201d Of your thinking-faculty, the greatest in this land, we have no need; you are to gauge beer there; for that only are you wanted. Very notable;\u2014and worth mentioning, though we know what is to be said and answered! As if Thought, Power of Thinking, were not, at all times, in all places and situations of the world, precisely the thing that was wanted. The fatal man, is he not always the unthinking man, the man who cannot think and see; but only grope, and hallucinate, and missee the nature of the thing he works with? He mis-sees it, mistakes it as we say; takes it for one thing, and it is another thing,\u2014and leaves him standing like a Futility there! He is the fatal man; unutterably fatal, put in the high places of men.\u2014\u201dWhy complain of this?\u201d say some: \u201cStrength is mournfully denied its arena; that was true from of old.\u201d Doubtless; and the worse for the arena, answer I! Complaining profits little; stating of the truth may profit. That a Europe, with its French Revolution just breaking out, finds no need of a Burns except for gauging beer,\u2014is a thing I, for one, cannot rejoice at\u2014!\n\nOnce more we have to say here, that the chief quality of Burns is the sincerity of him. So in his Poetry, so in his Life. The song he sings is not of fantasticalities; it is of a thing felt, really there; the prime merit of this, as of all in him, and of his Life generally, is truth. The Life of Burns is what we may call a great tragic sincerity. A sort of savage sincerity,\u2014not cruel, far from that; but wild, wrestling naked with the truth of things. In that sense, there is something of the savage in all great men.\n\nHero-worship,\u2014Odin, Burns? Well; these Men of Letters too were not without a kind of Hero-worship: but what a strange condition has that got into now! The waiters and ostlers of Scotch inns, prying about the door, eager to catch any word that fell from Burns, were doing unconscious reverence to the Heroic. Johnson had his Boswell for worshipper. Rousseau had worshippers enough; princes calling on him in his mean garret; the great, the beautiful doing reverence to the poor moon-struck man. For himself a most portentous contradiction; the two ends of his life not to be brought into harmony. He sits at the tables of grandees; and has to copy music for his own living. He cannot even get his music copied: \u201cBy dint of dining out,\u201d says he, \u201cI run the risk of dying by starvation at home.\u201d For his worshippers too a most questionable thing! If doing Hero-worship well or badly be the test of vital well-being or ill-being to a generation, can we say that these generations are very first-rate?\u2014And yet our heroic Men of Letters do teach, govern, are kings, priests, or what you like to call them; intrinsically there is no preventing it by any means whatever. The world has to obey him who thinks and sees in the world. The world can alter the manner of that; can either have it as blessed continuous summer sunshine, or as unblessed black thunder and tornado,\u2014with unspeakable difference of profit for the world! The manner of it is very alterable; the matter and fact of it is not alterable by any power under the sky. Light; or, failing that, lightning: the world can take its choice. Not whether we call an Odin god, prophet, priest, or what we call him; but whether we believe the word he tells us: there it all lies. If it be a true word, we shall have to believe it; believing it, we shall have to do it. What name or welcome we give him or it, is a point that concerns ourselves mainly. It, the new Truth, new deeper revealing of the Secret of this Universe, is verily of the nature of a message from on high; and must and will have itself obeyed.\u2014\n\nMy last remark is on that notablest phasis of Burns's history,\u2014his visit to Edinburgh. Often it seems to me as if his demeanor there were the highest proof he gave of what a fund of worth and genuine manhood was in him. If we think of it, few heavier burdens could be laid on the strength of a man. So sudden; all common Lionism. which ruins innumerable men, was as nothing to this. It is as if Napoleon had been made a King of, not gradually, but at once from the Artillery Lieutenancy in the Regiment La Fere. Burns, still only in his twenty-seventh year, is no longer even a ploughman; he is flying to the West Indies to escape disgrace and a jail. This month he is a ruined peasant, his wages seven pounds a year, and these gone from him: next month he is in the blaze of rank and beauty, handing down jewelled Duchesses to dinner; the cynosure of all eyes! Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man; but for one man who can stand prosperity, there are a hundred that will stand adversity. I admire much the way in which Burns met all this. Perhaps no man one could point out, was ever so sorely tried, and so little forgot himself. Tranquil, unastonished; not abashed, not inflated, neither awkwardness nor affectation: he feels that he there is the man Robert Burns; that the \u201crank is but the guinea-stamp;\u201d that the celebrity is but the candle-light, which will show what man, not in the least make him a better or other man! Alas, it may readily, unless he look to it, make him a worse man; a wretched inflated wind-bag,\u2014inflated till he burst, and become a dead lion; for whom, as some one has said, \u201cthere is no resurrection of the body;\u201d worse than a living dog!\u2014Burns is admirable here.\n\nAnd yet, alas, as I have observed elsewhere, these Lion-hunters were the ruin and death of Burns. It was they that rendered it impossible for him to live! They gathered round him in his Farm; hindered his industry; no place was remote enough from them. He could not get his Lionism forgotten, honestly as he was disposed to do so. He falls into discontents, into miseries, faults; the world getting ever more desolate for him; health, character, peace of mind, all gone;\u2014solitary enough now. It is tragical to think of! These men came but to see him; it was out of no sympathy with him, nor no hatred to him. They came to get a little amusement; they got their amusement;\u2014and the Hero's life went for it!\n\nRichter says, in the Island of Sumatra there is a kind of \u201cLight-chafers,\u201d large Fire-flies, which people stick upon spits, and illuminate the ways with at night. Persons of condition can thus travel with a pleasant radiance, which they much admire. Great honor to the Fire-flies! But\u2014!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/774737", "artist_names": "Billy J.

Romance\n\nScreenplay by Quentin Tarantino\n\nWhen you are tired of relationships, try a romance.\n\nINT. BAR \u221a NIGHT\n\nA smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.\n\nCLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older\nlady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But,\nyou can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.\nCLARENCE\nIn \"Jailhouse Rock\" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is\nrockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck\nabout anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and\nleaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big\nhe's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and\nhe's singing, \"Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care\". Now, they got\nhim dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this\nhorrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him\nwearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party,\nbig house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd\nwatch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm\nno fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most\nwomen. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too cause my\nlife depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.\n\nLucy takes a drag from her cigarette.\n\nLUCY\nI'd fuck Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nReally?\n\nLUCY\nWhen he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.\nCLARENCE\nI don't blame you.\n(they laugh)\nSo we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests,\nisn't it?\n\nLucy laughs.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, enough about the King, how 'bout you?\n\nLUCY\nHow 'bout me what?\n\nCLARENCE\nHow 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?\n\nLUCY\nWhat are we gonna see?\n\nCLARENCE\nA Donny Chiba triple feature. \"The Streetfighter\", \"Return of the\nStreetfighter\", and \"Sister Streetfighter\".\n\nLUCY\nWho's Sonny Chiba?\nCLARENCE\nHe is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.\n\nLUCY\n(not believing this)\nYou wanna take me to a kung fu movie?\n\nCLARENCE\n(holding up three fingers)\nThree kung fu movies.\n\nLucy takes a drag from her cigarette.\n\nLUCY\n(laughing)\nI don't think so, not my cup of tea.\n\nINT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nThe sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots\nand violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained\nblack.\n\nOn the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of\ncocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the\nsuitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. \"Bewitched\" is\nplaying.\n\nAt the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and\nFLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic\nbags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't\nknow it listen to him.\n\nDREXL\nNigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.\n\nFLOYD\nNaw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.\n\nDREXL\nThat's bullshit.\n\nBIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl\nand Floyd. Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in\ntwo greasy brown-paper bags.\n\nFLOYD\nNaw man, that's some serious shit.\n\nDREXL\nNigger, you lie like a big dog.\n\nBIG D\nWhat the fuck are you talkin' about?\nDREXL\nFloyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.\nBIG D\nShit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.\nDREXL\nI heard that.\nFLOYD\nHold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?\nBIG D\nNigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every\nmotherfuckin' thang.\n\nDREXL\nPreach on, Big D.\n\nFLOYD\nLook here. If I ever did eat some pussy \u221a I would never eat any pussy \u221a but,\nif I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be\nashamed as a motherfucker.\n\nBIG D\nShit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass\nthings. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin'\nniggers' dicks.\n\nDREXL\nHeard that.\n\nDrexl and Big D bump fists.\n\nFLOYD\nYeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.\n(he takes a hit off of a joint)\nThere used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their\npussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with\nwhite boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit \u221a\n\nDREXL\n\u221a Because it's good!\n\nFLOYD\nThen, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because\nyou white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for\nevery nigger in the world everywhere.\n\nBIG D\nDrexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to\nexpress our gratitude \u221a\n\nDrexl and Big D bust up.\n\nFLOYD\nGo on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got\npussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to\ndo a bunch of fucked-up shit.\n\nBIG D\nSo you do eat pussy!\n\nFLOYD\nNaw naw!\n\nBIG D\nYou don't like it, but you eat that shit.\n(to Drexl)\nHe eats it.\n\nDREXL\nDamn skippy. He like it, too.\n\nBIG D\n(mock English accent)\nMe thinketh he doth protest too much.\n\nFLOYD\nWell fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!\n\nDREXL\nWhy you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question.\nYou with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch \u221a you're with\nJayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say \"Bitch, suck my\ndick!\" and then Jayne Kennedy says, \"First things first, nigger, I ain't\nsuckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!\" Now, what\ndo you say?\n\nFLOYD\nI tell Jayne Kennedy, \"Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!\"\n\nBIG D\nNigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne\nCounty so fast \u221a\n\nDREXL\nNigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.\n\nFLOYD\nI'd say fuck it!\n\nDrexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd\nsitting all alone.\n\nBig D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching \"Bewitched\".\n\nFLOYD\n(yelling after them)\nAin't no man have to eat pussy!\n\nBIG D\n(not even looking)\nTake that shit somewhere else.\n\nDRXL\n(marching back)\nYou tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?\n\nFLOYD\nIf it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.\n\nDREXL\nWith that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy,\nkiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger,\nyou'd aim to please.\n\nBIG D\n(glued on TV)\nI'm hip.\n\nDREXL\nIn fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D,\ntoss me that shotgun.\n\nWithout turning away from \"Bewitched\" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to\nDrexl.\n\nDREXL\n(to Floyd)\nAll right, check this out.\n(referring to shotgun)\nNow, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.\n\nThen, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.\n\nBig D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.\n\nDrexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.\n\nThe blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.\n\nDrexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.\n\nBig D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.\n\nDrexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front\ndoor he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.\n\nEXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR \u221a MORNING\n\nA big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a\nbackdrop. The song \"Little Bitty Tear\" is heard a capella.\n\nINT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR \u221a MORNING\n\nCLIFF WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently\nto the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In\nbetween singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a\nsecurity guard uniform.\n\nEXT. TRAILER PARK \u221a MORNING\n\nCliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see\nsomething that stops him short.\n\nCLIFF'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD\n\nClarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front\nof his trailer.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a CLIFF\n\nUpon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLIFF'S POV\n\nClarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face\nthrough the driver's side window.\n\nCLARENCE\nGood Morning, Daddy. Long time no see.\n\nINT. TRAILER HOME \u221a MORNING\n\nAll three enter the trailer home.\n\nCLIFF\nExcuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if\nI'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected\nto see this morning.\n\nClarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin'\non thirst, you got anything to drink?\n\nHe moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.\n\nCLIFF\nI think there's a Seven-Up in there.\n\nCLARENCE\n(rumaging around the fridge)\nAnything stronger?\n(pause)\nOh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?\n\nCLIFF\nI can, but I don't.\n\nCLARENCE\n(closing the fridge)\nThat's about all I ever eat.\n\nCliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him.\n\nCLIFF\n(to Girl)\nI'm sorry... I'm his father.\n\nYOUNG GIRL\n(sticking her hand out)\nThat's OK, I'm his wife.\n(shaking his hand vigorously)\nAlabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.\n\nShe is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's\nwhere the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.\n\nClarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit\nmagnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.\n\nCLARENCE\nOh yeah, we got married.\n(referring to the magnets)\nYou still have these.\n(to Alabama)\nThis isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one.\nI never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a\nsport and go get us some beer. I want some beer.\n(to Cliff)\nDo you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here.\n\nHe hands her some money and his car keys.\n\nCLARENCE\nGo to the liquor store \u221a\n(to Cliff)\nWhere is there a liquor store around here?\n\nCLIFF\nUh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nGet a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get\ncause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if\nnot, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look,\nsince you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a\nfoot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-\nDongs.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food.

Is\nshe a four alarm fire, or what?\n\nCLIFF\nShe seems very nice.\n\nCLARENCE\nDaddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only\nword for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in\nlove with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's\nwritten all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we\ngotta talk \u221a\n\nCLIFF\nClarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how\nmuch like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and\nthrough. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a\nsudden at eight o'clock in the morning.

Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for\nthe part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's\nhanging on the hood.

I've tried to\nmake your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced\nyou, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a\nyear at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always \"OK\",\n\"No problem\", \"You're a busy guy, I understand\". The whole time you\nwere a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No!\nEverybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad\nparent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm\nbasically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask.\nAnd if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone.

That guy wasn't just some wild flake.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops\naren't looking for me?\n\nCLIFF\nNaw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou\nhad a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nClarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.\n\nCLARENCE\nThanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.\n\nCLIFF\nI got some money I can give you \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nKeep it.\n\nCLIFF\nWell, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and\nAlabama.

Remeber, you got a wife to think about.\nQuit fuckin' around.\n(pause)\nI love you son.\n\nThey hug each other,\n\nClarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but\nyou can get a hold of me through him.\n\nClarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her.\n\nCLARENCE\nBama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye,\n\nAlabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff\nand gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's\nbubbling like a Fresca.\n\nALABAMA\nBye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.\n\nCLARENCE\n(mock anger)\nWhat kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?\n\nALABAMA\nOh, hush up.\n\nThe two get into the Mustang.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Cliff)\nWe'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.\n\nClarence starts the engine.

I'm\nnot quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it.\nWanna say hi to my better half?\n\nBefore Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.\n\nALABAMA\nHi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.\n\nDICK\nHello, Alabama.\n\nALABAMA\nI can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were\nhis best friend.

TRAILER \u221a DAY\n\nA lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in\nfront of it in the shape of a planet.\n\nA big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly\nless kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a\nfast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.\n\nINT. TRAILER \u221a DAY\n\nHe steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to\nhis temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.\n\nGUN CARRIER (DARIO)\nWelcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.\n\nCliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men,\nstanding: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy),\nand TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fireplug pitbull type).\n\nSitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid\nmob leader Blue Lou Boyle.\n\nCliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario\nand Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(to Frankie)\nTell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.\n\nIn Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.\n\nCliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff.\nFrankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his\nhand, but he has yet to touch a drop.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nDo you know who I am, Mr. Worley?\n\nCLIFF\nI give up. Who are you?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell\nthe angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly\npersonified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is\nVincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man\nyour son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard\nof us before. Am I correct?\n\nCLIFF\nI've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question\nyou've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and,\nat the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.\n(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)\nWant a Chesterfield?\n\nCLIFF\nNo.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(as he lights up)\nI have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful\nthis must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his\nbrought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road\nwith 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a\nchoice.\n\nCLIFF\nLook, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence \u221a\n\nBefore Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with\nhis fist.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSmarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that\npain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any\nkind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna\nget, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors.\nThey saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in\nfront of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?\n\nCliff's defeated.\n\nCLIFF\nI've seen him.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nNow I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance\nyou're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore\nyour boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't\njust mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity.\nWell, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do\nsome business, cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room\nblastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat are you talkin' about?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it\noutta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is,\nleft his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the\ncommode filled in all the blanks.\n\nCLIFF\nI don't believe you.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nThat's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that\nI believe you. Where did they go?\n\nCLIFF\nOn their honeymoon.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they\ngo?\n\nCLIFF\nThey didn't tell me.\n\nCoccotti looks at him.\n\nCLIFF\nNow, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years.\nYesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me\nhe needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could\nborrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a\ncheck. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me\nGod. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never\nthought to ask.\n\nCoccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil,\nquick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then\nwhips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal\non the wound. Cliff screams.\n\nCoccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.\n\nTooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in\nthe car.\n\nVirgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm\nin agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old\nman was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from\ngrowin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen\ndifferent things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has\nseventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen.\nAnd if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to\nhell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna\nshow me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know\nwhere they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away\nfrom.\n\nThe awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart.\nHe looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.\n\nCLIFF\nCould I have one of those Chesterfields now?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSure.\n\nCoccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.\n\nCLIFF\nGot a match?\n\nCliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.\n\nCLIFF\nOh, don't bother. I got one.\n(he lights the cigarette)\nSo you're a Sicilian, huh?\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(intensly)\nUh-huh.\n\nCLIFF\nYou know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find\nthat shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians\nwere spawned by niggers.\n\nAll the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic\nVic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what\nhe's hearing.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nCome again?\n\nCLIFF\nIt's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you\ndon't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago\nthe Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then,\nSicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But,\nonce the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did\nso much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for\never, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it\nabsolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later,\nSicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's\nwritten. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-\ngrandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a\nfact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?\n\nCoccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic,\ngrabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets\nthrough Cliff's head.\n\nHe pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his\nfeelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon,\nand turns to his men.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity\nin fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this\ncomedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me\nwhere that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this\nfucked-up family for good.\n\nTooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was\nall about.\n\nLenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer.\nWhen he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic\nbanana magnet that says: \"Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and\naddress)\".\n\nLENNY\nBoss, get ready to get happy.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A.\"\n\nINT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a MORNING\n\nDick's asleep in a recliner. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His\nroom-mate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV.\n\nThe sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the\nbats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles\nstanding in his doorway.\n\nClarence and Alabama immediately start singing \"Hello My Baby\" like the frog\nin the old Chuck Jones cartoon.\n\nCLARENCE/ALABAMA\nHello my baby,\nHello my honey,\nHello my ragtime gal \u221a\n\nDICK\nHi guys.\n\nAlabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss. After she\nbreaks, Clarence does the same. Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick\nand into his apartment.\n\nCLARENCE\nWow. Neat place.\n\nINT.

PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND \u221a PATIO \u221a DAY\n\nClarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on\nchili dogs. Alabama is in the middle of a story.\n\nALABAMA\n... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid\nbefore, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished,\ncrowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and\nmy dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow\nzonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus\nappears, and the bus-driver says, \"Get her in here.\". He forgot all about his\nroute and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice\nguy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well,\nhis name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da\nbeen a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was\nfrom. And, so there you go.\n\nCLARENCE\nAnd here we are.\n\nDICK\nThat's a pretty amazing story.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?\n\nDICK\nJust like in Detroit, only skinnier.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou goin' out?\n\nDICK\nWell, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my\nacting class.\n\nCLARENCE\nGood for you.\n\nDICK\nWhat's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head\nbunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional\ninstability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a\nreally good reading for \"T.J. Hooker\" the other day.\n\nALABAMA\nYou're gonna be on \"T.J. Hooker\"?\n\nDICK\nKnock wood.\n\nHe knocks the table and then looks at it.\n\nDICK\n... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid you meet Captain Kirk?\n\nDICK\nYou don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.\n\nALABAMA\n(finishing her hot-dog)\nThat was so good I am gonna have another.\n\nDICK\nYou can't have just one.\n\nAlabama leaves to get another hot-dog. Clarence never takes his eyes off her.\n\nDICK\nHow much of that letter was on the up and up?\n\nCLARENCE\nEvery word of it.\n\nDick sees where Clarence's attention is.\n\nDICK\nYou're really in love, aren't you?\n\nCLARENCE\nFor the very first time in my life.\n(pause)\nDo you know what that's like?\n\nClarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer.\n\nDICK\n(regretfully)\nNo, I don't\n(he looks at Alabama)\nHow did you two meet?\n\nClarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you remember The Lyric?\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nSonny Chiba, as \"Streetfighter\" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists\nand feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen.\n\nClarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on\npopcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face.\n\nEXT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nA cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric. The marquee carries the names of the\ntriple feature: \"The Streetfighter\", \"Return of the Streetfighter\" and \"Sister\nStreetfighter\". Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office.\n\nA BOX OFFICE GIRL reading comic looks at her.\n\nALABAMA\nOne please.\n\nBOX OFFICE GIRL\nNinety-nine cents.\n\nALABAMA\nWhich one is on now?\n\nBOX OFFICE GIRL\n\"Return of the Streetfighter\". It's been on about forty-five minutes.\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a LOBBY \u221a NIGHT\n\nAlabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand. A\nYOUNG USHER takes care of her.\n\nALABAMA\nCan I have a medium popcorn? A super-large Mr. Pibb, and a box of\nGoobers.\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-\ncomers.\n\nAlabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food. She makes a quick\nscan of the theater. Not many people are there. She makes a beeline for the\nfront whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks the row of seats\njust behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it.\n\nClarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him. He\nturns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious.\n\nWhen Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine\nbottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nOh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm the clumsiest person in the world.\n\nCLARENCE\n(picking popcorn out of his hair)\nIt's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.\n\nALABAMA\n(picking popcorn out of his hair)\nWhat a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You\ncould have been a real dick.\n\nAlabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.\n\nClarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into\nthe movie.\n\nThey both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama leans forward and\ntaps Clarence on the shoulder.\n\nALABAMA\nExcuse me... I hate to bother you again. Would you mind too terribly filling\nme in on what I missed?\n\nJumping on this opportunity.\n\nCLARENCE\nNot at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.\n\nALABAMA\nThe oriental.\n\nCLARENCE\nThe oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired\nto kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into\nthe police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while\nkeepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a\nnumber on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the\nwindow. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.\n\nALABAMA\nWant some Goobers?\n\nCLARENCE\nThanks a lot.\n\nALABAMA\nI thought Sonny was the good guy.\n\nCLARENCE\nHe ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be\nbullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.\n\nThey both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses.\n\nTIME CUT:\n\nOn the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him.\nTHE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen.\n\nThe theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence.\nThey're both applauding.\n\nALABAMA\nGreat movie. Action-packed!\n\nCLARENCE\nDoes Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?\n\nALABAMA\nSonny kicks ass.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the \"Streetfighter\". It\nwas the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the\nR.\n\nALABAMA\nIf that was the R, I'd love to see the X.\n\nCLARENCE\nMy name is Clarence, and what is yours?\n\nALABAMA\nAlabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs that your real name? Really?\n\nALABAMA\nThat's my real name, really. I got proof. See.\n\nShe shows Clarence her driver's license.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker\nthere, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie.\n(announcer voice)\nShe's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She\ncarried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,\nand the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!\nPray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!\n\nEXT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the\nbackground they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and\nAlabama break up laughing.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhere's your car? I'll walk you to it.\n\nALABAMA\nI took a cab.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou took a cab to see three kung fu movies?\n\nALABAMA\nSure. Why not?\n\nCLARENCE\nNothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat time is it?\n\nCLARENCE\n'Bout twelve.\n\nALABAMA\nI suppose you gotta get up early, huh?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo. Not particularly.\n(pause)\nHow come?\n\nALABAMA\nWell, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get\nsome pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after\nyou've seen a good movie?\n\nCLARENCE\nI love to get pie after a movie.\n\nALABAMA\nWould you like to get some pie?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'd love some pie.\n\nINT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about\n12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke.\nAlabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, enough about the King. How about you?\n\nALABAMA\nHow 'bout me what?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell me about yourself.\n\nALABAMA\nThere's nothing to tell.\n\nCLARENCE\nC'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?\n\nALABAMA\nWhat do you want to know?\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your\nfavorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you\nlike? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's\nthe story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?\nAnd, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\nAlabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nAsk me them again. One by one.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat do you do?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't remember.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhere are you from.\n\nALABAMA\nMight be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's your favorite color?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's your favorite movie star?\n\nALABAMA\nBurt Reynolds.\n\nCLARENCE\nWould you like a bite of my pie?\n\nALABAMA\nYes, I would.\n\nClarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike it?\n\nALABAMA\nVery much. Now, where were we?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat kinda music do you like?\n\nALABAMA\nPhil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like \"He's a Rebel\".\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat are your turn-ons?\n\nALABAMA\nMickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like\nElvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.\n\nCLARENCE\nTurn-offs?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only\nthing that comes to mind are Persians.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you have a fella?\n\nShe looks at Clarence and smiles.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of\ntown alone?\n\nALABAMA\nApparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a\nform of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or\nwhere I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even\nknow my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a\nTallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they\ntold me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on\nme, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For\nsome reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told\nhim to stop and I got out.\n\nCLARENCE\nAnd in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\nALABAMA\nBecause you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure\ncouldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.\n\nClarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until\nit makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul.\n\nA smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.\n\nALABAMA\nAren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy?\n(eats her last piece of pie)\nWhere to next?\n\nINT. COMIC BOOK STORE \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a\ncomic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-\ncool.\n\nALABAMA\nWow. What a swell place to work.\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books,\nplay music.\n\nALABAMA\nHow long have you worked here?\n\nCLARENCE\nAlmost four years.\n\nALABAMA\nThat's a long time.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what\nI'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most\nof the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.\n\nALABAMA\nDo you get paid a lot?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow\nsome money if you need it. Wanna see what \"Spiderman\" number one\nlooks like?\n\nALABAMA\nYou bet. How much is that worth?\n\nClarence gets a box off the shelf.\n\nCLARENCE\nFour hundred bucks.\n\nALABAMA\nI didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" Lunch\nboxes. \"Green Hornet\" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are\nmain business. There's a lot of collectors around here.\n\nShe holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat's that?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's a \"Rookies\" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls.\nThey're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors\nin \"The Black Hole\"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid\nplayin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.\n\nHe pulls a plastic-cased \"Spiderman\" comic form the box.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Spiderman\", number one. The one that started it all.\n\nClarence shows the comic book to Alabama.\n\nALABAMA\nGod, Spiderman looks different.\n\nCLARENCE\nHe was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr.\nGene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just\ndisguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold\non, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.\n\nHe pulls out another comic.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\". One of the coolest series known\nto man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about\nfour bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.\n(he opens one up)\nJust look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look at\nthis one.\n\nWe see the \"Sgt. Fury\" panels.\n\nCLARENCE\nNick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on\na chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a\nship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain\nand the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. Isn't\nthat cool?\n\nShe's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze.\n\nCLARENCE\nAlabama, I'd like you to have this.\n\nClarence hands her the \"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\" comic book\nthat he loves so much.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis,\nanything you can imagine. The two walk through the door.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat a cool room!\n\nShe runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.\n\nLater. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album.\nClarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.\n\nALABAMA\nOooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you\nthen?\n\nCLARENCE\nFive.\n\nShe turns the page.\n\nALABAMA\nOh, you look so cute as little Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nI finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.\n\nLATER \u221a LIVING ROOM\n\nClarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's\n\"Piece of My Heart\".\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know when you sat behind me?\n\nALABAMA\nAt the movies?\n\nCLARENCE\nUh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she\ndoesn't want me bothering her.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat would make you think that?\n\nCLARENCE\nI dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.\n\nALABAMA\nYou're not stupid. Just wrong.\n\nThey move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the\nsong.\n\nALABAMA\nI love Janis.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.\n\nALABAMA\nShe OD'd, didn't she?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too\nmuch. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what\nshe took.\n\nALABAMA\nYou mean she got a bad batch?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the\nhappiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't\ntrust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her\nto marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she\ncouldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money.\nSo, she said no. And the guy says, \"Look, I really love you, and I wanna\nprove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what\nhappens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it.\" So she did,\nand he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her\na secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.\n\nALABAMA\nSo he really loved her?\n\nCLARENCE\nUh-huh.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a DAY\n\nIt's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks\naround, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a\nrobe and investigates.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a LIVING ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair\ncrying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?\n\nALABAMA\nYou didn't do nothing.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid you hurt yourself?\n(he takes her foot)\nWhatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?\n\nALABAMA\nClarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the\ntheater. I was paid to be there.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls.\nMake sure they're not rippin' the place off.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.\n\nPause.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou're a whore?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.\n(pause)\nI don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that\ncomic book place.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Heroes For Sale\"?\n\nALABAMA\nYeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.\n\nCLARENCE\nWho?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into\nyou, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was\ngonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I\nwas leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich\nmillionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat dazzling imagination.\n\nALABAMA\nIt's over on the TV. All it says is: \"Dear Clarence.\" I couldn't write\nanymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to\never see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that\nmuch fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, \"Alabama, come clean, Let him\nknow what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to\nDrexl and fuck yourself.\"\n\nCLARENCE\nWho and what is a Drexl?\n\nALABAMA\nMy pimp.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou have a pimp?\n\nALABAMA\nUh-huh.\n\nCLARENCE\nA real live pimp?\n\nALABAMA\nUh-huh.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he black?\n\nALABAMA\nHe thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he nice?\n\nALABAMA\nWell, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty\ndecent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with\nArlene the other day.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat did he do to Arlene?\n\nALABAMA\nSlapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis motherfucker sounds charming!\n\nClarence is on his feet, furious.\n\nCLARENCE\nGoddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much\nlonger before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How\nthe fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first\nplace?\n\nALABAMA\nAt the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an\nagency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They\nhave a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-\ncollar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five\nhundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry\nbeepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in \"Dressed to Kill\". And when I was\nready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says\nhe makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's\ngonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or\nwind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the\nropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last\nnight. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it\nwas a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a\nsecond date.\n\nCLARENCE\nThank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again.\nBama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went\ntogether all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it,\nyou wanna marry me?\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nWill you be my wife?\n\nWhen Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.\n\nALABAMA\nYes.\n\nCLARENCE\n(a little surprised)\nYou will?\n\nALABAMA\nYou better not be fucking teasing me.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou better not be fuckin' teasin' me.\n\nThey seal it with a kiss.\n\nLATER \u221a THAT NIGHT\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Alabama's wedding ring.\n\nThe newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV. The movie\nthey're watching is \"The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the\nFlying Guillotine\". Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks\ndown to admre the ring on her hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid ya ever see \"The Chinese Professionals\"?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't believe so.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the\nIncredible One-Armed Boxer.\n\nWe hear, off screen, the TV Announcer say:\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\n(off)\nWe'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in... \"The Incredible One-Armed Boxer\nvs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine\", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after\nthese important messages...\n\nClarence looks at the TV. He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his.\nWe see commercials playing.\n\nHe turns in her direction. She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring.\n\nHe smiles and turns back to the TV.\n\nMore commercials.\n\nDolly close on Clarence's face\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nAlabama, right after he proposed.\n\nALABAMA\nYou better not be fucking teasing me.\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nIn a cute, all-night wedding chapel.

Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you\nseen your lovely wife today?\n\nCLARENCE\nOh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.\n\nALABAMA\nOf course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?\n\nMoving on top of her.\n\nCLARENCE\nNot for me.\n\nHe starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat. She resists.\n\nALABAMA\n(playfully)\nNo no no no no no no no no...\n\nCLARENCE\n(playfully)\nYes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nA big mean-looking BLACK MAN in pimp's clothes.\n\nPIMP\nBitch, you better git yo ass back on the street an' git me my money.\n\nPimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving her a sales pitch to\na potential customer.\n\nPIMP\nI'm tellin' you, my man, this bitch is fine.

There's definitely something different about his eyes.\n\nClarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom. Alabama's startled\nby his sudden movement.\n\nALABAMA\n(yelling after him)\nWhere you goin', honey?\n\nCLARENCE\n(off)\nI just gotta get somethin'.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BATHROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep\npolluting his mind. Then, he hears a familiar voice.\n\nFAMILIAR VOICE\n(off)\nWell? Can you live with it?\n\nClarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley. Clarence isn't surprised to see him.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nELVIS\nCan you live with it?\n\nCLARENCE\nLive with what?\n\nELVIS\nWith that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you?\nAnd gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah.\n\nELVIS\nYou wanna get unhaunted?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah.\n\nELVIS\nThen shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.\n\nCLARENCE\nI can't believe what you're tellin' me.\n\nELVIS\nI ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou'd really do that?\n\nELVIS\nHe don't got no right to live.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to\nkill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.\n\nELVIS\nI don't blame you.\n\nCLARENCE\nIf I thought I could get away with it \u221a\n\nELVIS\nKillin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya\nthink the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find\nwho done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole\nwide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught\nat the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.\n\nClarence looks at Elvis.\n\nELVIS\nClarence, I like ya. Always have, always will.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a A snub-nosed .38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his\nheavy athletic sock.\n\nINT. CALRENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a LIVING ROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence returns.\n\nCLARENCE\nSweetheart, write down your former address.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nWrite down Drexl's address.\n\nALABAMA\nWhy?\n\nCLARENCE\nSo I can go over there and pick up your things.\n\nALABAMA\n(really scared)\nNo, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.\n\nHe kneels down before her and holds her hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker.\nHe can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses\nabsolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it\nwould be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?\n\nALABAMA\nYou don't know him \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I\nneed for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down\nthe address.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"CASS QUARTER, HEART OF DETROIT\"\n\nEXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack\ndab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his\nneck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis\nPresley gyration.\n\nCLARENCE\n(in Elvis voice)\nYeah... Yeah...\n\nHe makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building.\n\nINT. DARK BUILDING \u221a NIGHT\n\nHe's inside. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey. Clarence knock on the door.\n\nA YOUNG BLACK MAN, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has\nreally big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey.\n\nYOUNG BLACK MAN\nYou want somethin'?\n\nCLARENCE\nDrexl?\n\nYOUNG BLACK MAN\nNaw, man, I'm Marty. Watcha want?\n\nCLARENCE\nI gotta talk to Drexl.\n\nMARTY\nWell, what the fuck you wanna tell him?\n\nCLARENCE\nIt's about Alabama.\n\nA figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt. It's our\nfriend, Drexl Spivey.\n\nDREXL\nWhere the fuck is that bitch?\n\nCLARENCE\nShe's with me.\n\nDREXL\nWho the fuck are you?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm her husband.\n\nDREXL\nWell. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.\n\nINT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nDrexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation\nthey were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the\nconfrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nWhat was I sayin'?\n\nMARTY\nRock whores.\n\nDREXL\nYou ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They\ngot that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you.\nThey give you hips, lips, and fingertips.\n\nDrexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nYou know what I'm talkin' about.\n\nDrexl gestures to one of the THREE STONED HOOKERS lounging about the\napartment.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nThese bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get\nthe kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.\n\nDrexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-\nout boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV.\n\nDREXL\nLooky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with\nCherry Seven-Up.\n\nMARTY\nPussy love pink rocks.\n\nThis is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he\nexpected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table,\ndemanding Drexl's attention.\n\nDREXL\n(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence)\nGrab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We\ngot everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo thanks.\n\nDREXL\nNo thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down\nhere? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to\nbe eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've\nalready given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly\nwhere your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some\ndinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to\nmyself, \"This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the\nworld. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad\nmotherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my\nChinese, watch my TV.\" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV\nthere, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out,\nand you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I\nknow I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.\n\nClarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not eatin' cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' cause I'm not stayin'.\nI'm not lookin' at the movie cause I saw it seven years ago. It's \"The\nMack\" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by\nBobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama\nReleasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In\nthat envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener\npastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker.\nI never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that\nenvelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much.\nNot one penny more, not one penny more.\n\nYou could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full\nalert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl.\nDrexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.\n\nDREXL\nIt's empty.\n\nClarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, \"That's right, asshole.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nDREXL\nOooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we\ngot here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be?\nMr. Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't\ngot no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand \u221a\n\nBefore Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at\nClarence, catching him of guard.\n\nMarty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting\nhim in a tight choke hold.\n\nClarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus.\nWe'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl\ntakes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.\n\nAll of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold\nrecords, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.\n\nMarty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.\n\nSince Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.\n\nClarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about\nit.\n\nDREXL\nYa wanna fuck with me?\n(hits Clarence)\nYa wanna fuck with me?\n(hits Clarence)\nI'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!\n\nHe hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.\n\nClarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs\nhis nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and\nstarts twisting.\n\nMarty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip\naroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of\nhis head.\n\nDrexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's\nthumb.\n\nClarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and\nbusting his nose.\n\nMarty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets\nup on his knees.\n\nDrexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are\ngoing at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping\nthem coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other\nbecause of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.\n\nMarty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of\nLPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to\nhis feet.\n\nDrexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.\n\nMarty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up\ninto a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.\n\nDrexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.\n\nMarty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nYou OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?\n\nMARTY\nNaw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.\n\nDrexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nYou see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk\nin my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin'\nsmack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be\ncrazy.\n(to Marty)\nI don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.\n(laughing)\nHe must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?\n\nMARTY\n(laughing)\nNaw, man, it ain't white boy day.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nShit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a\nnigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.\n\nCLARENCE\n(hurting)\nWannabee nigger...\n\nDREXl\nFuck you! My mother was Apache.\n\nDrexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.\n\nDrexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.\n\nClarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.\n\nDrexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.\n\nDREXL\nWell, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost\nlike a nigger name.\n(to Clarence)\nHey, dummy.\n\nHe puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.\n\nDREXL\nBefore you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I\njust chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're\nsome macho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you\nare, Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street,\napartment 48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same\naddress. Marty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here.\n\nHe hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nI'll keep lover boy here entertained.\n(to Clarence)\nYou know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her\nsuck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's\ndone it before. But I want you as a audience.\n(hollering to Marty)\nMarty, what the fuck are you doin'?\n\nMARTY\n(off)\nI'm tryin' to find my jacket.\n\nDREXL\nLook in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there\nlately.\n\nWhile Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock\nand pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's\nstanding over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger\nand blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.\n\nDrexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.\n\nMARTY\n(off)\nWhat's happening?\n\nMarty steps into the room.\n\nClarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.\n\nTwo of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other\nHooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to\nbe terrified.\n\nDrexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his\nballs and his dick.\n\nClarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.\n\nCLARENCE\nGet a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!\n\nShe doesn't move.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!\n\nThe Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the\nbed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.\n\nClarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like\na pillbug.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.\n\nClarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Drexl)\nOpen you eyes, laughing boy.\n\nHe doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick.\n\nCLARENCE\nOpen you eyes!\n\nHe does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?\n\nHe fires.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When\nit reaches us, the screen goes awash in red.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a NIGHT\n\nThe front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and\nruns toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out:\n\nCLARENCE\nI killed him.\n\nShe stops short.\n\nCLARENCE\nI've got some food in the car, I'll be right back.\n\nClarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on\nthe couch.\n\nClarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He\nheaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down.\n\nCLARENCE\nHelp yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of\neverythin'.\n\nHe stops and looks at here.\n\nCLARENCE\nI am so hungry.\n\nHe starts eating french fries and hamburgers.\n\nALABAMA\n(in a daze)\nWas it him or you?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there\nI said to myself, \"If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it.\" I could.\nSo I did.\n\nALABAMA\nIs this a joke?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious,\nI've never had a hamburger taste this good.\n\nAlabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her.\n\nCLARENCE\nCome on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better.\n\nShe continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on\nher, yelling:\n\nCLARENCE\nWhy are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it\nhad been me? Do you love him?\n(no answer)\nDo you love him?\n(no answer)\nDo you love him?\n\nShe looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out.\n\nALABAMA\nI think what you did was...\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nALABAMA\nI think what you did...\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nALABAMA\n... was so romantic.\n\nClarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss.\nTheir kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal.\n\nCLARENCE\nI gotta get outta these clothes.\n\nHe picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them.\n\nALABAMA\n(comically)\nClean clothes. There is a god,\n\nClarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop.\n\nALABAMA\nClarence. Those aren't my clothes.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nWe see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. Pan to the parking lot where\nClarence's empty red Mustang is parked.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CALRENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Dick's jaw drops. His hand reaches out of shot.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of\ncocaine!\n\nClarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.\n\nAlabama's watching the cable TV.\n\nDICK\nHoly Mary, Mother of God.\n\nALABAMA\nThis is great, we got cable.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nBama, you got your blade?\n\nKeeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife\nwith a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the\ncorkscrew and opens the wine.\n\nHe pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a\nlittle one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.\n\nDICK\nThis shit can't be real.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt'll get ya high.\n\nHe tosses the knife.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you want some wine, sweetheart?\n\nALABAMA\nNope. I'm not really a wine gal.\n\nUsing the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back.\n\nDICK\nIt's fuckin' real!\n(to Clarence)\nIt's fuckin' real!\n\nCLARENCE\nI certainly hope so.\n\nDICK\nYou've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!\n\nCLARENCE\nI know.\n\nDICK\nDo you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell me.\n\nDICK\nI don't know! A fuckin' lot!\n\nHe downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass.\n\nDICK\nThis is Drexl's coke?\n\nCLARENCE\nDrexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he\nwants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama\nare gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So,\nyou got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?\n\nDICK\nLook, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.\n\nDick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up.\n\nCLARENCE\nBut you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the\nset.\n\nDICK\nYeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know\nthose guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot\nto piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit\nat a time \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nNo way! The whole enchilada in one shot.\n\nDICK\nDo you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred\nthousand. How difficult can that be?\n\nDICK\nIt's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat\ncats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two\nhundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And,\nmore important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could\npossibly help you.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he big league?\n\nDICK\nHe's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very\npowerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could\nbe interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat'd'ya tell 'em?\n\nDICK\nHardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and\nwhat wasn't.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's this acting class guy's name?\n\nDICK\nElliot.\n\nCLARENCE\nElliot what?\n\nDICK\nElliot Blitzer.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the\ngetting to know you stuff.\n\nDICK\nWhere?\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nThe zoo.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Dick)\nThe zoo.\n(pause)\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nDICK\nWould you just shut up a minute and let me think?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's to think about?\n\nDICK\nShut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're\nmarried. You killed a guy.\n\nCLARENCE\nTwo guys.\n\nDICK\nTwo guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck,\nClarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean\nshit.\n\nCLARENCE\nDon't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a\nfuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he\ndeserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit\nbadge or somethin'.\n\nDick rests his head in his hands.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need\nyou to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the idea,\nand get your friend to the phone.\n\nEXT.

The lights really great there and I'm up high\nenough so you can't see it from the street.\n\nELLIOT\n(forcing a laugh)\nHa ha ha. No really, where does it come from?\n\nCLARENCE\nCoco leaves.

What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob\nquestions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the\nevidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with\na wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he\ncould trust.\n\nELLIOT\nHe trusts you?\n\nCLARENCE\nWe were in Four H together.

Why is it you always\ncall me when I'm on the windiest street in L.A.?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELLIOT\n\nElliot is on the zoo payphone. Clarence is next to him. Dick is next to Clarence.\nAlabama is next to Dick, blowing bubbles.\n\nELLIOT\n(on phone)\nI'm with that party you wanted me to get together with. Do you know what\nI'm talking about, Lee?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nStore-fronts whiz by in the background.\n\nLEE\nWhy the hell are you calling my phone to talk about that?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELLIOT\n\nELLIOT\nWell, he'd here right now, and he insists on talking to you.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nIn the 7th street tunnel. Lee'svoice echoes.\n\nLEE\nAre you outta your fuckin' mind?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELLIOT\n\nELLIOT\nYou said if I didn't get you on the \u221a\n\nClarence takes the receiverout of Elliot's hand.\n\nCLARENCE\n(into phone)\nHello, Lee, it's Clarence. At last we meet.\n\nEXT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a DAY\n\nVirgil's knocking on Dick's door. Floyd (Dick's room-mate) answers.\n\nVIRGIL\nHello, is Dick Ritchie here?\n\nFLOYD\nNaw, he ain't home right now.\n\nVIRGIL\nDo you live here?\n\nFLOYD\nYeah, I live here.\n\nVIRGIL\nSorta room-mates?\n\nFLOYD\nExactly room-mates.\n\nVIRGIL\nMaybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours\nfrom Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be\ntravelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they\nstayin' here?\n\nFLOYD\nNaw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're\nstayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.\n\nVIRGIL\nHow do you know? You been there?\n\nFLOYD\nNo, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda\neasy to remember.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou're right. It is.\n\nEXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO \u221a PAYPHONE \u221a DAY\n\nClarence is still on the phone with Lee.\n\nCLARENCE\nLee, the reason I'm talkin' with you is I want to open \"Doctor Zhivago\" in\nL.A. And I want you to distribute it.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nStopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard.\n\nLEE\nI don't know, Clarence, \"Doctor Zhivago\" is a pretty big movie.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nThe biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a\nlot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a\nmovie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nHe's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now.\n\nLEE\nI'm not sayin' I'm not interested. But being a distributer's not what I'm all\nabout. I'm a film producer, I'm on this world to make good movies.\nNothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end\nhelps me on many levels.\n\nTraffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The background whizzes past him.\n\nLEE\n(continuing)\nBut the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of\ndistributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna\naccomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nNow that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a\nrisk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks,\nthen go straight to cable. This is \"Doctor Zhivago\". This'll be packin' 'em\nin for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to\nwork with anybody's movie but mine.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nSpeeding down a benchside road.\n\nLEE\nWell, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to \"Doctor Zhivago\" are\nin arbitration?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nI wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a\ncourtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on\nthe cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're\nin bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have\nto come to terms with your Fear and Desire.\n\nPause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Elliot)\nHe wants to talk ya.\n\nELLIOT\n(into phone)\nMr. Donowitz?\n(pause)\nI told you, through Dick.\n(pause)\nHe's in my acting class.\n(pause)\nAbout a year.\n(pause)\nYeah, he's good.\n(pause)\nThey grew up together.\n(pause)\nSure thing.\n\nElliot hangs up the phone.\n\nELLIOT\nHe says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants\neverybody there.\n(pointing to Clarence)\nHe'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do\nbusiness. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a\nsample bag.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo problems on both counts.\n\nHe offers Elliot the animal crackers.\n\nCLARENCE\nHave a cookie.\n\nElliot takes one.\n\nELLIOT\nThanks.\n\nHe puts it in the mouth.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat wasn't a gorilla, was it?\n\nEXT. HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nThe red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel. Alabama\nhops out. Clarence stays in.\n\nALABAMA\nYou did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do\nmy part OK?\n\nCLARENCE\nBabalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.\n\nALABAMA\nI felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head.\nI'm gonna go grab dinner.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm\ngonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated\nmovies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nCLARENCE\nWe now return to \"Bullit\" already in progress.\n\nHe slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel. Alabama walks her\nlittle walk from the parking lot to the pool area. Somebody whistles at her, she\nturns to them.\n\nALABAMA\nThank you.\n\nShe gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CALRENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nShe steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with\na sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her.\n\nVIRGIL\n(calmly)\nStep inside and shut the door.\n\nShe doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward.\n\nVIRGIL\n(calmly)\nLady. I'm gonna shoot you in the face.\n\nShe does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off.\n\nVIRGIL\nStep away from the door, move into the bathroom.\n\nShe does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming\nback.\n\nALABAMA\nI think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie. I don't have any Coke,\nbut there's a Pepsi machine downstairs. I don't know any Clarence, but\nmaybe my husband does. You might have heard of him, he play football. Al\nLylezado. He'll be home any minute, you can ask him.\n\nVirgil can't help but smile.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou're cute.\n\nVirgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square\nin the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back.\n\nINT. MOVING RED MUSTANG \u221a DAY\n\nClarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself.\n\nCLARENCE\n(singing)\n\"Land of stardust, land of glamour,\nVistavision and Cinema,\nEverything about it is a must,\nTo get to Hollywood, or bust...\"\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste\nof the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil\nstanding there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again\nto the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life.\n\nVIRGIL\nHurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm third-\ndegree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was in.\nKicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that bad. Get\non your feet, Fruitloop.\n\nAlabama wobbily complies.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhere's our coke? Where's Clarence? And when he's comin' back?\n\nAlabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to\ndie, because this man is going to kill her.\n\nALABAMA\nGo take a flying fuck and a rolling donut.\n\nVirgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach.\nThe air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours\ngasping for air that's just not there.\n\nVirgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter.\nHe takes a long, deep drag.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER STAND \u221a DAY\n\nClarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant.\n\nCLARENCE\nWoah! Smells like hamburgers in here! What's the biggest, fattest\nhamburger you guys got?\n\nThe IRANIAN GUY at the counter says:\n\nIRANIAN GUY\nThat would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, I want two of them bad boys. Two large orders of chili fries. Two\nlarge Diet Cokes.\n(looking at a menu at the wall)\nAnd I'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room. She braces herself\nagainst the wall. She is very punchy. Virgil steps in front of her.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you?\nDream on, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is\ngonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my\nfuckin' coke?\n\nShe doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her\nhead slams into the left side of the wall.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhere's Clarence?!\n\nNothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side.\nHer legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her\nlightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhen's Clarence getting back?\n\nShe can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the\nmiddle finger. Virgil can't help but smile.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou gotta lot of heart, kid.\n\nHe gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER STAND \u221a DAY\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them.\n\nClarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER reading a copy of\n\"Newsweek\" with Elvis on the cover.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's a great issue.\n\nThe Customer lowers his magazine a little bit.\n\nCUSTOMER\nYeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.\n\nCLARENCE\nHave you read the story on Elvis?\n\nCUSTOMER\nNo. Not yet.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I\nlook at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I\nended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever\nwrong.\n\nCUSTOMER\nThat good, huh?\n\nHe takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the\nElvis article.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the\nwhole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew\nup with him, the artists he inspired \u221a Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and\nthe fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the\ncreeps.\n\nCUSTOMER\nI can see what you mean.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every\nbranch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.\n\nClarence and the Customer laugh.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's\ncrawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the\ncocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary.\n\nVIRGIL\nNow the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the\nBoston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles\nWhitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you\ngreen money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the\nbitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to ho. Now, the\nsecond one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to ho.\nYou still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you\ncompletely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the\npoint now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.\n\nHe's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the\nbed, and the black suitcase is right there.\n\nAlabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the\nblack case and almost goes snow blind.\n\nVIRGIL\nWell, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great.\nOne less thing I gotta worry about.\n\nVirgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.\n\nShe pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth \u221a\n\nAlabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-\nman smiles.\n\nVIRGIL\nKid, you got a lotta heart.\n\nHe moves toward her.\n\nAlabama's hands are shaking.\n\nVIRGIL\nTell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only\ndo that for people I like.\n\nHe moves close.\n\nAlabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open.\nButtons fly everywhere.\n\nVIRGIL\nGo ahead, girl, take a stab at it.\n(giggling)\nYou don't have anything to lose.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose.\nVirgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women\nthat comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many\nwomen all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt\nonly a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into \"I'll\ntake this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do\" seething hatred.\n\nLetting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then\ndrops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a VIRGIL'S FACE\n\nTalk about bloodcurling yells.\n\nVirgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running\ndown his face.\n\nWhile Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter\nthat Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster,\nso it doesn't kill him.\n\nVirgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.\n\nAlabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it\nand, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the\nnose, breaking it.\n\nHer eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to\nit, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back,\nsending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.\n\nVirgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama.\nAlabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but\nnot one of them has ever laughed before he did it.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhat's so fuckin' funny?!!\n\nALABAMA\n(laughing)\nYou look so ridiculous.\n\nShe laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off\nthe ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.\n\nVIRGIL\nLaugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you\nlaughing now?\n\nAlabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and\nsqueezes it out in her hand.\n\nVirgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.\n\nAlabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his\neyes.\n\nVIRGIL\nOh Jesus!\n\nShe grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.\n\nVIRGIL\nOh Mary, help me!\n\nThe battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's\nclutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a\nTasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming\ntoward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks\nher into the toilet.\n\nAhe recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the\ntoilet tank.\n\nVirgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama\nbrings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet\nlid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires\nanyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.\n\nThe toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.\n\nAlabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net\nhairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his\ngun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame,\nwhich results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.\n\nHe fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending\nwater spraying.\n\nUpon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama\ndown, and runs out of the bathroom.\n\nVirgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off\nlaying on the ground. He crawls toward it.\n\nAlabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45\nautomatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.\n\nHe reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.\n\nAlabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-\nrunning-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.\n\nHe arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and\nsending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.\n\nAlabama snatches the shotgun.\n\nArched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.\n\nThe first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second\nhits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.\n\nAlabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.\n\nEver since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been\nfunctioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of\nSaint Francis of Assisi.\n\nALABAMA\nLord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nand where there is sadness, joy.\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not\nso much seek to be consoled as to console;\nto be understood as to understand;\nto be loved as to love;\nfor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born\nto eternal life.\n\nClarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn,\nonly to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.\n\nCLARENCE\nHoney?\n\nShe continues. He puts his gun away.\n\nCLARENCE\nSweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute,\n\nShe continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She\nlies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.\n\nClarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his\nshoulder.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nEverybody is outside their rooms wathcing as Clarence walks through the pool\narea with his bundle. Sirens can be heard.\n\nEXT. MOVING RED MUSTANG \u221a DAY\n\nClarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in the passenger seat. She's\nmuttering to herself. Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the other\nstrokes Alabama's hair.\n\nCLARENCE\nSleep baby. Don't dream. Don't worry. Just sleep. You deserve better than\nthis. I'm so sorry. Sleep my angel. Sleep peacefully.\n\nEXT. MOTEL 6 \u221a NIGHT\n\nA new motel. Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside.\n\nINT. MOTEL 6 \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nAlabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is asleep in bed.\n\nINT. NOWHERE\n\nClarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera. He's in a\nheadshot.\n\nCLARENCE\nI feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the\nshit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that\nthe way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that\nmuch. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'.\nBut, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured\nwith words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to \u221a\nthat's a test of oneself. That's a true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my\nhands and gouge out my eyes before I'll every let anything happen to that\nlady again.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS \u221a NIGHT\n\nA wonderful, gracefully flowing shot of the Hollywood Hills. Off in the distance\nwe hear the roar of a car engine.\n\nEXT. MULLHOLLAND DRIVE \u221a NIGHT\n\nVaaarrroooooommmm!!! A silver Porsche is driving hells bells, taking quick\ncorners, pushing it to the edge.\n\nINT. MOVING PORSCHE \u221a NIGHT\n\nElliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it. A blond, glitzy COKE WHORE is\nsitting next to him. They're having a ball. Then they're seeing a red and blue\nlight flashing in the rear-view window. It's the cops.\n\nELLIOT\nFuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined,\ndriving like this!\n(he pulls over)\nKandi, you gotta help me.\n\nKANDI\nWhat can I do?\n\nHe pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier.\n\nELLIOT\nYou gotta hold this for me.\n\nKANDI\nYou must be high. Uh-huh. No way.\n\nELLIOT\n(frantically)\nJust put it in your purse.\n\nKANDI\nI'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.\n\nELLIOT\nThey won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.\n\nKANDI\nNo way, Jose.\n\nELLIOT\nPlease, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.\n\nKANDI\nI'm not wearing a bra.\n\nELLIOT\n(pleading)\nPut it in your pants.\n\nKANDI\nNo.\n\nELLIOT\nYou're the one who wanted to drive fast.\n\nKANDI\nRead my lips.\n\nShe mouths the word \"no\".\n\nELLIOT\nAfter all I've done for you, you fuckin' whore!!\n\nShe goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine instead. It rips open. Cocaine\ncompletely covers his blue suit. At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing\nbeam. Tears fill his eyes.\n\nINT. POLICE STATION \u221a INTERROGATION ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nElliot is sitting in a chair at the table. Two young, good-looking, casually\ndressed, Starsky and Hutch-type POLICE DETECTIVES are questioning him.\nThey're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes. The dark-haired one\nis Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes.\n\nNICHOLSON\nLook, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine \u221a\n\nDIMES\nNot a tiny little vial \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nBut a fuckin' baggie.\n\nDIMES\nNo don't sit here and feed us some shit.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now\nwe gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time \u221a\n\nDIMES\nYou're no longer an extra \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nOr a bit player \u221a\n\nDIMES\nOr a supporting actor \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man\nshow nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience \u221a\n\nDIMES\nBut there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy\nwho gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll\nhave so much experience to draw on \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nAnd just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get\nmarried, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because\nyou'll know what it's like to be a woman.\n\nDIMES\n'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right\nanymore \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nThat is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.\n\nElliot starts crying. Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks and smile. Mission\naccomplished.\n\nINT. POLICE STATION \u221a CAPTAIN KRINKLE'S OFFICE \u221a DAY\n\nCAPTAIN BUFFORD KRINKLE is sitting behind his desk, where he spends\nabout seventy-five percent of his day. He's you standard rough, gruff, no-\nnonsense, by-the-book-type police captain.\n\nKRINKLE\nNicholson! Dimes! Het in here!\n\nThe two casually dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in, both shouting at once.\n\nNICHOLSON\nKrinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin'\ninto somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him\nfrom the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form\nthe right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it\nwas all over \u221a\n\nDIMES\nKrinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and\nif I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole\ndepartment. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta\ncome in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion \u221a\n\nKRINKLE\nBoth you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened,\nwhat's going on, and what are you talking about?\n\nDIMES\nOkee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for\nspeeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they\nbring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nNicholson and I.\n\nDIMES\nNicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in\nDenmark, cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're\nsweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nWhich wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.\n\nDIMES\nSo we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you\nain't gonna fuckin' believe it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. RESTAURANT \u221a DAY\n\nDetroit. Very fancy restaurant. FOUR WISE-GUY HOODS, one older, the\nother three, youngsters, are seated at the table with Mr. Coccotti.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n\u221a And so, tomorrow morning comes, and no Virgil. I check with Nick\nCardella, who Virgil was supposed to leave my narcotics with, he never\nshows. Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole\nand what I don't know is whose hand's on the handle.\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #1 (FRANKIE)\nYou think Virgil started gettin' big ideas?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nIt's possible. Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur. But\nafter that incident in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil.\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #2 (DARIO)\nWhat happened?\n\nOLD WISE-GUY(LENNY)\nVirgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown. He got five years, he\nserved three.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nAnybody who clams up and does hid time, I don't care how I feel about him\npersonally, he's OK.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nKRINKLE'S OFFICE\n\nNICHOLSON\nIt seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a\nmillion dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for\na year and a half. Now the cops got this weirdo \u221a\n\nDIMES\nSuspect's words \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nTo front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his\nboss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.\n\nDIMES\nHe produced \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\".\n\nKRINKLE\nThat Vietnam movie?\n\nNICHOLSON\nUh-huh.\n\nKRINKLE\nThat was a good fuckin' movie.\n\nDIMES\nSure was.\n\nKRINKLE\nDo you believe him?\n\nNICHOLSON\nI believe he believes him.\n\nDIMES\nHe's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny\ngranny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nThis rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.\n\nKRINKLE\nHe'll wear a wire?\n\nDIMES\nWe talked him into it.\n\nKRINKLE\nDirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.\n\nNICHOLSON\nLook, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire\ndepartment, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the\ntwelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.\n\nDIMES\nCocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood. This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way.\nAnd we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nINT. RESTAURANT \u221a DAY\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #3 (MARVIN)\nMaybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's. Cardella turns Virgil's switch\noff, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand.\n\nLENNY\nExcuse me, Mr. Coccotti.\n(to Marvin)\nDo you know Nick Cardella?\n\nMARVIN\nNo.\n\nLENNY\nThen where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?\n\nMARVIN\nI didn't mean \u221a\n\nLENNY\nShut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth\nbefore you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you\ncan throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nChildren, we're digressing. Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and\nher wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find\nthat hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot.\nSo you see, children, I got a lot of questions and no answers. Find out who\nthis wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"THE BIG DAY\"\n\nEXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY \u221a SUNRISE\n\nClarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway.\nAs luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of\nthe road.

All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to\ndo most, but couldn't.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nLeavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips.\nFun, fun, fun, fun.\n\nAnother plane takes off.\n\nCLARENCE\nBut knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new\noutlook.

Where should we fly off\nto, my little turtledove?\n\nALABAMA\nCancoon.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhy Cancoon?\n\nALABAMA\nIt's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. \"Clarence and Alabama Go\nto Cancoon\".

I don't know, what do you want me to say?\n\nDICK\nLook, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nI know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week\nhas taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a\ngun and not to have it.\n\nPause. Clarence stops walking.\n\nCLARENCE\nHold it, guys. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared.\nWhat say we forget the whole thing.\n\nDick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.\n\nDICK\nDo you really mean it?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think\nabout it. How 'bout you, Bama?\n\nALABAMA\nI thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't\nwant you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up\nthere. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's\nwaiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the\ndownside.\n\nDICK\nNow's a helluva time to play \"what if\".\n\nCLARENCE\nThis is our last chance to play \"what if\". I want to do it.

Clarence gets behind the wheel. The other two\nclimb in. Clarence hops back out.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm sorry guys, I gotta do it. As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away.\nI'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if I don't go in\nthere. Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop,\nhe's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man\nwho can get him there. So what say we throw caution to the wind and let\nthe chips fall where they may.\n\nClarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel. Dick and\nAlabama exchange looks and follow.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a LOBBY \u221a DAY\n\nElliot's walking around the lobby.

You apparently think I'm the dumbest\nmotherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a\ndoubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nDIMES\nWe gotta get him outta there.\n\nNICHOLSON\nWhatta we gonna do?

Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS\n\nNICHOLSON\nHe's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the\nshow must go on.\n\nDIMES\nThis guy's gonna kill him.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nCLARENCE\nStand up.\n\nElliot does. The .38 is still pressed against his forehead.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike Nick Carter used to say: I I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want you to tell\nme what's waiting for us up there. Something's amiss. I can feel it. If\nanything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the\nfirst one shot. Trust me, I am AIDS, you fuck with me, you die. Now quit\nmaking me mad and tell me why I'm so fucking nervous.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nHe's bluffin', I knew it. He doesn't know shit.\n\nDIMES\nDon't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou're am actor, so act, motherfucker.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nElliot still hasn't answered.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK.\n\nWith the .38 up against Elliot's head Clarence puts his palm over the top of the\ngun to shield himself from the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what\nhe's gonna do.\n\nElliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the\nother end of the wire. He sounds like a little boy.\n\nELLIOT\nI don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. I wish somebody would just come\nand get me cause I don't like this. This is not what I thought it would be.\nAnd I wish somebody would just take me away. Just take me away Come\nand get me. Cause I don't like this anymore. I can't take this. I'm sorry but\nI just can't. So, if somebody would just come to my rescue, everything\nwould be alright.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNicholson and Dimes shake their hands, They have a \"well, that's that\"\nexpression an their faces.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nClarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot.\n\nCLARENCE\nSorry, Elliot.

All you'll find is a .38 calibre.\n\nBoris gets up from the couch.\n\nBORIS\nWhat compelled you to bring that along?\n\nCLARENCE\nThe same thing that compelled you, Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire\nweaponry to a business meeting.\n\nBORIS\nI'll take that.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou'll have to.\n\nThe toilet flushes in the bathroom. The door swings open and Lee Donowitz\nemerges.\n\nLEE\nThey're here.

But, Lee, I'm fairly confident\nthat you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll\nput the gun on the table.\n\nLEE\nI don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you\nbe nice and get coffee for everybody.\n\nThey all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee,\nand Monty, who's standing behind Lee's chair.\n\nCLARENCE\nOh, Mr. Donowitz \u221a\n\nLEE\nLee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\" is one\nof my favorite movies. After \"Apocalypse Now\" I think it's the best\nVietnam movie ever.\n\nLEE\nThank you very much, Clarence.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. \"Sophie's\nChoice\", \"Ordinary People\", \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", \"Gandhi\". All that\nstuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.\n\nLEE\nI hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are\nunwatchable movies from unreadable books.\n\nBoris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills\neverybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert.\n\nLEE\nClarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more\nthan I do, but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nClarence is on a roll and he knows it.\n\nCLARENCE\nThey ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films.\nAnd do you know what films are? They're for people who don't like\nmovies. \"Mad Max\", that's a movie. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\",\nthat's a movie. \"Rio Bravo\", that's a movie. \"Rumble Fish\", that's a\nfuckin' movie. And, \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\", that's a movie. It was\nthe first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the \"The Deer\nHunter\".\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThey're all listening to this.\n\nDIMES\nWhat's this guy doin'? Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the \"New\nYorker\"?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nCLARENCE\nMy uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw \"Coming\nHome in a Body Bag\" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film\nthey'd ever seen.\n\nLEE\nYou know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it\nmakes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you\nmy friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you\nhave for me.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nThank God.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nClarence puts the suitcase on the table.\n\nCLARENCE\nLee, when you see this you're gonna shit.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLOBBY\n\nThe four Wise-guys are at the desk.\n\nLENNY\n(quietly to the others)\nWhat was the Jew-boy's name?\n\nMARVIN\nDonowitz, he said.\n\nFRONT-DESK GUY\nHow can I help you, Gentlemen?\n\nLENNY\nYeah, we're from Warner Bros. What room is Mr. Donowitz in?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nLee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it.\n\nCLARENCE\nNow, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot\nmore.\n\nLEE\nDon't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.\n\nCLARENCE\nMe too, Boris.\n\nBoris fills both of their cups. They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar.\nAll eyes are on them. Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this\ncup. Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar.\n\nLEE\n(stirring loudly)\nYou like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.\n\nBoth are cool as cucumbers.\n\nLEE\nI have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality. Can Boris\nmake anybody a sandwich? I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in\nthere.\n\nALABAMA\nNo thank you.\n\nDICK\nNo. But thanks.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that\nmade me a little sick.\n\nLEE\nWhere'd you go?\n\nCLARENCE\nA Norms in Van Nuys.\n\nLEE\nBastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.\n\nLee continues looking at the merchandise.\n\nAlabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil. She slides the napkin\nover to Clarence. It says: \"You're so cool\" with a tiny heart drawn on the\nbottom of it. Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart.\nShe takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket.\n\nLee looks up.\n\nLEE\nOK, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal\nthat's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the\nlevel.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nIf he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession.\n\nDIMES\nConvince him.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I\ndon't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with\nprofessionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that,\nand I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a\nhelluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug\ndealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all\nof the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and\nyou're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker. I like\nyou, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street,\nonly to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I\ncan't get the million dollars for it. But, you can. So, I'll sell it to you for a\ncouple a hundred thousand. You go to make a million. It's all found money\nto me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred\nthousand is the world.\n\nLEE\nElliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.\n(to Elliot)\nThanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on\nyou. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.\n(to Lee)\nHe's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.\n\nLEE\nWhy does he trust you?\n\nCLARENCE\nWe grew up together.\n\nLEE\nIf you don't know shit, ehy does he think you can sell it?\n\nCLARENCE\nI bullshitted him.\n\nLee starts laughing.\n\nLEE\nThat's wild. This fucking guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other\nroom and get the money.\n\nClarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNicholson and Dimes exchange looks.\n\nDIMES & NICHOLSON\nBingo!\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nThe four Wise-guys are coming up.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nLEE\n(pointing to Alabama)\nWhat's your part in this?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm his wife.\n\nLEE\n(referring to Dick)\nHow 'bout you?\n\nDICK\nI know Elliot.\n\nLEE\nAnd Elliot knows me. Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend\nwork in?\n\nDick and Alabama panic.\n\nCLARENCE\n(without missing a beat)\nCarson County Sheriffs.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThe internal affairs officers high five.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nMonty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table.\n\nLEE\nWanna count your money?\n\nCLARENCE\nActually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThey all stand.\n\nDIMES\nOK, boys. Let's go get 'em.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a LEE'S HOTEL ROOM \u221a BATHROOM \u221a\nDAY\n\nClarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door. As soon as it's shut he\nstarts doing the twist. He can't believe he's pulled it off. He goes to the toilet\nand starts taking a piss. He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink.\n\nELVIS\nClarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.\n\nCLARENCE\nI was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.\n\nELVIS\nAll anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.\n\nCLARENCE\nCan you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.\n\nELVIS\nOh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: \"I'll take that gun\", \"You'll\nhave to\".\n\nCLARENCE\nThat was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came\nfrom. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought,\nthat's a cool line, I gotta remember that.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nEverything's just as it was.\n\nSudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with\nguns drawn.\n\nDIMES & NICHOLSON\nPolice! Freeze, you're all under arrest!\n\nEverybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou two! Put the guns on the floor and back away.\n\nMONTY\nFuck you! All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away.\n\nLEE\nMonty, what are you talking about? So what they say.\n\nDIMES\nThis is your last warning! Drop those fuckin' guns!\n\nBORIS\nThis is your last warning! We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it!\nNow get on the floor!\n\nDICK\nWhat the fuck am I doing here?\n\nLEE\nBoris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops!\n\nMONTY\nSo they're cops. Who gives a shit?\n\nBORIS\nLee, something I never told you about me. I don't like cops.\n\nDIMES\nOK, let's everybody calm down and get nice. Nobody has to die. We don't\nwant it, and you don't want it.\n\nLEE\nWe don't want it.\n\nThe four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie,\nwho has two .45 automatics, one in each hand.\n\nHalf of the cops spin around.\n\nWURLITZER\nFreeze!\n\nLENNY\nWho are you guys?\n\nWURLITZER\nPolice.\n\nDARIO\n(to Lenny)\nDo we get any extra if we have to kill cops?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nBATHROOM\n\nClarence and Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nHow do you think I'm doin' with Lee?\n\nELVIS\nAre you kiddin'? He loves you.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?\n\nELVIS\nYou're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as\nkissin' his ass.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\".\n\nELVIS\nThat's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and\nhe can see that.\n\nElvis fixes Clarence's collar.\n\nELVIS\nI like ya, Clarence. Always have.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nThis is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one. Gangsters on one end with\nshotguns. Bodyguards with machine guns on the other. And cops with handguns\nin the middle.\n\nDick's ready to pass out.\n\nAlabama's so scared she pees on herself.\n\nFor Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it.\n\nELLIOT\nOfficer Dimes? Officer Dimes.\n\nDimes looks at Elliot.\n\nELLIOT\nThis has nothing to do with me anymore. Can I just leave and you guys just\nsettle it by yourselves?\n\nDIMES\nElliot, shut the fuck up and stay put!\n\nLEE\n(to Elliot)\nHow did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why,\nyou fuckin' little piece of shit!\n\nELLIOT\nLee, understand, I didn't want to \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nShut the fuck up!\n\nLEE\nWell, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty\nyears cause your career is over as of now! You might as weel burn you\nSAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the\nheart!\n\nLee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and\nflings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees,\n\nInstinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice.\n\nAlabama screams.\n\nBoris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets.\n\nDIMES\n(screaming)\nCody!!!\n\nNicholson flies backwards.\n\nMarvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks\nback and forth then on the floor.\n\nClarence opens the bathroom door.\n\nDimes hits the ground firing.\n\nA shot catches Clarence in the forehead.\n\nAlabama screams.\n\nDario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the\nbathroom sink, smashing the mirror.\n\nIt might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either\nhits the ground or runs for cover.\n\nDimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground.\n\nBoris dives into the kitchen area.\n\nMonty tips the table over.\n\nMarvin dives behind the sofa.\n\nDario runs out of the door and down the hall.\n\nWith bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA\nOfficers are shot right away.\n\nFrankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics.\n\nElliot gets it from both sides.\n\nAlabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the\nbathroom.\n\nClarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off.\n\nAlabama continues crawling.\n\nMarvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast\nhits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming.\n\nThe Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty.\n\nAs Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over\nthe apartment.\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a DAY\n\nCop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nGUNFIGHT\n\nAlabama crawling.\n\nThe suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick. Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air.\nMarvin comes from behind the sofa and fires. The suitcase is hit in mid-air.\nWhite powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped in cocaine.\n\nDick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door.\n\nAn IA Officer goes after him.\n\nLenny makes a break for it.\n\nWurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin.\n\nAlabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nSweety?\n\nClarence's face is awash with blood.\n\nCLARENCE\nI... I can't see you... I've got blood in my eyes...\n\nHe dies.\n\nAlabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a HALLWAY \u221a DAY\n\nDario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police.\n\nHe fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a ANOTHER HALLWAY\n\nThe hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes\naround the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the\nsame corner.\n\nIA OFFICER\n(aiming gun)\nFreeze!\n\nDick does.\n\nDICK\nI'm unarmed!\n\nIA OFFICER\nPut your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch!\n\nHe does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer,\nsending him to the wall.\n\nDICK\nOh shit.\n\nHe starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the\ncorner and runs down the hall.\n\nDick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box.\n\nLenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off.\n\nDICK\nLook, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm\nsorry.\n\nTwo elevator doors on either side of them open.\n\nLenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says:\n\nLENNY\nLotsa luck.\n\nLenny dives into one elevator car. Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors\nclose.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nHOTEL ROOM\n\nThe Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each\nother down.\n\nWurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned\ndown in the kitchen.\n\nIn the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get\nhis heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of\ntimes.\n\nALABAMA\nWake up, goddamn it!\n\nDimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the\ngrip of a dead Wise-guy.\n\nBoris peeks around the wall to fire.\n\nDimes lets loose with a blast. A scream is heard.\n\nBORIS\n(off)\nI'm shot! Stop!\n\nDIMES\nThrow out your gun, asshole!\n\nThe Uzi's tossed out.\n\nDimes goes to where Wurlitzer is.\n\nDIMES\n(to Marvin)\nOK, black jacket! It's two against one now! Toss the gun and lie face down\non the floor or die like all you friends.\n\nThe shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a ELEVATOR \u221a DAY\n\nDick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this. The doors open on the\nfourth floor. He runs out into the hallway.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nHe starts trying the room doors for an open one.\n\nDICK\nOh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up\nagain. Please, just let me get to \"T.J. Hooker\" on Monday.\n\nSTEWARDESS'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nDick steps in. THREE GORGEOUS GIRLS are doing a killer aerobics workout\nto a video on TV. The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't\nhear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed.\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nBoris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live. He's lying on the kitchen\nfloor. Dimes stands over him. He has the sawed-off in his hand.\n\nDIMES\nDon't even give me an excuse, motherfucker.\n\nDimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none.\n\nWurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch.\n\nDimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying\nover him.\n\nDimes walks over to Wurlitzer.\n\nDIMES\nEverything's under control here.\n\nWURLITZER\nSorry about Nicholson.\n\nDIMES\nMe too.\n\nWURLITZER\nI'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside.\n\nDIMES\nYou do that.\n\nWurlitzer exits. Dimes grabs the phone.\n\nLOBBY\n\nShotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby.\n\nA COP yells out.\n\nCOP\nYou! Stop!\n\nLenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it. OTHER COPS rush\nforward. Lenny grabs a woman standing by.\n\nLENNY\nGet back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come!\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nDimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the\nfloor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back.\nAlabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She\nreaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her\nhand and remembers Clarence saying:\n\nCLARENCE\n(off)\nShe's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She\ncarried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,\nand the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!\nPray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!\n\nAlabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand.\n\nMarvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice.\n\nDimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She\nfires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor.\n\nShe sees Boris on the kitchen floor.\n\nALABAMA\nBye-bye, Boris. Good luck.\n\nBORIS\nYou too, cutie.\n\nShe starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money. She takes it and\nwalks out the door.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nThe elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out.\n\nAlabama comes around the corner.\n\nWURLITZER\nHey, you!\n\nAlabama shoots him three times in the belly. She steps into the elevator, the\ndoors close.\n\nLOBBY\n\nAlabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, COPS\nare all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage.\n\nLENNY\nI wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to\ntake me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks!\n(pause)\nSmall bills!\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a PARKING LOT \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama puts the briefcase in the trunk. She gets into the Mustang and drives\naway.\n\nINT. MUSTANG \u221a MOVING \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be\nfunny. She's muttering to herself.\n\nALABAMA\nI could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked\naway. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred\npercent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad. I\nshould laugh cause you don't deserve any better. I could get another guy\nlike that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. Asshole. You're\na asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted it all, didn't ya?\nDidn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. You ain't got\nme. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. Nada. Zip.\nGoose egg. Nil. Donut.\n\nThe song \"Little Arrows\" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks\ndown and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues.\nShe wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on\nthe dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.\n\nShe pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view\nmirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens\non the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads\nit: \"You're so cool\".\n\nShe tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She\nlooks around for, and finally finds, the \"Sgt. Fury\" comic book Clarence bought\nher.\n\nAnd with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away\nfrom the Mustang forever.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nTHE END2Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

TROY\u2019S BATHROOM - DAY 15\nWater runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over\nthe toilet.

You went from ODB\nto Trey Songz!\n11.\nThe audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone\nexcept Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro\u2019d bohemian\ndisciples (who we\u2019ll call the BOFROS). Sam records the\nproceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera.\nREGGIE\nThat\u2019s his platform? Haircuts?\nSAM\nOofta is as Oofta does.\nCoco, sneaks through the door. She\u2019s got the eyes of Helmut\non her. What is he doing here?

I\ndon\u2019t have a chance in hell. Thank\nGod.\n12.\nSam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nTroy my brother, it\u2019s broke.\nThe BoFros cheer and make noise on each line.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nTroy\u2019s a legacy kid. And yet it\u2019s\nunder his watch that Armstrong /\nParker, the bastion of Black\nculture here was gutted. By the\nRandomization of Housing Act.\nSecond years of color no longer\nhave a say in where they go. The\nculture that\u2019s been fostered in\nthis house for two decades will be\nwiped out in two years.\nTroy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nThis wasn\u2019t motivated by a desire\nto mix things up. Bring about\nracial and socioeconomic harmony.\nNo, the Black kids are sitting\ntogether in the proverbial\ncafeteria and they must be up to no\ngood.\nCoco\u2019s eyes are in the back of her head.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nWe sit together to protect\nourselves. Over a century of houses\ngrouped by sports affiliations,\npolitical leanings, majors, you\nname it. Black folks get their own\nhouse, suddenly we got a problem?\nStudents look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam\ndelivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nThis Act doesn\u2019t affect the other\nhouses like it does ours. There are\nplenty of trustees, former coaches,\nand presidents watching out for the\nothers. All we have is a Dean who\u2019d\nrather please his massa --\nTROY\n-- Yo that\u2019s enough of that Sam --\n13.\nSAM\n-- then stand up for his own. Look,\nI know ya\u2019ll ain\u2019t voting for me.\nYa\u2019ll ain\u2019t ready and I didn\u2019t come\nhere for that. The Black Student\nUnion and I have brought a petition\nto repeal the Randomization of\nHousing Act. I plan on bringing it\nto the President and together we\ncan bring Black back to Manchester.\nIt\u2019ll be by the door.\nSam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy\n- give her daps and all sorts of praise.\nMARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with\nneat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand.\nMARTIN\nI assume everyone has the app I\ncreated by now?\nREGGIE\n(aside)\nIt\u2019s a child\u2019s app...\nMARTIN\nGood. Voting may commence.\nEveryone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view\nas he punches something in.\nTroy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who\ngive him a head nod. Troy\u2019s got this. After a moment...\nMARTIN (CONT\u2019D)\nOkay. Looks like we\u2019ve got\nourselves a winner.\n(devastated)\nSam White?\nThe blood drains from Sam\u2019s face and Troy\u2019s smile plummets\ninto the floor as the two turn to look at each other.\nTROY & SAM\nOh shit.\nReggie\u2019s grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and\nslips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.\n17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17\nRight on the heels of Helmut\u2019s exit is...\n14.\nCOCO\nSo that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for?\nHELMUT\nI\u2019m looking for good TV sister.\nCOCO\nI think I\u2019d be good TV.\nHELMUT\nYou\u2019re at a great school, getting a\ngreat education. Be good at that.\nCOCO\nI am. And when I graduate early\nwith an Economics degree from\nManchester it will be the crowning\nachievement of my Black middle\nclass parents\u2019 ambitions.\nHELMUT\nConflict is a commodity in my\nindustry. Sam\u2019s got it. Do you?\nCOCO\nSo you want me to start a fight.\nHELMUT\n(exactly)\nI don\u2019t want you to do anything you\nwouldn\u2019t otherwise do.\nHelmut hands her his card. A fire sparks in Coco as he exits.\nHe contemplates her. Fights a growing smile.\n18 INT. DEAN\u2019S OFFICE - DAY 18\nA fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while\nthe message plays over speaker phone.\nSPEAKER\n...bigger the dick the less you\u2019ll\nhave to pay me to ssssuck it.\nDean Fairbank\u2019s mind ticks away behind a concerned glare.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMost everything\u2019s locked up, but\nwe\u2019ll find another residence to\nmove you to. Third time\u2019s a charm.\n(off Lionel\u2019s sigh)\nWhat about Armstrong / Parker?\n15.\nLIONEL\nI don\u2019t know...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI might have an opening. Maybe it\u2019d\nbe good to be around...you know.\nLIONEL\nDean. The worst thing about high\nschool, and believe me it was a\nlong list, were the Black kids.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMaybe it\u2019s in your head. Sure,\nsometimes our folks can be\nintolerant around people like you.\nHomo --\nLIONEL\n-- I don\u2019t believe in labels.\nFairbanks just smiles. This is a sore spot and he backs off.\nLionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank\u2019s desk: Students\nof all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy\nwith the phrase \u201cMANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG\u201d printed below.\nTroy\u2019s huge smile seems to mock him.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou like jazz Lionel? Manchester\u2019s\nlike jazz you know.\nLIONEL\nThis is a research school.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAnd jazz is tension. The interplay\nof improvised solos all creating\none song. Your problem is you\u2019ve\ngot no instrument. No major, no\naffiliations, no solo son.\nLIONEL\nI submit articles to the\nIndependent Observer.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nNo one reads the Independent\nObserver, my point is are you\nplaying swing or bebop?\nLIONEL\nYou\u2019re mixing metaphors.\n16.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAre you a sax or are you a trumpet?\nLIONEL\nI hate jazz.\nFairbanks checks his watch. All out of ideas.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI\u2019ll do what I can. Not a word of\nthis in the Observer okay?\nLIONEL\nWhat\u2019s it matter? No one reads it.\n19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19\nLionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out\nto..\n...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself\namongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he\ntrades \u201cNo Homo\u2019s\u201d with the others.\nLionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud\ngay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his\nhair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.\nNot right either. Where does he fit? By surprise...\nGEORGE\nLionel right?\nGEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from\nNietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nGeorge. We had Civ last semester?\nHow you doing?\nLIONEL\nGrood...Gate...I\u2019m ah..\nGEORGE\nFan of your stuff. In the Observer?\nLIONEL\nNo one reads the Observer.\nGEORGE\nYou seen this?\nGeorge hands Lionel Sam\u2019s \u201cMissing Black Culture\u201d flyer.\n17.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nThe residents of Armstrong / Parker\njust made her head of house. Am I\ncrazy or is there a there there?\nLIONEL\nWhat made you come over here?\nGeorge holds up Sam\u2019s \u201cEbony & Ivy.\u201d Lionel takes it.\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nI mean I\u2019m glad you came --\nGEORGE\n-- My staff? God bless them.\nThey\u2019re whiter than Michael\nJackson\u2019s kids. We\u2019re fucked if\nanyone of them writes this story\nand I will not let the transfers at\nthe Gazette do it first.\nLIONEL\nThe oldest one has his face.\nGEORGE\nYou\u2019re in the Black Student Union.\nYou probably know Sam.\nLionel shakes his head \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d at the same time.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nYou come up with a good angle? I\nwant it in the Bugle.\nLionel eyes the bold \u201cBugle\u201d logo on George\u2019s shirt.\nLIONEL\n(aside)\nTrumpet...\nGEORGE\nBugle. Focus. The only paper on\ncampus with a national subscription\nbase and an Advisor from the New\nYork Times? Only so many ways a\nperson can distinguish themselves\nat a place like this Lionel. You\u2019re\ngood. You belong with us.\nThe way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we\nknow he\u2019s never heard these words. Never belonged any place.\nDoesn\u2019t hurt there\u2019s a handsome boy smiling at him either.\n18.\n20 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 20\nTroy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their\nopposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall\nbetween them.\nTROY\nGet it yet?\nSam shakes her head yes.\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nGood. You\u2019ve now got the shared\ncalendar, contacts, and official\nemail.\nTroy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack\nof papers.\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nOh and before I forget.\nSAM\nEvent requests for the year?\nTROY\nJust this month. They need your\napproval. Also don\u2019t forget to pick\nyour office hours. At least 20 per\nweek.\nSAM\nThat\u2019s absurd.\nTROY\nYou\u2019re in charge of a hundred\nresidents now. And they need time\nto complain to your face. About\nnoise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free\noptions in the cafeteria. Etcetera.\nSAM\nTroy. I didn\u2019t think I was going to\nwin.\nTROY\nAnd by the way petitioning the\nPresident on the Randomization of\nHousing Act isn\u2019t gonna do shit.\nNone of the other houses are\nconcerned.\n19.\nSAM\nBecause they all have a legacy of\nrich and powerful allies on the\nboard who will make sure that\n\u201crandom\u201d works out to their\nadvantage.\nTROY\nAnd you think a petition is going\nto change that?\nTroy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. Sam\u2019s\nphone buzzes: \u201cMOM.\u201d The letters chill Sam to the core.\n21 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY 21\nLionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights\nwith a notepad. He flips through Sam\u2019s \u201cEBONY & IVY\u201d book...\nSAM (V.O.)\nThe Armstrong / Parker dining hall\nis the epicenter of Black culture\nas it stands at Manchester. Only\nhere can you commiserate, celebrate\nand discuss everything from Kanye\nWest lyrics to theoretical\nrelativism all in one sitting. Not\nto mention find someone who can\nactually do your hair.\nARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS\nLionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this\nlively and somewhat alien dining hall.\nTroy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or\nso friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean\nart major.\nMARTIN\n\u201cWe wuz robbed.\u201d That election was\nsuspect man.\nMartin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam\nbreaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.\nSAM\nYou call me the minute there\u2019s an\nupdate. Love you too mom.\nSam hangs up. The call\u2019s really put her in a bad place. She\nsits at a table of her Bofros - who we\u2019ll name by their hair.\n20.\nCURLS\nThere is one other sister in my\nRelativity class, I\u2019ll be damned if\nour professor doesn\u2019t call me\nLaretta every God damn time.\nDREADS\nWe all look the same.\nREGGIE\nProgramming professor gets me and\nMartin here mixed up constantly.\nMARTIN\nYou should be so lucky.\nReggie glances over at Martin\u2019s Mac Air.\nREGGIE\nCute. You get that at Toys R Us?\nSam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card.\nREGGIE (CONT\u2019D)\nYou still using your ID number?\nSAM\nI always forget passwords.\nREGGIE\nYou are begging to get hacked.\nSAM\nGood thing the one evil technogenius\nthinking like that is on my\nside.\nSam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nSo this is what the revolution\nlooks like? Office hours and\npaperwork.\nSam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room.\nREGGIE\nWinning was a happy accident. We\nwant the reform repealed right?\nCURLS\nMeans to an end, sister.\n21.\nSam feels the heat of her disciples\u2019 eyes on her as the topic\nof the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with\na group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white\nand Black.\nCOCO\nThe talented tenth always has to\nbust its ass a little bit harder,\nbut I don\u2019t see the benefit in\nblaming white folks for everything.\nCURLS\nWho\u2019s blaming?\nTROY\nI don\u2019t see the issue. I never had\none. Never ran into any lynch mobs.\nLionel takes a seat alone facing the action.\nKurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in\nthe heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact.\nSAM\nLynch mob is still there. Just rebranded\nitself.\nTROY\nAs what pray tell?\nREGGIE\nThe Republican party.\nSAM\nWant to know how this world sees\nyou? Go to a Young Republican\u2019s\nmeeting and bring up Welfare.\nSUNGMI\nOr Immigration.\nLIONEL\n(aside)\nOr gay equality.\nKURT\nBullshit.\nMARTIN\nI agree. Got something to add?\nKURT\nThe biggest athletes, movie stars,\nhell your president is Black.\n22.\n(MORE)\nSometimes I think the hardest thing\nto be in the American work force\nright now is an educated white guy.\nSUNGMI\nYou\u2019re not serious.\nKURT\nYou guys still got affirmative\naction, you\u2019re set.\nREGGIE\nThis shit.\nSAM\nWhat are you doing in here?\nKURT\nObama. Leader of the free world got\ninto Harvard on affirmative action.\nKnow who\u2019s not president right now?\nThe guy that didn\u2019t get in.\nSAM\nOn behalf of the colored folks in\nthe room, let me apologize for all\nthe better qualified white students\nwhose place we\u2019re taking up.\nKurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nYou get lost? Bechet is that way.\nKURT\nYeah but what other dining hall\ngives you chicken and waffles? Dear\nWhite People right? Funny stuff.\nHow haven\u2019t we staffed you yet?\nSAM\nOn Pastiche? Your uninspired humor\nmagazine?\nKURT\nWe\u2019re a lot more than a magazine\nsweetie. SNL staff is basically\nhalf Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just\nlike the network comedies.\nA flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco.\n23.\nKURT (CONT'D)\nSAM\nWhat gives you Clubhouse kids the\nright to come to our Dining Hall?\nKurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nYou don\u2019t live here.\nMARTIN\nSam? What are you doing?\nSAM\nYou can\u2019t eat here.\nKurt eyes this new adversary. Enjoys a good challenge.\nTROY\nChill Sam damn. Let the man--\nKURT & SAM\n-- I got this.\nKURT\nWho are you to put me out?\nSAM\n(realizing)\nI\u2019m the Head of this house. And I\u2019m\ndoing things my way.\nSam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to\nwhich Sam slams his tray to the ground.\nLionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad.\nKURT\nYou got any idea who you\u2019re --\nSAM\n-- Yeah, I know who your daddy is.\nThe same one who\u2019s been pushing to\nbreak up this House for a decade.\nWhat\u2019s wrong? Is he scared letting\nthe Negroes gather in groups might\nstart a rebellion on the\nplantation? You tell him from\nme...he should be.\nKurt looks into Sam\u2019s eyes and then his crew. They want out.\nKURT\nBad move.\n24.\nKurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight\nsnicker from Lionel which draws Sam\u2019s eyes right to him.\nSomething sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts\nto GEORGE: \u201cI\u2019ve got the angle. I\u2019m in.\u201d\nSAM\nYou too.\nLIONEL\nMe?\nSAM\nIs this your house?\nLionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.\nSam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady\napplause. Troy and his table look around baffled.\nBy the caution on Sam\u2019s face it seems the first time she\u2019s\never heard this sound directed at her.\nA slight envy boils in Coco.\nOne last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out.\nLocked out again.\n23 INT. COCO\u2019S ROOM - DAY 23\nCoco scrolls Sam\u2019s \u201cDear White People\u201d Youtube page. 75K\nSubscribers.

Weaved bitch?\n25.\n(MORE)\nFirst of all if you\u2019re going to fix\nyour mouth to ask me something like\nthat, say it right please? It\u2019s\nweave. Noun. Present tense. Second\nof all don\u2019t assume just because\nyou see a sister with some hair\nit\u2019s a weave. Is it? Clearly. If a\nbitch could grow straight Indian\nhair directly out her own head I\nwouldn\u2019t have just overdrafted my\naccount paying for this shit but\nthat ain\u2019t your business. Are those\nyour lips sweetie? Sweet heart is\nthat really your skin? These white\ngirls and these tans I swear to\nGod, they\u2019re starting to look\ndarker than me.\nCoco pauses it.

Does anyone have any comments\nfor Sam\u2019s \u201cRebirth of a Nation?\u201d\nAll of the kids are too scared to comment. Except...\nPROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT\u2019D)\nGabe, go ahead.\nGABE\nI dig the \u201csilent movie\u201d thing, but\nit\u2019s a little self-congratulatory.\nLight on story and frankly\nthematically dubious.\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nOkay. Anybody else?\nSAM\nWhat?\nSAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER\nAs students filter out of the class...\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nSam?\nSAM\nBefore you say anything might I\nremind you that I sat through Birth\nof A Nation, Gone With The Wind,\nand Tarantino week without protest.\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nAnd might I remind you that I read\nall fifteen pages of your\nunsolicited essay on why Gremlins\nis actually about suburban white\nfear of Black culture.\nSAM\nThe Gremlins are loud, talk in\nslang, are addicted to fried\nchicken and freak out when you get\ntheir hair wet.\n27.\nPRESIDENT BODKIN\nMy only problem with your movie is\nthat it was late. The silent\nprojects were last semester Sam.\nYou were supposed to have emailed\nyour sound treatment over Summer.\nSAM\nI\u2019ve been getting footage.\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\nThis is your senior thesis Sam,\nwhere the hell is your head at?\nSAM\nI\u2019ve got Radio, BSU, this Head of\nHouse thing --\nPROFESSOR BODKIN\n-- Do you want this?

Or the sassy\nBlack secretary with no backstory\nor character development aside from\ntheir skin color.\nGABE\nSo it\u2019s a tit for tat? *\nEXT. GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL 2 - DAY *\nSAM *\nYou\u2019re honestly saying that art *\ncan\u2019t be reactionary? *\nGABE *\nYou\u2019re reacting to a work made *\nalmost a hundred years ago. *\nSAM *\nYes because fear of Black men being *\ninvolved in the United States *\nGovernment is a completely *\nantiquated concept. No social *\nrelevance whatsoever today. *\nGABE *\nFrankly I just think sometimes its *\nbetter to hold a mirror up to your *\naudience than to drop an *\nideological piano over their head. *\n29.\nSAM *\nFrankly I just think works that *\ndeal with the African Diaspora *\nthrough a post-modern lens are *\noutright rejected unless they\u2019re *\nhandled by a white artist. *\nGABE *\nAfrican Diaspora? Really? *\n26 INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DAY 26\nThe war rages as the two continue up a fleet of stairs.\nSAM\nBlackface is alive and well in our\nculture. Who primarily buys hip\nhop? Watches Housewives of Atlanta?\nThe same homogenized images of\nBlack people over and over again?\nWhite people Gabe.\nGABE\nWho goes to see Tyler Perry movies?\nSAM\nWe\u2019re an underfed community. None\nof this changes the fact that the\nvibrancy, the complexity of Black\nculture has been distilled into\ncommodities and marketing schemes\nto be bought and sold--\nGABE\n--to the detriment of the so called\n\u201creal thing.\u201d Got it.\nAnd into a room...\nINT.

GABE\u2019S ROOM - EVENING 27A\nSam\u2019s eyes pop open - a startled scream escapes her lips.\nShe\u2019s surprised at first to see Gabe beside her in bed, the\noutside spoon. They\u2019re both naked. Her pompadour frayed.\nGABE\nWhat? You dream in \u201cCosby\u201d again?\nSAM\nMy hair was so straight. My sweater\nso big. I told you about that?\nSam\u2019s phone buzzes. Gabe grabs it and sees Reggie\u2019s photo pop\nup. He swallows his envy and hands it to Sam. She doesn\u2019t\nanswer. Silence as it hits her voicemail.\nGABE\nHey so...this whole \u201cHead of House\u201d\nthing. Congrats?\nSAM\nYeah, it's\u2026it's.\nGABE\nWeird, right? Never took you as a\nstudent politician...\nReggie\u2019s photo again - New Voicemail. A regret in Sam\u2019s eyes.\nSAM\nYeah, well...\nSam rolls out of bed.

Can\u2019t\never shake the feeling I\u2019m an\nassignment for that Afro Studies\nMinor of hers.\nTroy nervously glances out at the crowd and then back towards\nthis dangerous and tempting creature before him.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nI\u2019m sure you have no idea what I\nmean.\n49 EXT. MANCHESTER YARD - NIGHT 49\nLionel and George walk through the campus at night. George\nwaves goodbye to Annie as they pass Bechet House.\nLIONEL\nShe seems really cool.\nGeorge just smiles.\nGEORGE\nDid we go too far? You\u2019re in\nArmstrong/Parker right?\nLIONEL\nNo. Garmin.\nGEORGE\nFancy.\nLIONEL\nGeorge I\u2019m not exactly down with\nSam and I\u2019m not in the BSU. I got\nkicked out of Armstrong / Parker\nsame as Kurt. But I\u2019m going to\nwrite a good story, okay?\nGEORGE\nI hope so. I want a Bugle on your\nchest by the end of the month.\nLionel fights a smile as his heart beats through his chest.\n56.\nThey reach the front of Lionel\u2019s house. George runs his hand\nthrough Lionel\u2019s hair. Mitch, smoking on the porch with some\nother kids - trade glances.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nYour fro\u2019s so gnarly.\nLIONEL\nI\u2019m growing it out.\nGEORGE\nNight Lionel.\nLionel heads up his stoop - past the snickers and glares of\nMitch and company.\nMITCH\nParty\u2019s not over.\nLIONEL\nI live here.\nMITCH\nSorry bro. Invitation only.\nLIONEL\nIt\u2019s two in the morning.\nMitch shrugs as humiliation floods over Lionel.\nLionel sighs and slumps on the steps outside the door. He\nscrolls through his phone for a contact...OFFICE OF THE DEAN.\nStarts an email.\n50 INT. TROY\u2019S BEDROOM - MORNING 50\nTroy\u2019s Kangol sits in the ground, besides his undies, and\nbesides a bright pink thong.\nCoco\u2019s pink painted finger nails travel through the creases\nof Troy\u2019s immaculate abs.\nTROY\nCoco huh?\nCOCO\nColandrea doesn\u2019t exactly pass the\nresume test, you know? I mean\ncouldn\u2019t you fucking die? My\nparents should\u2019ve just named me\nGhetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha. Do\nyou...indulge?\nCoco fiddles in her purse - pulls out a joint.\n57.\nTROY\nIt\u2019s ten am.\nCoco lights it and takes a drag. She hands it to Troy.\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nI don\u2019t mess with that stuff.\nCoco sees right through him as Troy hits it like a pro.\nCOCO\nSure about that?\nTROY\nSure you don\u2019t like Black guys?\nCOCO\nGirl like me is just a placeholder\nfor ya\u2019ll at a place like this.\nTROY\nI\u2019m not like that.\nCOCO\nI don\u2019t think Sam would agree.\nTROY\nThat was different.\nCOCO\nNo it wasn\u2019t. Poor thing, she was\nlight skin-ded and everything.\nTROY\nYo, it wasn\u2019t like that alright?\nTroy\u2019s tone sobers Coco a bit. She places a hand on Troy\u2019s.\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nMy pops. He wanted me with\nFletcher\u2019s daughter. They\u2019ve been\nin competition ever since they went\nhere. Pops hates that Fletcher\nended up President and he got stuck\nas the Dean.\nCOCO\nSo your upbringing may have\nactually fucked you up more than\nmine? That\u2019s hot.\nTroy laughs and takes the joint back.\n58.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nThe hell is the difference between\na Dean and a President anyway?\nTROY\nApparently four hundred years of\nunreconciled oppression.\nCOCO\nHe\u2019s not going to like you running\nwith the Pastiche boys is he?\nTROY\nIf I even get tapped.\nCOCO\nYou will. And you should do it.\nThey all land somewhere big, some\nbefore they even graduate. I\u2019ve\nseen you in front of a crowd Troy.\nI bet you could be famous.\nTROY\nThat what you want? To be famous?\nCOCO\nI want people to know my name.\nTROY\nWhich one?\nCoco\u2019s phone buzzes with a message. It\u2019s Kurt.\nCOCO\n(reading)\nWe want you. Come by Ellington\ntomorrow at eight.\n(to Troy)\nAnything?\nTroy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy\u2019s\neyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nYou\u2019re going to have to stand up to\nhim sooner or later Troy.\n52 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY 52\nTroy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation\nmarks her pretty face.\nSOFIA\nYou said you loved me.\n59.\nTROY\nI like you a lot.\nSalt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her.\nSOFIA\nWhat do you do in the bathroom?\nWhen you leave the shower running?\nWas it just to get away from me?\nTroy wagers his answer and decides to confess.\nTROY\nI smoke weed and write jokes.\nPuzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia\njust turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...\n...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before\nTroy turns to enter the house.\n53 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME 53\nLionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He\nturns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other\u2019s gaze.\nAs they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that\nthey\u2019re headed in the same direction.\n53A UPSTAIRS 53A\nLionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it\nwith a key. Troy\u2019s already at the door when he looks up and\nrealizes Lionel\u2019s just entered his apartment.\n54 INT. TROY\u2019S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 54\nTROY\nThe hell are you doing?\nLIONEL & TROY\nThis is my apartment.\nTROY\nThe hell it is.\nLIONEL\nThe Dean said it was the only\nopening.\nTROY\nHead of House doesn\u2019t share.\n60.\nLIONEL\nBut you\u2019re not Head of House.\nStill stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door\nleaving Lionel alone in the living room.\n57 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 57\nLionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the\ndifferent cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past\nand shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.\nDREADS\nStay Black, my brother.\nLIONEL\nSure thing?\nLionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the\nentrance - suddenly chums. Troy\u2019s getting good news and\ngladly shakes Kurt\u2019s hand.\nKURT\nNeed your submission by Thursday.\nTROY\nYou got it bro.\nThe two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG\nin the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining\nhall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.\nKURT\nThe fuck?\nSam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her\nother support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.\nTROY\nYo!\nTroy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the\nhumiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.\nLionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the\nother side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam\nbriefly who shares the same smirk.\nHe realizes Sam\u2019s actually looking at Reggie, perched behind\nhim at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.\nREGGIE\nFinally made it in.\n61.\nDREADS\nBeen moved around a lot right?\nCURLS\nYou must have been terrified when\nyou saw \u201cArmstrong/Parker\u201d written\non your moving assignment.\nLIONEL\nI was just finishing up.\nREGGIE\nDo Black people scare you?\nLIONEL\n(realizing its true)\nNo.\nREGGIE\nYou\u2019re too scared to even ask\nanyone for a cut.\nLIONEL\nI\u2019m growing it out.\nDREADS\nNo. I\u2019m growing it out. You\u2019re\nfostering an ecosystem.\nREGGIE\nHow come you don\u2019t come to BSU?\nLIONEL\nI listen to Mumford and Sons and\nwatch Robert Altman movies. You\nhonestly think I\u2019m Black enough for\nthe union?\nDREADS\nYo, I love Robert Altman. Mutha\nfucka goes in.\nCURLS\n(after a beat)\nWe\u2019re not all homophobes you know.\nBlack folks?\nLionel\u2019s eyes dart around. How did she know?\nDREADS\nI\u2019m bumping Frank Ocean right now.\nI don\u2019t give a fuck. Imma still eat\nat Chik Fil A though. Them nuggets\ngood as hell.\n62.\nLIONEL\nI\u2019m late for class.\nREGGIE\nYou\u2019re the \u201cBlack voice\u201d of the\nBugle now. We\u2019re just trying to\ndecide if you are friend or foe.\nReggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm.\nSam\u2019s on the front page with the headline \u201cWHITE STUDENTS\nTOLD TO \u2018GET OUT\u2019 BY LIONEL HIGGINS.\u201d\nREGGIE (CONT\u2019D)\nWe got to protect our girl.\nReggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over\nsomething with Martin at another table.\nLIONEL\nI\u2019m not on staff. Not until I make\ngood on my assignment, I\u2019m just --\nREGGIE\n-- Assignment? What\u2019s the story?\nLIONEL\nThey want me to do a profile piece\non Black culture at Manchester.\nREGGIE\nOf which you are so clearly an\nexpert.\nShame floods Lionel\u2019s face.\nREGGIE (CONT\u2019D)\nSo what\u2019s harder man? Being Black\nenough for the Black kids or the\nwhite ones?\nLIONEL\nBeing neither.\nAnother GONG sounds with another shower of paper balls. This\ntime it\u2019s for...\n...Gabe, who\u2019s stuck outside. He makes eye contact with...\nGABE\nSam! Really Sam?\nShe just looks away. Reggie eyes him coolly.\n63.\n58 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 58\nProfessor Bodkin watches over a small class as the students\nfill in essay questions. Sam\u2019s eyes are glued to a window...\nOutside below the Brofros pull up in an SUV. They hop out and\nstart pulling out rally signs and bullhorns.\nSam\u2019s eyes dart back to the clock as Gabe watches her watch\nthe time.\n59A EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 59A\nSam bounds out of a building on her way to the parking lot.\nFrom behind her...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nRunning late.\nSam pauses and turns to see him.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT\u2019D)\nFor your little rally?\nSAM\nForget your sign Dean?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nDo you honestly think this is in\nthe spirit of Armstrong / Parker\nhouse?\nSAM\nThe role of the counter culture is\nto wake up the mainstream to --\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n-- I\u2019ve got furniture older than\nyou. Counter culture? Is that what\nyou think this is? That show of\nyours?\nSAM\nWhat about my show?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYour show is racist.\nSAM\nBlack people can\u2019t be racist.\nThe Dean is rendered speechless at this statement.\n64.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nPrejudice? Yes. But not racist.\nRacism describes a system of\ndisadvantage based on race. Black\npeople can\u2019t be racist since they\ndon\u2019t benefit from such a system.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nDo you read the school papers?\nSAM\nIs the New York Times a school\npaper?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYour antics are making press Sam\nand press like this keeps men like\nPresident Fletcher up at night.\nSAM\nWarm milk?\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nHe\u2019s building a file on you.\nSAM\nIt\u2019s not my fault your son couldn\u2019t\nbeat me in an election.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI\u2019m sure it was hard growing up.\nWondering which side you fit into.\nFeeling like you have to\novercompensate perhaps?\nSAM\nIf that\u2019s true, I\u2019m not the only\none Dean.\nSam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank\u2019s last words resonate\nmore than she\u2019d like.\nGabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.\n59B EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 59B\nHuge canvas signs with the words \u201cWHITES ONLY\u201d are strewn\nabout the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.\nSam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the\nSUV.\n65.\nREGGIE\nThere you are! We supposed to start\nat noon.\nSAM\nI told you I had class.\nThere\u2019s a vibration in Sam\u2019s pocket. Her phone says \u201cMOM.\u201d\nShe cuts it off and picks up a \u201cwhite\u2019s only\u201d sign.\nREGGIE\nThose are going up on Gillespie.\nGood right?\nSam shrugs in the affirmative but it\u2019s too much. Reggie sees\na doubt in her eyes.\nREGGIE (CONT\u2019D)\nYo. What\u2019s that? You\u2019re not getting\ncold feet are you?\nSAM\nNo. I mean how long do I have to\ntalk anyway?\nREGGIE\nYou\u2019re kidding right? You\u2019re sort\nof the keynote.\nSAM\nYeah but...you know I think the\nwhole Malcolm X thing is your lane\nReg. I\u2019m just not --\nREGGIE\n-- They came to hear you Sam. Grab\na bullhorn. Turn it on.\nSam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse\nand comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to\nher phone. Sam checks: \u201cIT\u2019S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME\u201d\nSam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe\nwho\u2019s just happened upon the parking lot.\nGABE\nWhat is all this?\nSAM\n(on phone)\nHey. In the middle of--\n-- Okay. Okay. Okay.\n66.\nTears well up in Sam\u2019s eyes as she shakes her head no and\nheads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.\nWhen Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted\nlook of indignation asks her what she\u2019s doing.\nREGGIE\nSam?\nSam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie\u2019s\nheart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her.\nREGGIE (CONT\u2019D)\nSam!\n60 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 60\nReggie flanked by the BoFros bangs on Sam\u2019s door.\nREGGIE\nYo, what the hell Sam?\n61 INT. SAM\u2019S ROOM - DAY 61\nThe banging continues as Sam sits on the edge of her bed. The\ntears have dried. Gabe paces behind the bed.\nGABE\nYou want me to tell them to go?\nSAM\nYou\u2019re so tough.\nGABE\nI will.\nSAM\nI want you to wait until they\u2019ve\ngone and then head home.\nGABE\nI\u2019m trying to be here for you.\nSAM\nCan you be somewhere else for me?\n61A HALLWAY 61A\nREGGIE\nSam! I know you\u2019re home.\n67.\n61B SAM\u2019S ROOM 61B\nGABE\nWhat do you see in him?\nSAM\nThe only eligible single brother on\ncampus.\nGABE\nWow. Okay.\nSAM\nI get it. Your parents owned in\nHarlem or something? You watched\n\u201cDo The Right Thing\u201d in high school\nand you want to prove to the world\nyou\u2019re down?\nGABE\nI want to be down? How long does it\ntake to get your hair like that?\nREGGIE (O.S.)\nSam. We want to talk.\nSAM\nReggie I will call you later damn!\n(to Gabe)\nYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking\nabout. Girls like me--\nGABE\n--what? Have to pick a side? I\u2019m\nsick of your tragic Mulatto\nbullshit Sam!\nSAM\nYou can\u2019t say Mulatto.\nGABE\nMulatto! Mulatto! Mulatto!\nMORE BANGING\nSAM\nWindow. Go out the window.\nGABE\nI\u2019m sorry if I can\u2019t be your Nubian\nprince on my Black horse ready to\ntake you back to fucking Zamunda!\n68.\nSAM\nThat\u2019s not a real African country.\nGABE\nCan I please get some credit for a\nsolid \u201cComing to America\u201d\nreference?\nSam tries not laugh at this.\nGABE (CONT\u2019D)\nThis isn\u2019t you Sam.\nSAM\nNo? And who am I?\nGABE\nYou\u2019re this...girl...\nSAM\nPerceptive.\nGABE\nWho...likes to argue with me about\nevery fucking thing. And I hate it\nbecause we both know you\u2019re smarter\nthan me. Your favorite director is\nBergman, but you tell people its\nSpike Lee. You love bebop, but\nyou\u2019ve got a thing for Taylor\nSwift. I know because my Mac picks\nup your Mac\u2019s library.\nSAM\nAnd I was so careful...\nGABE\nYou like to use phrases from the\nthirties and wear clothes from the\nfifties and hairstyles from the\nsixties. You like to watch me when\nyou think I\u2019m sleeping. And trace\nthe outlines of my face.\nSam fights any signs of this moving her. Another BANG.\nGABE (CONT\u2019D)\nYou\u2019re more \u201cBanksy\u201d than \u201cBarack\u201d\nbut you\u2019ve been co-opted as some\nsort of revolutionary leader or\nsomething? But really you\u2019re an\nanarchist. A beautiful writer,\nartist, filmmaker, shit starter.\nAnd beautiful, in general.\n69.\nSam\u2019s heart beats through her chest. Her phone rings: \u201cMom.\u201d\nSAM\nYeah? Yeah? Yeah. It\u2019s okay. Get\nsome sleep.\nSam hangs up. A silence hangs - followed by a loud EXHALE\nfrom Sam as she let\u2019s go of the tension she\u2019d been holding.\nGABE\nEverything okay?\nSAM\n(happy tears)\nHis condition\u2019s stable.\nGABE\nGood. That\u2019s good Sam.\nGabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again.\nSAM\nGabe!\nGabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie...\nGABE\nWhat!?\n...and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down\nthe heartbroken looks on her disciples\u2019 faces.\nSAM\nI\u2019m sorry.\nAnd with that she closes the door right on Reggie.\n62 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT 62\nCoco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing\nterrace atop the Library.

You think they want\ninteresting? Dignified stories of\ntriumph and survival?\n(off Coco\u2019s naive shrug)\nThey want the \u201cauthentic urban\nexperience\u201d which is basically\nnetwork talk for bitching and weave\nsnatching. I\u2019m telling you this\nbecause the network is looking to\ntake one of the subjects to series.\nI got one episode. One shot to find\nthat subject. So if we do this...\nCOCO\n...we do it all the way. I\u2019m\nguessing Sam turned you down.\nHELMUT\nI think so. She called me a\nBojangling Oofta, whatever that\nmeans. Everything else she said\nwould\u2019ve been bleeped on tv.\n(off Coco\u2019s laugh)\nSo look, forty thousand hits on\nYoutube is good. It\u2019s not great.\nCOCO\nI\u2019m about to get a whole lot more.\n63 INT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - DAY 63\nCoco sits before a video camera.

TROY\u2019S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67\nTroy and Lionel both type furiously at their computers in\ntheir rooms. Troy on his invite - Lionel on his article.

Pours a bowl of cereal. He glances into Troy\u2019s\nroom. He\u2019s also got Star Trek on. Could it be? Troy, feels\nLionel\u2019s eyes on him and quickly switches it to Basketball.\n67C TROY\u2019S ROOM 67C\nTroy types in \u201cKURT FLETCHER\u201d in the \u201cTo\u201d field and \u201cPASTICHE\nSUBMISSION\u201d in the subject field. He hits \u201csend\u201d and swallows\nthe lump in his throat.\n68 INT. DEANS OFFICE - DAY 68\nTroy gingerly enters into the Dean\u2019s office. Martin and Dean\nFairbanks talk in hushed tones around Fairbanks' desk.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nMartin, would you share with Troy\nwhat you shared with me?\nMARTIN\nThe server that processes the\nvoting results for House Elections\nhas shut down the A.P. database.\nSaw it this morning. Apparently the\nintermediary program is on a\nrefractile loop.\nTROY\nI\u2019m a Poly Sci major man.\nMARTIN\nSam currently has 445 votes. That\u2019s\n200 more than she had last week\nduring the actual election.\nTROY\nThere\u2019s not even that many\nresidents in Armstrong / Parker.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nShe cheated. Hacked the system.\n69 INT. PRESIDENT\u2019S OFFICE - DAY 69\nSam sits before a giant fireplace - twice as large as the\nDean\u2019s. She faces President Fletcher and fights nerves.\n73.\nSAM\nI wouldn\u2019t even begin to know how\nto do something like that.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nIs your little war really this\nimportant?\nSam shifts gears slightly - he wants something from her.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT\u2019D)\nI understand the pressure to stand\nfor something at an institution\nlike this but you\u2019re barking up the\nwrong tree okay?\n70 INT.

I appreciate this.\n71 INT. PRESIDENT\u2019S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 71\nSam glares at Fletcher.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nYour advisor tells me you\u2019re\nhanging on by a thread in you\nmajor. Perhaps it\u2019s time to\nreprioritize.\nSAM\nYou\u2019re trying to frighten me, but I\nthink you\u2019re the one who\u2019s scared.\n74.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nAnd I think you long for the days\nwhere Blacks were hanging from\ntrees and denied actual rights.\nThen you\u2019d actually have something\nto fight against.\nA swell of emotion behind Sam\u2019s steel eyes.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT\u2019D)\nYou will be facing two hearings in\nthe coming weeks that could end in\neither Probation or Suspension. One\non the merits of your show, the\nother on your election to Head of\nHouse.\nSam is truly scared by this.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT\u2019D)\nYour responsibilities to your house\nare suspended. Your show is done\nfor. And another one of your\nillegal \u201cdemonstrations\u201d will only\nmake matters worse. This is a\ncritical time for this school.\nSAM\nYou damn right it is.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nWe don\u2019t have an intolerance\nproblem here. Except for the one\nI\u2019m looking at.\n72 INT.

Then Law School and\nthen --\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\n--And what\u2019s that got to do with\npartying with Kurt? With smoking\nweed and writing jokes?\nPanic flashes over Troy.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT\u2019D)\nOkay, so what? Is it the spotlight\nKurt gets? You want to be on...tv\nor something? You know how many\nBlack men waste their lives to get\non TV? Be rappers and ball players?\nTROY\n(wanting it to be true)\nDad no. I want what we always\ntalked about. Maybe have my own\nfirm someday? Run for office. Make\na difference. Wife. Kids. I want\nall that. I really really do.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nAnd the drugs? God damn it Troy I\ntaught you better than this. I have\nbeen in academia a long time, I\u2019ve\nseen a lot of things. The men who\nreally run this world? You got no\nidea what they see when they see\nyou. You are not going to be what\nthey all think you are. You will\nnot give them that satisfaction,\nyou hear me?\nTROY\nYes sir.\n73 INT. PRESIDENT\u2019S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 73\nSam steps out of Fletcher\u2019s office into the waiting room.\nKurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other\ndown as Kurt enters his father\u2019s office.\nA SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit\nthe room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through\nthe window.\nSam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and\nlistens in.\n76.\nPRESIDENT FLETCHER\nI know about the party.

Really break down what\u2019s\ngoing on.\nLionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a\nphone call.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nRight. It\u2019s almost like they\nrecycle so much from their past -\nMusic, food, fashion, and now\nturbulence.\nThis leaves a bitter taste in Lionel\u2019s mouth.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nThank you so much. Okay, take care.\nGeorge can\u2019t fight his grin as he looks to Annie.\nANNIE\nWell?\nGEORGE\nThat was our Times advisor. He said\nit\u2019s stories like these that get\neditors recommendation letters.\nLionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but\nreassured when they see who it is.\n77.\nLIONEL\nThe Negro at the door didn\u2019t scare\nyou this time.\nAnnie smiles and heads for the door.\nANNIE\nLionel please. You\u2019re only\ntechnically Black. G, going to\nFrench. You want me to hold your\nseat?\nGEORGE\nThanks.\nAnnie smiles and walks out.\nLIONEL\nYou need something? Saw your email.\nGEORGE\nYeah, I need someone to do the\nDonor\u2019s function on Saturday. Small\ndinner for the school\u2019s big givers.\nAdministration wants a little\ncoverage.\nLIONEL\nThat\u2019s Halloween night.\nGEORGE\nRight, which is why no one else\nwill take it.\nLIONEL\nAh. Thus the new guy.\nGeorge gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets\nclose.\nGEORGE\nOn my way to class, but you can\nstay and check out last year\u2019s\npiece. You\u2019ll do fine.\nLIONEL\nI don\u2019t know. Are there going to be\nany racially fueled outbursts at\nthis thing?\nGEORGE\nNever know right?\n78.\nIt\u2019s clear Lionel wants to say something else. George too.\nLIONEL\nAm I a good writer?\nGEORGE\nYou\u2019ll get better. And we need you\nright now.\nLIONEL\nYou\u2019re just a big recommendation\naway from landing the Times.\nGEORGE\nGod I hope so.\nLionel looks down. He is being used. Turns to go, just as --\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nHey.\n-- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. So\ninstead he just kisses him.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nI\u2019m glad we finally got that Bugle\non your chest.\nLionel\u2019s all mixed up.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nThere\u2019s a big party the night of\nthe Donor\u2019s event.

TROY\u2019S APARTMENT - NIGHT 76\nTroy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his durag\nto reveal his perfectly curled finger waves. He\u2019s getting\nready for something.\nHis phone buzzes with a notification: \u201cMessage from:\nPASTICHE\u201d\nTroy nervously clicks it open. As he reads...\n79.\nKURT (V.O.)\nDear White People.

He flinches in pain as he\nfluffs out each section.\nKURT (V.O.)\nDudes must rock FUBU, Ecko,\nRocawear, or Sean John. XXXL is the\nsmallest size T-Shirt you can wear,\npreferably with a collage of Barack\nObama and Tupac on it. Stunner\nShades, chains, and Blue-Tooth\ndevices sticking out yo ears are\nalso encouraged.\n76B Coco pulls a blonde curly wig over her natural hair. She 76B\nsmooths her tendrils to frame her face, almost pale with\nfoundation. She begins on her eyes.\nKURT (V.O.)\nLadies, we need to see huge hoop\nearrings, long nails, and cheap\ntight clothes.\n80.\n(MORE)\nA proper hood rat starts fights,\nspeaks loudly, and when she can\u2019t\nthink of the word she\u2019s trying to\nsay just makes one up, such as\n\u201cedumicated.\u201d Feel free to fry up\nsome chicken, bring Kool-Aid,\nWatermelon, 40s, Henny, and of\ncourse Dat Purple Drank. No bougie\nbitches allowed.\n76C Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C\nup her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around\nher ears.

He smokes on Coco\u2019s one-hitter from before.\nLionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand.\nThe two are surprised to see each other.\nLIONEL\nFunny seeing you here.\nTROY\nFather likes to show me off at all\nthe Donor functions. The dessert\ncourse is usually my cue to take a\nbreather while they talk shop.\n(friendlier)\nThe trick is to dazzle them into\nforking over their estates just\nbefore they kick the bucket.\nLionel could just leave. Instead he accepts the olive branch.\nLIONEL\nSo...Picard or Kirk?\nTROY\nKirk. Wait...\nLIONEL\nI saw you watching Star --\n81.\nKURT (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nTROY\n-- Yo what happens in the crib\nstays in the crib.

That work out for you?\nLIONEL\nNo. No it did not. At least not in\nHigh School. I bet there\u2019s a statue\nof you at your High School.\nTROY\nI was beloved. Won\u2019t lie.\nLIONEL\nDid they know you were a trekker?\nTROY\nMy pops left a paint by numbers\ntemplate for success at that High\nSchool. All I had to do was fill in\nthe blanks. Football captain.\nValedictorian. Prom King.\nLionel sees a sadness in Troy.\nTROY (CONT\u2019D)\nSo what? You\u2019re growing that out?\nLIONEL\nI think it\u2019s gaining sentience.\nTROY\nIt\u2019s...out there.\nLIONEL\nIt\u2019s like a black hole for white\npeople\u2019s fingers. They\u2019re obsessed.\nTROY\nYou know I cut hair. Why didn\u2019t you\nask me?\nLIONEL\nYou\u2019re I dunno...you?\n82.\nBehind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to\nGillespie.\nGEORGE\nLi!

KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 79\nThe party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in\ncostume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as\npimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack\nObama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.\nIt\u2019s a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with\n\u201cPurple Drank.\u201d Everyone downs the stuff.\nINT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT\nTroy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.\nTROY\n...my own firm. Maybe run for\noffice. Make a difference you know?\n83.\nThe couple smile.

KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 80\nLionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously\nput up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel\nglances at the posters - it\u2019s Kurt with a large Afro wig\nmimicking Sam\u2019s \u201cMissing Black Culture\u201d flyers.\nLIONEL\nThis is kind of fucked up. Right?\nGEORGE\nPastiche. The world\u2019s most erudite\nboneheads. Who wants another round?\nCome on Lionel, help a brother out.\nLIONEL\nKitchen\u2019s this way.\n80A ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80A\nCoco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She\u2019s\nfeeling herself as she\u2019s handed a drink.\nShe\u2019s got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a\nparty. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.\nHer confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath\nher party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...\nCOCO\nHey there muffins. How do I look?\nWhy are white folks so obsessed\nwith being Black? And why are Black\nfolks so addicted to Blonde Barbie\ndoll weaves? Honeys it\u2019s a strange\nsymbiosis we\u2019re here to explore...\nCoco\u2019s voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her\niPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath.\n80B HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 80B\nLionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the\nkitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into...\n80C BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 80C\n...the bathroom and up against the door. George inhales\nLionel\u2019s lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel\u2019s hair.\n84.\nLIONEL\nOuch.\nGEORGE\nSorry.\nLIONEL\nIt\u2019s okay. Can\u2019t wait to cut all\nthis off.\nGEORGE\nDon\u2019t you dare.\nGeorge plunges his fingers into Lionel\u2019s fro once again.\nPulls a touch too hard.\nGEORGE (CONT\u2019D)\nI could eat you like a Hershey\u2019s.\nThis sets something off in Lionel.\nLIONEL\nI\u2019ll be right back.\nLionel breaks George\u2019s grasp and heads out the bathroom...\nLIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n...and back out into the party. He\u2019s trapped in a nightmare\nof caricatures and reveling students. Can\u2019t breathe.\nEXT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT\nLionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his\nhead as he starts walking away from the party.\nJust then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some\nfriends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.\nKURT\nWhat the hell?\n81 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT 81\nLionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the\ndining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense.\nDINING HALL\nSAM\nFor a genius dude you\u2019re a fucking\nidiot.\n85.\nREGGIE\nI did it, we did it for you.\nSAM\nI didn\u2019t ask for it Reggie. I look\nlike I betrayed this house.\nREGGIE\nYeah? Well you betrayed me.\nSam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel.\nLIONEL\nSam? Can we talk?\nSam turns back around fiercely.\n82 INT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 82\nA turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED\nLIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record.\nThe crowd starts to get live now.\nCoco continues to make her way through the party - her face\nvisibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She\ncontinues out back...\n83 EXT. KURT\u2019S BACKYARD - NIGHT 83\n...and sits pulling out a cigarette. She sees Annie put on a\nlong straight Black wig and brag to friends...\nANNIE\nHey who am I? \u201cBitch it\u2019s weave.\nNoun. Present tense ho!\u201d\nRight in the gut. She\u2019s playing Coco. Coco grabs her phone...\n84 INT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84\nKurt stumbles about the party in a daze. Drunk? Folks give\nhim props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the\nothers. His phone rings.\nKURT\nYeah?\nINTERCUT\nCOCO\nKurt, it\u2019s me. I can\u2019t do this.\n86.\nKURT\nOkay, I\u2019m fucking confused.\n85 INT. SAM\u2019S ROOM - NIGHT 85\nLionel sits across from Sam.\nSAM\nWhat do you want me to do? Go over\nthere and yell at them?\nLIONEL\nHave you heard you yelling?\nSAM\nThis house is filled with folks\nwilling to take up after a cause\nLionel. Believe me. Never would\nhave guessed you\u2019d be one of them\nbut...\nLIONEL\nFor the first time in my life, I\ncan\u2019t just sit around and do\nnothing. How can you?\nSAM\nIf I\u2019m caught being a part of\nanything like this...it wouldn\u2019t be\ngood for me right now okay?\nLionel gets up and walks towards the door.\nSAM (CONT\u2019D)\nI\u2019m done being everybody\u2019s angry\nBlack chick.\nSam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out.\nSam\u2019s focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and\nthen to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.\n86 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT 86\nLionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining\nroom - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other\nstudents mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER.\n86A DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 86A\nLionel gingerly walks in the room. He\u2019s still an outsider\nhere - but something\u2019s changed in him.\n87.\nLIONEL\nHey. How\u2019s it going. Hi.\nNo one answers him - just stay to their own conversations.\nLionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi.\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nHey...what is this?\nSUNGMI\nBlack Student Union.\nLionel smiles shyly. He should\u2019ve known that.\nReggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front.\nDREADS\nYour call then man.\nREGGIE\n(to everyone)\nAlright ya\u2019ll - thanks for coming\nout tonight. Looks like Sam\u2019s not\nmaking it so...let\u2019s just call it.\nThe crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and\nleave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...\nLIONEL\nUh. Excuse me. Hi. I\u2019m Lionel. Some\nof you...none of you probably know\nme. I\u2019ve never been to a meeting.\nBut I just came back from a party\non campus and I think you should\nknow about it.\nLionel\u2019s nerves can be heard in his voice now. He\u2019s got the\njudging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an\nopen laptop on a desk.\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nAnybody mind if I?\nReggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up\nthe party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel\nbrowses through the photos.\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nI mean...I don\u2019t know. This is\nfucked up right?\nREGGIE\nAlright brother. What\u2019s the plan?\n88.\nLionel realizes the eyes aren\u2019t judging. They\u2019re mobilizing.\nReadying for action. Lionel steels himself.\nLIONEL\nWe go over there. Now.\nCURLS\nThink there\u2019s enough of us?\nSUNGMI\nYou know you don\u2019t have a monopoly\non being a pissed off minority.\nLatino\u2019s United is meeting across\nthe hall. Asian American League\ntoo.\n(off the stares)\nYou guys got better snacks.\n87 INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 87\nTroy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads\nfrom the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.\nShoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table\ncovered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to\nhis father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President\nFletcher.\nTROY\nDad...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nNot now Troy.\nTROY\nIt\u2019s important. There\u2019s something\nhappening on campus. I might\u2019ve...\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nYou\u2019re being rude son.\nDean Fairbanks turns away. Troy ponders a moment and then--\nTROY\nOh am I? How about I tell your\nprecious donors and anyone here\nwho\u2019ll listen about the kind of a\nschool it is they\u2019re giving to?\nThe Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on\nhim - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside.\n89.\nDEAN FAIRBANKS\nI don\u2019t know who you think you are\nyoung man but you don\u2019t get to talk\nto your father any kind of way.\nTROY\nAll I say to you is yes sir and no\nsir! Look I should\u2019ve brought this\nup before but --\n(off Fairbanks dismissal)\n-- listen to me!\nDean Fairbanks tries to cover this moment with a smile.\n88 INT. KURT\u2019S KITCHEN - NIGHT 88\nKurt, still dazed, huddles with his core Pastiche group.\nKURT\nWhat?\nGORDON\nYeah dude. We all got it. I mean,\neverything\u2019s cool right?\nA noise in the other room startles them...\n88A LIVING ROOM 88A\n...It\u2019s Reggie who knocks over a bowl of chips. Dreads argues\nwith a few people. Martin rips shades off a kid\u2019s face. The\nparty swarms with BSU kids and their Latino / Asian allies.\nA SMASH yanks Kurt\u2019s attention back to the kitchen...\n88B KITCHEN 88B\n...where Lionel smashes bottles of liquor in the sink.\nKURT\nLionel?\nKurt yanks the booze from Lionel and shoves him.\nKURT (CONT\u2019D)\nThe fuck you think you\u2019re doing\nman?\nLionel shoves Kurt into the bar divide. A few of the BSU kids\nflood into the kitchen and hold Kurt back.\nKURT (CONT\u2019D)\nThat all you got?\n90.\nLIONEL\nWe\u2019re putting an end to this Kurt.\nKURT\nFuck you I\u2019m calling the cops.\nMARTIN\nHalf of this crowd is under 21.\nA loud AMP sound alerts everyone to the DJ platform in the\nLiving Room.\n88C LIVING ROOM 88C\nMitch has taken over the mic.\nMITCH\nGimme that mic\nBefore I slap ya\nLooking for some dykes,\nthat wanna another chapta.\nIf you do me slow,\nyou can do me faster,\nI\u2019ll pass you to the Nigga on my\nright, he gets you after.\nLIONEL\nKurt--\nKURT\n-- Why don\u2019t you tuck your tail\nbetween your legs, run and tell the\nDean and get the fuck out.\nLionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU\nwatches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.\nLionel turns to go and spots...\n...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right\nbehind George is...\n...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed\nat the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.\nLionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.\nLionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of\none of the rapper\u2019s hands.\nLIONEL\nHeyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!\n91.\nThe crowd is with it - thinks it\u2019s part of the show as Lionel\nproceeds to freestyle terribly...\nLIONEL (CONT\u2019D)\nMy name is Lionel,\nSome people call me Li.\nLots of people think\nthat I talk kinda white.\nWell that\u2019s alright.\nYeah that\u2019s cool.\nI\u2019d rather you think I\u2019m white,\nthan tap dance for you.\nWith that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He\nthen takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.\nSparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.\nLionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.\nLionel\u2019s off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes\nKurt away in his defense.\nGordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.\nMore equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the\nparty disintegrates into chaos.\nSam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.\nArt is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on\nthe ground. Arguments come to physical blows.\nThe steel in Sam\u2019s gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?\nAnd then she spots...\n...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.\nSam\u2019s camera and mic stay trained on Coco.\nCOCO\nWhat? Say it. Come on.\nSam stays silent.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nThis may come as a shock, but these\npeople don\u2019t give a fuck about no\nHarriet muthafuckin Tubman. They\npay millions of dollars on their\ntans, their lips, their asses, Jay-\nZ tickets, you name it, cause they\nwanna be us.\n92.\n(MORE)\nSo they got to be for a night.I\u2019m\nnot about to go out into the\nstreets in protest of a Halloween\nparty.\nSam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco\nrealizes it\u2019s herself she\u2019s trying to convince.\nCoco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is\nnew for her. Keeping her mouth shut.\n89 EXT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 89\nCoco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her\nlashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night.\n90 EXT. KURT\u2019S YARD - NIGHT 90\nKurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the\nground.\nKURT\nDude. I know you can\u2019t help it...\nLionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down.\nKURT (CONT\u2019D)\n...but why are you such a fag dude?\nLionel spits in Kurt\u2019s face and pops right back up again. We\nsee it in his eyes - he\u2019ll never give up.\nKurt\u2019s hand is on Lionel\u2019s collar. He pushes him down again.\nKids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -\nsome from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.\nLionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt\u2019s eyes.\nLionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.\nLIONEL\nFinally got me where you want me.\nKurt\u2019s in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.\nLionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as\nwell. No time to soak this in though. Kurt\u2019s let up. For a\nmoment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the\nface. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.\nThe shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.\nThe world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort\nof makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.\n93.\nCOCO (CONT\u2019D)\nKids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard -\nOne is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a\ncouple POLICE OFFICERS surround him.\n91 INT. KURT\u2019S HOUSE - NIGHT 91\nThe motor on Sam\u2019s Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a\ncomplete standstill.\nTroy enters and looks around in disbelief.

AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 92\nA SERIES OF SHOTS FROM A MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A SCREEN\nWe see the Dean looking about the party with disappointment.\nCUT TO:\n92A KURT looking bewildered outside his house after the 92A\nparty. We hear BOOS from a crowd. The carnage is devastating.\nWindows are blown out - trash and destroyed furniture on the\nlawn. Ash where fires were put out.\nKURT\nI didn\u2019t do this. Sam.

I didn\u2019t mean to say all\nof that. I don\u2019t know why I did.\nGABE\nSam. Where are you going?\nSAM\nI don\u2019t know. Lunch?\nGabe starts to walk with her.\nGABE\nIsn\u2019t it Mac and Cheese day at\nArmstrong/Parker?\nSAM\nThink they\u2019ll let you in?\nGabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam\nlets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into\neach others\u2019 eyes.\nDon\u2019t even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.\n98 INT.

But do you?\nTroy doesn\u2019t know how to answer that. He stares at the\ntriumphant, winning version of himself on his poster.\n105.\nCoco\u2019s eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of\nwho she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.\nWatching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and\nSungmi. They both know that look well...\nSAM\nHey Lionel. With me out and Troy\nmoving on - A/P\u2019s going to need a\nnew head of house.\nLIONEL\nThink there\u2019s a story there?

FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY 100\nFairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher\u2019s office to join\nhim at his desk. They\u2019re all ears as they look across to...\nHELMUT\nLet me get this straight.

The boy grew up like the moon on the night of fulness; and when he came to man's estate and was endowed with all kinds of perfections, his father fell sick of a death-malady and, calling his son to him, said, \"O my son, the fated hour of my decease is at hand, and I desire to give thee my last injunctions.\" He asked, \"And what are they, O my father?\"; and he answered, \"O my son, I charge thee, be not over-familiar with any[FN#255] and eschew what leadeth to evil and mischief. Beware lest thou sit in company with the wicked; for he is like the blacksmith; if his fire burn thee not, his smoke shall bother thee: and how excellent is the saying of the poet,[FN#256]\n\n'In thy whole world there is not one,\nWhose friendship thou may'st count upon,\nNor plighted faith that will stand true,\nWhen times go hard, and hopes are few.\nThen live apart and dwell alone,\nNor make a prop of any one,\nI've given a gift in that I've said,\nWill stand thy friend in every stead:'\nAnd what another saith,\n\n'Men are a hidden malady; * Rely not on the sham in them:\nFor perfidy and treachery * Thou'lt find, if thou examine them.'\n\nAnd yet a third saith,\n\n'Converse with men hath scanty weal, except * To while away the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     time in chat and prate:\nThen shun their intimacy, save it be * To win thee lore, or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     better thine estate.'\n\nAnd a fourth saith,\n\n'If a sharp-witted wight e'er tried mankind, * I've eaten that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     which only tasted he:[FN#257]\nTheir amity proved naught but wile and guile, * Their faith I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     found was but hypocrisy.'\"\n\nQuoth Ali, \"O my father, I have heard thee and I will obey thee what more shall I do?\" Quoth he, \"Do good whereas thou art able; be ever kind and courteous to men and regard as riches every occasion of doing a good turn; for a design is not always easily carried out; and how well saith the poet,\n\"Tis not at every time and tide unstable, * We can do kindly acts\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp   and charitable:\nWhen thou art able hasten thee to act, * Lest thine endeavour\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     prove anon unable!'\"\n\nSaid Ali, \"I have heard thee and I will obey thee.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youth replied, \"I have heard thee and I will obey thee; what more?\" And his sire continued, \"Be thou, O my son, mindful of Allah, so shall He be mindful of thee. Ward thy wealth and waste it not; for an thou do, thou wilt come to want the least of mankind. Know that the measure of a man's worth is according to that which his right hand hendeth: and how well saith the poet,[FN#258]\n\n'When fails my wealth no friend will deign befriend, * And when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     it waxeth all men friendship show:\nHow many a foe for wealth became my friend, * Wealth lost, how\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     many a friend became a foe!'\"\n\nAsked Ali, \"What more?\" And Majd al-Din answered, \"O my son, take counsel of those who are older than thou and hasten not to do thy heart's desire. Have compassion on those who are below thee, so shall those who are above thee have compassion on thee; and oppress none, lest Allah empower one who shall oppress thee. How well saith the poet,\n\n'Add other wit to thy wit, counsel craving, * For man's true\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     course hides not from minds of two\nMan is a mirror which but shows his face, * And by two mirrors he\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     his back shall view.'\n\nAnd as saith another,[FN#259]\n\n'Act on sure grounds, nor hurry fast,\nTo gain the purpose that thou hast\nAnd be thou kindly to all men\nSo kindly thou'lt be called again;\nFor not a deed the hand can try,\nSave 'neath the hand of God on high,\nNor tyrant harsh work tyranny,\nUncrushed by tyrant harsh as he.'\nAnd as saith yet another,[FN#260]\n\n'Tyrannize not, if thou hast the power to do so; for the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     tyrannical-is in danger of revenges.\nThine eye will sleep while the oppressed, wakeful, will call down\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     curses on thee, and God's eye sleepeth not.'\n\nBeware of wine-bibbing, for drink is the root of all evil: it doeth away the reason and bringeth to contempt whoso useth it; and how well saith the poet,\n\n'By Allah, wine shall not disturb me, while my soul * Join body,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     nor while speech the words of me explain:\nNo day will I be thralled to wine-skin cooled by breeze[FN#261] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Nor choose a friend save those who are of cups unfair.'\n\nThis, then, is my charge to thee; bear it before thine eyes, and Allah stand to thee in my stead.\" Then he swooned away and kept silent awhile; and, when he came to himself, he besought pardon of Allah and pronounced the profession of the Faith, and was admitted to the mercy of the Almighty. So his son wept and lamented for him and presently made proper preparation for his burial; great and small walked in his funeral-procession and Koran readers recited Holy Writ about his bier; nor did Ali Shar omit aught of what was due to the dead. Then they prayed over him and committed him to the dust and wrote these two couplets upon his tomb,\n\n'Thou west create of dust and cam'st to life, * And learned'st in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     eloquence to place thy trust;\nAnon, to dust returning, thou becamest * A corpse, as though\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     ne'er taken from the dust.\"\n\nNow his son Ali Shar grieved for him with sore grief and mourned him with the ceremonies usual among men of note; nor did he cease to weep the loss of his father till his mother died also, not long afterwards, when he did with her as he had done with his sire. Then he sat in the shop, selling and buying and consorting with none of Almighty Allah's creatures, in accordance with his father's injunction. This wise he continued to do for a year, at the end of which time there came in to him by craft certain whoreson fellows and consorted with him, till he turned after their example to lewdness and swerved from the way of righteousness, drinking wine in flowing bowls and frequenting fair women night and day; for he said to himself, \"Of a truth my father amassed this wealth for me, and if I spend it not, to whom shall I leave it? By Allah, I will not do save as saith the poet,\n\n'An through the whole of life * Thou gett'st and gain'st for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     self;\nSay, when shalt thou enjoy * Thy gains and gotten pelf?'\"\n\nAnd Ali Shar ceased not to waste his wealth all whiles of the day and all watches of the night, till he had made away with the whole of his riches and abode in pauper case and troubled at heart. So he sold his shop and lands and so forth, and after this he sold the clothes off his body, leaving himself but one suit; and, as drunkenness quitted him and thoughtfulness came to him, he fell into grief and sore care. One day, when he had sat from day-break to mid-afternoon without breaking his fast, he said in his mind, \"I will go round to those on whom I spent my monies: perchance one of them will feed me this day.\" So he went the round of them all; but, as often as he knocked at any one's door of them, the man denied himself and hid from him, till his stomach ached with hunger. Then he betook himself to the bazar of the merchants,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Tenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ali Shar feeling his stomach ache with hunger, betook himself to the merchants' bazar where he found a crowd of people assembled in ring, and said to himself, \"I wonder what causeth these folk to crowd together thus? By Allah, I will not budge hence till I see what is within yonder ring!\" So he made his way into the ring and found therein a damsel exposed for sale who was five feet tall,[FN#262] beautifully proportioned, rosy of cheek and high of breast; and who surpassed all the people of her time in beauty and loveliness and elegance and grace; even as saith one, describing her,\n\n\"As she will\u00e8d she was made, and in such a way that when * She\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     was cast in Nature's mould neither short nor long was she:\nBeauty woke to fall in love with the beauties of her form, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Where combine with all her coyness her pride and pudency:\nThe full moon is her face[FN#263]and the branchlet is her shape,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     * And the musk-pod is her scent\u2014what like her can there be?\n'Tis as though she were moulded from water of the pearl, * And in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     every lovely limblet another moon we see!\"\n\nAnd her name was Zumurrud\u2014the Smaragdine. So when Ali Shar saw her, he marvelled at her beauty and grace and said, \"By Allah, I will not stir hence till I see how much this girl fetcheth, and know who buyeth her!\" So he took standing-place amongst the merchants, and they thought he had a mind to buy her, knowing the wealth he had inherited from his parents. Then the broker stood at the damsel's head and said, \"Ho, merchants! Ho, ye men of money! Who will open the gate of biddings for this damsel, the mistress of moons, the union pearl, Zumurrud the curtain-maker, the sought of the seeker and the delight of the desirous? Open the biddings' door and on the opener be nor blame nor reproach for evermore.\" Thereupon quoth one merchant, \"Mine for five hundred dinars;\" \"And ten,\" quoth another. \"Six hundred,\" cried an old man named Rash\u00edd al-Din, blue of eye[FN#264] and foul of face. \"And ten,\" cried another. \"I bid a thousand,\" rejoined Rashid al-Din; whereupon the rival merchants were tongue-tied, and held their peace and the broker took counsel with the girl's owner, who said, \"I have sworn not to sell her save to whom she shall choose: so consult her.\" Thereupon the broker went up to Zumurrud and said to her, \"O mistress of moons this merchant hath a mind to buy thee.\" She looked at Rashid al-Din and finding him as we have said, replied, \"I will not be sold to a gray-beard, whom decrepitude hath brought to such evil plight. Allah inspired his saying who saith,\n\n'I craved of her a kiss one day; but soon as she beheld * My\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     hoary hairs, though I my luxuries and wealth display'd;\nShe proudly turned away from me, showed shoulders, cried aloud:\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     * 'No! no! by Him, whose hest mankind from nothingness hath\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     made\nFor hoary head and grizzled chin I've no especial-love: * What!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     stuff my mouth with cotton[FN#265] ere in sepulchre I'm\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     laid?'\"\n\nNow when the broker heard her words he said, \"By Allah, thou art excusable, and thy price is ten thousand gold pieces!\" So he told her owner that she would not accept of old man Rashid al-Din, and he said, \"Consult her concerning another.\" Thereupon a second man came forward and said, \"Be she mine for what price was offered by the oldster she would have none of;\" but she looked at him and seeing that his beard was dyed, said \"What be this fashion lewd and base and the blackening of the hoary face?\" And she made a great show of wonderment and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Showed me Sir Such-an-one a sight and what a frightful sight! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     A neck by Allah, only made for slipper-sole to smite[FN#266]\nA beard the meetest racing ground where gnats and lice contend, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     A brow fit only for the ropes thy temples chafe and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     bite.[FN#267]\nO thou enravish\" by my cheek and beauties of my form, * Why so\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     translate thyself to youth and think I deem it right?\nDyeing disgracefully that white of reverend aged hairs, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     hiding for foul purposes their venerable white!\nThou goest with one beard and comest back with quite another, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Like Punch-and-Judy man who works the Chinese shades by\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     night.[FN#268]\n\nAnd how well saith another'\n\nQuoth she, 'I see thee dye thy hoariness:'[FN#269] * 'To hide, O\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     ears and eyes! from thee,' quoth I:\nShe roared with laugh and said, 'Right funny this; * Thou art so\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     lying e'en\n\nNow when the broker heard her verse he exclaimed, \"By Allah thou hast spoken sooth!\" The merchant asked what she said: so the broker repeated the verses to him; and he knew that she was in the right while he was wrong and desisted from buying her. Then another came forward and said, \"Ask her if she will be mine at the same price;\" but, when he did so, she looked at him and seeing that he had but one eye, said, \"This man is one-eyed; and it is of such as he that the poet saith,[FN#270]\n\n'Consort not with the Cyclops e'en a day; * Beware his falsehood\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     and his mischief fly:\nHad this monocular a jot of good, * Allah had ne'er brought\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     blindness to his eye!'\"\n\nThen said the broker, pointing to another bidder, \"Wilt thou be sold to this man?\" She looked at him and seeing that he was short of stature[FN#271] and had a beard that reached to his navel, cried, \"This is he of whom the poet speaketh,\n'I have a friend who hath a beard * Allah to useless length\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     unroll'd:\n'Tis like a certain[FN#272] winter night, * Longsome and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     darksome, drear and cold.'\"\n\nSaid the broker, \"O my lady, look who pleaseth thee of these that are present, and point him out, that I may sell thee to him.\" So she looked round the ring of merchants, examining one by one their physiognomies, till her glance fell on Ali Shar,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Eleventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the girl's glance fell on Ali Shar, she cast at him a look with longing eyes, which cost her a thousand sighs, and her heart was taken with him; for that he was of favour passing fair and pleasanter than zephyr or northern air; and she said, \"O broker, I will be sold to none but to this my lord, owner of the handsome face and slender form whom the poet thus describeth,\n\n'Displaying that fair face * The tempted they assailed\nWho, had they wished me safe * That lovely face had veiled!'\n\nFor none shall own me but he, because his cheek is smooth and the water of his mouth sweet as Salsabil;[FN#273] his spittle is a cure for the sick and his charms daze and dazzle poet and proser, even as saith one of him,\n\n'His honey dew of lips is wine; his breath * Musk and those\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     teeth, smile shown, are camphor's hue:\nRizw\u00e1n[FN#274] hath turned him out o' doors, for fear * The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Houris lapse from virtue at the view\nMen blame his bearing for its pride, but when * In pride the full\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     moon sails, excuse is due.'\n\nLord of the curling locks and rose red cheeks and ravishing look of whom saith the poet,\n\n'The fawn-like one a meeting promised me * And eye expectant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     waxed and heart unstirred:\nHis eyelids bade me hold his word as true; * But, in their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     languish,[FN#275] can he keep his word?'\n\nAnd as saith another,\n\n'Quoth they, 'Black letters on his cheek are writ! * How canst\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thou love him and a side-beard see?'\nQuoth I, 'Cease blame and cut your chiding short; * If those be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     letters 'tis a forgery:'\nGather his charms all growths of Eden garth * Whereto those\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Kausar[FN#276]-lips bear testimony.'\"\n\nWhen the broker heard the verses she repeated on the charms of Ali Shar, he marvelled at her eloquence, no less than at the brightness of her beauty; but her owner said to him, \"Marvel not at her splendour which shameth the noonday sun, nor that her memory is stored with the choicest verses of the poets; for besides this, she can repeat the glorious Koran, according to the seven readings,[FN#277] and the august Traditions, after ascription and authentic transmission; and she writeth the seven modes of handwriting[FN#278] and she knoweth more learning and knowledge than the most learned. Moreover, her hands are better than gold and silver; for she maketh silken curtains and selleth them for fifty gold pieces each; and it taketh her but eight days to make a curtain.\" Exclaimed the broker, \"O happy the man who hath her in his house and maketh her of his choicest treasures!\"; and her owner said to him, \"Sell her to whom she will.\" So the broker went up to Ali Shar and, kissing his hands, said to him, \"O my lord, buy thou this damsel, for she hath made choice of thee.\"[FN#279] Then he set forth to him all her charms and accomplishments, and added, \"I give thee joy if thou buy her, for this be a gift from Him who is no niggard of His giving.\" Whereupon Ali bowed his head groundwards awhile, laughing at himself and secretly saying, \"Up to this hour I have not broken my fast; yet I am ashamed before the merchants to own that I have no money wherewith to buy her.\" The damsel, seeing him hang down his head, said to the broker, \"Take my hand and lead me to him, that I may show my beauty to him and tempt him to buy me; for I will not be sold to any but to him.\" So the broker took her hand and stationed her before Ali Shar, saying, \"What is thy good pleasure, O my lord?\" But he made him no answer, and the girl said to him, \"O my lord and darling of my heart, what aileth thee that thou wilt not bid for me? Buy me for what thou wilt and I will bring thee good fortune.\" So he raised his eyes to her and said, \"Is buying perforce? Thou art dear at a thousand dinars.\" Said she, \"Then buy me, O my lord, for nine hundred.\" He cried, \"No,\" and she rejoined, \"Then for eight hundred;\" and though he again said, \"Nay,\" she ceased not to abate the price, till she came to an hundred dinars. Quoth he, \"I have not by me a full hundred.\" So she laughed and asked, \"How much dost thou lack of an hundred?\" He answered, \"By Allah, I have neither an hundred dinars, nor any other sum; for I own neither white coin nor red cash, neither dinar nor dirham. So look out thou for another and a better customer.\" And when she knew that he had nothing, she said to him, \"Take me by the hand and carry me aside into a by- lane, as if thou wouldst examine me privily.\" He did so and she drew from her bosom a purse containing a thousand dinars, which she gave him, saying, \"Pay down nine hundred to my price and let the hundred remain with thee by way of provision.\" He did as she bid him and, buying her for nine hundred dinars, paid down the price from her own purse and carried her to his house. When she entered it, she found a dreary desolate saloon without carpets or vessels; so she gave him other thousand dinars, saying, \"Go to the bazar and buy three hundred dinars' worth of furniture and vessels for the house and three dinars' worth of meat and drink.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Twelfth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King that quoth the slave-girl, \"Bring us meat and drink for three dinars, furthermore a piece of silk, the size of a curtain, and bring golden and silvern thread and sewing silk of seven colours.\" Thus he did, and she furnished the house and they sat down to eat and drink; after which they went to bed and took their pleasure one of the other. And they lay the night embraced behind the curtain and were even as saith the poet,[FN#280]\n\n\"Cleave fast to her thou lovestand let the envious rail amain,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     For calumny and envy ne'er to favour love were fain.\nLo, whilst I slept, in dreams I saw thee lying by my side And,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     from thy lips the sweetest, sure, of limpid springs did\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     drain.\nYea, true and certain all I saw is, as I will avouch, And 'spite\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     the envier, thereto I surely will attain.\nThere is no goodlier sight, indeed, for eyes to look upon, Than\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     when one couch in its embrace enfoldeth lovers twain.\nEach to the other's bosom clasped, clad in their twinned delight,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     Whilst hand with hand and arm with arm about their necks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     enchain\nLo, when two hearts are straitly knit in passion and desire, But\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     on cold iron smite the folk who chide at them in vain.\nThou, that for loving censurest the votaries of love, Canst thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     assain a heart diseased or heal-a cankered brain?\nIf in thy time thou kind but one to love thee and be true, I rede\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thee cast the world away and with that one remain.\"\n\nSo they lay together till the morning and love for the other waxed firmly fixed in the heart of each. And on rising, Zumurrud took the curtain and embroidered it with coloured silks and purpled it with silver and gold thread and she added thereto a border depicting round about it all manner of birds and beasts; nor is there in the world a feral but she wrought his semblance. This she worked in eight days, till she had made an end of it, when she trimmed it and glazed and ironed it and gave it to her lord, saying, \"Carry it to the bazar and sell it to one of the merchants at fifty dinars; but beware lest thou sell it to a passer-by, as this would cause a separation between me and thee, for we have foes who are not unthoughtful of us.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" answered he and, repairing to the bazar, sold the curtain to a merchant, as she bade him; after which he bought a piece of silk for another curtain and gold and silver and silken thread as before and what they needed of food, and brought all this to her, giving her the rest of the money. Now every eight days she made a curtain, which he sold for fifty dinars, and on this wise passed a whole year. At the end of that time, he went as usual to the bazar with a curtain, which he gave to the broker; and there came up to him a Nazarene who bid him sixty dinars for it; but he refused, and the Christian continued bidding higher and higher, till he came to an hundred dinars and bribed the broker with ten ducats. So the man returned to Ali Shar and told him of the proffered price and urged him to accept the offer and sell the article at the Nazarene's valuation, saying, \"O my lord, be not afraid of this Christian for that he can do thee no hurt.\" The merchants also were urgent with him; so he sold the curtain to the Christian, albeit his heart misgave him; and, taking the money, set off to return home. Presently, as he walked, he found the Christian walking behind him; so he said to him, \"O Nazarene,[FN#281] why dost thou follow in my footsteps?\" Answered the other \"O my lord, I want a something at the end of the street, Allah never bring thee to want!\"; but Ali Shar had barely reached his place before the Christian overtook him; so he said to him, \"O accursed, what aileth thee to follow me wherever I go?\" Replied the other, \"O my lord, give me a draught of water, for I am athirst; and with Allah be thy reward!\"[FN#282] Quoth Ali Shar to himself, \"Verily, this man is an Infidel who payeth tribute and claimeth our protection[FN#283] and he asketh me for a draught of water; by Allah, I will not baulk him!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Thirteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Ali Shar to himself, \"This man is a tributary Unbeliever and he asked me for a draught of water; by Allah, I will not baulk him!\" So he entered the house and took a gugglet of water; but the slave-girl Zumurrud saw him and said to him, \"O my love, hast thou sold the curtain?\" He replied, \"Yes;\" and she asked, \"To a merchant or to a passer-by? for my heart presageth a parting.\" And he answered, \"To whom but to a merchant?\" Thereupon she rejoined, \"Tell me the truth of the case, that I may order my affair; and why take the gugglet of water?\" And he, To give the broker to drink,\" upon which she exclaimed, There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"; and she repeated these two couplets,[FN#284]\n\n\"O thou who seekest separation, act leisurely, and let not the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     embrace of the beloved deceive thee!\nAct leisurely; for the nature of fortune is treacherous, and the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     end of every union is disjunction.\n\nThen he took the gugglet and, going out, found the Christian within the vestibule and said to him, \"How comest thou here and how darest thou, O dog, enter my house without my leave?\" Answered he, \"O my lord, there is no difference between the door and the vestibule, and I never intended to stir hence, save to go out; and my thanks are due to thee for thy kindness and favour, thy bounty and generosity.\" Then he took the mug and emptying it, returned it to Ali Shar, who received it and waited for him to rise up and to go; but he did not move. So Ali said to him, \"Why dost thou not rise and wend thy way?\"; and he answered, \"O my lord, be not of those who do a kindness and then make it a reproach, nor of those of whom saith the poet,[FN#285]\n\n'They're gone who when thou stoodest at their door * Would for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     thy wants so generously cater:\nBut stand at door of churls who followed them, * They'd make high\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     favour of a draught of water!'\"\n\nAnd he continued, \"O my lord, I have drunk, and now I would have thee give me to eat of whatever is in the house, though it be but a bit of bread or a biscuit with an onion.\" Replied Ali Shar, \"Begone, without more chaffer and chatter; there is nothing in the house.\" He persisted, \"O my lord, if there be nothing in the house, take these hundred dinars and bring us something from the market, if but a single scone, that bread and salt may pass between us.\"[FN#286] With this, quoth Ali Shar to himself, \"This Christian is surely mad; I will take his hundred dinars and bring him somewhat worth a couple of dirhams and laugh at him.\" And the Nazarene added, \"O my lord, I want but a small matter to stay my hunger, were it but a dry scone and an onion; for the best food is that which doeth away appetite, not rich viands; and how well saith the poet,\n\n'Hunger is sated with a bone-dry scone, * How is it then[FN#287]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     in woes of want I wone?\nDeath is all-justest, lacking aught regard * For Caliph-king and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     beggar woe-begone.'\"\n\nThen quoth Ali Shar, \"Wait here, while I lock the saloon and fetch thee somewhat from the market;\" and quoth the Christian, \"To hear is to obey.\" So Ali Shar shut up the saloon and, locking the door with a padlock, put the key in his pocket: after which he went to market and bought fried cheese and virgin honey and bananas[FN#288] and bread, with which he returned to the house. Now when the Christian saw the provision, he said, \"O my lord, this is overmuch; 'tis enough for half a score of men and I am alone; but belike thou wilt eat with me.\" Replied Ali, \"Eat by thyself, I am full;\" and the Christian rejoined, \"O my lord, the wise say, Whoso eateth not with his guest is a son of a whore.\" Now when Ali Shar heard these words from the Nazarene, he sat down and ate a little with him, after which he would have held his hand;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Fourteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ali Shar sat down and ate a little with him, after which he would have held his hand; but the Nazarene privily took a banana and peeled it; then, splitting it in twain, put into one half concentrated Bhang, mixed with opium, a drachm whereof would over throw an elephant; and he dipped it in the honey and gave it to Ali Shar, saying, \"O my lord, by the truth of thy religion, I adjure thee to take this.\" So Ali Shar, being ashamed to make him forsworn, took it and swallowed it; but hardly had it settled well in his stomach, when his head forwent both his feet and he was as though he had been a year asleep. As soon as the Nazarene saw this, rose to his feet as he had been a scald wolf or a cat-o'-mount[FN#289] at bay and, taking the saloon key, left Ali Shar prostrate and ran off to rejoin his brother. And the cause of his so doing was that the Nazarene's brother was the same decrepit old man who purposed to buy Zumurrud for a thousand dinars, but she would none of him and jeered him in verse. He was an Unbeliever inwardly, though a Moslem outwardly, and had called himself Rashid al-Din;[FN#290] and when Zumurrud mocked him and would not accept of him, he complained to his brother the aforesaid Christian who played this sleight to take her from her master Ali Shar; whereupon his brother, Barsum by name said to him, \"Fret not thyself about the business, for I will make shift to seize her for thee, without expending either diner or dirham. Now he was a skilful wizard, crafty and wicked; so he watched his time and ceased not his practices till he played Ali Shar the trick before related; then, taking the key, he went to his brother and acquainted him with what had passed. Thereupon Rashid al-Din mounted his she mule and repaired with his brother and his servants to the house of Ali Shar, taking with him a purse of a thousand dinars, wherewith to bribe the Chief of Police, should he meet him. He opened the saloon door and the men who were with him rushed in upon Zumurrud and forcibly seized her, threatening her with death, if she spoke, but they left the place as it was and took nothing therefrom. Lastly they left Ali Shar lying in the vestibule after they had shut the door on him and laid the saloon key by his side. Then the Christian carried the girl to his own house and setting her amongst his handmaids and concubines, said to her, \"O strumpet, I am the old man whom thou didst reject and lampoon; but now I have thee, without paying diner or dirham.\" Replied she (and her eyes streamed with tears), \"Allah requite thee, O wicked old man, for sundering me and my lord!\" He rejoined, \"Wanton minx and whore that thou art, thou shalt see how I will punish thee! By the truth of the Messiah and the Virgin, except thou obey me and embrace my faith, I will torture thee with all manner of torture!\" She replied, \"By Allah, though thou cut my flesh to bits I will not forswear the faith of Al-Islam! It may be Almighty Allah will bring me speedy relief, for He cloth even as He is fief, and the wise say: 'Better body to scathe than a flaw in faith.'\" Thereupon the old man called his eunuchs and women, saying, \"Throw her down!\" So they threw her down and he ceased not to beat her with grievous beating, whilst she cried for help and no help came; then she no longer implored aid but fell to saying, \"Allah is my sufficiency, and He is indeed all-sufficient!\" till her groans ceased and her breath failed her and she fell into a fainting-fit. Now when his heart was soothed by bashing her, he said to the eunuchs, \"Drag her forth by the feet and cast her down in the kitchen, and give her nothing to eat.\" And after quietly sleeping that night, on the morrow the accursed old man sent for her and beat her again, after which he bade the Castrato return her to her place. When the burning of the blows had cooled, she said, \"There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God! Allah is my sufficiency and excellent is my Guardian!\" And she called for succour upon our Lord Mohammed (whom Allah bless and keep!)\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Fifteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zumurrud called for succour upon our Lord Mohammed (whom Allah bless and keep!). Such was her case; but as regards Ali Shar, he ceased not sleeping till next day, when the Bhang quitted his brain and he opened his eyes and cried out, \"O Zumurrud\"; but no one answered him. So he entered the saloon and found the empty air and the fane afar;[FN#291] whereby he knew that it was the Nazarene who had played him this trick. And he groaned and wept and lamented and again shed tears, repeating these couplets,\n\n\"O Love thou'rt instant in thy cruellest guise; * Here is my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     heart 'twixt fears and miseries:\nPity, O lords, a thrall who, felled on way * Of Love, erst\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     wealthy now a beggar lies:\nWhat profits archer's art if, when the foe * Draw near, his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     bowstring snap ere arrow {lies:\nAnd when griefs multiply on generous man * And urge, what fort\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     can fend from destinies?\nHow much and much I warded parting, but * 'When Destiny descends\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     she blinds our eyes?'\"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verse, he sobbed with loud sobs and repeated also these couplets,\n\n\"Enrobes with honour sands of camp her foot step wandering lone,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     * Pines the poor mourner as she wins the stead where wont to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     wane\nShe turns to resting-place of tribe, and yearns thereon to view *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     The spring-camp lying desolate with ruins overstrown\nShe stands and questions of the site, but with the tongue of case\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     * The mount replies, 'There is no path that leads to union,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     none!\n'Tis as the lightning flash erewhile bright glittered o'er the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     camp * And died in darkling air no more to be for ever\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     shown.'\"\n\nAnd he repented when repentance availed him naught, and wept and rent his raiment. Then he hent in hand two stones and went round about the city, beating his breast with the stones and crying \"O Zumurrud!\" whilst the small boys flocked round him, calling out, \"A madman! A madman!\" and all who knew him wept for him, saying, \"This is such an one: what evil hath befallen him?\" Thus he continued doing all that day and, when night darkened on him, he lay down in one of the city lanes and sleet till morning On the morrow, he went round about town with the stones till eventide, when he returned to his saloon to pass therein the night. Presently, one of his neighbours saw him, and this worthy old woman said to him, \"O my son, Heaven give thee healing! How long hast thou been mad?\" And he answered her with these two couplets,[FN#292]\n\n\"They said, Thou revest upon the person thou lovest. * And I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     replied, The sweets of life are only for the mad.\nDrop the subject of my madness, and bring her upon whom I rave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    If she cure my madness do not blame me.\"\n\nSo his old neighbour knew him for a lover who had lost his beloved and said, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might, save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! O my son, I wish thou wouldest acquaint me with the tale of thine affliction. Peradventure Allah may enable me to help thee against it, if it so please Him.\" So he told her all that had befallen him with Barsum the Nazarene and his brother the wizard who had named himself Rashid al-Din and, when she understood the whole case, she said, \"O my son, indeed thou hast excuse.\" And her eyes railed tears and she repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"Enough for lovers in this world their ban and bane: * By Allah,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     lover ne'er in fire of Sakar fries:\nFor, sure, they died of love-desire they never told * Chastely,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     and to this truth tradition testifies.\"[FN#293]\n\nAnd after she had finished her verse, she said, \"O my son, rise at once and buy me a crate, such as the jewel-pedlars carry; buy also bangles and seal-rings and bracelets and ear-rings and other gewgaws wherein women delight and grudge not the cash. Put all the stock into the crate and bring it to me and I will set it on my head and go round about, in the guise of a huckstress and make search for her in all the houses, till I happen on news of her\u2014 Inshallah!\" So Ali Shar rejoiced in her words and kissed her hands, then, going out, speedily brought her all she required; whereupon she rose and donned a patched gown and threw over her head a honey-yellow veil, and took staff in hand and, with the basket on her head, began wandering about the passages and the houses. She ceased not to go from house to house and street to street and quarter to quarter, till Allah Almighty led her to the house of the accursed Rashid al-Din the Nazarene where, hearing groans within, she knocked at the door,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Sixteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman heard groans within the house, she knocked at the door, whereupon a slave-girl came down and opening to her, saluted her. Quoth the old woman, \"I have these trifles for sale: is there any one with you who will buy aught of them?\" \"Yes,\" answered the damsel and, carrying her indoors, made her sit down; whereupon all the slave-girls came round her and each bought something of her. And as the old woman spoke them fair and was easy with them as to price, all rejoiced in her, because of her kind ways and pleasant speech. Meanwhile, she looked narrowly at the ins and outs of the place to see who it was she had heard groaning, till her glance fell on Zumurrud, when she knew her and she began to show her customers yet more kindness. At last she made sure that Zumurrud was laid prostrate; so she wept and said to the girls, \"O my children, how cometh yonder young lady in this plight?\" Then the slave-girls told her all what had passed, adding, \"Indeed this matter is not of our choice; but our master commanded us to do thus, and he is now on a journey.\" She said, \"O my children, I have a favour to ask of you, and it is that you loose this unhappy damsel of her bonds, till you know of your lord's return, when do ye bind her again as she was; and you shall earn a reward from the Lord of all creatures.\" \"We hear and obey,\" answered they and at once loosing Zumurrud, gave her to eat and drink. Thereupon quoth the old woman, \"Would my leg had been broken, ere I entered your house!\" And she went up to Zumurrud and said to her, \"O my daughter, Heaven keep thee safe; soon shall Allah bring thee relief.\" Then she privily told her that she came from her lord, Ali Shar, and agreed with her to be on the watch for sounds that night, saying, \"Thy lord will come and stand by the pavilion-bench and whistle[FN#294] to thee; and when thou hearest him, do thou whistle back to him and let thyself down to him by a rope from the window, and he will take thee and go away with thee.\" So Zumurrud thanked the old woman, who went forth and returned to Ali Shar and told him what she had done, saying, \"Go this night, at midnight, to such a quarter, for the accursed carle's house is there and its fashion is thus and thus. Stand under the window of the upper chamber and whistle; whereupon she will let herself down to thee; then do thou take her and carry her whither thou wilt.\" He thanked her for her good offices and with flowing tears repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Now with their says and saids[FN#295] no more vex me the chiding\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     race; * My heart is weary and I'm worn to bone by their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     disgrace:\nAnd tears a truthful legend[FN#296] with a long ascription-chain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp    * Of my desertion and distress the lineage can trace.\nO thou heart-whole and free from dole and dolours I endure, * Cut\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     short thy long persistency nor question of my case:\nA sweet-lipped one and soft of sides and cast in shapeliest mould\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     * Hath stormed my heart with honied lure and honied words of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     grace.\nNo rest my heart hath known since thou art gone, nor ever close *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     These eyes, nor patience aloe scape the hopes I dare to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     trace:\nYe have abandoned me to be the pawn of vain desire, * In squalid\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     state 'twixt enviers and they who blame to face:\nAs for forgetting you or love 'tis thing I never knew; * Nor in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     my thought shall ever pass a living thing but you.\"\n\nAnd when he ended his verses, he sighed and shed tears and repeated also these couplets,\n\n\"Divinely were inspired his words who brought me news of you; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     For brought he unto me a gift was music in mine ear:\nTake he for gift, if him content, this worn-out threadbare robe,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     * My heart, which was in pieces torn when parting from my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     fete.\"\n\nHe waited till night darkened and, when came the appointed time, he went to the quarter she had described to him and saw and recognised the Christian's house; so he sat down on the bench under the gallery. Presently drowsiness overcame him and he slept (Glory be to Him who sleepeth not!?, for it was long since he had tasted sleep, by reason of the violence of his passion, and he became as one drunken with slumber. And while he was on this wise,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Seventeenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that while he lay asleep, behold, a certain thief, who had come out that night and prowled about the skirts of the city to steal-somewhat, happened by the decree of Destiny, on the Nazarene's house. He went round about it, but found no way of climbing up into it, and presently on his circuit he came to the bench, where he saw Ali Shar asleep and stole his turband; and, as he was taking it suddenly Zumurrud looked out and seeing the thief standing in the darkness, took him for her lord; whereupon she let herself down to him by the rope with a pair of saddle-bags full of gold. Now when the robber saw that, he said to himself, \"This is a wondrous thing, and there must needs be some marvellous cause to it.\" Then he snatched up the saddle-bags, and threw Zumurrud over his shoulders and made off with both like the blinding lightening. Quoth she, \"Verily, the old woman told me that thou west weak with illness on my account; and here thou art, stronger than a horse.\" He made her no reply; so she put her hand to his face and felt a beard like the broom of palm-frond used for the Hammam,[FN#297] as if he were a hog which had swallowed feathers and they had come out of his gullet; whereat she took fright and said to him, \"What art thou?\" \"O strumpet,\" answered he, \"I am the sharper Jaw\u00e1n[FN#298] the Kurd, of the band of Ahmad al-Danaf; we are forty sharpers, who will all piss our tallow into thy womb this night, from dusk to dawn.\" When she heard his words, she wept and beat her face, knowing that Fate had gotten the better of her and that she had no resource but resignation and to put her trust in Allah Almighty. So she took patience and submitted herself to the ordinance of the Lord, saying, \"There is no god but the God! As often as we escape from one woe, we fall into a worse.\" Now the cause of Jawan's coming thither was this: he had said to Calamity-Ahmad, \"O Sharper-captain,[FN#299] I have been in this city before and know a cavern without the walls which will hold forty souls; so I will go before you thither and set my mother therein. Then will I return to the city and steal-somewhat for the luck of all of you and keep it till you come; so shall you be my guests and I will show you hospitality this day.\" Replied Ahmad al-Danaf, \"Do what thou wilt.\" So Jawan went forth to the place before them and set his mother in the cave; but, as he came out he found a trooper lying asleep, with his horse picketed beside him; so he cut his throat and, taking his clothes and his charger and his arms, hid them with his mother in the cave, where also he tethered the horse. Then he betook himself to the city and prowled about, till he happened on the Christian's house and did with Ali Shar's turband and Zumurrud and her saddle-bags as we have said. He ceased not to run, with Zumurrud on his back, till he came to the cavern, where he gave her in charge of his mother, saying, \"Keep thou watch over her till I return to thee at first dawn of day,\" and went his ways.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Eighteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Kurdish Jawan to his mother, \"Keep thou watch over her till I come back to thee at first dawn of day,\" and went his ways. Now Zumurrud said to herself, \"Why am I so heedless about saving my life and wherefore await till these forty men come?: they will take their turns to board me, till they make me like a water- logged ship at sea.\" Then she turned to the old woman, Jawan's mother, and said to her, \"O my aunt, wilt thou not rise up and come without the cave, that I may louse thee in the sun?\"[FN#300] Replied the old woman, \"Ay, by Allah, O my daughter: this long time have I been out of reach of the bath; for these hogs cease not to carry me from place to place.\" So they went without the cavern, and Zumurrud combed out her head hair and killed the lice on her locks, till the tickling soothed her and she fell asleep; whereupon Zumurrud arose and, donning the clothes of the murdered trooper, girt her waist with his sword and covered her head with his turband, so that she became as she were a man. Then, mounting the horse after she had taken the saddle-bags full of gold, she breathed a prayer, \"O good Protector, protect me I adjure thee by the glory of Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!),\" adding these words in thought, \"If I return to the city belike one of the trooper's folk will see me, and no good will befal me.\" So she turned her back on the town and rode forth into the wild and the waste. And she ceased not faring forth with her saddle-bags and the steed, eating of the growth of the earth and drinking of its waters, she and her horse, for ten days and, on the eleventh, she came in sight of a city pleasant and secure from dread, and established in happy stead. Winter had gone from it with his cold showers, and Prime had come to it with his roses and orange- blossoms and varied flowers; and its blooms were brightly blowing; its streams were merrily flowing and its birds warbled coming and going. And she drew near the dwellings and would have entered the gate when she saw the troops and Emirs and Grandees of the place drawn up, whereat she marvelled seeing them in such unusual-case and said to herself, \"The people of the city are all gathered at its gate: needs must there be a reason for this.\" Then she made towards them; but, as she drew near, the soldiery dashed forward to meet her and, dismounting all, kissed the ground between her hands and said, \"Aid thee Allah, O our lord the Sultan!\" Then the notables and dignitaries ranged themselves before her in double line, whilst the troops ordered the people in, saying, \"Allah aid thee and make thy coming a blessing to the Moslems, O Sultan of all creatures! Allah establish thee, O King of the time and union-pearl of the day and the tide!\" Asked Zumurrud, \"What aileth you, O people of this city?\" And the Head Chamberlain answered, \"Verily, He hath given to thee who is no niggard in His giving; and He hath been bountiful to thee and hath made thee Sultan of this city and ruler over the necks of all who are therein; for know thou it is the custom of the citizens, when their King deceaseth leaving no son, that the troops should sally forth to the suburbs and sojourn there three days: and whoever cometh from the quarter whence thou hast come, him they make King over them. So praised be Allah who hath sent us of the sons of the Turks a well-favoured man; for had a lesser than thou presented himself, he had been Sultan.\" Now Zumurrud was clever and well-advised in all she did: so she said, \"Think not that I am of the common folk of the Turks! nay, I am of the sons of the great, a man of condition; but I was wroth with my family, so I went forth and left them. See these saddle-bags full of gold which I have brought under me that, by the way, I might give alms thereof to the poor and the needy.\" So they called down blessings upon her and rejoiced in her with exceeding joy and she also joyed in them and said in herself, \"Now that I have attained to this\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Nineteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Zumurrud to herself, \"Now that I have attained to this case, haply Allah will reunite me with my lord in this place, for He can do whatso He willeth.\" Then the troops escorted her to the city and, all dismounting, walked before her to the palace. Here she alighted and the Emirs and Grandees, taking her under both armpits,[FN#301] carried her into the palace and seated her on the throne; after which they all kissed ground before her. And when duly enthroned she bade them open the treasuries and gave largesse to all the troops, who offered up prayers for the continuance of her reign, and all the townsfolk accepted her rule and all the lieges of the realm. Thus she abode awhile bidding and forbidding, and all the people came to hold her in exceeding reverence and heartily to love her, by reason of her continence and generosity; for taxes she remitted and prisoners she released and grievances she redressed; but, as often as she bethought her of her lord, she wept and besought Allah to reunite her and him; and one night, as she chanced to be thinking of him and calling to mind the days she had passed with him, her eyes ran over with tears and she versified in these two couplets,\n\n\"My yearning for thee though long is fresh, * And the tears which\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     chafe these eyelids increase\nWhen I weep, I weep from the burn of love, * For to lover\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     severance is decease.\"[FN#302]\n\nAnd when she had ended her verse, she wiped away her tears and repairing to the palace, betook herself to the Harim, where she appointed to the slave-girls and concubines separate lodgings and assigned them pensions and allowances, giving out that she was minded to live apart and devote herself to works of piety. So she applied herself to fasting and praying, till the Emirs said, \"Verily this Sultan is eminently devout;\" nor would she suffer any male attendants about her, save two little eunuchs to serve her. And on this wise she held the throne a whole year, during which time she heard no news of her lord, and failed to hit upon his traces, which was exceeding grievous to her; so, when her distress became excessive, she summoned her Wazirs and Chamberlains and bid them fetch architects and builders and make her in front of the palace a horse-course, one parasang long and the like broad. They hastened to do her bidding, and lay out the place to her liking; and, when it was completed, she went down into it and they pitched her there a great pavilion, wherein the chairs of the Emirs were ranged in due order. Moreover, she bade them spread on the racing-plain tables with all manners of rich meats and when this was done she ordered the Grandees to eat. So they ate and she said to them, \"It is my will that, on seeing the new moon of each month, ye do on this wise and proclaim in the city that no man shall open his shop, but that all our lieges shall come and eat of the King's banquet, and that whoso disobeyeth shall be hanged over his own door.\"[FN#303] So they did as she bade them, and ceased not so to do till the first new moon of the second year appeared; when Zumurrud went down into the horse-course and the crier proclaimed aloud, saying, \"Ho, ye lieges and people one and all, whoso openeth store or shop or house shall straight way be hanged over his own door; for it behoveth you to come in a body and eat of the King's banquet.\" And when the proclamation became known, they laid the tables and the subjects came in hosts; so she bade them sit down at the trays and eat their fill of all the dishes. Accordingly they sat down and she took place on her chair of state, watching them, whilst each who was at meat said to himself, \"Verily the King looketh at none save me.\" Then they fell to eating and the Emirs said to them, \"Eat and be not ashamed; for this pleaseth the King.\" So they ate their fill and went away, blessing the Sovereign and saying, one to the other, \"Never in our days saw we a Sultan who loved the poor as doth this Sultan.\" And they wished him length of life. Upon this Zumurrud returned to her palace,\u2014 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Twentieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen Zumurrud returned to her palace, rejoicing in her device and saying to herself, \"Inshallah, I shall surely by this means happen on news of my lord Ali Shar.\" When the first day of the second month came round, she did as before and when they had spread the tables she came down from her palace and took place on her throne and commanded the lieges to sit down and fall to. Now as she sat on her throne, at the head of the tables, watching the people take their places company by company and one by one, behold her eye fell on Barsum, the Nazarene who had bought the curtain of her lord; and she knew him and said in her mind, \"This is the first of my joy and the winning of my wish.\" Then Barsum came up to the table and, sitting down with the rest to eat, espied a dish of sweet rice, sprinkled with sugar; but it was far from him, so he pushed up to it through the crowd and, putting out his hand to it, seized it and set it before himself. His next neighbour said to him, \"Why dost thou not eat of what is before thee? Is not this a disgrace to thee? How canst thou reach over for a dish which is distant from thee? Art thou not ashamed?\" Quoth Barsum, \"I will eat of none save this same.\" Rejoined the other, \"Eat then, and Allah give thee no good of it!\" But another man, a Hashish-eater, said, \"Let him eat of it, that I may eat with him.\" Replied his neighbour, \"O unluckiest of Hashish- eaters, this is no meat for thee; it is eating for Emirs. Let it be, that it may return to those for whom it is meant and they eat it.\" But Barsum heeded him not and took a mouthful of the rice and put it in his mouth; and was about to take a second mouthful when the Queen, who was watching him, cried out to certain of her guards, saying, \"Bring me yonder man with the dish of Sweet rice before him and let him not eat the mouthful he hath read but throw it from his hand.\"[FN#304] So four of the guards went up to Barsum and haled him along on his face, after throwing the mouthful of rice from his hand, and set him standing before Zumurrud, whilst all the people left eating and said to one another, By Allah, he did wrong in not eating of the food meant for the likes of him.\" Quoth one, \"For me I was content with this porridge[FN#305] which is before me.\" And the Hashish-eater said, \"Praised be Allah who hindered me from eating of the dish of sugared rice for I expected it to stand before him and was waiting only for him to have his enjoyment of it, to eat with him, when there befel him what we see.\" And the general said, one to other, \"Wait till we see what shall befal him.\" Now as they brought him before Queen Zumurrud she cried, \"Woe to thee, O blue eyes! What is thy name and why comest thou to our country?\" But the accursed called himself out of his name having a white turband[FN#306] on, and answered, \"O King, my name is Ali; I work as a weaver and I came hither to trade.\" Quoth Zumurrud, \"Bring me a table of sand and a pen of brass,\" and when they brought her what she sought, she took the sand and the pen, and struck a geomantic figure in the likeness of a baboon; then, raising her head, she looked hard at Barsum for an hour or so and said to him, \"O dog, how darest thou lie to Kings? Art thou not a Nazarene, Barsum by name, and comest thou not hither in quest of somewhat? Speak the truth, or by the glory of the Godhead, I will strike off thy head!\" At this Barsum was confounded and the Emirs and bystanders said, \"Verily, this King understandeth geomancy: blessed be He who hath gifted him!\" Then she cried out upon the Christian and said, 'Tell me the truth, or I will make an end of thee!\" Barsum replied, \"Pardon, O King of the age; thou art right as regards the table, for the far one[FN#307] is indeed a Nazarene,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Barsum replied, \"Pardon, O King of the age; thou art right as regards the table, for thy slave is indeed a Nazarene.\" Whereupon all present, gentle and simple, wondered at the King's skill in hitting upon the truth by geomancy, and said, \"Verily this King is a diviner, whose like there is not in the world.\" Thereupon Queen Zumurrud bade flay the Nazarene and stuff his skin with straw and hang it over the gate of the race-course. Moreover, she commended to dig a pit without the city and burn therein his flesh and bones and throw over his ashes offal and ordure. \"We hear and obey,\" answered they, and did with him all she bade; and, when the folk saw what had befallen the Christian, they said, \"Serve him right; but what an unlucky mouthful was that for him!\" And another said, \"Be the far one's wife divorced if this vow be broken: never again to the end of my days will I eat of sugared rice!\"; and the Hashish-eater cried \"Praised be Allah, who spared me this fellow's fate by saving me from eating of that same rice!\" Then they all went out, holding it thenceforth unlawful to sit over against the dish of sweet rice as the Nazarene had sat. Now when the first day of the third month came, they laid the tables according to custom, and covered them with dishes and chargers, and Queen Zumurrud came down and sat on her throne, with her guards in attendance, as of wont, in awe of her dignity and majesty. Then the townsfolk entered as before and went round about the tables, looking for the place of the dish of sweet rice, and quoth one to another, \"Hark ye, O H\u00e1j\u00ed[FN#308] Khalaf!\"; and the other answered, \"At thy service, O H\u00e1j\u00ed Kh\u00e1lid.\" Said Kh\u00e1lid, \"Avoid the dish of sweet rice and look thou eat not thereof; for, if thou do, by early morning thou will be hanged.\"[FN#309] Then they sat down to meat around the table; and, as they were eating, Queen Zumurrud chanced to look from her throne and saw a man come running in through the gate of the horse-course; and having considered him attentively, she knew him for Jawan the Kurdish thief who murdered the trooper. Now the cause of his coming was this: when he left his mother, he went to his comrades and said to them, \"I did good business yesterday; for I slew a trooper and took his horse. Moreover there fell to me last night a pair of saddle-bags, full of gold, and a young lady worth more than the money in pouch; and I have left all that with my mother in the cave.\" At this they rejoiced and repaired to the cavern at night-fall, whilst Jawan the Kurd walked in front and the rest behind; he wishing to bring them the booty of which he had boasted. But he found the place clean empty and questioned his mother, who told him all that had befallen her; whereupon he bit his hands for regret and exclaimed, \"By Allah, I will assuredly make search for the harlot and take her, wherever she is, though it be in the shell of a pistachio-nut,[FN#310] and quench my malice on her!\" So he went forth in quest of her and ceased not journeying from place to place, till he came to Queen Zumurrud's city. On entering he found the town deserted and, enquiring of some women whom he saw looking from the windows, they told him that it was the Sultan's custom to make a banquet for the people on the first of each month and that all the lieges were bound to go and eat of it. Furthermore the women directed him to the racing-ground, where the feast was spread. So he entered at a shuffling trot; and, finding no place empty, save that before the dish of sweet rice already noticed, took his seat right opposite it and stretched out his hand towards the dish; whereupon the folk cried out to him, saying, \"O our brother, what wouldst thou do?\" Quoth he, \"I would eat my fill of this dish.\" Rejoined one of the people, \"If thou eat of it thou wilt assuredly find thyself hanged to-morrow morning.\" But Jawan said, \"Hold thy tongue and talk not so unpleasantly.\" Then he stretched out his hand to the dish and drew it to him; but it so chanced that the Hashish-eater of whom we have spoken, was sitting by him; and when he saw him take the dish, the fumes of the Hashish left his head and he fled from his place and sat down afar off, saying, \"I will have nothing to do with yonder dish.\" Then Jawan the Kurd put out his hand (which was very like a raven's claws,[FN#311] scooped up therewith half the dishful and drew out his neave as it were a camel's hoof,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Jawan the Kurd drew his neave from the dish as it were a camel's hoof and rolled the lump of rice in the palm of his hand, till it was like a big orange, and threw it ravenously into his mouth; and it rolled down his gullet, with a rumble like thunder and the bottom of the deep dish appeared where said mouthful had been. Thereupon quoth to him one sitting by his side, \"Praised be Allah for not making me meat between thy hands; for thou hast cleared the dish at a single mouthful;\" and quoth the Hashish-eater, \"Let him eat; methinks he hath a hanging face.\" Then, turning to Jawan he added, \"Eat and Allah give thee small good of it.\" So Jawan put out his hand again and taking another mouthful, was rolling it in his palm like the first, when behold, the Queen cried out to the guards saying, \"Bring me yonder man in haste and let him not eat the mouthful in his hand.\" So they ran and seizing him as he hung over the dish, brought him to her, and set him in her presence, whilst the people exulted over his mishap and said one to the other, \"Serve him right, for we warned him, but he would not take warning. Verily, this place is bound to be the death of whoso sitteth therein, and yonder rice bringeth doom to all who eat of it.\" Then said Queen Zumurrud to Jawan, \"What is thy name and trade and wherefore comest thou to our city?\" Answered he, \"O our lord the Sultan, my name is Othman; I work as a gardener and am come hither in quest of somewhat I have lost.\" Quoth Zumurrud, \"Here with a table of sand!\" So they brought it, and she took the pen and drawing a geomantic scheme, considered it awhile, then raising her head, exclaimed, \"Woe to thee, thou loser! How darest thou lie to Kings? This sand telleth me that of a truth thy name is Jawan the Kurd and that thou art by trade a robber, taking men's goods in the way of unright and slaying those whom Allah hath forbidden to slay save for just cause.\" And she cried out upon him, saying, \"O hog, tell me the truth of thy case or I will cut off thy head on the spot.\" Now when he heard these words, he turned yellow and his teeth chattered; then, deeming that he might save himself by truth-telling, he replied, \"O King, thou sayest sooth; but I repent at thy hands henceforth and turn to Allah Almighty!\" She answered, \"It were not lawful for me to leave a pest in the way of Moslems;\" and cried to her guards, \"Take him and skin him and do with him as last month ye did by his like.\" They obeyed her commandment; and, when the Hashish- eater saw the soldiers seize the man, he turned his back upon the dish of rice, saying, \"'Tis a sin to present my face to thee!\" And after they had made an end of eating, they dispersed to their several homes and Zumurrud returned to her palace and dismissed her attendants. Now when the fourth month came round, they went to the race-course and made the banquet, according to custom, and the folk sat awaiting leave to begin. Presently Queen Zumurrud entered and, sitting down on her throne, looked at the tables and saw that room for four people was left void before the dish of rice, at which she wondered. Now as she was looking around, behold, she saw a man come trotting in at the gate of the horse- course; and he stayed not till he stood over the food-trays; and, finding no room save before the dish of rice, took his seat there. She looked at him and knowing him for the accursed Christian who called himself Rashid al-Din, said in her mind, \"How blessed is this device of the food,[FN#312] into whose toils this infidel hath fallen\" Now the cause of his coming was extraordinary, and it was on this wise. When he returned from his travels,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the accursed, who had called himself Rashid al-Din, returned from travel, his household informed him that Zumurrud was missing and with her a pair of saddle-bags full of money; on hearing which ill tidings he rent his raiment and buffeted his face and plucked out his beard. Then he despatched his brother Barsum in quest of her to lands adjoining and, when he was weary of awaiting news of him, he went forth himself, to seek for him and for the girl, whenas fate led him to the city of Zumurrud. He entered it on the first day of the month and finding the streets deserted and the shops shut and women idling at the windows, he asked them the reason why, and they told him that the King made a banquet on the first of each month for the people, all of whom were bound to attend it, nor might any abide in his house or shop that day; and they directed him to the racing-plain. So he betook himself thither and found the people crowding about the food, and there was never a place for him save in front of the rice-dish now well-known. Here then he sat and put forth his hand to eat thereof, whereupon Zumurrud cried out to her guards, saying, \"Bring me him who sitteth over against the dish of rice.\" So they knew him by what had before happened and laid hands on him and brought him before Queen Zumurrud, who said to him, \"Out on thee! What is thy name and trade, and what bringeth thee to our city?\" Answered he, \"O King of the age, my name is Rustam[FN#313] and I have no occupation, for I am a poor dervish.\" Then said she to her attendants, \"Bring me table of sand and pen of brass.\" So they brought her what she sought, as of wont; and she took the pen and made the dots which formed the figure and considered it awhile, then raising her head to Rashid al-Din, she said, \"O dog, how darest thou lie to Kings? Thy name is Rashid al-Din the Nazarene, thou art outwardly a Moslem, but a Christian at heart, and thine occupation is to lay snares for the slave-girls of the Moslems and make them captives. Speak the truth, or I will smite off thy head.\" He hesitated and stammered, then replied, \"Thou sayest sooth, O King of the age!\" Whereupon she commanded to throw him down and give him an hundred blows with a stick on each sole and a thousand stripes with a whip on his body; after which she bade flay him and stuff his skin with herds of flax and dig a pit without the city, wherein they should burn his corpse and cast on his ashes offal-and ordure. They did as she bade them and she gave the people leave to eat. So they ate and when they had eaten their fill they went their ways, while Queen Zumurrud returned to her palace, saying, \"I thank Allah for solacing my heart of those who wronged me.\" Then she praised the Creator of the earth and the heavens and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"They ruled awhile and theirs was harsh tyrannic rule, * But soon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     that rule went by as though it never were:\nIf just they had won justice; but they sinned, and so * The world\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     collected all its bane for them to bear:\nSo died they and their case's tongue declares aloud * This is for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     that so of the world your blaming spare.\"\n\nAnd when her verse was ended she called to mind her lord Ali Shar and wept flowing tears; but presently recovered herself and said, \"Haply Allah, who hath given mine enemies into my hand, will vouchsafe me the speedy return of my beloved;\" and she begged forgiveness of Allah (be He extolled and exalted')\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Queen begged forgiveness of Allah (be He extolled and exalted!), and said, \"Haply He will vouchsafe me speedy reunion with my beloved Ali Shar for He can do what He willeth and to His servants showeth grace, ever mindful of their case!\" Then she praised Allah and again besought forgiveness of Him, submitting herself to the decrees of destiny, assured that each beginning hath his end, and repeating the saying of the poet,\n\n\"Take all things easy; for all worldly things * In Allah's hand\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     are ruled by Destiny:\nNe'er shall befal thee aught of things forbidden, * Nor what is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     bidden e'er shall fail to thee!\"\n\nAnd what another saith.\n\n\"Roll up thy days[FN#314] and easy shall they roll * Through\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     life, nor haunt the house of grief and dole:\nFull many a thing, which is o'er hard to find,* Next hour shall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     bring thee to delight thy soul.\"\nAnd what a third saith,[FN#315]\n\n\"Be mild what time thou'rt ta'en with anger and despite * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     patient, if there fall misfortune on thy head.\nIndeed, the nights are quick and great with child by Time * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     of all wondrous things are hourly brought to bed.\"\n\nAnd what a fourth saith,\n\n\"Take patience which breeds good if patience thou can learn; * Be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     calm soured, scaping anguish-draughts that gripe and bren:\nKnow, that if patience with good grace thou dare refuse, * With\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     ill-graced patience thou shalt bear what wrote the Pen.\"\n\nAfter which she abode thus another whole month's space, judging the folk and bidding and forbidding by day, and by night weeping and bewailing her separation from her lord Ali Shar. On the first day of the fifth month, she bade them spread the banquet on the race-plain, according to custom, and sat down at the head of the tables, whilst the lieges awaited the signal to fall to, leaving the place before the dish of rice vacant. She sat with eyes fixed upon the gate of the horse-course, noting all who entered and saying in her soul, \"O Thou who restoredest Joseph to Jacob and diddest away the sorrows of Job,[FN#316] vouchsafe of Thy might and Thy majesty to restore me my lord Ali Shar; for Thou over all things art Omnipotent, O Lord of the Worlds! O Guide of those who go astray! O Hearer of those that cry! O Answerer of those who pray, answer Thou my prayer, O Lord of all creatures.\" Now hardly had she made an end of her prayer and supplication when behold, she saw entering the gate of the horse-plain a young man, in shape like a willow branch, the comeliest of youths and the most accomplished, save that his face was wan and his form wasted by weariness. Now as he entered and came up to the tables, he found no seat vacant save that over against the dish of sweet rice so he sat down there; and, when Zumurrud looked upon him, her heart fluttered and, observing him narrowly, she knew him for her lord Ali Shar, and was like to have cried out for joy, but restrained herself, fearing disgrace before the folk and, albeit her bowels yearned over him and her heart beat wildly, she hid what she felt. Now the cause of his coming thither was on this wise. After he fell asleep upon the bench and Zumurrud let herself down to him and Jawan the Kurd seized her, he presently awoke and found himself lying with his head bare, so he knew that some one had come upon him and had robbed him of his turband whilst he slept. So he spoke the saying which shall never shame its sayer and, which is, \"Verily, we are Allah's and to Him are we returning!\" and, going back to the old woman's house, knocked at the door. She came out and he wept before her, till he fell down in a fainting fit. Now when he came to himself, he told her all that had passed, and she blamed him and chid him for his foolish doings saying, \"Verily thine affliction and calamity come from thyself.\" And she gave not over reproaching him, till the blood streamed from his nostrils and he again fainted away. When he recovered from his swoon,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Ali Shar recovered from his swoon he saw the old woman bewailing his griefs and weeping over him; so he complained of his hard lot and repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"How bitter to friends is a parting, * And a meeting how sweet to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     the lover!\nAllah join all the lovers He parteth, * And save me who of love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     ne'er recover.\"[FN#317]\n\nThe old woman mourned over him and said to him, \"Sit here, whilst I go in quest of news for thee and return to thee in haste.\" \"To hear is to obey,\" answered he. So she left him on her good errand and was absent till midday, when she returned and said to him, \"O Ali, I fear me thou must die in thy grief; thou wilt never see thy beloved again save on the bridge Al-Sir\u00e1t;[FN#318] for the people of the Christian's house, when they arose in the morning, found the window giving on the garden torn from its hinges and Zumurrud missing, and with her a pair of saddle-bags full of the Christian's money. And when I came thither, I saw the Chief of Police standing at the door, he and his many, and there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" Now, as Ali Shar heard these words, the light in his sight was changed to the darkness of night and he despaired of life and made sure of death; nor did he leave weeping, till he lost his senses. When he revived, love and longing were sore upon him; there befel him a grievous sickness and he kept his house a whole year; during which the old woman ceased not to bring him doctors and ply him with ptisanes and diet-drinks and make him savoury broths till, after the twelve-month ended, his life returned to him. Then he recalled what had passed and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Severance-grief nighmost, Union done to death, * Down-railing\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     tear-drops, heart fire tortureth!\nRedoubleth pine in one that hath no peace * For love and wake and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     woe he suffereth:\nO Lord, if there be thing to joy my soul * Deign Thou bestow it\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp     while I breathe my breath.\"\n\nWhen the second year began, the old woman said to him, \"O my son, all this thy weeping and wailing will not bring thee back thy mistress. Rise, therefore, gird the loins of resolution and seek for her in the lands: peradventure thou shalt light on some news of her.\" And she ceased not to exhort and hearten him, till he took courage and she carried him to the Hammam. Then she made him drink strong wine and eat white meats, and thus she did with him for a whole month, till he regained strength; and setting out journeyed without ceasing till he arrived at Zumurrud's city where he went to the horse-course, and sat down before the dish of sweet rice and put out his hand to eat of it. Now when the folk saw this, they were concerned for him and said to him, \"O young man, eat not of that dish, for whoso eateth thereof, misfortune befalleth him.\" Answered he, \"Leave me to eat of it, and let them do with me what they will, so haply shall I be at rest from this wearying life.\" Accordingly he ate a first mouthful, and Zumurrud was minded to have him brought before her, but then she bethought her that belike he was an hungered and said to herself, \"It were properer to let him eat his fill.\" So he went on eating, whilst the folk looked at him in astonishment, waiting to see what would betide him; and, when he had satisfied himself, Zumurrud said to certain of her eunuchry, \"Go to yonder youth who eateth of the rice and bring him to me in courteous guise, saying: 'Answer the summons of the King who would have a word with thee on some slight matter.'\" They replied, \"We hear and obey,\" and going straightways up to Ali Shar, said to him, \"O my lord, be pleased to answer the summons of the King and let thy heart be at ease.\" Quoth he, \"Hearkening and obedience;\" and followed the eunuchs,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ali Shar rejoined, \"Hearkening and obedience;\" and followed the eunuchs, whilst the people said to one another, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I wonder what the King will do with him!\" And others said, \"He will do him naught but good: for had he intended to harm him, he had not suffered him to eat his fill.\" Now when the Castratos set him in presence of Zumurrud he saluted and kissed the earth before her, whilst she returned his salutation and received him with honour. Then she asked him, \"What may be thy name and trade, and what brought thee to our city?\"; and he answered, \"O King my name is Ali Shar; I am of the sons of the merchants of Khorasan; and the cause of my coming hither is to seek for a slave-girl whom I have lost for she was dearer to me than my hearing and my seeing, and indeed my soul cleaveth to her, since I lost her; and such is my tale.\" So saying he wept, till he swooned away; whereupon she bade them sprinkle rose-water on his face, which they did till he revived, when she said, \"Here with the table of sand and the brass pen.\" So they brought them and she took the pen and struck a geomantic scheme which she considered awhile; and then cried, \"Thou hast spoken sooth, Allah will grant thee speedy reunion with her; so be not troubled.\" Upon this she commanded her head- chamberlain to carry him to the bath and afterwards to clothe him in a handsome suit of royal-apparel, and mount him on one of the best of the King's horses and finally bring him to the palace at the last of the day. So the Chamberlain, after saying \"I hear and I obey,\" took him away, whilst the folk began to say to one another, \"What maketh the King deal thus courteously with yonder youth?\" And quoth one, \"Did I not tell you that he would do him no hurt?; for he is fair of aspect; and this I knew, ever since the King suffered him to eat his fill.\" And each said his say; after which they all dispersed and went their ways. As for Zumurrud, she thought the night would never come, that she might be alone with the beloved of her heart. As soon as it was dark, she withdrew to her sleeping-chamber and made her attendants think her overcome with sleep; and it was her wont to suffer none to pass the night with her save those two little eunuchs who waited upon her. After a while when she had composed herself, she sent for her dear Ali Shar and sat down upon the bed, with candles burning over her head and feet, and hanging lamps of gold lighting up the place like the rising sun. When the people heard of her sending for Ali Shar, they marvelled thereat and each man thought his thought and said his say; but one of them declared, \"At all events the King is in love with this young man, and to- morrow he will make him generalissimo of the army.\"[FN#319] Now when they brought him into her, he kissed the ground between her hands and called down blessings her, and she said in her mind, \"There is no help for it but that I jest with him awhile, before I make myself known to him.''[FN#320] Then she asked him, \"O Ali, say me, hast thou been to the Hammam?\"[FN#321] and he answered, \"Yes, O my lord.\" Quoth she, \"Come, eat of this chicken and meat, and drink of this wine and sherbet of sugar; for thou art weary; and after that come thou hither.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" replied he and did as she commanded him do. Now when he had made an end of eating and drinking, she said to him, \"Come up with me on the couch and shampoo[FN#322] my feet.\" So he fell to rubbing feet and kneading calves, and found them softer than silk. Then said she, \"Go higher with the massage;\" and he, \"Pardon me, O my lord, to the knee but no farther!\" Whereupon quoth she, \"Durst thou disobey me?: it shall be an ill-omened night for thee!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Three Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zumurrud cried to her lord, Ali Shar, \"Durst thou disobey me?: it shall be an ill-omened night for thee! Nay, but it behoveth thee to do my bidding and I will make thee my minion and appoint thee one of my Emirs.\" Asked Ali Shar, \"And in what must I do thy bidding, O King of the age?\" and she answered, \"Doff thy trousers and lie down on thy face.\" Quoth he, \"That is a thing in my life I never did; and if thou force me thereto, verily I will accuse thee thereof before Allah on Resurrection-day. Take everything thou hast given me and let me go from thy city.\" And he wept and lamented; but she said, \"Doff thy trousers and lie down on thy face, or I will strike off thy head.\" So he did as she bade him and she mounted upon his back; and he felt what was softer than silk and smoother than cream and said in himself, \"Of a truth, this King is nicer than all the women!\" Now for a time she abode on his back, then she turned over on the bed, and he said to himself, \"Praised be Allah! It seemeth his yard is not standing.\" Then said she, \"O Ali, it is of the wont of my prickle that it standeth not, except they rub it with their hands; so, come, rub it with thy hand, till it be at stand, else will I slay thee.\" So saying, she lay down on her back and taking his hand, set it to her parts, and he found these same parts softer than silk; white, plumply-rounded, protuberant, resembling for heat the hot room of the bath or the heart of a lover whom love-longing hath wasted. Quoth Ali in himself, \"Verily, our King hath a coynte; this is indeed a wonder of wonders!\" And lust get hold on him and his yard rose and stood upright to the utmost of its height; which when Zumurrud saw, she burst out laughing and said to him, \"O my lord, all this happeneth and yet thou knowest me not!\" He asked \"And who art thou, O King?\"; and she answered, \"I am thy slave- girl Zumurrud.\" Now whenas he knew this and was certified that she was indeed his very slave-girl, Zumurrud, he kissed her and embraced her and threw himself upon her as the lion upon the lamb. Then he sheathed his steel rod in her scabbard and ceased not to play the porter at her door and the preacher in her pulpit and the priest[FN#323] at her prayer niche, whilst she with him ceased not from inclination and prostration and rising up and sitting down, accompanying her ejaculations of praise and of \"Glory to Allah!\" with passionate movements and wrigglings and claspings of his member[FN#324] and other amorous gestures, till the two little eunuchs heard the noise. So they came and peeping from behind the curtains saw the King lying on his back and upon him Ali Shar, thrusting and slashing whilst she puffed and blew and wriggled. Quoth they, \"Verily, this be no man's wriggle: belike this King is a woman.''[FN#325] But they concealed their affair and discovered it to none. And when the morrow came, Zumurrud summoned all the troops and the lords of the realm and said to them, \"I am minded to journey to this man's country; so choose you a viceroy, who shall rule over you till I return to you.\" And they answered, \"We hear and we obey.\" Then she applied herself to making ready the wants of the way, to wit provaunt and provender, monies and rarities for presents, camels and mules and so forth; after which she set out from her city with Ali Shar, and they ceased not faring on, till they arrived at his native place, where he entered his house and gave many gifts to his friends and alms and largesse to the poor. And Allah vouchsafed him children by her, and they both lived the gladdest and happiest of lives, till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies and the Garnerer of graves. And glorified be He the Eternal without cease, and praised be He in every case! And amongst other tales they tell one of\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n[FN#254] Lane (ii. 435) ill-advisedly writes \"Sher,\" as \"the word is evidently Persian signifying a Lion.\" But this is only in the debased Indian dialect, a Persian, especially a Shirazi, pronounces \"Sh\u00edr.\" And this is how it is written in the Bresl. Edit., vii. 262. \"Sh\u00e1r\" is evidently a fancy name, possibly suggested by the dynastic name of the Ghurjistan or Georgian Princes.\n\n[FN#255] Again old experience, which has learned at a heavy cost how many a goodly apple is rotten at the core.\n\n[FN#256] This couplet has occurred in Night xxi. I give Torrens (p. 206) by way of specimen.\n\n[FN#257] Arab. \"Z\u00e1ka\" = merely tasting a thing which may be sweet with a bitter after-flavour\n\n[FN#258] This tetraseich was in Night xxx. with a difference.\n\n[FN#259] The lines have occurred in Night xxx. I quote Torrens, p. 311.\n\n[FN#260] This tetrastich is in Night clxix. I borrow from Lane (ii. 62).\n\n[FN#261] The rude but effective refrigerator of the desert Arab who hangs his water-skin to the branch of a tree and allows it to swing in the wind.\n\n[FN#262] Arab \"Khum\u00e1siyah\" which Lane (ii. 438) renders \"of quinary stature.\" Usually it means five spans, but here five feet, showing that the girl was young and still growing. The invoice with a slave always notes her height in spans measured from ankle-bone to ear and above seven she loses value as being full grown. Hence Sud\u00e1si (fem. Sud\u00e1siyah) is a slave six spans high, the Shibr or full span (9 inches) not the Fitr or short span from thumb to index. Faut is the interval-between every finger, Ratab between index and medius, and Atab between medius and annularis.\n\n[FN#263] \"Moon faced\" now sounds sufficiently absurd to us, but it was not always so. Solomon (Cant. vi. 10) does not disdain the image \"fair as the moon, clear as the sun,\" and those who have seen a moon in the sky of Arabia will thoroughly appreciate it. We find it amongst the Hindus, the Persians, the Afghans, the Turks and all the nations of Europe. We have, finally, the grand example of Spenser,\n\n\"Her spacious forehead, like the clearest moon, etc.\"\n\n[FN#264] Blue eyes have a bad name in Arabia as in India: the witch Zark\u00e1 of Al-Yamamah was noted for them; and \"blue eyed\" often means \"fierce-eyed,\" alluding to the Greeks and Daylamites, mortal-enemies to Ishmael. The Arabs say \"ruddy of mustachio, blue of eye and black of heart.\"\n\n[FN#265] Before explained as used with camphor to fill the dead man's mouth.\n\n[FN#266] As has been seen, slapping on the neck is equivalent to our \"boxing ears,\" but much less barbarous and likely to injure the child. The most insulting blow is that with shoe sandal-or slipper because it brings foot in contact with head. Of this I have spoken before.\n\n[FN#267] Arab. \"Hib\u00e1l\" (= ropes) alluding to the A'ak\u00e1l-fillet which binds the K\u00fafiyah-kerchief on the Badawi's head. (Pilgrimage, i. 346.)\n\n[FN#268] Arab. \"Khiy\u00e1l\"; afterwards called Kara Gyuz (= \"black eyes,\" from the celebrated Turkish Wazir). The mise-en-sc\u00e8ne was like that of Punch, but of transparent cloth, lamp lit inside and showing silhouettes worked by hand. Nothing could be more Fescenntne than Kara Gyuz, who appeared with a phallus longer than himself and made all the Consuls-General-periodically complain of its abuse, while the dialogue, mostly in Turkish, as even more obscene. Most ingenious were Kara Gyuz's little ways of driving on an Obstinate donkey and of tackling a huge Anatolian pilgrim. He mounted the Neddy's back face to tail, and inserting his left thumb like a clyster, hammered it with his right when the donkey started at speed. For the huge pilgrim he used a ladder. These shows now obsolete, used to enliven the Ezbekiyah Gardens every evening and explain Ovid's Words,\n\n\"Delicias videam, Nile jocose, tuas!\"\n\n[FN#269] Mohammed (Mishk\u00e1t al-Mas\u00e1bih ii. 360-62) says, \"Change the whiteness of your hair but not with anything black.\" Abu Bakr, who was two years and some months older than the Prophet, used tincture of Henna and Katam. Old Turkish officers justify black dyes because these make them look younger and fiercer. Henna stains white hair orange red; and the Persians apply after it a paste of indigo leaves, the result is successively leek-green, emerald-green, bottle-green and lastly lamp-black. There is a stage in life (the youth of old age) when man uses dyes: presently he finds that the whole face wants dye; that the contrast between juvenile coloured hair and ancient skin is ridiculous and that it is time to wear white.\n\n[FN#270] This prejudice extends all over the East: the Sanskrit saying is \"Kvachit k\u00e1n\u00e1 bhaveta s\u00e1dhus\" now and then a monocular is honest. The left eye is the worst and the popular idea is, I have said, that the damage will come by the injured member\n\n[FN#271] The Arabs say like us, \"Short and thick is never quick\" and \"Long and thin has little in.\"\n\n[FN#272] Arab. \"Ba'azu lay\u00e1li,\" some night when his mistress failed him.\n\n[FN#273] The fountain in Paradise before noticed.\n\n[FN#274] Before noticed as the Moslem St. Peter (as far as the keys go).\n\n[FN#275] Arab. \"Munkasir\" = broken, frail, languishing the only form of the maladive allowed. Here again we have masculine for feminine: the eyelids show love-desire, but, etc.\n\n[FN#276] The river of Paradise.\n\n[FN#277] See Night xii. \"The Second Kalandar's Tale \" vol. i. 113.\n\n[FN#278] Lane (ii. 472) refers for specimens of calligraphy to Herbin's \"D\u00e9veloppements, etc.\" There are many more than seven styles of writing as I have shown in Night xiii.; vol. i. 129.\n\n[FN#279] Amongst good Moslems this would be a claim upon a man.\n\n[FN#280] These lines have occurred twice already: and first appear in Night xxii. I have borrowed from Mr. Payne (iv. 46).\n\n[FN#281] Arab. \"Ya Nasr\u00e1ni\", the address is not intrinsically slighting but it may easily be made so. I have elsewhere noted that when Julian (is said to have) exclaimed \"Vicisti Nazarene!\" he was probably thinking in Eastern phrase \"Nasarta, y\u00e1 Nasr\u00e1ni!\"\n\n[FN#282] Thirst is the strongest of all pleas to an Eastern, especially to a Persian who never forgets the sufferings of his Imam, Husayn, at Kerbela: he would hardly withhold it from the murderer of his father. There is also a Hadis, \"Thou shalt not refuse water to him who thirsteth in the desert.\"\n\n[FN#283] Arab. \"Zimmi\" which Lane (ii. 474) aptly translates a \"tributary.\" The Koran (chaps. ix.) orders Unbelievers to Islamize or to \"pay tribute by right of subjection\" (lit. an yadin=out of hand, an expression much debated). The least tribute is one dinar per annum which goes to the poor-rate. and for this the Kafir enjoys protection and almost all the civil rights of Moslems. As it is a question of \"loaves and fishes\" there is much to say on the subject; \"loaves and fishes\" being the main base and foundation of all religious establishments.\n\n[FN#284] This tetrastich has before occurred, so I quote Lane (ii. 444).\n\n[FN#285] In Night xxxv. the same occurs with a difference.\n\n[FN#286] The old rite, I repeat, has lost amongst all but the noblest of Arab tribes the whole of its significance; and the traveller must be careful how he trusts to the phrase \"Nahnu m\u00e1lihin\" we are bound together by the salt.\n\n[FN#287] Arab. \"Al\u00e1ma\" = Al\u00e1-m\u00e1 = upon what ? wherefore ?\n\n[FN#288] Arab. \"Mauz\"; hence the Linnean name Musa (paradisiaca, etc.). The word is explained by Sale (Koran, chaps. xxxvii. 146) as \"a small tree or shrub;\" and he would identify it with Jonah's gourd.\n\n[FN#289] Lane (ii. 446) \"bald wolf or empowered fate,\" reading (with Mac.) Kaz\u00e1 for Kattan (cat).\n\n[FN#290] i.e. \"the Orthodox in the Faith.\" R\u00e1shid is a proper name, witness that scourge of Syria, R\u00e1shid Pasha. Born in 1830, of the Haji Nazir Agha family, Darrah-Beys of Macedonian Draina, he was educated in Paris where he learned the usual-hatred of Europeans: he entered the Egyptian service in 1851, and, presently exchanging it for the Turkish, became in due time Wali (Governor-General) of Syria which he plundered most shamelessly. Recalled in 1872, he eventually entered the Ministry and on June 15 1876, he was shot down, with other villains like himself, by gallant Captain Hasan, the Circassian (Yarham-hu 'll\u00e1h !).\n\n[FN#291] Quoted from a piece of verse, of which more presently.\n\n[FN#292] This tetrastich has occurred before (Night cxciii.). I quote Lane (ii. 449), who quotes Dryden's Spanish Friar,\n\n\"There is a pleasure sure in being mad\nWhich none but madmen know.\"\n\n[FN#293] Lane (ii. 449) gives a tradition of the Prophet, \"Whoso is in love, and acteth chastely, and concealeth (his passion) and dieth, dieth a martyr.\" Sakar is No. 5 Hell for Magi Guebres, Parsis, etc., it is used in the comic Persian curse, \"Fi'n-n\u00e1ri wa Sakar al-jadd w'al-pidar\"=ln Hell and Sakar his grandfather and his father.\n\n[FN#294] Arab. \"Sifr\": I have warned readers that whistling is considered a kind of devilish speech by the Arabs, especially the Badawin, and that the traveller must avoid it. It savours of idolatry: in the Koran we find (chaps. viii. 35), \"Their prayer at the House of God (Ka'abah) is none other than whistling and hand-clapping;\" and tradition says that they whistled through their fingers. Besides many of the Jinn have only round holes by way of mouths and their speech is whistling a kind of bird language like sibilant English.\n[FN#295] Arab. 'K\u00edl wa k\u00e1l\"=lit. \"it was said and he said;\" a popular phrase for chit chat, tittle-tattle, prattle and prate, etc.\n\n[FN#296] Arab. \"Hadis.\" comparing it with a tradition of the\nProphet.\n\n[FN#297] Arab. \"Mikashshah,\" the thick part of a midrib of a palm-frond soaked for some days in water and beaten out till the fibres separate. It makes an exceedingly hard, although not a lasting broom.\n\n[FN#298] Persian, \"the youth, the brave;\" Sansk. Yuv\u00e1n: and Lat. Juvenis. The Kurd, in tales, is generally a sturdy thief; and in real-life is little better.\n\n[FN#299] Arab. \"Y\u00e1 Shatir ;\" lit. O clever one (in a bad sense).\n\n[FN#300] Lane (ii. 453) has it. \"that I may dress thy hair'\" etc.\nThis is Bowdlerising with a witness.\n\n[FN#301] The sign of respect when a personage dismounts.\n(Pilgrimage i. 77.)\n\n[FN#302] So the Hindus speak of \"the defilement of separation\" as if it were an impurity.\n\n[FN#303] Lane (i. 605) gives a long and instructive note on these public royal-banquets which were expected from the lieges by Moslem subjects. The hanging-penalty is, perhaps, a tattle exaggerated; but we find the same excess in the priestly Gesta Romanorum.\n\n[FN#304] Had he eaten it he would have become her guest. Amongst the older Badawin it was sufficient to spit upon a man (in entreaty) to claim his protection: so the horse-thieves when caught were placed in a hole in the ground covered over with matting to prevent this happening. Similarly Saladin (Sal\u00e1h al-Din) the chivalrous would not order a cup of water for the robber, Reynald de Ch\u00e2tillon, before putting him to death\n\n[FN#305] Arab. \"Kishk\" properly \"Kashk\"=wheat-meal-coarsely ground and eaten with milk or broth. It is de rigueur with the Egyptian Copts on the \"Friday of Sorrow\" (Good Friday): and Lane gives the recipe for making it (M. E. chaps. xxvi.)\n\n[FN#306] In those days distinctive of Moslems.\n\n[FN#307] The euphemism has before been noticed: the Moslem reader would not like to pronounce the words \"I am a Nazarene.\" The same formula occurs a little lower down to save the reciter or reader from saying \"Be my wife divorced,\" etc.\n\n[FN#308] Arab, \"H\u00e1jj,\" a favourite Egyptianism. We are wrong to write Hajji which an Eastern would pronounce H\u00e1j-j\u00ed.\n\n[FN#309] This is Cairene \"chaff.\"\n\n[FN#310] Whose shell fits very tight.\n\n[FN#311] His hand was like a raven's because he ate with thumb and two fingers and it came up with the rice about it like a camel's hoof in dirty ground. This refers to the proverb (Burckhardt, 756), \"He comes down a crow-claw (small) and comes up a camel-hoof (huge and round).\"\n\n[FN#312] Easterns have a superstitious belief in the powers of food: I knew a learned man who never sat down to eat without a ceremonious salam to his meat.\n\n[FN#313] Lane (ii. 464), uses the vile Turkish corruption \"Rustum,\" which, like its fellow \"Rustem,\" would make a Persian shudder.\n\n[FN#314] Arab. \"Darrij\" i.e. let them slide (Americanic\u00e8).\n\n[FN#315] This tetrastich has occurred before: so I quote Mr. Payne (in loco).\n\n[FN#316] Shaykh of Al-Butnah and J\u00e1biyah, therefore a Syrian of the Hauran near Damascus and grandson to Is\u00fa (Esau). Arab mystics (unlike the vulgar who see only his patience) recognise that inflexible integrity which refuses to utter \"words of wind\" and which would not, against his conscience, confess to wrong-doing merely to pacify the Lord who was stronger than himself. The Classics taught this noble lesson in the case of Prometheus versus Zeus. Many articles are called after Job e.g. Ra'ar\u00e1' Ayyub or Ghubayr\u00e1 (inula Arabica and undulata), a creeper with which he rubbed himself and got well: the Copts do the same on \"Job's Wednesday,\" i.e. that before Whit Sunday O.S. Job's father is a nickname of the camel, etc. etc.\n\n[FN#317] Lane (in loco) renders \"I am of their number.\" But \"f\u00ed al-siy\u00e1k\" means popularly \"(driven) to the point of death.\"\n\n[FN#318] Lit. = \"pathway, road\"; hence the bridge well known as \"finer than a hair and sharper than a sword,\" over which all (except Khadijah and a chosen few) must pass on the Day of Doom; a Persian apparatus bodily annexed by Al-Islam. The old Guebres called it Puli Chin\u00e1var or Chin\u00e1vad and the Jews borrowed it from them as they did all their fancies of a future life against which Moses had so gallantly fought. It is said that a bridge over the grisly \"brook Kedron\" was called Sir\u00e1t (the road) and hence the idea, as that of hell-fire from Ge-Hinnom (Gehenna) where children were passed through the fire to Moloch. A doubtful Hadis says, \"The Prophet declared Al-Sir\u00e1t to be the name of a bridge over hell- fire, dividing Hell from Paradise\" (pp. 17, 122, Reynold's trans. of Al-Siyuti's Traditions, etc.). In Koran i. 5, \"Sirat\" is simply a path, from sarata, he swallowed, even as the way devours (makes a lakam or mouthful of) those who travel it. The word was orig. written with S\u00edn but changed for easier articulation to S\u00e1d, one of the four Hur\u00faf al-Mutabbak\u00e1t, \"the flattened,\" formed by the broadened tongue in contact with the palate. This Sad also by the figure Ishm\u00e1m (=conversion) turns slightly to a Z\u00e1, the intermediate between Sin and Sad.\n\n[FN#319] The rule in Turkey where catamites rise to the highest rank: C'est un homme de bonne famille (said a Turkish officer in Egypt) il a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9. Hence \"Alfi\" (one who costs a thousand) is a well-known cognomen. The Pasha of the Syrian caravan, with which I travelled' had been the slave of a slave and he was not a solitary instance. (Pilgrimage i. 90.)\n\n[FN#320] The device of the banquet is dainty enough for any old Italian novella; all that now comes is pure Egyptian polissonnerie speaking to the gallery and being answered by roars of laughter.\n\n[FN#321] i.e. \"art thou ceremonially pure and therefore fit for handling by a great man like myself?\"\n\n[FN#322] In past days before Egypt was \"frankified\" many overlanders used to wash away the traces of travel by a Turkish bath which mostly ended in the appearance of a rump wriggling little lad who offered to shampoo them. Many accepted his offices without dreaming of his usual-use or misuse.\n\n[FN#323] Arab. \"Im\u00e1m.\" This is (to a Moslem) a most offensive comparison between prayer and car. cop.\n\n[FN#324] Arab. \"Fi zaman-hi,\" alluding to a peculiarity highly prized by Egyptians; the use of the constrictor vagin\u00e6 muscles, the sphincter for which Abyssinian women are famous. The \"Kabb\u00e1zah\" ( = holder), as she is called, can sit astraddle upon a man and can provoke the venereal-orgasm, not by wriggling and moving but by tightening and loosing the male member with the muscles of her privities, milking it as it were. Consequently the cassenoisette costs treble the money of other concubines. (Arranga-Ranga, p. 127.)\n\n[FN#325] The little eunuchs had evidently studied the Harem.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/855117", "artist_names": "Brook Benton", "full_title": "Another Cup of Coffee by\u00a0Brook\u00a0Benton", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/92c2e563c8386a62813d1de0c293e3c3.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/92c2e563c8386a62813d1de0c293e3c3.640x640x1.jpg", "id": 855117, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429284779, "path": "/Brook-benton-another-cup-of-coffee-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Brook-benton-another-cup-of-coffee-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/92c2e563c8386a62813d1de0c293e3c3.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/92c2e563c8386a62813d1de0c293e3c3.640x640x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Another Cup of Coffee", "title_with_featured": "Another Cup of Coffee", "updated_by_human_at": 1652091489, "url": "https://genius.com/Brook-benton-another-cup-of-coffee-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/351692", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7a0813a20b2c318d80c3ce0bee10c8c8.368x368x1.jpg", "id": 351692, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7a0813a20b2c318d80c3ce0bee10c8c8.368x368x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Brook Benton", "slug": "Brook-benton", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Brook-benton"}, "artist": "Brook Benton", "lyrics": "Another Cup of Coffee LyricsAnother cup of coffee, another cigarette\nAnother hour of mem'ries so hard to forget\nHow your crazy-lovin' arms held me so tight\nAnother cup of java, another lonely night\n\nPut a dime in the jukebox, play a sad, sad song\nAnd all the time I'll be thinkin' about the dream that's gone wrong\nAnd where you used to say \"Our love is still alive\"\nAnother cup of coffee, another lonely night\n\nBut there'll be me, I don't blame you for walkin' out on me\n'Cause the way I cheated on you, I deserve this misery\nAnother love has found you, he's a lucky guy\nAnother's arms all around you, I'm so sad I could cry\nDarling, if you don't come back, I know what's in sight\nAnother cup of coffee, another lonely night\n\nWhoa, dear, if you don't come back, I know what's in sight\nAnother cup of coffee, another lonely night\n\nAnother cup of coffee, hmmm, another lonely nightYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/4960095", "artist_names": "URLtv (Ft.
