Scene 1 LyricsBanquet halls are a very special place, where under one big roof so many different memories are made. From proms to weddings to baby showers, once that DJ starts to spin, there's something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with sing-along dance tunes. Top 40 hits come and go, and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening, but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time. Not only do they never go out of style, they are essential components of the perfect hoe-down in all banquet halls.\n\n1. The Chicken Dance\nThis song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can't help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding.\n\n2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios\nA major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat.\n\n3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA\nLight-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S.\n4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion\nThe words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, \"My heart will go on and OOOOOOON!\" with Celine.\n\n5. Don't Stop Believin, by Journey\nThe ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey's quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren't even born then know the words. It's a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song.\n\nThese time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they've got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones.\n\nriage, first gave sign\nUnto his contract; fire and air did shine,\nAs guilty of the match; and from the hill\nThe nymphs with shriekings do the region fill.\nHere first began their bane; this day was ground\nOf all their ills; for now, nor rumour's sound,\nNor nice respect of state, moves Dido ought;\nHer love no longer now by stealth is sought:\nShe calls this wedlock, and with that fair name\nCovers her fault. Forthwith the bruit and fame,\nThrough all the greatest Lybian towns is gone;\nFame, a fleet evil, than which is swifter none,\nThat moving grows, and flying gathers strength,\nLittle at first, and fearful; but at length\nShe dares attempt the skies, and stalking proud\nWith feet on ground, her head doth pierce a cloud!\nThis child, our parent earth, stirr'd up with spite\nOf all the gods, brought forth; and, as some write,\nShe was last sister of that giant race\nThat thought to scale Jove' s court; right swift of pace,\nAnd swifter far of wing; a monster vast,\nAnd dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed\nOn her huge corps, so many waking eyes\nStick underneath; and, which may stranger rise\nIn the report, as many tongues she bears,\nAs many mouths, as many listening ears.\nNightly, in midst of all the heaven, she flies,\nAnd through the earth's dark shadow shrieking cries,\nNor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep;\nBy day on tops of houses she doth keep,\nOr on high towers; and doth thence affright\nCities and towns of most conspicuous site:\nAs covetous she is of tales and lies,\nAs prodigal of truth: this monster\u2014\nLup.\n[within.] Come, follow me, assist me, second me! Where'! the\nemperor?\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] Sir, you must pardon us.\n\n2 Eques.\n[within.] Caesar is private now; you may not enter.\n\nTuc.\n[within.] Not enter! Charge them upon their allegiance,\ncropshin.\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] We have a charge to the contrary, sir.\n\nLup.\n[within.] I pronounce you all traitors, horrible traitors:\nWhat! do you know my affairs? I have matter of danger and state to impart to Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nWhat noise is there? who's that names Caesar?\n\nLup.\n[within.] A friend to Caesar. One that, for Caesar's good,\nwould speak with Caesar.\nCaes.\nWho is it? look, Cornelius.\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] Asinius Lupus.\n\nCaes.\nO, bid the turbulent informer hence;\nWe have no vacant ear now, to receive\nThe unseason'd fruits of his officious tongue.\n\nMec.\nYou must avoid him there.\n\nLup.\n[within.] I conjure thee, as thou art. Caesar, or respectest\nthine own safety, or the safety of the state, Caesar, hear me,\nspeak with me, Caesar; 'tis no common business I come about, but\nsuch, as being neglected, may concern the life of Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nThe life of Caesar! Let him enter. Virgil, keep thy seat.\nEnter Lupus, Tucca, and Lictors.\n\nEques.\n[within.] Bear back, there: whither will you? keep back!\n\nTuc.\nBy thy leave, goodman usher: mend thy peruke; so.\n\nLup.\nLay hold on Horace there; and on Mecaenas, lictors. Romans,\noffer no rescue, upon your allegiance: read, royal Caesar.\n[Gives a paper.] I'll tickle you, Satyr.\n\nTuc.\nHe will, Humours, he will; he will squeeze you, poet\npuck-fist.\n\nLup.\nI'll lop you off for an unprofitable branch, you satirical\nvarlet.\n\nTuc.\nAy, and Epaminondas your patron here, with his flagon chain;\ncome, resign: [takes off Mecaenas' chain,] though 'twere your great grandfather's, the law has made it mine now, sir. Look to him, my party-coloured rascals; look to him.\n\nCaes.\nWhat is this, Asinius Lupus? I understand it not.\n\nLup.\nNot understand it! A libel, Caesar; a dangerous, seditious\nlibel; a libel in picture.\n\nCaes.\nA libel!\n\nLup.\nAy, I found it in this Horace his study, in Mecaenas his\nhouse, here; I challenge the penalty of the laws against them.\n\nTuc.\nAy, and remember to beg their land betimes; before some of\nthese hungry court-hounds scent it out.\n\nCaes.\nShew it to Horace: ask him if he know it.\n\nLup.\nKnow it! his hand is at it, Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nThen 'tis no libel.\n\nHor.\nIt is the imperfect body of an emblem, Caesar, I began for\nMecaenas.\n\nLup.\nAn emblem! right: that's Greek for a libel. Do but mark how\nconfident he is.\n\nHor.\nA just man cannot fear, thou foolish tribune;\nNot, though the malice of traducing tongues,\nThe open vastness of a tyrant's ear,\nThe senseless rigour of the wrested laws,\nOr the red eyes of strain'd authority,\nShould, in a point, meet all to take his life:\nHis innocence is armour 'gainst all these.\n\nLup.\nInnocence! O impudence! let me see, let me see! Is not here an\neagle! and is not that eagle meant by Caesar, ha? Does not Caesar\ngive the eagle? answer me; what sayest thou?\n\nTuc.\nHast thou any evasion, stinkard?\n\nLup.\nNow he's turn'd dumb. I'll tickle you, Satyr.\n\nHor.\nPish: ha, ha!\n\nLup.\nDost thou pish me? Give me my long sword.\n\nHor.\nWith reverence to great Caesar, worthy Romans,\nObserve but this ridiculous commenter;\nThe soul 'to my device was in this distich:\nThus oft, the base and ravenous multitude\nSurvive, to share the spoils of fortitude.\nWhich in this body I have figured here,\nA vulture\u2014\n\nLup.\nA vulture! Ay, now, 'tis a vulture. O abominable! monstrous!\nmonstrous! has not your vulture a beak? has it not legs, and\ntalons, and wings, and feathers?\n\nTuc.\nTouch him, old buskins.\n\nHor.\nAnd therefore must it be an eagle?\n\nMec.\nRespect him not, good Horace: say your device.\n\nHor.\nA vulture and a wolf\n\nLup.\nA wolf! good: that's I; I am the wolf: my name's Lupus; I am\nmeant by the wolf. On, on; a vulture and a wolf\n\nHor.\nPreying upon the carcass of an ass\u2014\n\nLup.\nAn ass! good still: that's I too; I am the ass. You mean me by\nthe ass.\n\nMec.\nPrithee, leave braying then.\n\nHor.\nIf you will needs take it, I cannot with modesty give it from\nyou.\n\nMec.\nBut, by that beast, the old Egyptians\nWere wont to figure, in their hieroglyphics,\nPatience, frugality, and fortitude;\nFor none of which we can suspect you, tribune.\n\nCaes.\nWho was it, Lupus, that inform'd you first, This should be\nmeant by us? Or was't your comment?\n\nLup.\nNo, Caesar; a player gave me the first light of it indeed.\n\nTuc.\nAy, an honest sycophant-like slave, and a politician besides\n\nCaes.\nWhere is that player?\n\nTuc.\nHe is without here.\n\nCaes.\nCall him in.\n\nTuc.\nCall in the player there: master AEsop, call him.\n\nEquites.\n[within.] Player! where is the player? bear back: none but\nthe player enter.\n\n[Enter AESOP, followed by CRISPINUS and DEMETRIUS.\nTuc.\nYes, this gentleman and his Achates must.\n\nCris.\nPray you, master usher:\u2014we'll stand close, here.\n\nTuc.\n'Tis a gentleman of quality, this; though he be somewhat out\nof clothes, I tell ye.\u2014Come, AEsop, hast a bay-leaf in thy mouth?\nWell said; be not out, stinkard. Thou shalt have a monopoly of\nplaying confirm'd to thee, and thy covey, under the emperor's broad seal, for this service.\n\nCaes.\nIs this he?\n\nLup.\nAy, Caesar, this is he.\n\nCaes.\nLet him be whipped. Lictors, go take him hence.\nAnd, Lupus, for your fierce credulity,\nOne fit him with a pair of larger ears:\n'Tis Caesar's doom, and must not be revoked.\nWe hate to have our court and peace disturb'd\nWith these quotidian clamours. See it done.\n\nLup.\nCaesar! \n\n[Exeunt some of the Lictors, with Lupus and AEsop\nCaes.\nGag him, [that] we may have his silence.\n\nVirg.\nCaesar hath done like Caesar. Fair and just\nIs his award, against these brainless creatures.\n'Tis not the wholesome sharp morality,\nOr modest anger of a satiric spirit,\nThat hurts or wounds the body of the state;\nBut the sinister application\nOf the malicious, ignorant, and base\nInterpreter; who will distort, and strain\nThe general scope and purpose of an author\nTo his particular and private spleen.\n\nCaes.\nWe know it, our dear Virgil, and esteem it\nA most dishonest practice in that man,\nWill seem too witty in another's work.\nWhat would Cornelius Gallus, and Tibullus?\n\n[They whisper Caesar.\nTuc.\n[to Mecaenas.] Nay, but as thou art a man, dost hear! a man\nof worship and honourable: hold, here, take thy chain again.\nResume, mad Mecoenas. What! dost thou think I meant to have kept it, old boy? no: I did it but to fright thee, I, to try how thou\nwould'st take it. What! will I turn shark upon my friends, or my\nfriends' friends? I scorn it with my three souls. Come, I love\nbully Horace as well as thou dost, I: 'tis an honest hieroglyphic.\nGive me thy wrist, Helicon. Dost thou think I'll second e'er a\nrhinoceros of them all, against thee, ha? or thy noble Hippocrene,\nhere? I'll turn stager first, and be whipt too: dost thou see,\nbully?\n\nCaes.\nYou have your will of Caesar: use it, Romans.\nVirgil shall be your praetor: and ourself\nWill here sit by, spectator of your sports;\nAnd think it no impeach of royalty.\nOur ear is now too much profaned, grave Maro,\nWith these distastes, to take thy sacred lines;\nPut up thy book, till both the time and we\nBe fitted with more hallow'd circumstance\nFor the receiving of so divine a work.\nProceed with your design.\n\nMec. Gal. Tib.\nThanks to great Caesar.\n\nGal.\nTibullus, draw you the indictment then, whilst Horace arrests\nthem on the statute of Calumny. Mecaenas and I will take our\nplaces here. Lictors, assist him.\n\nHor.\nI am the worst accuser under heaven.\n\nGal.\nTut, you must do it; 'twill be noble mirth.\n\nHor.\nI take no knowledge that they do malign me.\n\nTib.\nAy, but the world takes knowledge.\n\nHor.\nWould the world knew\nHow heartily I wish a fool should hate me!\n\nTuc.\nBody of Jupiter! what! will they arraign my brisk Poetaster\nand his poor journeyman, ha? Would I were abroad skeldering for, a drachm, so I were out of this labyrinth again! I do feel myself\nturn stinkard already: but I must set the best face I have upon't\nnow.\n[Aside.]\u2014Well said, my divine, deft Horace, bring the whoreson detracting slaves to the bar, do; make them hold up their spread golls: I'll give in evidence for thee, if thou wilt. Take courage, Crlspinus; would thy man had a clean band!\n\nCris.\nWhat must we do, captain?\n\nTuc.\nThou shalt see anon: do not make division with thy legs so.\n\nCaes.\nWhat's he. Horace?\n\nHor.\nI only know him for a motion, Caesar.\n\nTuc.\nI am one of thy commanders, Caesar; a man of service and\naction: my name is Pantilius Tucca; I have served in thy wars\nagainst Mark Antony, I.\n\nCaes.\nDo you know him, Cornelius?\n\nGal.\nHe's one that hath had the mustering, or convoy of a company\nnow and then: I never noted him by any other employment.\n\nCaes.\nWe will observe him better.\n\nTib.\nLictor, proclaim silence in the court.\n\nLict.\nIn the name of Caesar, silence!\n\nTib.\nLet the parties, the accuser and the accused, present\nthemselves.\n\nLict.\nThe accuser and the accused, present yourselves in court.\n\nCris.\nDem. Here.\n\nVirg.\nRead the indictment.\n\nTib.\nRufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your\nhands. You are, before this time, jointly and severally indicted,\nand here presently to be arraigned upon the statute of calumny, or\nLex Remmia, the one by the name of Rufus Laberius Crispinus, alias\nCri-spinus, poetaster and plagiary, the other by the name of\nDemetrius Fannius, play-dresser and plagiary. That you (not having\nthe fear of Phoebus, or his shafts, before your eyes) contrary to\nthe peace of our liege lord, Augustus Caesar, his crown and\ndignity, and against the form of a statute, in that case made and\nprovided, have moat ignorantly, foolishly, and, more like\nyourselves, maliciously, gone about to deprave, and calumniate the\nperson and writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus, here present,\npoet, and priest to the Muses, and to that end have mutually\nconspired and plotted, at sundry times, as by several means, and in\nsundry places, for the better accomplishing your base and envious\npurpose, taxing him falsely, of self-love, arrogancy, impudence,\nrailing, filching by translation, etc. Of all which calumnies, and\nevery of them, in manner and form aforesaid, what answer you! Are you guilty, or not guilty?\n\nTuc.\nNot guilty, say.\n\nCris.\nDem. Not guilty.\n\nTib.\nHow will you be tried?\n[Aside to Crispinus.\nTuc.\nBy the Roman Gods, and the noblest Romans.\n\nCris.\nDem. By the Roman gods, and the noblest Romans.\n\nVirg.\nHere sits Mecaenas, and Cornelius Gallus, are you contented\nto be tried by these?\n[Aside.\nTuc.\nAy, so the noble captain may be joined with them in\ncommission, say.\n\nCris.\nDem. Ay, so the noble captain may be joined\nwith them in commission.\n\nVirg.\nWhat says the plaintiff?\n\nHor.\nI am content.\n\nVirg.\nCaptain, then take your place.\n\nTuc.\nalas, my worshipful praetor! 'tis more of thy gentleness than\nof my deserving, I wusse. But since it hath pleased the court to\nmake choice of my wisdom and gravity, come, my calumnious\nvarlets; let's hear you talk for yourselves, now, an hour or two.\nWhat can you say? Make a noise. Act, act!\n\nVirg.\nStay, turn, and take an oath first. You shall swear,\nBy thunder-darting Jove, the king of gods,\nAnd by the genius of Augustus Caesar;\nBy your own white and uncorrupted souls,\nAnd the deep reverence of our Roman justice;\nTo judge this case, with truth and equity:\nAs bound by your religion, and your laws.\nNow read the evidence: but first demand\nOf either prisoner, if that writ be theirs.\n[Gives him two papers.\nTib.\nShew this unto Crispinus. Is it yours?\n\nTuc.\nSay, ay. [Aside.]\u2014What! dost thou stand upon it, pimp! Do not\ndeny thine own Minerva, thy Pallas, the issue of thy brain.\n\nOris.\nYes it is mine.\n\nTib.\nShew that unto Demetrius. Is it yours?\n\nDem.\nIt is.\n\nTuc.\nThere's a father will not deny his own bastard now, I warrant\nthee.\n\nVirg.\nRead them aloud.\n\nTib.\nRamp up my genius, be not retrograde;\nBut boldly nominate a spade a spade\nWhat, shall thy lubrical and glibbery muse\nLive, as she were defunct, like punk in stews!\n\nTuc.\nExcellent!\n\nAlas! that were no modern consequence,\nTo have cothurnal buskins frighted hence.\nNo, teach thy Incubus to poetise;\nAnd throw abroad thy spurious snotteries,\nUpon that puft-up lump of balmy froth.\n\nTuc.\nAh, Ah!\n\nOr clumsy chilblain'd judgment; that with oath\nMagnificates his merit; and beapawls\nThe conscious time, with humorous foam and brawls,\nAs if his organons of sense would crack\nThe sinews of my patience. Break his back,\nO poets all and some! for now we list\nOf strenuous vengeance to clutch the fist.\nCRISPINUS.\n\nTuc.\nAy, marry, this was written like a Hercules in poetry, now.\n\nCaes.\nExcellently well threaten'd!\n\nVirg.\nAnd as strangely worded, Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nWe observe it.\n\nVirg.\nThe other now.\n\nTuc.\nThis is a fellow of a good prodigal tongue too, this will do\nwell.\n\nTib.\nOur Muse is in mind for th' untrussing a poet,\nI slip by his name, for most men do know it:\nA critic, that all the world bescumbers\nWith satirical humours and lyrical numbers:\n\nTuc.\nArt thou there, boy?\n\nAnd for the most part, himself doth advance\nWith much self-love, and more arrogance.\n\nTuc.\nGood again!\n\nAnd, but that I would not be thought a prater,\nI could tell you he were a translator.\nI know the authors from whence he has stole,\nAnd could trace him too, but that\nI understand them not full and whole.\n\nTuc.\nThat line is broke loose from all his fellows: chain him up\nshorter, do.\n\nThe best note I can give you to know him by,\nIs, that he keeps gallants' company;\nWhom I could wish, in time should him fear,\nLest after they buy repentance too dear.\nDEME. FANNIUS.\n\nTuc.\nWell said! This carries palm with it.\n\nHor.\nAnd why, thou motley gull, why should they fear!\nWhen hast thou known us wrong or tax a friend?\nI dare thy malice to betray it. Speak.\nNow thou curl'st up, thou poor and nasty snake,\nAnd shrink'st thy poisonous head into thy bosom:\nOut, viper! thou that eat'st thy parents, hence!\nRather, such speckled creatures, as thyself,\nShould be eschew'd, and shunn'd; such as will bite\nAnd gnaw their absent friends, not cure their fame;\nCatch at the loosest laughters, and affect\nTo be thought jesters; such as can devise\nThings never seen, or head, t'impair men's names,\nAnd gratify their credulous adversaries;\nWill carry tales, do basest offices,\nCherish divided fires, and still encrease\nNew flames, out of old embers; will reveal\nEach secret that's committed to their trust:\nThese be black slaves; Romans, take heed of these.\n\nTuc.\nThou twang'st right, little Horace: they be indeed a couple of\nchap-fall'n curs. Come, we of the bench, let's rise to the urn, and\ncondemn them quickly.\n\nVirg.\nBefore you go together, worthy Romans,\nWe are to tender our opinion;\nAnd give you those instructions, that may add\nUnto your even judgment in the cause:\nWhich thus we do commence. First, you must know,\nThat where there is a true and perfect merit,\nThere can be no dejection; and the scorn\nOf humble baseness, oftentimes so works\nIn a high soul, upon the grosser spirit,\nThat to his bleared and offended sense,\nThere seems a hideous fault blazed in the object;\nWhen only the disease is in his eyes.\nHere-hence it comes our Horace now stands tax'd\nOf impudence, self-love, and arrogance,\nBy those who share no merit in themselves;\nAnd therefore think his portion is as small.\nFor they, from their own guilt, assure their souls,\nIf they should confidently praise their works,\nIn them it would appear inflation:\nWhich, in a full and well digested man,\nCannot receive that foul abusive name,\nBut the fair title of erection.\nAnd, for his true use of translating men,\nIt still hath been a work of as much palm,\nIn clearest judgments, as to invent or make,\nHis sharpness,\u2014-that is most excusable;\nAs being forced out of a suffering virtue,\nOppressed with the license of the time:\u2014-\nAnd howsoever fools or jerking pedants,\nPlayers, or suchlike buffoon barking wits,\nMay with their beggarly and barren trash\nTickle base vulgar ears, in their despite;\nThis, like Jove's thunder, shall their pride control,\n\"The honest satire hath the happiest soul.\"\n\nNow, Romans, you have heard our thoughts;\nwithdraw when you please.\n\nTib.\nRemove the accused from the bar.\n\nTuc.\nWho holds the urn to us, ha? Fear nothing, I'll quit you, mine\nhonest pitiful stinkards; I'll do't.\n\nCris.\nCaptain, you shall eternally girt me to you, as I am\ngenerous.\n\nTuc.\nGo to.\n\nCaes.\nTibullus, let there be a case of vizards privately provided;\nwe have found a subject to bestow them on.\n\nTib.\nIt shall be done, Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nHere be words, Horace, able to bastinado a man's ears.\n\nHor. Ay.\nPlease it, great Caesar, I have pills about me,\nMixt with the whitest kind of hellebore,\nWould give him a light vomit, that should purge\nHis brain and stomach of those tumorous heats:\nMight I have leave to minister unto him.\n\nCaes.\nO, be his AEsculapius, gentle Horace!\nYou shall have leave, and he shall be your patient. Virgil,\nUse your authority, command him forth.\n\nVirg.\nCaesar is careful of your health, Crispinus;\nAnd hath himself chose a physician\nTo minister unto you: take his pills.\n\nHor.\nThey are somewhat bitter, sir, but very wholesome.\nTake yet another; so: stand by, they'll work anon.\n\nTib.\nRomans, return to your several seats: lictors, bring forward\nthe urn; and set the accused to the bar.\n\nTuc.\nQuickly, you whoreson egregious varlets; come forward. What!\nshall we sit all day upon you? You make no more haste now, than a\nbeggar upon pattens; or a physician to a patient that has no money,\nyou pilchers.\n\nTib.\nRufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your\nhands. You have, according to the Roman custom, put yourselves upon trial to the urn, for divers and sundry calumnies, whereof you\nhave, before this time, been indicted, and are now presently\narraigned: prepare yourselves to hearken to the verdict of your\ntryers. Caius Cilnius Mecaenas pronounceth you, by this\nhand-writing, guilty. Cornelius Gallus, guilty. Pantilius Tucca\u2014\n\nTuc.\nParcel-guilty, I.\n\nDem.\nHe means himself; for it was he indeed\nSuborn'd us to the calumny.\n\nTuc.\nI, you whoreson cantharides! was it I?\n\nDem.\nI appeal to your conscience, captain.\n\nTib.\nThen you confess it now?\n\nDem.\nI do, and crave the mercy of the court.\n\nTib.\nWhat saith Crispinus?\n\nCris.\nO, the captain, the captain\u2014-\n\nBor.\nMy physic begins to work with my patient, I see.\n\nVirg.\nCaptain, stand forth and answer.\n\nTuc.\nHold thy peace, poet praetor: I appeal from thee to Caesar, I.\nDo me right, royal Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nMarry, and I will, sir.\u2014-Lictors, gag him; do.\nAnd put a case of vizards o'er his head,\nThat he may look bifronted, as he speaks.\n\nTuc.\nGods and fiends! Caesar! thou wilt not, Caesar, wilt thou?\nAway, you whoreson vultures; away. You think I am a dead corps now, because Caesar is disposed to jest with a man of mark, or so.

These, or such,\nWhether of malice, or of ignorance,\nOr itch t' have me their adversary, I know not,\nOr all these mixt; but sure I am, three years\nThey did provoke me with their petulant styles\nOn every stage: and I at last unwilling,\nBut weary, I confess, of so much trouble,\nThought I would try if shame could win upon 'em,'\nAnd therefore chose Augustus Caesar's times,\nWhen wit and area were at their height in Rome,\nTo shew that Virgil, Horace, and the rest\nOf those great master-spirits, did not want\nDetractors then, or practicers against them:\nAnd by this line, although no parallel,\nI hoped at last they would sit down and blush;\nBut nothing I could find more contrary.\nAnd though the impudence of flies be great,\nYet this hath so provok'd the angry wasps,\nOr, as you said, of the next nest, the hornets,\nThat they fly buzzing, mad, about my nostrils,\nAnd, like so many screaming grasshoppers\nHeld by the wings, fill every ear with noise.\nAnd what? those former calumnies you mention'd.\nFirst, of the law: indeed I brought in Ovid\nChid by his angry father for neglecting\nThe study of their laws for poetry:\nAnd I am warranted by his own words:\n\nSaepe pater dixit, studium quid inutile tentas!\nMaeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes.\n\nAnd in far harsher terms elsewhere, as these:\n\nNon me verbosas leges ediscere, non me\nIngrato voces prostituisse foro.\n\nBut how this should relate unto our laws,\nOr the just ministers, with least abuse,\nI reverence both too much to understand!\nThen, for the captain, I will only speak\nAn epigram I here have made: it is\n\nUNTO TRUE SOLDIERS.\nThat's the lemma: mark it.\nStrength of my country, whilst I bring to view\nSuch: as are miss-call'd captains, and wrong you,\nAnd your high names; I do desire, that thence,\nBe nor put on you, nor you take offence:\nI swear by your true friend, my muse, I love\nYour great profession which I once did prove;\nAnd did not shame it with my actions then,\nNo more than I dare now do with my pen.\nHe that not trusts me, having vowed thus much,\nBut's angry for the captain, still: is such.\nNow for the players, it is true, I tax'd them,\nAnd yet but some; and those so sparingly,\nAs all the rest might have sat still unquestion'd,\nHad they but had the wit or conscience\nTo think well of themselves. But impotent, they\nThought each man's vice belong'd to their whole tribe;\nAnd much good do't them! What they have done 'gainst me,\nI am not moved with: if it gave them meat,\nOr got them clothes, 'tis well; that was their end.\nOnly amongst them, I am sorry for\nSome better natures, by the rest so drawn,\nTo run in that vile line.\n\nPol.\nAnd is this all!\nWill you not answer then the libels?\n\nAut.\nNo.\n\nPol.\nNor the Untrussers?\n\nAut.\nNeither.\n\nPol.\nY'are undone then.\n\nAut.\nWith whom?\n\nPol.\nThe world.\n\nAut.\nThe bawd!\n\nPol.\nIt will be taken\nTo be stupidity or tameness in you.\n\nAut.\nBut they that have incensed me, can in soul\nAcquit me of that guilt. They know I dare\nTo spurn or baffle them, or squirt their eyes\nWith ink or urine; or I could do worse,\nArm'd with Archilochus' fury, write Iambics,\nShould make the desperate lashers hang themselves;\nRhime them to death, as they do Irish rats\nIn drumming tunes. Or, living, I could stamp\nTheir foreheads with those deep and public brands,\nThat the whole company of barber-surgeon a\nShould not take off with all their art and plasters.\nAnd these my prints should last, still to be read\nIn their pale fronts; when, what they write 'gainst me\nShall, like a figure drawn in water, fleet,\nAnd the poor wretched papers be employed\nTo clothe tobacco, or some cheaper drug:\nThis I could do, and make them infamous.\nBut, to what end? when their own deeds have mark'd 'em;\nAnd that I know, within his guilty breast\nEach slanderer bears a whip that shall torment him\nWorse than a million of these temporal plagues:\nWhich to pursue, were but a feminine humour,\nAnd far beneath the dignity of man.\n\nNas.\n'Tis true; for to revenge their injuries,\nWere to confess you felt them. Let them go,\nAnd use the treasure of the fool, their tongues,\nWho makes his gain, by speaking worst of beat.\n\nPol.\nO, but they lay particular imputations\u2014\n\nAut.\nAs what?\n\nPol.\nThat all your writing is mere railing.\n\nAut.\nHa?\nIf all the salt in the old comedy\nShould be so censured, or the sharper wit\nOf the bold satire termed scolding rage,\nWhat age could then compare with those for buffoons?\nWhat should be said of Aristophanes,\nPersius, or Juvenal, whose names we now\nSo glorify in schools, at least pretend it?\u2014-\nHave they no other?\n\nPol.\nYes; they say you are slow,\nAnd scarce bring forth a play a year.\n\nAut.\n'Tis true.\nI would they could not say that I did that!\nThere' s all the joy that I take in their trade,\nUnless such scribes as these might be proscribed\nTh' abused theatres. They would think it strange, now,\nA man should take but colts-foot for one day,\nAnd, between whiles, spit out a better poem\nThan e'er the master of art, or giver of wit,\nTheir belly, made. Yet, this is possible,\nIf a free mind had but the patience,\nTo think so much together and so vile.\nBut that these base and beggarly conceits\nShould carry it, by the multitude of voices,\nAgainst the most abstracted work, opposed\nTo the stuff'd nostrils of the drunken rout!\nO, this would make a learn'd and liberal soul\nTo rive his stained quill up to the back,\nAnd damn his long-watch'd labours to the fire,\nThings that were born when none but the still night\nAnd his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes,\nWere not his own free merit a more crown\nUnto his travails than their reeling claps.\nThis 'tis that strikes me silent, seals my lips,\nAnd apts me rather to sleep out my time,\nThan I would waste it in contemned strifes\nWith these vile Ibides, these unclean birds,\nThat make their mouths their clysters, and still purge\nFrom their hot entrails. But I leave the monsters\nTo their own fate. And, since the Comic Muse\nHath proved so ominous to me, I will try\nIf TRAGEDY have a more kind aspect;\nHer favours in my next I will pursue,\nWhere, if I prove the pleasure but of one,\nSo he judicious be, he shall be alone\nA theatre unto me; Once I'll say\nTo strike the ear of time in those fresh strains,\nAs shall, beside the cunning of their ground,\nGive cause to some of wonder, some despite,\nAnd more despair, to imitate their sound.\nI, that spend half my nights, and all my days,\nHere in a cell, to get a dark paleface,\nTo come forth worth the ivy or the bays,\nAnd in this age can hope no other grace\u2014-\nLeave me! There's something come into my thought,\nThat must and shall be sung high and aloof,\nSafe from the wolfs black jaw, and the dun ass's hoof\n\nNas.\nI reverence these raptures, and obey them.\n\n\n[The scene closes\u2014-\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GLOSSARY\n\nABATE, cast down, subdue.\n\nABHORRING, repugnant (to), at variance.\n\nABJECT, base, degraded thing, outcast.\n\nABRASE, smooth, blank.\n\nABSOLUTE(LY), faultless(ly).\n\nABSTRACTED, abstract, abstruse.\n\nABUSE, deceive, insult, dishonour, make ill use of.\n\nACATER, caterer.\n\nACATES, cates.\n\nACCEPTIVE, willing, ready to accept, receive.\n\nACCOMMODATE, fit, befitting.

Every word uttered by the maids upstairs made her jump; disturbed by all their running about, she kept asking herself what they could be doing. In other words, we had moved. Certainly the servants had made no less noise in the attics of our old home; but she knew them, she had made of their comings and goings familiar events. Now she faced even silence with a strained attention. And as our new neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to which we had hitherto looked had been noisy, the song (distinct at a distance, when it was still quite faint, like an orchestralmotif) of a passer-by brought tears to the eyes of a Fran\u00e7oise in exile. And so if I had been tempted to laugh at her in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was \u2018so well respected on all sides\u2019 and had packed her trunks with tears, according to the Use of Combray, declaring superior to all possible houses that which had been ours, on the other hand I, who found it as hard to assimilate new as I found it easy to abandon old conditions, I felt myself drawn towards our old servant when I saw that this installation of herself in a building where she had not received from the hall-porter, who did not yet know us, the marks of respect necessary to her moral wellbeing, had brought her positively to the verge of dissolution. She alone could understand what I was feeling; certainly her young footman was not the person to do so; for him, who was as unlike the Combray type as it was possible to conceive, packing up, moving, living in another district, were all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of one\u2019s surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had actually travelled; he thought he was in the country; and a cold in the head afforded him, as though he had been sitting in a draughty railway carriage, the delicious sensation of having seen the world; at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so smart a place, having always longed to be with people who travelled a lot. And so, without giving him a thought, I went straight to Fran\u00e7oise, who, in return for my having laughed at her tears over a removal which had left me cold, now shewed an icy indifference to my sorrow, but because she shared it. The \u2018sensibility\u2019 claimed by neurotic people is matched by their egotism; they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in themselves. Fran\u00e7oise, who would not allow the least of her own ailments to pass unnoticed, if I were in pain would turn her head from me so that I should not have the satisfaction of seeing my sufferings pitied, or so much as observed. It was the same as soon as I tried to speak to her about our new house. Moreover, having been obliged, a day or two later, to return to the house we had just left, to retrieve some clothes which had been overlooked in our removal, while I, as a result of it, had still a \u2018temperature,\u2019 and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a long trunk which my eyes had still to digest, Fran\u00e7oise, with true feminine inconstancy, came back saying that she had really thought she would stifle on our old boulevard, it was so stuffy, that she had found it quite a day\u2019s journey to get there, that never had she seen such stairs, that she would not go back to live there for a king\u2019s ransom, not if you were to offer her millions \u2014 a pure hypothesis \u2014 and that everything (everything, that is to say, to do with the kitchen and \u2018usual offices\u2019) was much better fitted up in the new house. Which, it is high time now that the reader should be told \u2014 and told also that we had moved into it because my grandmother, not having been at all well (though we took care to keep this reason from her), was in need of better air \u2014 was a flat forming part of the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the age when a Name, offering us an image of the unknowable which we have poured into its mould, while at the same moment it connotes for us also an existing place, forces us accordingly to identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name, it is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality, as do allegorical paintings, it is not only the physical universe which they pattern with differences, people with marvels, there is the social universe also; and so every historic house, in town or country, has its lady or its fairy, as every forest has its spirit, as there is a nymph for every stream. Sometimes, hidden in the heart of its name, the fairy is transformed to suit the life of our imagination by which she lives; thus it was that the atmosphere in which Mme. de Guermantes existed in me, after having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window, began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the real person to whom her name corresponds, for that person the name then begins to reflect, and she has in her nothing of the fairy; the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person, but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and with her the name, as happened to the family of Lusignan, which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy M\u00e9lusine should disappear. Then the Name, beneath our successive \u2018restorations\u2019 of which we may end by finding, as their original, the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to meet, is nothing more than the mere photograph, for identification, to which we refer in order to decide whether we know, whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in the street. But let a sensation from a bygone year \u2014 like those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the manner of the various artists who have sung or played into them \u2014 enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears, then, while the name itself has apparently not changed, we feel the distance that separates the dreams which at different times its same syllables have meant to us. For a moment, from the clear echo of its warbling in some distant spring, we can extract, as from the little tubes which we use in painting, the exact, forgotten, mysterious, fresh tint of the days which we had believed ourself to be recalling, when, like a bad painter, we were giving to the whole of our past, spread out on the same canvas, the tones, conventional and all alike, of our unprompted memory. Whereas on the contrary, each of the moments that composed it employed, for an original creation, in a matchless harmony, the colour of those days which we no longer know, and which, for that matter, will still suddenly enrapture me if by any chance the name \u2018Guermantes,\u2019 resuming for a moment, after all these years, the sound, so different from its sound to-day, which it had for me on the day of Mile. Percepied\u2019s marriage, brings back to me that mauve \u2014 so delicate, almost too bright, too new \u2014 with which the billowy scarf of the young Duchess glowed, and, like two periwinkle flowers, growing beyond reach and blossoming now again, her two eyes, sunlit with an azure smile. And the name Guermantes of those days is also like one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen, or some such gas; when I come to explode it, to make it emit what it contains, I breathe the air of the Combray of that year, of that day, mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by the wind from the corner of the square, harbinger of rain, which now sent the sun packing, now let him spread himself over the red woollen carpet to the sacristy, steeping it in a bright geranium scarlet, with that, so to speak, Wagnerian harmony in its gaiety which makes the wedding service always impressive. But even apart from rare moments such as these, in which suddenly we feel the original entity quiver and resume its form, carve itself out of the syllables now soundless, dead; if, in the giddy rush of daily life, in which they serve only the most practical purposes, names have lost all their colour, like a prismatic top that spins too quickly and seems only grey, when, on the other hand, in our musings we reflect, we seek, so as to return to the past, to slacken, to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne alcng, gradually we see once more appear, side by side, but entirely distinct from one another, the tints which in the course of our existence have been successively presented to us by a single name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What form was assumed in my mind by this name Guermantes when my first nurse \u2014 knowing no more, probably, than I know to-day in whose honour it had been composed \u2014 sang me to sleep with that old ditty, Gloire \u00e0 la Marquise de Guermantes, or when, some years later, the veteran Mar\u00e9chal de Guermantes, making my nursery-maid\u2019s bosom swell with pride, stopped in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es to remark: \u201cA fine child that!\u201d and gave me a chocolate drop from his comfit-box, I cannot, of course, now say. Those years of my earliest childhood are no longer a part of myself; they are external to me; I can learn nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we were born \u2014 from the accounts given me by other people. But more recently I find in the period of that name\u2019s occupation of me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively assumed; the earliest were the most beautiful; gradually my musings, forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable, established themselves anew in one slightly less advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther. And, with Mme. de Guermantes, was transformed simultaneously her dwelling, itself also the offspring of that name, fertilised from year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and modulated the tone of my musings; that dwelling of hers reflected them in its very stones, which had turned to mirrors, like the surface of a cloud or of a lake. A dungeon keep without mass, no more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals, had given place \u2014 right at the end of that \u2018Guermantes way\u2019 along which, on so many summer afternoons, I retraced with my parents the course of the Vivonne \u2014 to that land of bubbling streams where the Duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned the walls of the neighbouring gardens; then it had been the ancient heritage, famous in song and story, from which the proud race of Guermantes, like a carved and mellow tower that traverses the ages, had risen already over France when the sky was still empty at those points where, later, were to rise Notre Dame of Paris and Notre Dame of Chartres, when on the summit of the hill of Laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised, like the Ark of the Deluge on the summit of Mount Ararat, crowded with Patriarchs and Judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of God were yet appeased, carrying with it the types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth, brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers, where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains of Champagne; when the traveller who left Beauvais at the close of day did not yet see, following him and turning with his road, outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky, the black, ribbed wings of the cathedral. It was, this \u2018Guermantes,\u2019 like the scene of a novel, an imaginary landscape which I could with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to discover, set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a sudden would become alive with heraldic details, within a few miles of a railway station; I recalled the names of the places round it as if they had been situated at the foot of Parnassus or of Helicon, and they seemed precious to me, as the physical conditions \u2014 in the realm of topographical science \u2014 required for the production of an unaccountable phenomenon. I saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the windows of Combray church; their quarters filled, century after century, with all the lordships which, by marriage or conquest, this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the corners of Germany, Italy and France; vast territories in the North, strong cities in the South, assembled there to group themselves in Guermantes, and, losing their material quality, to inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert, or castle triple-towered argent upon its azure field. I had heard of the famous tapestries of Guermantes, I could see them, mediaeval and blue, a trifle coarse, detach themselves like a floating cloud from the legendary, amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient forest in which Childebert went so often hunting; and this delicate, mysterious background of their lands, this vista of the ages, it seemed to me that, as effectively as by journeying to see them, I might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in contact for a moment in Paris with Mme. de Guermantes, the princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake, as if her face, her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves and streams, and the same secular peculiarities as the old customs recorded in her archives. But then I had met Saint-Loup; he had told me that the castle had borne the name of Guermantes only since the seventeenth century, when that family had acquired it. They had lived, until then, in the neighbourhood, but their title was not taken from those parts. The village of Guermantes had received its name from the castle round which it had been built, and so that it should not destroy the view from the castle, a servitude, still in force, traced the line of its streets and limited the height of its houses. As for the tapestries, they were by Boucher, bought in the nineteenth century by a Guermantes with a taste for the arts, and hung, interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which he himself had painted, in a hideous drawing-room upholstered in \u2018adrianople\u2019 and plush. By these revelations Saint-Loup had introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of Guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar of its walls. And so, in the heart of the name, was effaced the castle mirrored in its lake, and what now became apparent to me, surrounding Mme. de Guermantes as her dwelling, had been her house in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, limpid like its name, for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and blind its transparence. As the word church signifies not only the temple but the assembly of the faithful also, this H\u00f4tel de Guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the Duchess, but these intimates on whom I had never set eyes were for me only famous and poetic names, and knowing exclusively persons who themselves also were names only, did but enhance and protect the mystery of the Duchess by extending all round her a vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its circumference increased\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the parties which she gave, since I could not imagine the guests as having any bodies, any moustaches, any boots, as making any utterances that were commonplace, or even original in a human and rational way, this whirlpool of names, introducing less material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral ball, round that statuette in Dresden china which was Madame de Guermantes, kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a showcase. Then, after Saint-Loup had told me various anecdotes about his cousin\u2019s chaplain, her gardener, and the rest, the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes had become \u2014 as the Louvre might have been in days gone by \u2014 a kind of castle, surrounded, in the very heart of Paris, by its own domains, acquired by inheritance, by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived, over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges. But this last dwelling itself vanished when we had come to live beside Mme. de Villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by Mme. de Guermantes in a wing of the H\u00f4tel. It was one of those old town houses, a few of which are perhaps still to be found, in which the court of honour \u2014 whether they were alluvial deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy, or a legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were clustered round the overlord \u2014 is flanked by little shops and workrooms, a shoemaker\u2019s, for instance, or a tailor\u2019s, such as we see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such accretions; a porter who also does cobbling, keeps hens, grows flowers, and, at the far end, in the main building, a \u2018Comtesse\u2019 who, when she drives out in her old carriage and pair, flaunting on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the plot by the porter\u2019s lodge (with, by the coachman\u2019s side on the box, a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood), scatters vague little smiles and waves her hand in greeting to the porter\u2019s children and to such of her respectable fellow-tenants as may happen to be passing, who, to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride, seem all the same\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the house in which we had now come to live, the great lady at the end of the courtyard was a Duchess, smart and still quite young. She was, in fact, Mme. de Guermantes and, thanks to Fran\u00e7oise, I soon came to know all about her household. For the Guermantes (to whom Fran\u00e7oise regularly alluded as the people \u2018below,\u2019 or \u2018downstairs\u2019) were her constant preoccupation from the first thing in the morning when, as she did Mamma\u2019s hair, casting a forbidden, irresistible, furtive glance down into the courtyard, she would say: \u201cLook at that, now; a pair of holy Sisters; that\u2019ll be for downstairs, surely;\u201d or, \u201cOh! just look at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window; no need to ask where they came from, the Duke will have been out with his gun!\u201d\u2014 until the last thing at night when, if her ear, while she was putting out my night-things, caught a few notes of a song, she would conclude: \u201cThey\u2019re having company down below; gay doings, I\u2019ll be bound;\u201d whereupon, in her symmetrical face, beneath the arch of her now snow-white hair, a smile from her young days, sprightly but proper, would for a moment set each of her features in its place, arranging them in an intricate and special order, as though for a country-dance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the moment in the life of the Guermantes which excited the keenest interest in Fran\u00e7oise, gave her the most complete satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that at which, the two halves of the great gate having been thrust apart, the Duchess stepped into her carriage. It was generally a little while after our servants had finished the celebration of that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb, called their midday dinner, during which they were so far taboo that my father himself was not allowed to ring for them, knowing moreover that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth peal than to the first, and that the discourtesy would therefore have been a pure waste of time and trouble, though not without trouble in store for himself. For Fran\u00e7oise (who, in her old age, lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity) would without fail have presented him, for the rest of the day, with a face covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made visible \u2014 though by no means legible \u2014 to the outer world the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her dissatisfactions. She would enlarge upon them, too, in a running \u2018aside,\u2019 but not so that we could catch her words. She called this practice \u2014 which, she imagined, must be infuriating, \u2018mortifying\u2019 as she herself put it,\u2018vexing\u2019 to us \u2014\u2018saying low masses all the blessed day.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last rites accomplished, Fran\u00e7oise, who was at one and the same time, as in the primitive church, the celebrant and one of the faithful, helped herself to a final glass, undid the napkin from her throat, folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of watered wine and coffee, slipped it into its ring, turned a doleful eye to thank \u2018her\u2019 young footman who, to shew his zeal in her service, was saying: \u201cCome, ma\u2019am, a drop more of the grape; it\u2019s d\u2019licious to-day,\u201d and went straight across to the window, which she flung open, protesting that it was too hot to breathe in \u2018this wretched kitchen.\u2019 Dexterously casting, as she turned the latch and let in the fresh air, a glance of studied indifference into the courtyard below, she furtively elicited the conclusion that the Duchess was not ready yet to start, brooded for a moment with contemptuous, impassioned eyes over the waiting carriage, and, this meed of attention once paid to the things of the earth, raised them towards the heavens, whose purity she had already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of the sun; and let them rest on a corner of the roof, at the place where, every spring, there came and built, immediately over the chimney of my bedroom, a pair of pigeons like those she used to hear cooing from her kitchen at Combray\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Combray, Combray!\u201d she cried. And the almost singing tone in which she declaimed this invocation might, taken with the Arlesian purity of her features, have made the onlooker suspect her of a Southern origin and that the lost land which she was lamenting was no more, really, than a land of adoption. If so, he would have been wrong, for it seems that there is no province that has not its own South-country; do we not indeed constantly meet Savoyards and Bretons in whose speech we find all those pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are characteristic of the Southerner? \u201cAh, Combray, when shall I look on thee again, poor land! When shall I pass the blessed day among thy hawthorns, under our own poor lily-oaks, hearing the grasshoppers sing, and the Vivonne making a little noise like someone whispering, instead of that wretched bell from our young master, who can never stay still for half an hour on end without having me run the length of that wicked corridor. And even then he makes out I don\u2019t come quick enough; you\u2019d need to hear the bell ring before he has pulled it, and if you\u2019re a minute late, away he flies into the most towering rage. Alas, poor Combray; maybe I shall see thee only in death, when they drop me like a stone into the hollow of the tomb. And so, nevermore shall I smell thy lovely hawthorns, so white and all. But in the sleep of death I dare say I shall still hear those three peals of the bell which will have driven me to damnation in this world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the waistcoat-maker downstairs, the same who had so delighted my grandmother once, long ago, when she had gone to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis, and now occupied no less exalted a place in Franchise\u2019s affections. Having raised his head when he heard our window open, he had already been trying for some time to attract his neighbour\u2019s attention, in order to bid her good day. The coquetry of the young girl that Fran\u00e7oise had once been softened and refined for M. Jupien the querulous face of our old cook, dulled by age, ill-temper and the heat of the kitchen fire, and it was with a charming blend of reserve, familiarity and modesty that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoat-maker, but without making any audible response, for if she did infringe Mamma\u2019s orders by looking into the courtyard, she would never have dared to go the length of talking from the window, which would have been quite enough (according to her) to bring down on her \u2018a whole chapter\u2019 from the Mistress. She pointed to the waiting carriage, as who should say: \u201cA fine pair, eh!\u201d though what she actually muttered was: \u201cWhat an old rattle-trap!\u201d but principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer, putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having to shout:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou could have one too if you liked, as good as they have and better, I dare say, only you don\u2019t care for that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Franoise, after a modest, evasive signal of delight, the meaning of which was, more or less: \u201cTastes differ, you know; simplicity\u2019s the rule in this house,\u201d shut the window again in case Mamma should come in. These \u2018you\u2019 who might have had more horses than the Guermantes were ourselves, but Jupien was right in saying \u2018you\u2019 since, except for a few purely personal gratifications, such as, when she coughed all day long without ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her cold, that of pretending, with an irritating little titter, that she had not got a cold, like those plants that an animal to which they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches, eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the ultimate and easily assimilable residue, Fran\u00e7oise lived with us in full community; it was we who, with our virtues, our wealth, our style of living, must take on ourselves the task of concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was formed \u2014 with the addition of the recognised rights of freely practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the traditional custom, which included a mouthful of air at the window when the meal was finished, a certain amount of loitering in the street when she went out to do her marketing, and a holiday on Sundays when she paid a visit to her niece \u2014 the portion of happiness indispensable to her existence. And so it can be understood that Fran\u00e7oise might well have succumbed in those first days of our migration, a victim, in a house where my father\u2019s claims to distinction were not yet known, to a malady which she herself called \u2018wearying,\u2019 wearying in the active sense in which the word ennui is employed by Corneille, or in the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives because they are wearying for their girls or for their native villages. Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s wearying had soon been cured by none other than Jupien, for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen, indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to keep a carriage. \u201cVery good class, those Juliens,\u201d (for Fran\u00e7oise readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already familiar) \u201cvery worthy people; you can see it written on their faces.\u201d Jupien was in fact able to understand, and to inform the world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no wish for one. This new friend of Fran\u00e7oise was very little at home, having obtained a post in one of the Government offices. A waistcoat-maker first of all, with the \u2018chit of a girl\u2019 whom my grandmother had taken for his daughter, he had lost all interest in the exercise of that calling after his assistant (who, when still little more than a child, had shewn great skill in darning a torn skirt, that day when my grandmother had gone to call on Mme. de Villeparisis) had turned to ladies\u2019 fashions and become a seamstress. A prentice hand, to begin with, in a dressmaker\u2019s workroom, set to stitch a seam, to fasten a flounce, to sew on a button or to press a crease, to fix a waistband with hooks and eyes, she had quickly risen to be second and then chief assistant, and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies of fashion now worked at home, that is to say in our courtyard, generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom, whom she had taken on as apprentices. After this, Jupien\u2019s presence in the place had ceased to matter. No doubt the little girl (a big girl by this time) had often to cut out waistcoats still. But with her friends to assist her she needed no one besides. And so Jupien, her uncle, had sought employment outside. He was free at first to return home at midday, then, when he had definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun by being, not before dinner-time. His appointment to the \u2018regular establishment\u2019 was, fortunately, not announced until some weeks after our arrival, so that his courtesy could be brought to bear on her long enough to help Fran\u00e7oise to pass through the first, most difficult phase without undue suffering. At the same time, and without underrating his value to Fran\u00e7oise as, so to speak, a sedative during the period of transition, I am bound to say that my first impression of Jupien had been far from favourable. At a little distance, entirely ruining the effect that his plump cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced, his eyes, brimming with a compassionate, mournful, dreamy gaze, led one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a great bereavement. Not only was he nothing of the sort, but as soon as he opened his mouth (and his speech, by the way, was perfect) he was quite markedly cynical and cold. There resulted from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which was not attractive, and by which he had himself the air of being made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at a party where everyone else is in evening dress, or as a commoner who having to speak to a Royal Personage does not know exactly how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by cutting down his remarks to almost nothing. Jupien\u2019s (here the comparison ends) were, on the contrary, charming. Indeed, corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his eyes (which one ceased to notice when one came to know him), I soon discerned in him a rare intellect, and one of the most spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come across, in the sense that, probably without education, he possessed or had assimilated, with the help only of a few books skimmed in early life, the most ingenious turns of speech. The most gifted people that I had known had died young. And so I was convinced that Jupien\u2019s life would soon be cut short. Kindness was among his qualities, and pity, the most delicate and the most generous feelings for others. But his part in the life of Fran\u00e7oise had soon ceased to be indispensable. She had learned to put up with understudies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a parcel or message, while seeming to pay no attention and merely pointing vaguely to an empty chair, Fran\u00e7oise so skilfully put to the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen, while he waited for Mamma\u2019s answer, that it was very seldom that the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon his memory the conviction that, if we \u2018did not have\u2019 any particular thing, it was because we had \u2018no wish\u2019 for it. If she made such a point of other people\u2019s knowing that we \u2018had money\u2019 (for she knew nothing of what Saint-Loup used to call partitive articles, and said simply \u2018have money,\u2019 \u2018fetch water\u2019), of their realising that we were rich, it was not because riches with nothing else besides, riches without virtue, were in her eyes the supreme good in life; but virtue without riches was not her ideal either. Riches were for her, so to speak, a necessary condition of virtue, failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and charm. She distinguished so little between them that she had come in time to invest each with the other\u2019s attributes, to expect some material comfort from virtue, to discover something edifying in riches\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as she had shut the window again, which she did quickly \u2014 otherwise Mamma would, it appeared, have heaped on her \u2018every conceivable insult\u2019\u2014 Fran\u00e7oise began with many groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are some Guermantes who stay in the Rue de la Chaise,\u201d began my father\u2019s valet; \u201cI had a friend who used to be with them; he was their second coachman. And I know a fellow, not my old pal, but his brother-in-law, who did his time in the Army with one of the Baron de Guermantes\u2019s stud grooms. Does your mother know you\u2019re out?\u201d added the valet, who was in the habit, just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season, of peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, with the tired eyes of an ageing woman, eyes which moreover saw everything from Combray, in a hazy distance, made out not the witticism that underlay the words, but that there must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker. She smiled at him, therefore, with an air of benevolent bewilderment, as who should say: \u201cAlways the same, that Victor!\u201d And she was genuinely pleased, knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was akin \u2014 if remotely \u2014 to those reputable social pleasures for which, in every class of society, people make haste to dress themselves in their best and run the risk of catching cold. Furthermore, she believed the valet to be a friend after her own heart, for he never left off denouncing, with fierce indignation, the appalling measures which the Republic was about to enforce against the clergy. Fran\u00e7oise had not yet learned that our cruellest adversaries are not those who contradict and try to convince us, but those who magnify or invent reports which may make us unhappy, taking care not to include any appearance of justification, which might lessen our discomfort, and perhaps give us some slight regard for a party which they make a point of displaying to us, to complete our torment, as being at once terrible and triumphant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess must be connected with all that lot,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, bringing the conversation back to the Guermantes of the Rue de la Chaise, as one plays a piece over again from the andante. \u201cI can\u2019t recall who it was told me that one of them had married a cousin of the Duke. It\u2019s the same kindred, anyway. Ay, they\u2019re a great family, the Guermantes!\u201d she added, in a tone of respect founding the greatness of the family at once on the number of its branches and the brilliance of its connexions, as Pascal founds the truth of Religion on Reason and on the Authority of the Scriptures. For since there was but the single word \u2018great\u2019 to express both meanings, it seemed to her that they formed a single idea, her vocabulary, like cut stones sometimes, shewing thus on certain of its facets a flaw which projected a ray of darkness into the recesses of her mind. \u201cI wonder now if it wouldn\u2019t be them that have their castle at Guermantes, not a score of miles from Combray; then they must be kin to their cousin at Algiers, too.\u201d My mother and I long asked ourselves who this cousin at Algiers could be until finally we discovered that Fran\u00e7oise meant by the name \u2018Algiers\u2019 the town of Angers. What is far off may be more familiar to us than what is quite near. Fran\u00e7oise, who knew the name \u2018Algiers\u2019 from some particularly unpleasant dates that used to be given us at the New Year, had never heard of Angers. Her language, like the French language itself, and especially that of place-names, was thickly strewn with errors. \u201cI meant to talk to their butler about it. What is it again you call him?\u201d she interrupted herself as though putting a formal question as to the correct procedure, which she went on to answer with: \u201cOh, of course, it\u2019s Antoine you call him!\u201d as though Antoine had been a title. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who could tell me, but he\u2019s quite the gentleman, he is, a great scholar, you\u2019d say they\u2019d cut his tongue out, or that he\u2019d forgotten to learn to speak. He makes no response when you talk to him,\u201d went on Fran\u00e7oise, who used \u2018make response\u2019 in the same sense as Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, quite untruthfully, \u201cso long as I know what\u2019s boiling in my pot, I don\u2019t bother my head about what\u2019s in other people\u2019s. Whatever he is, he\u2019s not a Catholic. Besides, he\u2019s not a courageous man.\u201d (This criticism might have led one to suppose that Fran\u00e7oise had changed her mind about physical bravery which, according to her, in Combray days, lowered men to the level of wild beasts. But it was not so. \u2018Courageous\u2019 meant simply a hard worker.) \u201cThey do say, too, that he\u2019s thievish as a magpie, but it doesn\u2019t do to believe all one hears. The servants never stay long there because of the lodge; the porters are jealous and set the Duchess against them. But it\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019s a real twister, that Antoine, and his Antoinesse is no better,\u201d concluded Fran\u00e7oise, who, in furnishing the name \u2018Antoine\u2019 with a feminine ending that would designate the butler\u2019s wife, was inspired, no doubt, in her act of word-formation by an unconscious memory of the words chanoine and chanoinesse. If so, she was not far wrong. There is still a street near Notre-Dame called Rue Chanoinesse, a name which must have been given to it (since it was never inhabited by any but male Canons) by those Frenchmen of olden days of whom Fran\u00e7oise was, properly speaking, the contemporary. She proceeded, moreover, at once to furnish another example of this way of forming feminine endings, for she went on: \u201cBut one thing sure and certain is that it\u2019s the Duchess that has Guermantes Castle. And it\u2019s she that is the Lady Mayoress down in those parts. That\u2019s always something.\u201d\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can well believe that it is something,\u201d came with conviction from the footman, who had not detected the irony\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think so, do you, my boy, you think it\u2019s something? Why, for folk like them to be Mayor and Mayoress, it\u2019s just thank you for nothing. Ah, if it was mine, that Guermantes Castle, you wouldn\u2019t see me setting foot in Paris, I can tell you. I\u2019m sure a family who\u2019ve got something to go on with, like Monsieur and Madame here, must have queer ideas to stay on in this wretched town rather than get away down to Combray the moment they\u2019re free to start, and no one hindering them. Why do they put off retiring? They\u2019ve got everything they want. Why wait till they\u2019re dead? Ah, if I had only a crust of dry bread to eat and a faggot to keep me warm in winter, a fine time I\u2019d have of it at home in my brother\u2019s poor old house at Combray. Down there you do feel you\u2019re alive; you haven\u2019t all these houses stuck up in front of you, there is so little noise at night-time, you can hear the frogs singing five miles off and more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat must indeed be fine!\u201d exclaimed the young footman with enthusiasm, as though this last attraction had been as peculiar to Combray as the gondola is to Venice. A more recent arrival in the household than my father\u2019s valet, he used to talk to Fran\u00e7oise about things which might interest not himself so much as her. And Fran\u00e7oise, whose face wrinkled up in disgust when she was treated as a mere cook, had for the young footman, who referred to her always as the \u2018housekeeper,\u2019 that peculiar tenderness which Princes not of the blood royal feel towards the well-meaning young men who dignify them with a \u2018Highness.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt any rate one knows what one\u2019s about, there, and what time of year it is. It isn\u2019t like here where you won\u2019t find one wretched buttercup flowering at holy Easter any more than you would at Christmas, and I can\u2019t hear so much as the tiniest ang\u00e9lus ring when I lift my old bones out of bed in the morning. Down there, you can hear every hour; there\u2019s only the one poor bell, but you say to yourself: \u2018My brother will be coming in from the field now,\u2019 and you watch the daylight fade, and the bell rings to bless the fruits of the earth, and you have time to take a turn before you light the lamp. But here it\u2019s daytime and it\u2019s nighttime, and you go to bed, and you can\u2019t say any more than the dumb beasts what you\u2019ve been about all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI gather M\u00e9s\u00e9glise is a fine place, too, Madame,\u201d broke in the young footman, who found that the conversation was becoming a little too abstract for his liking, and happened to remember having heard us, at table, mention M\u00e9s\u00e9glise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, is it?\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise with the broad smile which one could always bring to her lips by uttering any of those names \u2014 M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, Combray, Tansonville. They were so intimate a part of her life that she felt, on meeting them outside it, on hearing them used in conversation, a hilarity more or less akin to that which a professor excites in his class by making an allusion to some contemporary personage whose name the students had never supposed could possibly greet their ears from the height of the academic chair. Her pleasure arose also from the feeling that these places were something to her which they were not for the rest of the world, old companions with whom one has shared many delights; and she smiled at them as if she found in them something witty, because she did find there a great part of herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, you may well say so, son, it is a pretty enough place is M\u00e9s\u00e9glise;\u201d she went on with a tinkling laugh, \u201cbut how did you ever come to hear tell of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow did I hear of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise? But it\u2019s a well-known place; people have told me about it \u2014 yes, over and over again,\u201d he assured her with that criminal inexactitude of the informer who, whenever we attempt to form an impartial estimate of the importance that a thing which matters to us may have for other people, makes it impossible for us to succeed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can tell you, it\u2019s better down there, under the cherry trees, than standing before the fire all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to them even of Eulalie as a good person. For since Eulalie\u2019s death Fran\u00e7oise had completely forgotten that she had loved her as little in her lifetime as she loved every one whose cupboard was bare, who was dying of hunger, and after that came, like a good for nothing, thanks to the bounty of the rich, to \u2018put on airs.\u2019 It no longer pained her that Eulalie had so skilfully managed, Sunday after Sunday, to secure her \u2018trifle\u2019 from my aunt. As for the latter, Fran\u00e7oise never left off singing her praises\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut it was at Combray, surely, that you used to be, with a cousin of Madame?\u201d asked the young footman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, with Mme. Octave \u2014 oh, a dear, good, holy woman, my poor friends, and a house where there was always enough and to spare, and all of the very best, a good woman, you may well say, who had no pity on the partridges, or the pheasants, or anything; you might turn up five to dinner or six, it was never the meat that was lacking, and of the first quality too, and white wine, and red wine, and everything you could wish.\u201d (Fran\u00e7oise used the word \u2018pity\u2019 in the sense given it by Labruy\u00e8re.) \u201cIt was she that paid the damages, always, even if the family stayed for months and years.\u201d (This reflection was not really a slur upon us, for Fran\u00e7oise belonged to an epoch when the words \u2018damages\u2019 was not restricted to a legal use and meant simply expense.) \u201cAh, I can tell you, people didn\u2019t go empty away from that house. As his reverence the Cur\u00e9 has told us, many\u2019s the time, if there ever was a woman who could count on going straight before the Throne of God, it was she. Poor Madame, I can hear her saying now, in the little voice she had: \u2018You know, Fran\u00e7oise, I can eat nothing myself, but I want it all to be just as nice for the others as if I could.\u2019 They weren\u2019t for her, the victuals, you may be quite sure. If you\u2019d only seen her, she weighed no more than a bag of cherries; there wasn\u2019t that much of her. She would never listen to a word I said, she would never send for the doctor. Ah, it wasn\u2019t in that house that you\u2019d have to gobble down your dinner. She liked her servants to be fed properly. Here, it\u2019s been just the same again to-day; we haven\u2019t had time for so much as to break a crust of bread; everything goes like ducks and drakes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What annoyed her more than anything were the rusks of pulled bread that my father used to eat. She was convinced that he had them simply to give himself airs and to keep her \u2018dancing.\u2019 \u201cI can tell you frankly,\u201d the young footman assured her, \u201cthat I never saw the like.\u201d He said it as if he had seen everything, and as if in him the range of a millennial experience extended over all countries and their customs, among which was not anywhere to be found a custom of eating pulled bread. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d the butler muttered, \u201cbut that will all be changed; the men are going on strike in Canada, and the Minister told Monsieur the other evening that he\u2019s clearing two hundred thousand francs out of it.\u201d There was no note of censure in his tone, not that he was not himself entirely honest, but since he regarded all politicians as unsound the crime of peculation seemed to him less serious than the pettiest larceny. He did not even stop to ask himself whether he had heard this historic utterance aright, and was not struck by the improbability that such a thing would have been admitted by the guilty party himself to my father without my father\u2019s immediately turning him out of the house. But the philosophy of Combray made it impossible for Fran\u00e7oise to expect that the strikes in Canada could have any repercussion on the use of pulled bread. \u201cSo long as the world goes round, look, there\u2019ll be masters to keep us on the trot, and servants to do their bidding.\u201d In disproof of this theory of perpetual motion, for the last quarter of an hour my mother (who probably did not employ the same measures of time as Fran\u00e7oise in reckoning the duration of the latter\u2019s dinner) had been saying:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat on earth can they be doing? They\u2019ve been at least two hours at their dinner.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she rang timidly three or four times. Fran\u00e7oise, \u2018her\u2019 footman, the butler, heard the bell ring, not as a summons to themselves, and with no thought of answering it, but rather like the first sounds of the instruments being tuned when the next part of a concert is just going to begin, and one knows that there will be only a few minutes more of interval. And so, when the peals were repeated and became more urgent, our servants began to pay attention, and, judging that they had not much time left and that the resumption of work was at hand, at a peal somewhat louder than the rest gave a collective sigh and went their several ways, the footman slipping downstairs to smoke a cigarette outside the door, Fran\u00e7oise, after a string of reflexions on ourselves, such as: \u201cThey\u2019ve got the jumps to-day, surely,\u201d going up to put her things tidy in her attic, while the butler, having supplied himself first with note-paper from my bedroom, polished off the arrears of his private correspondence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the apparent stiffness of their butler, Fran\u00e7oise had been in a position, from the first, to inform me that the Guermantes occupied their mansion by virtue not of an immemorial right but of a quite recent tenancy, and that the garden over which it looked on the side that I did not know was quite small and just like all the gardens along the street; and I realised at length that there were not to be seen there pit and gallows or fortified mill, secret chamber, pillared dovecot, manorial bakehouse or tithe-barn, dungeon or drawbridge, or fixed bridge either for that matter, any more than toll-houses or pinnacles, charters, muniments, ramparts or commemorative mounds. But just as Elstir, when the bay of Balbec, losing its mystery, had become for me simply a portion, interchangeable with any other, of the total quantity of salt water distributed over the earth\u2019s surface, had suddenly restored to it a personality of its own by telling me that it was the gulf of opal, painted by Whistler in his \u2018Harmonies in Blue and Silver,\u2019 so the name Guermantes had seen perish under the strokes of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s hammer the last of the dwellings that had issued from its syllables when one day an old friend of my father said to us, speaking of the Duchess: \u201cShe is the first lady in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; hers is the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\u201d No doubt the most exclusive drawing-room, the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain was little or nothing after all those other mansions of which in turn I had dreamed. And yet in this one too (and it was to be the last of the series), there was something, however humble, quite apart from its material components, a secret differentiation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it became all the more essential that I should be able to explore in the drawing-room of Mme. de Guermantes, among her friends, the mystery of her name, since I did not find it in her person when I saw her leave the house in the morning on foot, or in the afternoon in her carriage. Once before, indeed, in the church at Combray, she had appeared to me in the blinding flash of a transfiguration, with cheeks irreducible to, impenetrable by, the colour of the name Guermantes and of afternoons on the banks of the Vivonne, taking the place of my shattered dream like a swan or willow into which has been changed a god or nymph, and which henceforward, subjected to natural laws, will glide over the water or be shaken by the wind. And yet, when that radiance had vanished, hardly had I lost sight of it before it formed itself again, like the green and rosy afterglow of sunset after the sweep of the oar has broken it, and in the solitude of my thoughts the name had quickly appropriated to itself my impression of the face. But now, frequently, I saw her at her window, in the courtyard, in the street, and for myself at least if I did not succeed in integrating in her the name Guermantes, I cast the blame on the impotence of my mind to accomplish the whole act that I demanded of it; but she, our neighbour, she seemed to make the same error, nay more to make it without discomfiture, without any of my scruples, without even suspecting that it was an error. Thus Mme. de Guermantes shewed in her dresses the same anxiety to follow the fashions as if, believing herself to have become simply a woman like all the rest, she had aspired to that elegance in her attire in which other ordinary women might equal and perhaps surpass her; I had seen her in the street gaze admiringly at a well-dressed actress; and in the morning, before she sallied forth on foot, as if the opinion of the passers-by, whose vulgarity she accentuated by parading familiarly through their midst her inaccessible life, could be a tribunal competent to judge her, I would see her before the glass playing, with a conviction free from all pretence or irony, with passion, with ill-humour, with conceit, like a queen who has consented to appear as a servant-girl in theatricals at court, this part, so unworthy of her, of a fashionable woman; and in this mythological oblivion of her natural grandeur, she looked to see whether her veil was hanging properly, smoothed her cuffs, straightened her cloak, as the celestial swan performs all the movements natural to his animal species, keeps his eyes painted on either side of his beak without putting into them any glint of life, and darts suddenly after a bud or an umbrella, as a swan would, without remembering that he is a god. But as the traveller, disappointed by the first appearance of a strange town, reminds himself that he will doubtless succeed in penetrating its charm if he visits its museums and galleries, so I assured myself that, had I been given the right of entry into Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s house, were I one of her friends, were I to penetrate into her life, I should then know what, within its glowing orange-tawny envelope, her name did really, objectively enclose for other people, since, after all, my father\u2019s friend had said that the Guermantes set was something quite by itself in the Faubourg Saint-Germain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The life which I supposed them to lead there flowed from a source so different from anything in my experience, and must, I felt, be so indissolubly associated with that particular house that I could not have imagined the presence, at the Duchess\u2019s parties, of people in whose company I myself had already been, of people who really existed. For not being able suddenly to change their nature, they would have carried on conversations there of the sort that I knew; their partners would perhaps have stooped to reply to them in the same human speech; and, in the course of an evening spent in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, there would have been moments identical with moments that I had already lived. Which was impossible. It was thus that my mind was embarrassed by certain difficulties, and the Presence of Our Lord\u2019s Body in the Host seemed to me no more obscure a mystery than this leading house in the Faubourg, situated here, on the right bank of the river, and so near that from my bed, in the morning, I could hear its carpets being beaten. But the line of demarcation that separated me from the Faubourg Saint-Germain seemed to me all the more real because it was purely ideal. I felt clearly that it was already part of the Faubourg, when I saw the Guermantes doormat, spread out beyond that intangible Equator, of which my mother had made bold to say, having like myself caught a glimpse of it one day when their door stood open, that it was a shocking state. For the rest, how could their dining-room, their dim gallery upholstered in red plush, into which I could see sometimes from our kitchen window, have failed to possess in my eyes the mysterious charm of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to form part of it in an essential fashion, to be geographically situated within it, since to have been entertained to dinner in that room was to have gone into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to have breathed its atmosphere, since the people who, before going to table, sat down by the side of Mme. de Guermantes on the leather-covered sofa in that gallery were all of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. No doubt elsewhere than in the Faubourg, at certain parties, one might see now and then, majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashion, one of those men who were mere names and varyingly assumed, when one tried to form a picture of them, the aspect of a tournament or of a royal forest. But here, in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-German, in the drawing-room, in the dim gallery, there were only they. They were wrought of precious materials, the columns that upheld the temple. Indeed for quiet family parties it was from among them only that Mme. de Guermantes might select her guests, and in the dinners for twelve, gathered around the dazzling napery and plate, they were like the golden statues of the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle, symbolic, consecrative pillars before the Holy Table. As for the tiny strip of garden that stretched between high walls at the back of the house, where on summer evenings Mme. de Guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade brought out after dinner, how could I not have felt that to sit there of an evening, between nine and eleven, on its iron chairs \u2014 endowed with a magic as potent as the leathern sofa \u2014 without inhaling the breezes peculiar to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis of Figuig without thereby being necessarily in Africa. Only imagination and belief can differentiate from the rest certain objects, certain people, and can create an atmosphere. Alas, those picturesque sites, those natural accidents, those local curiosities, those works of art of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, never probably should I be permitted to set my feet among them. And I must content myself with a shiver of excitement as I sighted, from the deep sea (and without the least hope of ever landing there) like an outstanding minaret, like the first palm, like the first signs of some exotic industry or vegetation, the well-trodden doormat of its shore\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes began for me at its hall-door, its dependencies must be regarded as extending a long way farther, according to the Duke, who, looking on all the other tenants as farmers, peasants, purchasers of forfeited estates, whose opinion was of no account, shaved himself every morning in his nightshirt at the window, came down into the courtyard, according to the warmth or coldness of the day, in his shirtsleeves, in pyjamas, in a plaid coat of startling colours, with a shaggy nap, in little light-coloured coats shorter than the jackets beneath, and made one of his grooms lead past him at a trot some horse that he had just been buying. More than once, indeed, the horse broke the window of Jupien\u2019s shop, whereupon Jupien, to the Duke\u2019s indignation, demanded compensation. \u201cIf it were only in consideration of all the good that Madame la Duchesse does in the house, here, and in the parish,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cit is an outrage on this fellow\u2019s part to claim a penny from us.\u201d But Jupien had stuck to his point, apparently not having the faintest idea what \u2018good\u2019 the Duchess had ever done. And yet she did do good, but \u2014 since one cannot do good to everybody at once \u2014 the memory of the benefits that we have heaped on one person is a valid reason for our abstaining from helping another, whose discontent we thereby make all the stronger. From other points of view than that of charity the quarter appeared to the Duke \u2014 and this over a considerable area \u2014 to be only an extension of his courtyard, a longer track for his horses. After seeing how a new acquisition trotted by itself he would have it harnessed and taken through all the neighbouring streets, the groom running beside the carriage holding the reins, making it pass to and fro before the Duke who stood on the pavement, erect, gigantic, enormous in his vivid clothes, a cigar between his teeth, his head in the air, his eyeglass scrutinous, until the moment when he sprang on the box, drove the horse up and down for a little to try it, then set off with his new turn-out to pick up his mistress in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. M. de Guermantes bade good day, before leaving the courtyard, to two couples who belonged more or less to his world; the first, some cousins of his who, like working-class parents, were never at home to look after their children, since every morning the wife went off to the Schola to study counterpoint and fugue, and the husband to his studio to carve wood and beat leather; and after them the Baron and Baronne de Norpois, always dressed in black, she like a pew-opener and he like a mute at a funeral, who emerged several times daily on their way to church. They were the nephew and niece of the old Ambassador who was our friend, and whom my father had, in fact, met at the foot of the staircase without realising from where he came; for my father supposed that so important a personage, one who had come in contact with the most eminent men in Europe and was probably quite indifferent to the empty distinctions of rank, was hardly likely to frequent the society of these obscure, clerical and narrow-minded nobles. They had not been long in the place; Jupien, who had come out into the courtyard to say a word to the husband just as he was greeting M. de Guermantes, called him \u2018M. Norpois,\u2019 not being certain of his name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMonsieur Norpois, indeed! Oh, that really is good! Just wait a little! This individual will be calling you Comrade Norpois next!\u201d exclaimed M. de Guermantes, turning to the Baron. He was at last able to vent his spleen against Jupien who addressed him as \u2018Monsieur,\u2019 instead of \u2018Monsieur le Duc.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day when M. de Guermantes required some information upon a matter of which my father had professional knowledge, he had introduced himself to him with great courtesy. After that, he had often some neighbourly service to ask of my father and, as soon as he saw him begin to come downstairs, his mind occupied with his work and anxious to avoid any interruption, the Duke, leaving his stable-boys, would come up to him in the courtyard, straighten the collar of his great-coat, with the serviceable deftness inherited from a line of royal body-servants in days gone by, take him by the hand, and, holding it in his own, patting it even to prove to my father, with a courtesan\u2019s or courtier\u2019s shamelessness, that he, the Duc de Guermantes, made no bargain about my father\u2019s right to the privilege of contact with the ducal flesh, lead him, so to speak, on leash, extremely annoyed and thinking only how he might escape, through the carriage entrance out into the street. He had given us a sweeping bow one day when we had come in just as he was going out in the carriage with his wife; he was bound to have told her my name; but what likelihood was there of her remembering it, or my face either? And besides, what a feeble recommendation to be pointed out simply as being one of her tenants! Another, more valuable, would have been my meeting the Duchess in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, who, as it happened, had just sent word by my grandmother that I was to go and see her, and, remembering that I had been intending to go in for literature, had added that I should meet several authors there. But my father felt that I was still a little young to go into society, and as the state of my health continued to give him uneasiness he did not see the use of establishing precedents that would do me no good\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As one of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s footmen was in the habit of talking to Fran\u00e7oise, I picked up the names of several of the houses which she frequented, but formed no impression of any of them; from the moment in which they were a part of her life, of that life which I saw only through the veil of her name, were they not inconceivable?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo-night there\u2019s a big party with a Chinese shadow show at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s,\u201d said the footman, \u201cbut we shan\u2019t be going, because at five o\u2019clock Madame is taking the train to Chantilly, to spend a few days with the Due d\u2019Aumale; but it\u2019ll be the lady\u2019s maid and valet that are going with her. I\u2019m to stay here. She won\u2019t be at all pleased, the Princesse de Parme won\u2019t, that\u2019s four times already she\u2019s written to Madame la Duchesse.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen you won\u2019t be going down to Guermantes Castle this year?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we shan\u2019t be going there: it\u2019s because of the Duke\u2019s rheumatics, the doctor says he\u2019s not to go there till the hot pipes are in, but we\u2019ve been there every year till now, right on to January. If the hot pipes aren\u2019t ready, perhaps Madame will go for a few days to Cannes, to the Duchesse de Guise, but nothing\u2019s settled yet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd to the theatre, do you go, sometimes?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe go now and then to the Op\u00e9ra, usually on the evenings when the Princesse de Parme has her box, that\u2019s once a week; it seems it\u2019s a fine show they give there, plays, operas, everything. Madame refused to subscribe to it herself, but we go all the same to the boxes Madame\u2019s friends take, one one night, another another, often with the Princesse de Guermantes, the Duke\u2019s cousin\u2019s lady. She\u2019s sister to the Duke of Bavaria. And so you\u2019ve got to run upstairs again now, have you?\u201d went on the footman, who, albeit identified with the Guermantes, looked upon masters in general as a political estate, a view which allowed him to treat Fran\u00e7oise with as much respect as if she too were in service with a duchess. \u201cYou enjoy good health, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, if it wasn\u2019t for these cursed legs of mine! On the plain I can still get along\u201d (\u2018on the plain\u2019 meant in the courtyard or in the streets, where Fran\u00e7oise had no objection to walking, in other words \u2018on a plane surface\u2019) \u201cbut it\u2019s these stairs that do me in, devil take them. Good day to you, sir, see you again, perhaps, this evening.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was all the more anxious to continue her conversations with the footman after he mentioned to her that the sons of dukes often bore a princely title which they retained until their fathers were dead. Evidently the cult of the nobility, blended with and accommodating itself to a certain spirit of revolt against it, must, springing hereditarily from the soil of France, be very strongly implanted still in her people. For Fran\u00e7oise, to whom you might speak of the genius of Napoleon or of wireless telegraphy without succeeding in attracting her attention, and without her slackening for an instant the movements with which she was scraping the ashes from the grate or laying the table, if she were simply to be told these idiosyncrasies of nomenclature, and that the younger son of the Duc de Guermantes was generally called Prince d\u2019Ol\u00e9ron, would at once exclaim: \u201cThat\u2019s fine, that is!\u201d and stand there dazed, as though in contemplation of a stained window in church\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise learned also from the Prince d\u2019Agrigente\u2019s valet, who had become friends with her by coming often to the house with notes for the Duchess, that he had been hearing a great deal of talk in society about the marriage of the Marquis de Saint-Loup to Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac, and that it was practically settled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That villa, that opera-box, into which Mme. de Guermantes transfused the current of her life, must, it seemed to me, be places no less fairylike than her home. The names of Guise, of Parme, of Guermantes-Baviere, differentiated from all possible others the holiday places to which the Duchess resorted, the daily festivities which the track of her bowling wheels bound, as with ribbons, to her mansion. If they told me that in those holidays, in those festivities, consisted serially the life of Mme. de Guermantes, they brought no further light to bear on it. Each of them gave to the life of the Duchess a different determination, but succeeded only in changing the mystery of it, without allowing to escape any of its own mystery which simply floated, protected by a covering, enclosed in a bell, through the tide of the life of all the world. The Duchess might take her luncheon on the shore of the Mediterranean at Carnival time, but, in the villa of Mme. de Guise, where the queen of Parisian society was nothing more, in her white linen dress, among numberless princesses, than a guest like any of the rest, and on that account more moving still to me, more herself by being thus made new, like a star of the ballet who in the fantastic course of a figure takes the place of each of her humbler sisters in succession; she might look at Chinese shadow shows, but at a party given by the Princesse de Parme, listen to tragedy or opera, but from the box of the Princesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we localise in the body of a person all the potentialities of that person\u2019s life, our recollections of the people he knows and has just left or is on his way to meet, if, having learned from Fran\u00e7oise that Mme. de Guermantes was going on foot to luncheon with the Princesse de Parme, I saw her, about midday, emerge from her house in a gown of flesh-coloured satin over which her face was of the same shade, like a cloud that rises above the setting sun, it was all the pleasures of the Faubourg Saint-Germain that I saw before me, contained in that small compass, as in a shell, between its twin valves that glowed with roseate nacre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had a friend at the Ministry, one A. J. Moreau, who, to distinguish him from the other Moreaus, took care always to prefix both initials to his name, with the result that people called him, for short, \u2018A.J.\u2019 Well, somehow or other, this A. J. found himself entitled to a stall at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on a gala night, he sent the ticket to my father, and as Berma, whom I had not been again to see since my first disappointment, was to give an act of Ph\u00e8dre, my grandmother persuaded my father to pass it on to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To tell the truth, I attached no importance to this possibility of hearing Berma which, a few years earlier, had plunged me in such a state of agitation. And it was not without a sense of melancholy that I realized the fact of my indifference to what at one time I had put before health, comfort, everything. It was not that there had been any slackening of my desire for an opportunity to contemplate close at hand the precious particles of reality of which my imagination caught a broken glimpse. But my imagination no longer placed these in the diction of a great actress; since my visits to Elstir, it was on certain tapestries, certain modern paintings that I had brought to bear the inner faith I had once had in this acting, in this tragic art of Berma; my faith, my desire, no longer coming forward to pay incessant worship to the diction, the attitudes of Berma, the counterpart that I possessed of them in my heart had gradually perished, like those other counterparts of the dead in ancient Egypt which had to be fed continually in order to maintain their originals in eternal life. This art had become a feeble, tawdry thing. No deep-lying soul inhabited it any more\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That evening, as, armed with the ticket my father had received from his friend, I was climbing the grand staircase of the Opera, I saw in front of me a man whom I took at first for M. de Charlus, whose bearing he had; when he turned his head to ask some question of one of the staff I saw that I had been mistaken, but I had no hesitation in placing the stranger in the same class of society, from the way not only in which he was dressed but in which he spoke to the man who took the tickets and to the box-openers who were keeping him waiting. For, apart from personal details of similarity, there was still at this period between any smart and wealthy man of that section of the nobility and any smart and wealthy man of the world of finance or \u2018big business\u2019 a strongly marked difference. Where one of the latter would have thought he was giving proof of his exclusiveness by adopting a sharp, haughty tone in speaking to an inferior, the great gentleman, affable, pleasant, smiling, had the air of considering, practising an affectation of humility and patience, a pretence of being just one of the audience, as a privilege of his good breeding. It is quite likely that, on seeing him thus dissemble behind a smile overflowing with good nature the barred threshold of the little world apart which he carried in his person, more than one wealthy banker\u2019s son, entering the theatre at that moment, would have taken this great gentleman for a person of no importance if he had not remarked in him an astonishing resemblance to the portrait that had recently appeared in the illustrated papers of a nephew of the Austrian Emperor, the Prince of Saxony, who happened to be in Paris at the time. I knew him to be a great friend of the Guermantes. As I reached the attendant I heard the Prince of Saxony (or his double) say with a smile: \u201cI don\u2019t know the number; it was my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He may well have been the Prince of Saxony; it was perhaps of the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom, in that event, I should be able to watch in the process of living one of those moments of her unimaginable life in her cousin\u2019s box) that his eyes formed a mental picture when he referred to \u2018my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box,\u2019 so much so that that smiling gaze peculiar to himself, those so simple words caressed my heart (far more gently than would any abstract meditation) with the alternative feelers of a possible happiness and a vague distinction. Whatever he was, in uttering this sentence to the attendant he grafted upon a commonplace evening in my everyday life a potential outlet into a new world; the passage to which he was directed after mentioning the word \u2018box\u2019 and along which he now proceeded was moist and mildewed and seemed to lead to subaqueous grottoes, to the mythical kingdom of the water-nymphs. I had before me a gentleman in evening dress who was walking away from me, but I kept playing upon and round him, as with a badly fitting reflector on a lamp, and without ever succeeding in making it actually coincide with him, the idea that he was the Prince of Saxony and was on his way to join the Duchesse de Guermantes. And, for all that he was alone, that idea, external to himself, impalpable, immense, unstable as the shadow projected by a magic lantern, seemed to precede and guide him like that deity, invisible to the rest of mankind, who stands beside the Greek warrior in the hour of battle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took my seat, striving all the time to recapture a line from Ph\u00e8dre which I could not quite remember. In the form in which I repeated it to myself it had not the right number of feet, but as I made no attempt to count them, between its unwieldiness and a classical line of poetry it seemed as though no common measure could exist. It would not have surprised me to learn that I must subtract at least half a dozen syllables from that portentous phrase to reduce it to alexandrine dimensions. But suddenly I remembered it, the irremediable asperities of an inhuman world vanished as if by magic; the syllables of the line at once filled up the requisite measure, what there was in excess floated off with the ease, the dexterity of a bubble of air that rises to burst on the water\u2019s brink. And, after all, this excrescence with which I had been struggling consisted of but a single foot\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certain number of orchestra stalls had been offered for sale at the box office and bought, out of snobbishness or curiosity, by such as wished to study the appearance of people whom they might not have another opportunity of seeing at close quarters. And it was indeed a fragment of their true social life, ordinarily kept secret, that one could examine here in public, for, the Princesse de Parme having herself distributed among her friends the seats in stalls, balconies and boxes, the house was like a drawing-room in which everyone changed his place, went to sit here or there wherever he caught sight of a woman whom he knew\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next to me were some common people who, not knowing the regular subscribers, were anxious to shew that they were capable of identifying them and named them aloud. They went on to remark that these subscribers behaved there as though they were in their own drawing-rooms, meaning that they paid no attention to what was being played. Which was the exact opposite of what did happen. A budding genius who had taken a stall in order to hear Berma thinks only of not soiling his gloves, of not disturbing, of making friends with the neighbour whom chance has put beside him, of pursuing with an intermittent smile the fugitive \u2014 avoiding with apparent want of politeness the intercepted gaze of a person of his acquaintance whom he has discovered in the audience and to whom, after a thousand indecisions, he makes up his mind to go and talk just as the three hammer-blows from the stage, sounding before he has had time to reach his friend, force him to take flight, like the Hebrews in the Red Sea, through a heaving tide of spectators and spectatresses whom he has obliged to rise and whose dresses he tears as he passes, or tramples on their boots. On the other hand it was because the society people sat in their boxes (behind the general terrace of the balcony, as in so many little drawing-rooms, the fourth walls of which had been removed, or in so many little caf\u00e9s, to which one might go for refreshment, without letting oneself be intimidated by the mirrors in gilt frames or the red plush seats, in the Neapolitan style, of the establishment), it was because they rested an indifferent hand on the gilded shafts of the columns which upheld this temple of the lyric art, it was because they remained unmoved by the extravagant honours which seemed to be being paid them by a pair of carved figures which held out towards the boxes branches of palm and laurel, that they and they only would have had minds free to listen to the play, if only they had had minds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first there was nothing visible but vague shadows, in which one suddenly struck \u2014 like the gleam of a precious stone which one cannot see \u2014 the phosphorescence of a pair of famous eyes, or, like a medallion of Henri IV on a dark background, the bent profile of the Due d\u2019Aumale, to whom an invisible lady was exclaiming \u201cMonseigneur must allow me to take his coat,\u201d to which the Prince replied, \u201cOh, come, come! Really, Madame d\u2019Ambresac.\u201d She took it, in spite of this vague prohibition, and was envied by all the rest her being thus honoured\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in the other boxes, everywhere almost, the white deities who inhabited those sombre abodes had flown for shelter against their shadowy walls and remained invisible. Gradually, however, as the performance went on, their vaguely human forms detached themselves, one by one, from the shades of night which they patterned, and, raising themselves towards the light, allowed their semi-nude bodies to emerge, and rose, and stopped at the limit of their course, at the luminous, shaded surface on which their brilliant faces appeared behind the gaily breaking foam of the feather fans they unfurled and lightly waved, beneath their hyacinthine locks begemmed with pearls, which the flow of the tide seemed to have caught and drawn with it; this side of them, began the orchestra stalls, abode of mortals for ever separated from the transparent, shadowy realm to which, at points here and there, served as boundaries, on its brimming surface, the limpid, mirroring eyes of the water-nymphs. For the folding seats on its shore, the forms of the monsters in the stalls were painted upon the surface of those eyes in simple obedience to the laws of optics and according to their angle of incidence, as happens with those two sections of external reality to which, knowing that they do not possess any soul, however rudimentary, that can be considered as analogous to our own, we should think ourselves mad if we addressed a smile or a glance of recognition: namely, minerals and people to whom we have not been introduced. Beyond this boundary, withdrawing from the limit of their domain, the radiant daughters of the sea kept turning at every moment to smile up at the bearded tritons who clung to the anfractuosities of the cliff, or towards some aquatic demi-god, whose head was a polished stone to which the tides had borne a smooth covering of seaweed, and his gaze a disc of rock crystal. They leaned towards these creatures, offering them sweetmeats; sometimes the flood parted to admit a fresh Nereid who, belated, smiling, apologetic, had just floated into blossom out of the shadowy depths; then, the act ended, having no further hope of hearing the melodious sounds of earth which had drawn them to the surface, plunging back all in a moment the several sisters vanished into the night. But of all these retreats, to the thresholds of which their mild desire to behold the works of man brought the curious goddesses who let none approach them, the most famous was the cube of semi-darkness known to the world as the stage box of the Princesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like a mighty goddess who presides from far aloft over the sports of lesser deities, the Princess had deliberately remained a little way back on a sofa placed sideways in the box, red as a reef of coral, beside a big, glassy splash of reflexion which was probably a mirror and made one think of the section cut by a ray of sunlight, vertical, clear, liquid, through the flashing crystal of the sea. At once plume and blossom, like certain subaqueous growths, a great white flower, downy as the wing of a bird, fell from the brow of the Princess along one of her cheeks, the curve of which it followed with a pliancy, coquettish, amorous, alive, and seemed almost to enfold it like a rosy egg in the softness of a halcyon\u2019s nest. Over her hair, reaching in front to her eyebrows and caught back lower down at the level of her throat, was spread a net upon which those little white shells which are gathered on some shore of the South Seas alternated with pearls, a marine mosaic barely emerging from the waves and at every moment plunged back again into a darkness in the depths of which even then a human presence was revealed by the ubiquitous flashing of the Princess\u2019s eyes. The beauty which set her far above all the other fabulous daughters of the dusk was not altogether materially and comprehensively inscribed on her neck, her shoulders, her arms, her figure. But the exquisite, unfinished line of the last was the exact starting point, the inevitable focus of invisible lines which the eye could not help prolonging, marvellous lines, springing into life round the woman like the spectrum of an ideal form projected upon the screen of darkness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the Princesse de Guermantes,\u201d said my neighbour to the gentleman beside her, taking care to begin the word \u2018Princesse\u2019 with a string of P\u2019s, to shew that a title like that was absurd. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been sparing with her pearls. I\u2019m sure, if I had as many as that, I wouldn\u2019t make such a display of them; it doesn\u2019t look at all well, not to my mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, when they caught sight of the Princess, all those who were looking round to see who was in the audience felt springing up for her in their hearts the rightful throne of beauty. Indeed, with the Duchesse de Luxembourg, with Mme. de Morienval, with Mme. de Saint-Euverte, and any number of others, what enabled one to identify their faces would be the juxtaposition of a big red nose to a hare-lip, or of a pair of wrinkled cheeks to a faint moustache. These features were nevertheless sufficient in themselves to attract the eye, since having merely the conventional value of a written document they gave one to read a famous and impressive name; but also they gave one, cumulatively, the idea that ugliness had about it something aristocratic, and that it was unnecessary that the face of a great lady, provided it was distinguished, should be beautiful as well. But like certain artists who, instead of the letters of their names, set at the foot of their canvas a form that is beautiful in itself, a butterfly, a lizard, a flower, so it was the form of a delicious face and figure that the Princess had put in the corner of her box, thereby shewing that beauty can be the noblest of signatures; for the presence there of Mme. de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, who brought to the theatre only such persons as at other times formed part of her intimate circle, was in the eyes of specialists in aristocracy the best possible certificate of the authenticity of the picture which her box presented, a sort of evocation of a scene in the ordinary private life of the Princess in her palaces in Munich and in Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our imagination being like a barrel organ out of order, which always plays some other tune than that shewn on its card, every time that I had heard any mention of the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, a recollection of certain sixteenth-century masterpieces had begun singing in my brain. I was obliged to rid myself quickly of this association, now that I saw her engaged in offering crystallised fruit to a stout gentleman in a swallowtail coat. Certainly I was very far from the conclusion that she and her guests were mere human beings like the rest of the audience. I understood that what they were doing there was all only a game, and that as a prelude to the acts of their real life (of which, presumably, this was not where they spent the important part) they had arranged, in obedience to a ritual unknown to me, they were feigning to offer and decline sweetmeats, a gesture robbed of its ordinary significance and regulated beforehand like the step of a dancer who alternately raises herself on her toes and circles about an upheld scarf. For all I knew, perhaps at the moment of offering him her sweetmeats the goddess was saying, with that note of irony in her voice (for I saw her smile): \u201cDo have one, won\u2019t you?\u201d What mattered that to me? I should have found a delicious refinement in the deliberate dryness, in the style of M\u00e9rim\u00e9e or Meilhac, of such words addressed by a goddess to a demi-god who, conscious himself what were the sublime thoughts which they both had in their minds, in reserve, doubtless, until the moment when they would begin again to live their true life, consenting to join in the game, was answering with the same mysterious bitterness: \u201cThanks; I should like a cherry.\u201d And I should have listened to this dialogue with the same avidity as to a scene from Le Mari de la D\u00e9butante, where the absence of poetry, of lofty thoughts, things so familiar to me which, I suppose, Meilhac could easily, had he chosen, have put into it a thousand times over, seemed to me in itself a refinement, a conventional refinement and therefore all the more mysterious and instructive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat fat fellow is the Marquis de Ganan\u00e7ay,\u201d came in a knowing tone from the man next to me, who had not quite caught the name whispered in the row behind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquis de Palancy, his face bent downwards at the end of his long neck, his round bulging eye glued to the glass of his monocle, was moving with a leisurely displacement through the transparent shade and appeared no more to see the public in the stalls than a fish that drifts past, unconscious of the press of curious gazers, behind the glass wall of an aquarium. Now and again he paused, a venerable, wheezing monument, and the audience could not have told whether he was in pain, asleep, swimming, about to spawn, or merely taking breath. No one else aroused in me so much envy as he, on account of his apparent familiarity with this box and the indifference with which he allowed the Princess to hold out to him her box of sweetmeats; throwing him, at the same time, a glance from her fine eyes, cut in a pair of diamonds which at such moments wit and friendliness seemed to liquefy, whereas, when they were at rest, reduced to their purely material beauty, to their mineral brilliance alone, if the least reflected flash disturbed them ever so slightly, they set the darkness ablaze with inhuman horizontal splendid fires. But now, because the act ofPh\u00e8dre in which Berma was playing was due to start, the Princess came to the front of the box; whereupon, as if she herself were a theatrical production, in the zone of light which she traversed, I saw not only the colour but the material of her adornments change. And in the box, dry now, emerging, a part no longer of the watery realm, the Princess, ceasing to be a Nereid, appeared turbanned in white and blue like some marvellous tragic actress dressed for the part of Za\u00efre, or perhaps of Orosmane; finally, when she had taken her place in the front row I saw that the soft halcyon\u2019s nest which tenderly shielded the rosy nacre of her cheeks was \u2014 downy, dazzling, velvety, an immense bird of paradise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But now my gaze was diverted from the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s box by a little woman who came in, ill-dressed, plain, her eyes ablaze with indignation, followed by two young men, and sat down a few places from me. At length the curtain went up. I could not help being saddened by the reflexion that there remained now no trace of my old disposition, at the period when, so as to miss nothing of the extraordinary phenomenon which I would have gone to the ends of the earth to see, I kept my mind prepared, like the sensitive plates which astronomers take out to Africa, to the West Indies, to make and record an exact observation of a comet or an eclipse; when I trembled for fear lest some cloud (a fit of ill humour on the artist\u2019s part or an incident in the audience) should prevent the spectacle from presenting itself with the maximum of intensity; when I should not have believed that I was watching it in the most perfect conditions had I not gone to the very theatre which was consecrated to it like an altar, in which I then felt to be still a part of it, though an accessory part only, the officials with their white carnations, appointed by her, the vaulted balcony covering a pit filled with a shabbily dressed crowd, the women selling programmes that had her photograph, the chestnut trees in the square outside, all those companions, those confidants of my impressions of those days which seemed to me to be inseparable from them. Ph\u00e8dre, the \u2018Declaration Scene,\u2019 Berma, had had then for me a sort of absolute existence. Standing aloof from the world of current experience they existed by themselves, I must go to meet them, I should penetrate what I could of them, and if I opened my eyes and soul to their fullest extent I should still absorb but a very little of them. But how pleasant life seemed to me: the triviality of the form of it that I myself was leading mattered nothing, no more than the time we spend on dressing, on getting ready to go out, since, transcending it, there existed in an absolute form, good and difficult to approach, impossible to possess in their entirety, those more solid realities,  Ph\u00e8dre and the way in which Berma spoke her part. Steeped in these dreams of perfection in the dramatic art (a strong dose of which anyone who had at that time subjected my mind to analysis at any moment of the day or even the night would have been able to prepare from it), I was like a battery that accumulates and stores up electricity. And a time had come when, ill as I was, even if I had believed that I should die of it, I should still have been compelled to go and hear Berma. But now, like a hill which from a distance seems a patch of azure sky, but, as we draw nearer, returns to its place in our ordinary field of vision, all this had left the world of the absolute and was no more than a thing like other things, of which I took cognisance because I was there, the actors were people of the same substance as the people I knew, trying to speak in the best possible way these lines of Ph\u00e8dre, which themselves no longer formed a sublime and individual essence, distinct from everything else, but were simply more or less effective lines ready to slip back into the vast corpus of French poetry, of which they were merely a part. I felt a discouragement that was all the more profound in that, if the object of my headstrong and active desire no longer existed, the same tendencies, on the other hand, to indulge in a perpetual dream, which varied from year to year but led me always to sudden impulses, regardless of danger, still persisted. The day on which I rose from my bed of sickness and set out to see, in some country house or other, a picture by Elstir or a mediaeval tapestry, was so like the day on which I ought to have started for Venice, or that on which I did go to hear Berma, or start for Balbec, that I felt before going that the immediate object of my sacrifice would, after a little while, leave me cold, that then I might pass close by the place without stopping even to look at that picture, those tapestries for which I would at this moment risk so many sleepless nights, so many hours of pain. I discerned in the instability of its object the vanity of my effort, and at the same time its vastness, which I had not before noticed, like a neurasthenic whose exhaustion we double by pointing out to him that he is exhausted. In the meantime my musings gave a distinction to everything that had any connexion with them. And even in my most carnal desires, magnetised always in a certain direction, concentrated about a single dream, I might have recognised as their primary motive an idea, an idea for which I would have laid down my life, at the innermost core of which, as in my day dreams while I sat reading all afternoon in the garden at Combray, lay the thought of perfection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I no longer felt the same indulgence as on the former occasion towards the deliberate expressions of affection or anger which I had then remarked in the delivery and gestures of Aricie, Ism\u00e8ne and Hippolyte. It was not that the players \u2014 they were the same, by the way \u2014 did not still seek, with the same intelligent application, to impart now a caressing inflexion, or a calculated ambiguity to their voices, now a tragic amplitude, or a suppliant meekness to their movements. Their intonations bade the voice: \u201cBe gentle, sing like a nightingale, caress and woo\u201d; or else, \u201cnow wax furious,\u201d and then hurled themselves upon it, trying to carry it off with them in their frenzied rush. But it, mutinous, independent of their diction, remained unalterably their natural voice with its material defects or charms, its everyday vulgarity or affectation, and thus presented a sum-total of acoustic or social phenomena which the sentiment contained in the lines they were repeating was powerless to alter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly the gestures of the players said to their arms, to their garments: \u201cBe majestic.\u201d But each of these unsubmissive members allowed to flaunt itself between shoulder and elbow a biceps which knew nothing of the part; they continued to express the triviality of everyday life and to bring into prominence, instead of fine shades of Racinian meaning, mere muscular attachments; and the draperies which they held up fell back again along vertical lines in which the natural law that governs falling bodies was challenged only by an insipid textile pliancy. At this point the little woman who was sitting near me exclaimed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot a hand! Did you ever see such a get-up? She\u2019s too old; she can\u2019t play the part; she ought to have retired ages ago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amid a sibilant protest from their neighbours the two young men with her succeeded in making her keep quiet and her fury raged now only in her eyes. This fury could, moreover, be prompted only by the thought of success, of fame, for Berma, who had earned so much money, was overwhelmed with debts. Since she was always making business or social appointments which she was prevented from keeping, she had messengers flying with apologies along every street in Paris, and what with rooms in hotels which she would never occupy engaged in advance, oceans of scent to bathe her dogs, heavy penalties for breaches of contract with all her managers, failing any more serious expense and being not so voluptuous as Cleopatra, she would have found the means of squandering on telegrams and jobmasters provinces and kingdoms. But the little woman was an actress who had never tasted success, and had vowed a deadly hatred against Berma. The latter had just corne on to the stage. And then \u2014 oh, the miracle \u2014 like those lessons which we laboured in vain to learn overnight, and find intact, got by heart, on waking up next morning, like, too, those faces of dead friends which the impassioned efforts of our memory pursue without recapturing them, and which, when we are no longer thinking of them, are there before our eyes just as they were in life \u2014 the talent of Berma, which had evaded me when I sought so greedily to seize its essential quality, now, after these years of oblivion, in this hour of indifference, imposed itself, with all the force of a thing directly seen, on my admiration. Formerly, in my attempts to isolate the talent, I deducted, so to speak, from what I heard the part itself, a part common to all the actresses who appeared as Ph\u00e8dre, which I had myself studied beforehand so that I might be capable of subtracting it, of receiving in the strained residue only the talent of Mme. Berma. But this talent which I sought to discover outside the part itself was indissolubly one with it. So with a great musician (it appears that this was the case with Vinteuil when he played the piano), his playing is that of so fine a pianist that one cannot even be certain whether the performer is a pianist at all, since (not interposing all that mechanism of muscular effort, crowned here and there with brilliant effects, all that spattering shower of notes in which at least the listener who does not quite know where he is thinks that he can discern talent in its material, tangible objectivity) his playing is become so transparent, so full of what he is interpreting, that himself one no longer sees and he is nothing now but a window opening upon a great work of art. The intentions which surrounded, like a majestic or delicate border, the voice and mimicry of Aricie, Ism\u00e8ne or Hippolyte I had been able to distinguish, but Ph\u00e8dre had taken hers into herself, and my mind had not succeeded in wresting from her diction and attitudes, in apprehending in the miserly simplicity of their unbroken surfaces those treasures, those effects of which no sign emerged, so completely had they been absorbed. Berma\u2019s voice, in which not one atom of lifeless matter refractory to the mind remained undissolved, did not allow any sign to be discernible around it of that overflow of tears which one could feel, because they had not been able to absorb it in themselves, trickling over the marble voice of Aricie or Ism\u00e8ne, but had been brought to an exquisite perfection in each of its tiniest cells like the instrument of a master violinist, in whom one means, when one says that his music has a fine sound, to praise not a physical peculiarity but a superiority of soul; and, as in the classical landscape where in the place of a vanished nymph there is an inanimate waterspring, a clear and concrete intention had been transformed into a certain quality of tone, strangely, appropriately, coldly limpid. Berma\u2019s arms, which the lines themselves, by the same dynamic force that made the words issue from her lips, seemed to raise on to her bosom like leaves disturbed by a gush o\u00ee water; her attitude, on the stage, which she had gradually built up, which she was to modify yet further, and which was based upon reasonings of a different profundity from those of which traces might be seen in the gestures of her fellow-actors, but of reasonings that had lost their original deliberation, and had melted into a sort of radiance in which they sent throbbing, round the person of the heroine, elements rich and complex, but which the fascinated spectator took not as an artistic triumph but as a natural gift; those white veils themselves, which, tenuous and clinging, seemed to be of a living substance and to have been woven by the suffering, half-pagan, half-Jansenist, around which they drew close like a frail, shrinking chrysalis; all of them, voice, attitude, gestures, veils, were nothing more, round this embodiment of an idea, which a line of poetry is (an embodiment that, unlike our human bodies, covers the soul not with an opaque screen which prevents us from seeing it, but with a purified, a quickened garment through which the soul is diffused and we discover it), than additional envelopes which instead of concealing shewed up in greater splendour the soul that had assimilated them to itself and had spread itself through them, than layers of different substances, grown translucent, the interpolation of which has the effect only of causing a richer refraction of the imprisoned, central ray that pierces through them, and of making more extensive, more precious and more fair the matter purified by fire in which it is enshrined. So Berma\u2019s interpretation was, around Racine\u2019s work, a second work, quickened also by the breath of genius\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My own impression, to tell the truth, though more pleasant than on the earlier occasion, was not really different. Only, I no longer put it to the test of a pre-existent, abstract and false idea of dramatic genius, and I understood now that dramatic genius was precisely this. It had just occurred to me that if I had not derived any pleasure from my first hearing of Berma, it was because, as earlier still when I used to meet Gilberte in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I had come to her with too strong a desire. Between my two disappointments there was perhaps not only this resemblance, but another more profound. The impression given us by a person or a work (or a rendering, for that matter) of marked individuality is peculiar to that person or work. We have brought to it the ideas of \u2018beauty,\u2019 \u2018breadth of style,\u2019 \u2018pathos\u2019 and so forth which we might, failing anything better, have had the illusion of discovering in the commonplace show of a \u2018correct\u2019 face or talent, but our critical spirit has before it the insistent challenge of a form of which it possesses no intellectual equivalent, in which it must detect and isolate the unknown element. It hears a shrill sound, an oddly interrogative intonation. It asks itself: \u201cIs that good? Is what I am feeling just now admiration? Is that richness of colouring, nobility, strength?\u201d And what answers it again is a shrill voice, a curiously questioning tone, the despotic impression caused by a person whom one does not know, wholly material, in which there is no room left for \u2018breadth of interpretation.\u2019 And for this reason it is the really beautiful works that, if we listen to them with sincerity, must disappoint us most keenly, because in the storehouse of our ideas there is none that corresponds to an individual impression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was precisely what Berma\u2019s acting shewed me. This was what was meant by nobility, by intelligence of diction. Now I could appreciate the worth of a broad, poetical, powerful interpretation, or rather it was to this that those epithets were conventionally applied, but only as we give the names of Mars, Venus, Saturn to planets which have no place in classical mythology. We feel in one world, we think, we give names to things in another; between the two we can establish a certain correspondence, but not bridge the interval. It was quite narrow, this interval, this fault that I had had to cross when, that afternoon on which I went first to bear Berma, having strained my ears to catch every word, I had found some difficulty in correlating my ideas of \u2018nobility of interpretation,\u2019 of \u2018originality,\u2019 and had broken out in applause only after a moment of unconsciousness and as if my applause sprang not from my actual impression but was connected in some way with my preconceived ideas, with the pleasure that I found in saying to myself: \u201cAt last I am listening to Berma.\u201d And the difference that there is between a person, or a work of art which is markedly individual and the idea of beauty, exists just as much between what they make us feel and the idea of love, or of admiration. Wherefore we fail to recognise them. I had found no pleasure in listening to Berma (any more than, earlier still, in seeing Gilberte). I had said to myself: \u201cWell, I do not admire this.\u201d But then I was thinking only of mastering the secret of Berma\u2019s acting, I was preoccupied with that alone, I was trying to open my mind as wide as possible to receive all that her acting contained. I understood now that all this amounted to nothing more nor less than admiration\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This genius of which Berma\u2019s rendering of the part was only the revelation, was it indeed the genius of Racine and nothing more?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought so at first. I was soon to be undeceived when the curtain fell on the act from Ph\u00e8dre, amid enthusiastic recalls from the audience, through which the old actress, beside herself with rage, drawing her little body up to its full height, turning sideways in her seat, stiffened the muscles of her face and folded her arms on her bosom to shew that she was not joining the others in their applause, and to make more noticeable a protest which to her appeared sensational though it passed unperceived. The piece that followed was one of those novelties which at one time I had expected, since they were not famous, to be inevitably trivial and of no general application, devoid as they were of any existence outside the performance that was being given of them at the moment. But I had not with them as with a classic the disappointment of seeing the infinity and eternity of a masterpiece occupy no more space or time than the width of the footlights and the length of a performance which would finish it as effectively as a piece written for the occasion. Besides, at every fresh passage which, I felt, had appealed to the audience and would onc day be famous, in place of the fame which it was prevented from having won in the past I added that which it would enjoy in the future, by a mental process the converse of that which consists in imagining masterpieces on the day of their first thin performance, when it seemed inconceivable that a title which no one had ever heard before could one day be set, bathed in the same mellow light, beside those of the author\u2019s other works. And this part would be set one day in the list of her finest impersonations, next to that of Ph\u00e8dre. Not that in itself it was not destitute of all literary merit. But Berma was as sublime in one as in the other. I realised then that the work of the playwright was for the actress no more than the material, the nature of which was comparatively unimportant, for the creation of her masterpiece of interpretation, just as the great painter whom I had met at Balbec, Elstir, had found the inspiration for two pictures of equal merit in a school building without any character and a cathedral which was in itself a work of art. And as the painter dissolves houses, carts, people, in some broad effect of light which makes them all alike, so Berma spread out great sheets of terror or tenderness over words that were all melted together in a common mould, lowered or raised to one level, which a lesser artist would have carefully detached from one another. No doubt each of them had an inflexion of its own, and Berma\u2019s diction did not prevent one from catching the rhythm of the verse. Is it not already a first element of ordered complexity, of beauty, when, on hearing a rhyme, that is to say something which is at once similar to and different from the preceding rhyme, which was prompted by it, but introduces the variety of a new idea, one is conscious of two systems overlapping each other, one intellectual, the other prosodie? But Berma at the same time made her words, her lines, her whole speeches even, flow into lakes of sound vaster than themselves, at the margins of which it was a joy to see them obliged to stop, to break off; thus it is that a poet takes pleasure in making hesitate for a moment at the rhyming point the word which is about to spring forth, and a composer in merging the various words of his libretto in a single rhythm which contradicts, captures and controls them. Thus into the prose sentences of the modern playwright as into the poetry of Racine Berma managed to introduce those vast images of grief, nobility, passion, which were the masterpieces of her own personal art, and in which she could be recognised as, in the portraits which he has made of different sitters, we recognise a painter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no longer any desire, as on the former occasion, to be able to arrest and perpetuate Berma\u2019s attitudes, the fine colour effect which she gave for a moment only in a beam of limelight which at once faded never to reappear, nor to make her repeat a single line a hundred times over. I realised that my original desire had been more exacting than the intentions of the poet, the actress, the great decorative artist who supervised her productions, and that that charm which floated over a line as it was spoken, those unstable poses perpetually transformed into others, those successive pictures were the transient result, the momentary object, the changing masterpiece which the art of the theatre undertook to create and which would perish were an attempt made to fix it for all time by a too much enraptured listener. I did not even make a resolution to come back another day and hear Berma again. I was satisfied with her; it was when I admired too keenly not to be disappointed by the object of my admiration, whether that object were Gilberte or Berma, that I demanded in advance, of the impression to be received on the morrow, the pleasure that yesterday\u2019s impression had refused to afford me. Without seeking to analyse the joy which I had begun now to feel, and might perhaps have been turning to some more profitable use, I said to myself, as in the old days I might have said to one of my schoolfellows: \u201cCertainly, I put Berma first!\u201d not without a confused feeling that Berma\u2019s genius was not, perhaps, very accurately represented by this affirmation of my preference, or this award to her of a \u2018first\u2019 place, whatever the peace of mind that it might incidentally restore to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as the curtain was rising on this second play I looked up at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s box. The Princess was in the act \u2014 by a movement that called into being an exquisite line which my mind pursued into the void \u2014 of turning her head towards the back of the box; her party were all standing, and also turning towards the back, and between the double hedge which they thus formed, with all the assurance, the grandeur of the goddess that she was, but with a strange meekness which so late an arrival, making every one else get up in the middle of the performance, blended with the white muslin in which she was attired, just as an adroitly compounded air of simplicity, shyness and confusion tempered her triumphant smile, the Duchesse de Guermantes, who had at that moment entered the box, came towards her cousin, made a profound obeisance to a young man with fair hair who was seated in the front row, and turning again towards the amphibian monsters who were floating in the recesses of the cavern, gave to these demi-gods of the Jockey Club \u2014 who at that moment, and among them all M. de Palancy in particular, were the men whom I should most have liked to be \u2014 the familiar \u2018good evening\u2019 of an old and intimate friend, an allusion to the daily sequence of her relations with them during the last fifteen years. I felt the mystery, but could not solve the riddle of that smiling gaze which she addressed to her friends, in the azure brilliance with which it glowed while she surrendered her hand to one and then to another, a gaze which, could I have broken up its prism, analysed its crystallisation, might perhaps have revealed to me the essential quality of the unknown form of life which became apparent in it at that moment. The Duc de Guermantes followed his wife, the flash of his monocle, the gleam of his teeth, the whiteness of his carnation or of his pleated shirt-front scattering, to make room for their light, the darkness of his eyebrows, lips and coat; with a wave of his outstretched hand which he let drop on to their shoulders, vertically, without moving his head, he commanded the inferior monsters, who were making way for him, to resume their seats, and made a profound bow to the fair young man. One would have said that the Duchess had guessed that her cousin, of whom, it was rumoured, she was inclined to make fun for what she called her \u2018exaggerations\u2019 (a name which, from her own point of view, so typically French and restrained, would naturally be applied to the poetry and enthusiasm of the Teuton), would be wearing this evening one of those costumes in which the Duchess thought of her as \u2018dressed up,\u2019 and that she had decided to give her a lesson in good taste. Instead of the wonderful downy plumage which, from the crown of the Princess\u2019s head, fell and swept her throat, instead of her net of shells and pearls, the Duchess wore in her hair only a simple aigrette, which, rising above her arched nose and level eyes, reminded one of the crest on the head of a bird. Her neck and shoulders emerged from a drift of snow-white muslin, against which fluttered a swansdown fan, but below this her gown, the bodice of which had for its sole ornament innumerable spangles (either little sticks and beads of metal, or possibly brilliants), moulded her figure with a precision that was positively British. But different as their two costumes were, after the Princess had given her cousin the chair in which she herself had previously been sitting, they could be seen turning to gaze at one another in mutual appreciation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly a smile would curve the lips of Mme. de Guermantes when next day she referred to the headdress, a little too complicated, which the Princess had worn, but certainly she would declare that it had been, all the same, quite lovely, and marvellously arranged; and the Princess, whose own tastes found something a little cold, a little austere, a little \u2018tailor-made\u2019 in her cousin\u2019s way of dressing, would discover in this rigid sobriety an exquisite refinement. Moreover the harmony that existed between them, the universal and pre-established gravitation exercised by their upbringing, neutralised the contrasts not only in their apparel but in their attitude. By those invisible magnetic longitudes which the refinement of their manners traced between them the expansive nature of the Princess was stopped short, while on the other side the formal correctness of the Duchess allowed itself to be attracted and relaxed, turned to sweetness and charm. As, in the play which was now being performed, to realise how much personal poetry Berma extracted from it one had only to entrust the part which she was playing, which she alone could play, to no matter what other actress, so the spectator who should raise his eyes to the balcony might see in two smaller boxes there how an \u2018arrangement\u2019 supposed to suggest that of the Princesse de Guermantes simply made the Baronne de Morienval appear eccentric, pretentious and ill-bred, while an effort, as painstaking as it must have been costly, to imitate the clothes and style of the Duchesse de Guermantes only made Mme. de Cambremer look like some provincial schoolgirl, mounted on wires, rigid, erect, dry, angular, with a plume of raven\u2019s feathers stuck vertically in her hair. Perhaps the proper place for this lady was not a theatre in which it was only with the brightest stars of the season that the boxes (even those in the highest tier, which from below seemed like great hampers brimming with human flowers and fastened to the gallery on which they stood by the red cords of their plush-covered partitions) composed a panorama which deaths, scandals, illnesses, quarrels would soon alter, but which this evening was held motionless by attention, heat, giddiness, dust, smartness or boredom, in that so to speak everlasting moment of unconscious waiting and calm torpor which, in retrospect, seems always to have preceded the explosion of a bomb or the first flicker of a fire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The explanation of Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s presence on this occasion was that the Princesse de Parme, devoid of snobbishness as are most truly royal personages, and to make up for this devoured by a pride in and passion for charity which held an equal place in her heart with her taste for what she believed to be the Arts, had bestowed a few boxes here and there upon women like Mme. de Cambremer who were not numbered among the highest aristocratic society but with whom she was connected in various charitable undertakings. Mme. de Cambremer never took her eyes off the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes, which was all the simpler for her since, not being actually acquainted with either, she could not be suspected of angling for recognition. Inclusion in the visiting lists of these two great ladies was nevertheless the goal towards which she had been marching for the last ten years with untiring patience. She had calculated that she might reach it, possibly, in five years more. But having been smitten by a relentless malady, the inexorable character of which \u2014 for she prided herself upon her medical knowledge \u2014 she thought she knew, she was afraid that she might not live so long. This evening she was happy at least in the thought that all these women whom she barely knew would see in her company a man who was one of their own set, the young Marquis de Beausergent, Mme. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s brother, who moved impartially in both worlds and with whom the women of the second were greatly delighted to bedizen themselves before the eyes of those of the first. He was seated behind Mme. de Cambremer on a chair placed at an angle, so that he might rake the other boxes with his glasses. He knew everyone in the house, and, to greet his friends, with the irresistible charm of his beautifully curved figure, and fine fair head, he half rose from his seat, stiffening his body, a smile brightening his blue eyes, with a blend of deference and detachment, a picture delicately engraved, in its rectangular frame, and placed at an angle to the wall, like one of those old prints which portray a great nobleman in his courtly pride. He often accepted these invitations to go with Mme. de Cambremer to the play. In the theatre itself, and on their way out, in the lobby, he stood gallantly by her side in the thick of the throng of more brilliant friends whom he saw about him, and to whom he refrained from speaking, to avoid any awkwardness, just as though he had been in doubtful company. If at such moments there swept by him the Princesse de Guermantes, lightfoot and fair as Diana, letting trail behind her the folds of an incomparable cloak, turning after her every head and followed by every eye (and, most of all, by Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s), M. de Beausergent would become absorbed in conversation with his companion, acknowledging the friendly and dazzling smile of the Princess only with constraint, under compulsion, and with the well-bred reserve, the considerate coldness of a person whose friendliness might at the moment have been inconvenient\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had not Mme. de Cambremer known already that the box belonged to the Princess, she could still have told that the Duchesse de Guermantes was the guest from the air of keener interest with which she was surveying the spectacle of stage and stalls, out of politeness to her hostess. But simultaneously with this centrifugal force, an equal and opposite force generated by the same desire to be sociable drew her attention back to her own attire, her plume, her necklace, her bodice and also to that of the Princess, whose subject, whose slave her cousin seemed thus to proclaim herself, come thither solely to see her, ready to follow her elsewhere should it have taken the fancy of the official occupant of the box to rise and leave, and regarding as composed merely of strangers, worth looking at simply as curiosities, the rest of the house, in which, nevertheless, she numbered many friends to whose boxes she regularly repaired on other evenings and with regard to whom she never failed on those occasions to demonstrate a similar loyalism, exclusive, conditional and hebdomadary. Mme. de Cambremer was surprised to see her there that evening. She knew that the Duchess was staying on very late at Guermantes, and had supposed her to be there still. But she had been told, also, that sometimes, when there was some special function in Paris which she considered it worth her while to attend, Mme. de Guermantes would order one of her carriages to be brought round as soon as she had taken tea with the guns, and, as the sun was setting, start out at a spanking pace through the gathering darkness of the forest, then over the high road, to join the train at Combray and so be in Paris the same evening. \u201cPerhaps she has come up from Guermantes on purpose to hear Berma,\u201d thought Mme. de Cambremer, and marvelled at the thought. And she remembered having heard Swann say in that ambiguous jargon which he used in common with M. de Charlus: \u201cThe Duchess is one of the noblest souls in Paris, the cream of the most refined, the choicest society.\u201d For myself, who derived from the names Guermantes, Bavaria and Cond\u00e9 what I imagined to be the life, the thoughts of the two cousins (I could no longer so ascribe their faces, having seen them), I would rather have had their opinion of Ph\u00e8dre than that of the greatest critic in the world. For in his I should have found merely intellect, an intellect superior to my own but similar in kind. But what the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes might think, an opinion which would have furnished me with an invaluable clue to the nature of these two poetic creatures, I imagined with the aid of their names, I endowed with an irrational charm, and, with the thirst, the longing of a fever-stricken wretch, what I demanded that their opinion of Ph\u00e8dre should yield to me was the charm of the summer afternoons that I had spent in wandering along the Guermantes way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Cambremer was trying to make out how exactly the cousins were dressed. For my own part, I never doubted that their garments were peculiar to themselves, not merely in the sense in which the livery with red collar or blue facings had belonged once exclusively to the houses of Guermantes and Cond\u00e9, but rather as is peculiar to a bird the plumage which, as well as being a heightening of its beauty, is an extension of its body. The toilet of these two ladies seemed to me like a materialisation, snow-white or patterned with colour, of their internal activity, and, like the gestures which I had seen the Princesse de Guermantes make, with no doubt in my own mind that they corresponded to some idea latent in hers, the plumes which swept downward from her brow, and her cousin\u2019s glittering spangled bodice seemed each to have a special meaning, to be to one or the other lady an attribute which was hers and hers alone, the significance of which I would eagerly have learned; the bird of paradise seemed inseparable from its wearer as her peacock is from Juno, and I did not believe that any other woman could usurp that spangled bodice, any more than the fringed and flashing aegis of Minerva. And when I turned my eyes to their box, far more than on the ceiling of the theatre, painted with cold and lifeless allegories, it was as though I had seen, thanks to a miraculous rending of the clouds that ordinarily veiled it, the Assembly of the Gods in the act of contemplating the spectacle of mankind, beneath a crimsor canopy, in a clear lighted space, between two pillars of Heaven. I gazed on this brief transfiguration with a disturbance which was partly soothed by the feeling that I myself was unknown to these Immortals; the Duchess had indeed seen me once with her husband, but could surely have kept no memory of that, and it gave me no pain that she found herself, owing to the place that she occupied in the box, in a position to gaze down upon the nameless, collective madrepores of the public in the stalls, for I had the happy sense that my own personality had been dissolved in theirs, when, at the moment in which, by the force of certain optical laws, there must, I suppose, have come to paint itself on the impassive current of those blue eyes the blurred outline of the protozoon, devoid of any individual existence, which was myself, I saw a ray illumine them; the Duchess, goddess turned woman, and appearing in that moment a thousand times more lovely, raised, pointed in my direction the white-gloved hand which had been resting on the balustrade of the box, waved it at me in token of friendship; my gaze felt itself trapped in the spontaneous incandescence of the flashing eyes of the Princess, who had unconsciously set them ablaze merely by turning her head to see who it might be that her cousin was thus greeting, while the Duchess, who had remembered me, showered upon me the sparkling and celestial torrent of her smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now every morning, long before the hour at which she would appear, I went by a devious course to post myself at the corner of the street along which she generally came, and, when the moment of her arrival seemed imminent, strolled homewards with an air of being absorbed in something else, looking the other way and raising my eyes to her face as I drew level with her, but as though I had not in the least expected to see her. Indeed, for the first few mornings, so as to be sure of not missing her, I waited opposite the house. And every time that the carriage gate opened (letting out one after another so many people who were none of them she for whom I was waiting) its grinding rattle continued in my heart in a series of oscillations which it took me a long time to subdue. For never was devotee of a famous actress whom he did not know, posting himself and patrolling the pavement outside the stage door, never was angry or idolatrous crowd, gathered to insult or to carry in triumph through the streets the condemned assassin or the national hero whom it believes to be on the point of coming whenever a sound is heard from the inside of the prison or the palace, never were these so stirred by their emotion as I was, awaiting the emergence of this great lady who in her simple attire was able, by the grace of her movements (quite different from the gait she affected on entering a drawing-room or a box), to make of her morning walk \u2014 and for me there was no one in the world but herself out walking \u2014 a whole poem of elegant refinement and the finest ornament, the most curious flower of the season. But after the third day, so that the porter should not discover my stratagem, I betook myself much farther afield, to some point upon the Duchess\u2019s usual route. Often before that evening at the theatre I had made similar little excursions before luncheon when the weather was fine; if it had been raining, at the first gleam of sunshine I would hasten downstairs to take a turn, and if, suddenly, coming towards me, on the still wet pavement changed by the sun into a golden lacquer, in the transformation scene of a crossroads dusty with a grey mist which the sun tanned and gilded, I caught sight of a schoolgirl followed by her governess or of a dairy-maid with her white sleeves, I stood motionless, my hand pressed to my heart which was already leaping towards an unexplored form of life; I tried to bear in mind the street, the time, the number of the door through which the girl (whom I followed sometimes) had vanished and failed to reappear. Fortunately the fleeting nature of these cherished images, which I promised myself that I would make an effort to see again, prevented them from fixing themselves with any vividness in my memory. No matter, I was less sad now at the thought of my own ill health, of my never having summoned up courage to set to work, to begin a book, the world appeared to me now a pleasanter place to live in, life a more interesting experience now that I had learned that the streets of Paris, like the roads round Balbec, were aflower with those unknown beauties whom I had so often sought to evoke from the woods of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, each one of whom aroused a sensual longing which she alone appeared capable of assuaging\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On coming home from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique I had added for next morning to the list of those which for some days past I had been hoping to meet again the form of Mme. de Guermantes, tall, with her high-piled crown of silky, golden hair; with the kindness promised me in the smile which she had directed at me from her cousin\u2019s box. I would follow the course which Fran\u00e7oise had told me that the Duchess generally took, and I would try at the same time, in the hope of meeting two girls whom I had seen a few days earlier, not to miss the break-up of their respective class and catechism. But in the mean time, ever and again, the scintillating smile of Mme. de Guermantes, the pleasant sensation it had given me, returned. And without exactly knowing what I was doing, I tried to find a place for them (as a woman studies the possible effect on her dress of some set of jewelled buttons that have just been given her) beside the romantic ideas which I had long held and which Albertine\u2019s coldness, Gis\u00e8le\u2019s premature departure, ana before them my deliberate and too long sustained separation from Gilberte, had set free (the idea, for instance of being loved by a woman, of having a life in common with her); next, it had been the image of one or other of the two girls seen in the street that I brought into relation with those ideas, to which immediately afterwards I was trying to adapt my memory of the Duchess. Compared with those ideas my memory of Mme. de Guermantes at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was a very little thing, a tiny star twinkling beside the long tail of a blazing comet; moreover I had been quite familiar with the ideas long before I came to know Mme. de Guermantes; my memory of her, on the contrary, I possessed but imperfectly; every now and then it escaped me; it was during the hours when, from floating vaguely in my mind in the same way as the images of various other pretty women, it passed gradually into a unique and definite association \u2014 exclusive of every other feminine form \u2014 with those romantic ideas of so much longer standing than itself, it was during those few hours in which I remembered it most clearly that I ought to have taken steps to find out exactly what it was; but I did not then know the importance which it was to assume for me; it was pleasant merely as a first private meeting with Mme. de Guermantes inside myself, it was the first, the only accurate sketch, the only one taken from life, the only one that was really Mme. de Guermantes; during the few hours in which I was fortunate enough to retain it without having the sense to pay it any attention, it must all the same have been charming, that memory, since it was always to it, and quite freely moreover, to that moment, without haste, without strain, without the slightest compulsion or anxiety, that my ideas of love returned; then, as gradually those ideas fixed it more definitely, it acquired from them a proportionately greater strength but itself became more vague; presently I could no longer recapture it; and in my dreams I probably altered it completely, for whenever I saw Mme. de Guermantes I realised the difference \u2014 never twice, as it happened, the same \u2014 between what I had imagined and what I saw. And now every morning, certainly at the moment when Mme. de Guermantes emerged from her gateway at the top of the street I saw again her tall figure, her face with its bright eyes and crown of silken hair \u2014 all the things for which I was there waiting; but, on the other hand, a minute or two later, when, having first turned my eyes away so as to appear not to be waiting for this encounter which I had come out to seek, I raised them to look at the Duchess at the moment in which we converged, what I saw then were red patches (as to which I knew not whether they were due to the fresh air or to a faulty complexion) on a sullen face which with the curtest of nods, a long way removed from the affability of the Ph\u00e8dre evening, acknowledged my salute, which I addressed to her daily with an air of surprise, and which did not seem to please her. And yet, after a few days, during which the memory of the two girls fought against heavy odds for the mastery of my amorous feelings against that of Mme. de Guermantes, it was in the end the latter which, as though of its own accord, generally prevailed while its competitors withdrew; it was to it that I finally found myself, deliberately moreover, and as though by preference and for my own pleasure, to have transferred all my thoughts of love. I had ceased to dream of the little girls coming from their catechism, or of a certain dairy-maid; and yet I had also lost all hope of encountering in the street what I had come out to seek, either the affection promised to me, at the theatre, in a smile, or the profile, the bright face beneath its pile of golden hair which were so only when seen from afar. Now I should not even have been able to say what Mme. de Guermantes was like, by what I recognised her, for every day, in the picture which she presented as a whole, the face was different, as were the dress and the hat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why did I one morning, when I saw bearing down on me beneath a violet hood a sweet, smooth face whose charms were symmetrically arranged about a pair of blue eyes, a face in which the curve of the nose seemed to have been absorbed, gauge from a joyous commotion in my bosom that I was not going to return home without having caught a glimpse of Mme. de Guermantes; and on the next feel the same disturbance, affect the same indifference, turn away my eyes in the same careless manner as on the day before, on the apparition, seen in profile as she crossed from a side street and crowned by a navy-blue toque, of a beak-like nose bounding a flushed cheek chequered with a piercing eye, like some Egyptian deity? Once it was not merely a woman with a bird\u2019s beak that I saw but almost the bird itself; the outer garments, even the toque of Mme. de Guermantes were of fur, and since she thus left no cloth visible, she seemed naturally furred, like certain vultures whose thick, smooth, dusky, downy plumage suggests rather the skin of a wild beast. From the midst of this natural plumage, the tiny head arched out its beak and the two eyes on its surface were piercing-keen and blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day I had been pacing up and down the street for hours on end without a vestige of Mme. de Guermantes when suddenly, inside a pastrycook\u2019s shop tucked in between two of the mansions of this aristocratic and plebeian quarter, there appeared, took shape the vague and unfamiliar face of a fashionably dressed woman who was asking to see some little cakes, and, before I had had time to make her out, there shot forth at me like a lightning flash, reaching me sooner than its accompaniment of thunder, the glance of the Duchess; another time, having failed to meet her and hearing twelve strike, I realised that it was not worth my while to wait for her any longer, I Was sorrowfully making my way homewards; and, absorbed in my own disappointment, looking absently after and not seeing a carriage that had overtaken me, I realised suddenly that the movement of her head which I saw a lady make through the carriage window was meant for me, and that this lady, whose features, relaxed and pale, or it might equally be tense and vivid, composed, beneath a round hat which nestled at the foot of a towering plume, the face of a stranger whom I had supposed that I did not know, was Mme. de Guermantes, by whom I had let myself be greeted without so much as acknowledging her bow. And sometimes I came upon her as I entered the gate, standing outside the lodge where the detestable porter whose scrutinous eye I loathed and dreaded was in the act of making her a profound obeisance and also, no doubt, his daily report. For the entire staff of the Guermantes household, hidden behind the window curtains, were trembling as they watched a conversation which they were unable to overhear, but which meant as they very well knew that one or other of them would certainly have his \u2018day out\u2019 stopped by the Duchess to whom this Cerberus was betraying him. In view of the whole series of different faces which Mme. Guermantes displayed thus one after another, faces that occupied a relative and varying extent, contracted one day, vast the next, in her person and attire as a whole, my love was not attached to any one of those changeable and ever-changing elements of flesh and fabric which replaced one another as day followed day, and which she could modify, could almost entirely reconstruct without altering my disturbance because beneath them, beneath the new collar and the strange cheek, I felt that it was still Mme. de Guermantes. What I loved was the invisible person who set all this outward show in motion, her whose hostility so distressed me, whose approach set me trembling, whose life I would fain have made my own and driven out of it her friends. She might flaunt a blue feather or shew a fiery cheek without her actions\u2019 losing their importance for me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should not myself have felt that Mme. de Guermantes was tired of meeting me day after day, had I not learned it indirectly by reading it on the face, stiff with coldness, disapproval and pity which Fran\u00e7oise shewed when she was helping me to get ready for these morning walks. The moment I asked her for my outdoor things I felt a contrary wind arise in her worn and battered features. I made no attempt to win her confidence, for I knew that I should not succeed. She had, for at once discovering any unpleasant thing that might have happened to my parents or myself, a power the nature of which I have never been able to fathom. Perhaps it was not supernatural, but was to be explained by sourees of information that were open to her alone: as it may happen that the news which often reaches a savage tribe several days before the post has brought it to the European colony has really been transmitted to them not by telepathy but from hill-top to hill-top by a chain of beacon fires. So, in the particular instance of my morning walks, possibly Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s servants had heard their mistress say how tired she was of running into me every day without fail wherever she went, and had repeated her remarks to Fran\u00e7oise. My parents might, it is true, have attached some servant other than Fran\u00e7oise to my person, still I should have been no better off. Fran\u00e7oise was in a sense less of a servant than the others. In her way of feeling things, of being kind and pitiful, hard and distant, superior and narrow, of combining a white skin with red hands, she was still the village maiden whose parents had had \u2018a place of their own\u2019 but having come to grief had been obliged to put her into service. Her presence in our household was the country air, the social life of a farm of fifty years ago wafted to us by a sort of reversal of the normal order of travel whereby it is the place that comes to visit the person. As the glass cases in a local museum are filled with specimens of the curious handiwork which the peasants still carve or embroider or whatever it may be in certain parts of the country, so our flat in Paris was decorated with the words of Fran\u00e7oise, inspired by a traditional local sentiment and governed by extremely ancient laws. And she could in Paris find her way back as though by clues of coloured thread to the songbirds and cherry trees of her childhood, to her mother\u2019s deathbed, which she still vividly saw. But in spite of all this wealth of background, once she had come to Paris and had entered our service she had acquired \u2014 as, obviously, anyone else coming there in her place would have acquired \u2014 the ideas, the system of interpretation used by the servants on the other floors, compensating for the respect which she was obliged to shew to us by repeating the rude words that the cook on the fourth floor had used to her mistress, with a servile gratification so intense that, for the first time in our lives, feeling a sort of solidarity between ourselves and the detestable occupant of the fourth floor flat, we said to ourselves that possibly we too were \u2018employers\u2019 after all. This alteration in Fran\u00e7oise\u2019\u00bb character was perhaps inevitable. Certain forms of existence are so abnormal that they are bound to produce certain characteristic faults; such was the life led by the King at Versailles among his courtiers, a life as strange as that of a Pharaoh or a Doge \u2014 and, far more even than his, the life of his courtiers. The life led by our servants is probably of an even more monstrous abnormality, which only its familiarity can prevent us from seeing. But it was actually in details more intimate still that I should have been obliged, if I had dismissed Fran\u00e7oise, to keep the same servant. For various others might, in years to come, enter my service; already furnished with the defects common to all servants, they underwent nevertheless a rapid transformation with me. As, in the rules of tactics, an attack in one sector compels a counter-attack in another, so as not to be hurt by the asperities of my nature, all of them effected in their own an identical resilience, always at the same points, and to make up for this took advantage of the gaps in my line to thrust out advanced posts. Of these gaps I knew nothing, any more than of the salients to which they gave rise, precisely because they were gaps. But my servants, by gradually becoming spoiled, taught me of their existence. It was from the defects which they invariably acquired that I learned what were my own natural and invariable shortcomings; their character offered me a sort of negative plate of my own. We had always laughed, my mother and I, at Mme. Sazerat, who used, in speaking of her servants, expressions like \u2018the lower orders\u2019 or \u2018the servant class.\u2019 But I am bound to admit that what made it useless to think of replacing Fran\u00e7oise by anyone else was that her successor would inevitably have belonged just as much to the race of servants in general and to the class of my servants in particular\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to Fran\u00e7oise, I never in my life experienced any humiliation without having seen beforehand on her face a store of condolences prepared and waiting; and if then in my anger at the thought of being pitied by her I tried to pretend that on the contrary I had scored a distinct success, my lies broke feebly on the wall of her respectful but obvious unbelief and the consciousness that she enjoyed of her own infallibility. For she knew the truth. She refrained from uttering it, and made only a slight movement with her lips as if she still bad her mouth full and was finishing a tasty morsel. She refrained from uttering it, or so at least I long believed, for at that time I still supposed that it was by means of words that one communicated the truth to others. Indeed the words that people used to me recorded their meaning so unalterably on the sensitive plate of my mind that I could no more believe it to be possible that anyone who had professed to love me did not love me than Fran\u00e7oise herself could have doubted when she had read it in a newspaper that some clergyman or gentleman was prepared, on receipt of a stamped envelope, to furnish us free of charge with an infallible remedy for every known complaint or with the means of multiplying our income an hundredfold. (If, on the other hand, our doctor were to prescribe for her the simplest ointment to cure a cold in the head, she, so stubborn to endure the keenest suffering, would complain bitterly of what she had been made to sniff, insisting that it tickled her nose and that life was not worth living.) But she was the first person to prove to me by her example (which I was not to understand until, long afterwards, when it was given me afresh and to my greater discomfort, as will be found in the later volumes of this work, by a person who was dearer to me than Fran\u00e7oise) that the truth has no need to be uttered to be made apparent, and that one may perhaps gather it with more certainty, without waiting for words, without even bothering one\u2019s head about them, from a thousand outward signs, even from certain invisible phenomena, analogous in the sphere of human character to what in nature are atmospheric changes. I might perhaps have suspected this. since to myself at that time it frequently occurred that I said things in which there was no vestige of truth, while I made the real truth plain by all manner of involuntary confidences expressed by my body and in my actions (which were at once interpreted by Fran\u00e7oise); I ought perhaps to have suspected it, but to do so I should first have had to be conscious that I myself was occasionally untruthful and dishonest. Now untruthfulness and dishonesty were with me, as with most people; called into being in so immediate, so contingent a fashion, and in self-defence, by some particular interest, that my mind, fixed on some lofty ideal, allowed my character, in the darkness below, to set about those urgent, sordid tasks, and did net look down to observe them. When Fran\u00e7oise, in the evening, was polite to me, and asked my permission before sitting down in my room, it seemed as though her face became transparent and I could see the goodness and honesty that lay beneath. But Jupien, who had lapses into indiscretion of which I learned only later, revealed afterwards that she had told him that I was not worth the price of a rope to hang me, and that I had tried to insult her in every possible way. These words of Jupien set up at once before my eyes, in new and strange colours, a print of the picture of my relations with Fran\u00e7oise so different from that on which I used to like letting my eyes rest, and in which, without the least possibility of doubt, Fran\u00e7oise adored me and lost no opportunity of singing my praises, that I realised that it is not only the material world that is different from the aspect in which we see it; that all reality is perhaps equally dissimilar from what we think ourselves to be directly perceiving; that the trees, the sun and the sky would not be the same as what we see if they were apprehended by creatures having eyes differently constituted from ours, or, better still, endowed for that purpose with organs other than eyes which would furnish trees and sky and sun with equivalents, though not visual. However that might be, this sudden outlet which Jupien threw open for me upon the real world appalled me. So far it was only Fran\u00e7oise that was revealed, and of her I barely thought. Was it the same with all one\u2019s social relations? And in what depths of despair might this not some day plunge me, if it were the same with love? That was the future\u2019s secret. For the present only Fran\u00e7oise was concerned. Did she sincerely believe what she had said to Jupien? Had she said it to embroil Jupien with me, possibly so that we should not appoint Jupien\u2019s girl as her successor? At any rate I realised the impossibility of obtaining any direct and certain knowledge of whether Fran\u00e7oise loved or lothed me. And thus it was she who first gave me the idea that a person does not (as I had imagined) stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits, his defects, his plans, his intentions with regard to ourself exposed on his surface, like a garden at which, with all its borders spread out before us, we gaze through a railing, but is a shadow which we can never succeed in penetrating, of which there can be no such thing as direct knowledge, with respect to which we form countless beliefs, based upon his words and sometimes upon his actions, though neither words nor actions can give us anything but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information \u2014 a shadow behind which we can alternately imagine, with equal justification, that there burns the flame of hatred and of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was genuinely in love with Mme. de Guermantes. The greatest happiness that I could have asked of God would have been that He should overwhelm her under every imaginable calamity, and that ruined, despised, stripped of all the privileges that divided her from me, having no longer any home of her own or people who would condescend to speak to her, she should come to me for refuge. I imagined her doing so. And indeed on those evenings when some change in the atmosphere or in my own condition brought to the surface of my consciousness some forgotten scroll on which were recorded impressions of other days, instead of profiting by the refreshing strength that had been generated in me, instead of employing it to decipher in my own mind thoughts which as a rule escaped me, instead of setting myself at last to work, I preferred to relate aloud, to plan out in the third person, with a flow of invention as useless as was my declamation of it, a whole novel crammed with adventure, in which the Duchess, fallen upon misfortune, came to implore assistance from me \u2014 me who had become, by a converse change of circumstances, rich and powerful. And when I had let myself thus for hours on end imagine the circumstances, rehearse the sentences with which I should welcome the Duchess beneath my roof, the situation remained unaltered; I had, alas, in reality, chosen to love the very woman who, in her own person, combined perhaps the greatest possible number of different advantages; in whose eyes, accordingly, I could not hope, myself, ever to cut any figure; for she was as rich as the richest commoner \u2014 and noble also; without reckoning that personal charm which set her at the pinnacle of fashion, made her among the rest a sort of queen\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt that I was annoying her by crossing her path in this way every morning; but even if I had had the courage to refrain, for two or three days consecutively, from doing so, perhaps that abstention, which would have represented so great a sacrifice on my part, Mme. de Guermantes would not have noticed, or would have set it down to some obstacle beyond my control. And indeed I could not have succeeded in making myself cease to track her down except by arranging that it should be impossible for me to do so, for the need incessantly reviving in me to meet her, to be for a moment the object of her attention, the person to whom her bow was addressed, was stronger than my fear of arousing her displeasure. I should have had to go away for some time; and for that I had not the heart. I did think of it more than once. I would then tell Fran\u00e7oise to pack my boxes, and immediately afterwards to unpack them. And as the spirit of imitation, the desire not to appear behind the times, alters the most natural and most positive form of oneself, Fran\u00e7oise, borrowing the expression from her daughter\u2019s vocabulary, used to remark that I was \u2018dippy.\u2019 She did not approve of this; she said that I was always \u2018balancing,\u2019 for she made use, when she was not aspiring to rival the moderns, of the language of Saint-Simon. It is true that she liked it still less when I spoke to her as master to servant. She knew that this was not natural to me, and did not suit me, a condition which she rendered in words as \u2018where there isn\u2019t a will.\u2019 I should never have had the heart to leave Paris except in a direction that would bring me closer to Mme. de Guermantes. This was by no means an impossibility. Should I not indeed find myself nearer to her than I was in the morning, in the street, solitary, abashed, feeling that not a single one of the thoughts which I should have liked to convey to her ever reached her, in that weary patrolling up and down of walks which might be continued, day after day, for ever without the slightest advantage to myself, if I were to go miles away from Mme. de Guermantes, but go to some one of her acquaintance, some one whom she knew to be particular in the choice of his friends and who would appreciate my good qualities, would be able to speak to her about me, and if not to obtain it from her at least to make her know what I wanted, some one by means of whom, in any event, simply because I should discuss with him whether or not it would be possible for him to convey this or that message to her, I should give to my solitary and silent meditations a new form, spoken, active, which would seem an advance, almost a realisation. What she did during the mysterious daily life of the \u2018Guermantes\u2019 that she was \u2014 this was the constant object of my thoughts; and to break through the mystery, even by indirect means, as with a lever, by employing the services of a person to whom were not forbidden the town house of the Duchess, her parties, unrestricted conversation with her, would not that be a contact more distant but at the same time more effective than my contemplation of her every morning in the street?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The friendship, the admiration that Saint-Loup felt for me seemed to me undeserved and had hitherto left me unmoved. All at once I attached a value to them, I would have liked him to disclose them to Mme. de Guermantes, I was quite prepared even to ask him to do so. For when we are in love, all the trifling little privileges that we enjoy we would like to be able to divulge to the woman we love, as people who have been disinherited and bores of other kinds do to us in everyday life. We are distressed by her ignorance of them; we seek consolation in the thought that just because they are never visible she has perhaps added to the opinion which she already had of us this possibility of further advantages that must remain unknown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup had not for a long time been able to come to Paris, whether, as he himself explained, on account of his military duties, or, as was more likely, on account of the trouble that he was having with his mistress, with whom he had twice now been on the point of breaking off relations. He had often told me what a pleasure it would be to him if I came to visit him at that garrison town, the name of which, a couple of days after his leaving Balbec, had caused me so much joy when I had read it on the envelope of the first letter I received from my friend. It was (not so far from Balbec as its wholly inland surroundings might have led one to think) one of those little fortified towns, aristocratic and military, set in a broad expanse of country over which on fine days there floats so often into the distance a sort of intermittent haze of sound which \u2014 as a screen of poplars by its sinuosities outlines the course of a river which one cannot see \u2014 indicates the movements of a regiment on parade, so that the very atmosphere of its streets, avenues and squares has been gradually tuned to a sort of perpetual vibration, musical and martial, while the most ordinary note of cartwheel or tramway is prolonged in vague trumpet calls, indefinitely repeated, to the hallucinated ear, by the silence. It was not too far away from Paris for me to be able, if I took the express, to return, join my mother and grandmother and sleep in my own bed. As soon as I realised this, troubled by a painful longing, I had too little will power to decide not to return to Paris but rather to stay in this town; but also too little to prevent a porter from carrying my luggage to a cab and not to adopt, as I walked behind him, the unburdened mind of a traveller who is looking after his luggage and for whom no grandmother is waiting anywhere at home, to get into the carriage with the complete detachment of a person who, having ceased to think of what it is that he wants, has the air of knowing what he wants, and to give the driver the address of the cavalry barracks. I thought that Saint-Loup might come to sleep that night at the hotel at which I should be staying, so as to make less painful for me the first shock of contact with this strange town. One of the guard went to find him, and I waited at the barrack gate, before that huge ship of stone, booming with the November wind, out of which, every moment, for it was now six o\u2019clock, men were emerging in pairs into the street, staggering as if they were coming ashore in some foreign port in which they found themselves temporarily anchored\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup appeared, moving like a whirlwind, his eyeglass spinning in the air before him; I had not given my name, I was eager to enjoy his surprise and delight. \u201cOh! What a bore!\u201d he exclaimed, suddenly catching sight of me, and blushing to the tips of his ears. \u201cI have just had a week\u2019s leave, and I shan\u2019t be off duty again for another week.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, preoccupied by the thought of my having to spend this first night alone, for he knew better than anyone my bed-time agonies, which he had often remarked and soothed at Balbec, he broke off his lamentation to turn and look at me, coax me with little smiles, with tender though unsymmetrical glances, half of them coming directly from his eye, the other half through his eyeglass, but both sorts alike an allusion to the emotion that he felt on seeing me again, an allusion also to that important matter which I did not always understand but which concerned me now vitally, our friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say! Where are you going to sleep? Really, I can\u2019t recommend the hotel where we mess; it is next to the Exhibition ground, where there\u2019s a show just starting; you\u2019ll find it beastly crowded. No, you\u2019d better go to the H\u00f4tel de Flandre; it is a little eighteenth-century palace with old tapestries. It \u2018makes\u2019 quite an \u2018old-world residence.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup employed in every connexion the word \u2018makes\u2019 for \u2018has the air of,\u2019 because the spoken language, like the written, feels from time to time the need of these alterations in the meanings of words, these refinements of expression. And just as journalists often have not the least idea from what school of literature come the \u2018turns of speech\u2019 that they borrow, so the vocabulary, the very diction of Saint-Loup were formed in imitation of three different aesthetes, none of whom he knew personally but whose way of speaking had been indirectly instilled into him. \u201cBesides,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe hotel I mean is more or less adapted to your supersensitiveness of hearing. You will have no neighbours. I quite see that it is a slender advantage, and as, after all, another visitor may arrive to-morrow, it would not be worth your while to choose that particular hotel with so precarious an object in view. No, it is for its appeal to the eye that I recommend it. The rooms are quite attractive, all the furniture is old and comfortable; there is something reassuring about that.\u201d But to me, less of an artist than Saint-Loup, the pleasure that an attractive house could give was superficial, almost non-existent, and could not calm my growing anguish, as painful as that which I used to feel long ago at Combray when my mother did not come upstairs to say good night, or that which I felt on the evening of my arrival at Balbec in the room with the unnaturally high ceiling, which smelt of flowering grasses. Saint-Loup read all this in my fixed gaze\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA lot you care, though, about this charming palace, my poor fellow; you\u2019re quite pale; and here am I like a great brute talking to you about tapestries which you won\u2019t have the heart to look at, even. I know the room they\u2019ll put you in; personally I find it most enlivening, but I can quite understand that it won\u2019t have the same effect on you with your sensitive nature. You mustn\u2019t think I don\u2019t understand; I don\u2019t feel the same myself, but I can put myself in your place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment a serjeant who was exercising a horse on the square, entirely absorbed in making the animal jump, disregarding the salutes of passing troopers, but hurling volleys of oaths at such as got in his way, turned with a smile to Saint-Loup and, seeing that he had a friend with him, saluted us. But his horse at once reared. Saint-Loup flung himself at its head, caught it by the bridle, succeeded in quieting it and returned to my side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he resumed; \u201cI assure you that I fully understand; I feel for you as keenly as you do yourself. I am wretched,\u201d he went on, laying his hand lovingly on my shoulder, \u201cwhen I think that if I could have stayed with you to-night, I might have been able, if we talked till morning, to relieve you of a little of your unhappiness. I can lend you any number of books, but you won\u2019t want to read if you\u2019re feeling like that. And I shan\u2019t be able to get anyone else to take my duty here; I\u2019ve been off now twice running because my girl came down to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he knitted his brows partly with vexation and also in the effort to decide, like a doctor, what remedy he might best apply to my disease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRun along and light the fire in my quarters,\u201d he called to a trooper who passed us. \u201cHurry up; get a move on!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After which he turned once more to me, and his eyeglass and his peering, myopic gaze hinted an allusion to our great friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo! To see you here, in these barracks where I have spent so much time thinking about you, I can scarcely believe my eyes. I must be dreaming. And how are you? Better, I hope. You must tell me all about yourself presently. We\u2019ll go up to my room; we mustn\u2019t hang about too long on the square, there\u2019s the devil of a draught; I don\u2019t feel it now myself, but you aren\u2019t accustomed to it, I\u2019m afraid of your catching cold. And what about your work; have you started yet? No? You are a quaint fellow! If I had your talent I\u2019m sure I should be writing morning, noon and night. It amuses you more to do nothing? What a pity it is that it\u2019s the useless fellows like me who are always ready to work, and the ones who could if they wanted to, won\u2019t. There, and I\u2019ve clean forgotten to ask you how your grandmother is. Her Proudhons are in safe keeping. I never part from them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An officer, tall, handsome, majestic, emerged with slow and solemn gait from the foot of a staircase. Saint-Loup saluted him and arrested the perpetual instability of his body for the moment occupied in holding his hand against the peak of his cap. But he had flung himself into the action with so much force, straightening himself with so sharp a movement, and, the salute ended, let his hand fall with so abrupt a relaxation, altering all the positions of shoulder, leg, and eyeglass, that this moment was one not so much of immobility as of a throbbing tension in which were neutralised the excessive movements which he had just made and those on which he was about to embark. Meanwhile the officer, without coming any nearer us, calm, benevolent, dignified, imperial, representing, in short, the direct opposite of Saint-Loup, himself also, but without haste, raised his hand to the peak of his cap\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI must just say a word to the Captain,\u201d whispered Saint-Loup. \u201cBe a good fellow, and go and wait for me in my room. It\u2019s the second on the right, on the third floor; I\u2019ll be with you in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And setting off at the double, preceded by his eyeglass which fluttered in every direction, he made straight for the slow and stately Captain whose horse had just been brought round and who, before preparing to mount, was giving orders with a studied nobility of gesture as in some historical painting, and as though he were setting forth to take part in some battle of the First Empire, whereas he was simply going to ride home, to the house which he had taken for the period of his service at Donci\u00e8res, and which stood in a Square that was named, as though in an ironical anticipation of the arrival of this Napoleonid, Place de la R\u00e9publique. I started to climb the staircase, nearly slipping on each of its nail-studded steps, catching glimpses of barrack-rooms, their bare walls edged with a double line of beds and kits. I was shewn Saint-Loup\u2019s room. I stood for a moment outside its closed door, for I could hear some one stirring; he moved something, let fall something else; I felt that the room was not empty, that there must be somebody there. But it was only the freshly lighted fire beginning to burn. It could not keep quiet, it kept shifting its faggots about, and very clumsily. I entered the room; it let one roll into the fender and set another smoking. And even when it was not moving, like an ill-bred person it made noises all the time, which, from the moment I saw the flames rising, revealed themselves to me as noises made by a fire, although if I had been on the other side of a wall I should have thought that they came from some one who was blowing his nose and walking about. I sat down in the room and waited. Liberty hangings and old German stuffs of the eighteenth century managed to rid it of the smell that was exhaled by the rest of the building, a coarse, insipid, mouldy smell like that of stale toast. It was here, in this banning room, that I could have dined and slept with a calm and happy mind Saint-Loup seemed almost to be present by reason of the text-books which littered his table, between his photographs, among which I could make out my own and that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, by the light of the fire which had at length grown accustomed to the grate, and, like an animal crouching in an ardent, noiseless, faithful watchfulness, let fall only now and then a smouldering log which crumbled into sparks, or licked with a tongue of flame the sides of the chimney. I heard the tick of Saint-Loup\u2019s watch, which could not be far away. This tick changed its place every moment \u2018for I could not see the watch; it seemed to come from behind, from in front of me, from my right, from my left, sometimes to die away as though at a great distance. Suddenly I caught sight of the watch on the table. Then I heard the tick in a fixed place from which it did not move again. That is to say, I thought I heard it at this place; I did not hear it there; I saw it there, for sounds have no position in space. Or rather we associate them with movements, and in that way they serve the purpose of warning us of those movements, of appearing to make them necessary and natural. Certainly it happens commonly enough that a sick man whose ears have been stopped with cotton-wool ceases to hear the noise of a fire such as was crackling at that moment in Saint-Loup\u2019s fireplace, labouring at the formation of brands and cinders, which it then lets fall into the fender, nor would he hear the passage of the tramway-cars whose music took its flight, at regular intervals, over the Grand\u2019place of Donci\u00e8res. Let the sick man then read a book, and the pages will turn silently before him, as though they were moved by the fingers of a god. The dull thunder of a bath which is being filled becomes thin, faint and distant as the twittering of birds in the sky. The withdrawal of sound, its dilution, take from it all its power to hurt us; driven mad a moment ago by hammer-blows which seemed to be shattering the ceiling above our head, it is with a quiet delight that we now gather in their sound, light, caressing, distant, like the murmur of leaves playing by the roadside with the passing breeze. We play games of patience with cards which we do not hear, until we imagine that we have not touched them, that they are moving of their own accord, and, anticipating our desire to play with them, have begun to play with us. And in this connexion we may ask ourselves whether, in the case of love (to which indeed we may add the love of life and the love of fame, since there are, it appears, persons who are acquainted with these latter sentiments), we ought not to act like those who, when a noise disturbs them, instead of praying that it may cease, stop their ears; and, with them for our pattern, bring our attention, our defensive strength to bear on ourselves, give ourselves as an objective to capture not the \u2018other person\u2019 with whom we are in love but our capacity for suffering at that person\u2019s hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to the problem of sounds, we have only to thicken the wads which close the aural passages, and they confine to a pianissimo the girl who has just been playing a boisterous tune overhead; if we go farther, and steep the wad in grease, at once the whole household must obey its despotic rule; its laws extend even beyond our portals. Pianissimo is not enough; the wad instantly orders the piano to be shut, and the music lesson is abruptly ended; the gentleman who was walking up and down in the room above breaks off in the middle of his beat; the movement of carriages and tramways is interrupted as though a Sovereign were expected to pass. And indeed this attenuation of sounds sometimes disturbs our slumbers instead of guarding them. Only yesterday the incessant noise in our ears, by describing to us in a continuous narrative all that was happening in the street and in the house, succeeded at length in making us sleep, like L boring book; to-night, through the sheet of silence that is spread over our sleep a shock, louder than the rest, manages to make itself heard, gentle as a sigh, unrelated to any other sound, mysterious; and the call for an explanation which it emits is sufficient to awaken us. Take away for a moment from the sick man the cotton-wool that has been stopping his ears and in a flash the full daylight, the sun of sound dawns afresh, dazzling him, is born again in his universe; in all haste returns the multitude of exiled sounds; we are present, as though it were the chanting of choirs of angels, at the resurrection of the voice. The empty streets are filled for a moment with the whirr of the swift, consecutive wings of the singing tramway-cars. In the bedroom itself, the sick man has created, not, like Prometheus, fire, but the sound of fire. And when we increase or reduce the wads of cottonwool, it is as though we were pressing alternately one and the other of the two pedals with which we have extended the resonant compass of the outer world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only there are also suppressions of sound which are not temporary. The man who has grown completely deaf cannot even heat a pan of milk by his bedside, but he must keep an eye open to watch, on the tilted lid, for the white, arctic reflexion, like that of a coming snowstorm, which is the warning sign which he is wise to obey, by cutting off (as Our Lord bade the waves be still) the electric current; for already the swelling, jerkily climbing egg of boiling milk-film is reaching its climax in a series of sidelong movements, has filled and set bellying the drooping sails with which the cream has skimmed its surface, sends in a sudden storm a scud of pearly substance flying overboard \u2014 sails which the cutting off of the current, if the electric storm is hushed in time, will fold back upon themselves and let fall with the ebbing tide, changed now to magnolia petals. But if the sick man should not be quick enough in taking the necessary precautions, presently, when his drowned books and watch are seen barely emerging from the milky tide, he will be obliged to call the old nurse who, though he be himself an eminent statesman or a famous writer, will tell him that he has no more sense than a child of five. At other times in the magic chamber, between us and the closed door, a person who was not there a moment ago makes his appearance; it is a visitor whom we did not hear coming in, and who merely gesticulates, like a figure in one of those little puppet theatres, so restful for those who have taken a dislike to the spoken tongue. And for this totally deaf man, since the loss of a sense adds as much beauty to the world as its acquisition, it is with ecstasy that he walks now upon an earth grown almost an Eden, in which sound has not yet been created. The highest waterfalls unfold for his eyes alone their ribbons of crystal, stiller than the glassy sea, like the cascades of Paradise. As sound was for him before his deafness the perceptible form in which the cause of a movement was draped, objects moved without sound seemed to be being moved also without cause; deprived of all resonant quality, they shew a spontaneous activity, seem to be alive. They move, halt, become alight of their own accord. Of their own accord they vanish in the air like the winged monsters of prehistoric days. In the solitary and unneighboured home of the deaf man the service which, before his infirmity was complete, was already shewing an increased discretion, was being carried on in silence, is now assured him with a sort of surreptitious deftness, by mutes, as at the court of a fairy-tale king. And, as upon the stage, the building on which the deaf man looks from his window \u2014 be it barracks, church, or town hall \u2014 is only so much scenery. If one day it should fall to the ground, it may emit a cloud of dust and leave visible ruins; but, less material even than a palace on the stage, though it has not the same exiguity, it will subside in the magic universe without letting the fall of its heavy blocks of stone tarnish, with anything so vulgar as sound, the chastity of the prevailing silence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The silence, though only relative, which reigned in the little barrack-room where I sat waiting was now broken. The door opened and Saint-Loup, dropping his eyeglass, dashed in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, my dear Robert, you make yourself very comfortable here,\u201d I said to him; \u201chow jolly it would be if one were allowed to dine and sleep here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And to be sure, had it not been against the regulations, what repose untinged by sadness I could have tasted there, guarded by that atmosphere of tranquillity, vigilance and gaiety which was maintained by a thousand wills controlled and free from care, a thousand heedless spirits, in that great community called a barracks where, time having taken the form of action, the sad bell that tolled the hours outside was replaced by the same joyous clarion of those martial calls, the ringing memory of which was kept perpetually alive in the paved streets of the town, like the dust that floats in a sunbeam; \u2014 a voice sure of being heard, and musical because it was the command not only of authority to obedience but of wisdom to happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019d rather stay with me and sleep here, would you, than to go the hotel by yourself?\u201d Saint-Loup asked me, smiling\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Robert, it is cruel of you to be sarcastic about it,\u201d I pleaded; \u201cyou know it\u2019s not possible, and you know how wretched I shall be over there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood! You flatter me!\u201d he replied. \u201cIt occurred to me just now that you would rather stay here to-night. And that is precisely what I stopped to ask the Captain.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd he has given you leave?\u201d I cried\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe hadn\u2019t the slightest objection.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! I adore him!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; that would be going too far. But now, let me just get hold of my batman and tell him to see about our dinner,\u201d he went on, while I turned away so as to hide my tears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were several times interrupted by one or other of Saint-Loup\u2019s friends\u2019 coming in. He drove them all out again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGet out of here. Buzz off!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begged him to let them stay\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, really; they would bore you stiff; they are absolutely uncultured; all they can talk about is racing, or stables shop. Besides, I don\u2019t want them here either; they would spoil these precious moments I\u2019ve been looking forward to. But you mustn\u2019t think, when I tell you that these fellows are brainless, that everything military is devoid of intellectuality. Far from it. We have a major here who is a splendid chap. He\u2019s given us a course in which military history is treated like a demonstration, like a problem in algebra. Even from the aesthetic point of view there is a curious beauty, alternately inductive and deductive, about it which you couldn\u2019t fail to appreciate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s not the officer who\u2019s given me leave to stay here to-night?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; thank God! The man you \u2018adore\u2019 for so very trifling a service is the biggest fool that ever walked the face of the earth. He is perfect at looking after messing, and at kit inspections; he spends hours with the serjeant major and the master tailor. There you have his mentality. Apart from that he has a vast contempt, like everyone here, for the excellent major I was telling you about. No one will speak to him because he\u2019s a freemason and doesn\u2019t go to confession. The Prince de Borodino would never have an outsider like that in his house. Which is pretty fair cheek, when all\u2019s said and done, from a man whose great-grandfather was a small farmer, and who would probably be a small farmer himself if it hadn\u2019t been for the Napoleonic wars. Not that he hasn\u2019t a lurking sense of his own rather ambiguous position in society, where he\u2019s neither flesh nor fowl. He hardly ever shews his face at the Jockey, it makes him feel so deuced awkward, this so-called Prince,\u201d added Robert, who, having been led by the same spirit of imitation to adopt the social theories of his teachers and the worldly prejudices of his relatives, had unconsciously wedded the democratic love of humanity to a contempt for the nobility of the Empire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was looking at the photograph of his aunt, and the thought that, since Saint-Loup had this photograph in his possession, he might perhaps give it to me, made me feel all the fonder of him and hope to do him a thousand services, which seemed to me a very small exchange for it. For this photograph was like one encounter more, added to all those that I had already had, with Mme. de Guermantes; better still, a prolonged encounter, as if, by some sudden stride forward in our relations, she had stopped beside me, in a garden hat, and had allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of memory); and the contemplation of them, as well as of the bare bosom and arms of a woman whom I had never seen save in a high-necked and long-sleeved bodice, was to me a voluptuous discovery, a priceless favour. Those lines, which had seemed to me almost a forbidden spectacle, I could study there, as in a text-book of the only geometry that had any value for me. Later on, when I looked at Robert, I noticed that he too was a little like the photograph of his aunt, and by a mysterious process which I found almost as moving, since, if his face had not been directly created by hers, the two had nevertheless a common origin. The features of the Duchesse de Guermantes, which were pinned to my vision of Combray, the nose like a falcon\u2019s beak, the piercing eyes, seemed to have served also as a pattern for the cutting out \u2014 in another copy analogous and slender, with too delicate a skin \u2014 of Robert\u2019s face, which might almost be superimposed upon his aunt\u2019s. I saw in him, with a keen longing, those features characteristic of the Guermantes, of that race which had remained so individual in the midst of a world with which it was not confounded, in which it remained isolated in the glory of an ornithomorphic divinity, for it seemed to have been the issue, in the age of mythology, of the union of a goddess with a bird\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert, without being aware of its cause, was touched by my evident affection. This was moreover increased by the sense of comfort inspired in me by the heat of the fire and by the champagne which bedewed at the same time my brow with beads of sweat and my cheeks with tears; it washed down the partridges; I ate mine with the dumb wonder of a profane mortal of any sort when he finds in a form of life with which he is not familiar what he has supposed that form of life to exclude \u2014 the wonder, for instance, of an atheist who sits down to an exquisitely cooked dinner in a presbytery. And next morning, when I awoke, I rose and went to cast from Saint-Loup\u2019s window, which being at a great height overlooked the whole countryside, a curious scrutiny to make the acquaintance of my new neighbour, the landscape which I had not been able to distinguish the day before, having arrived too late, at an hour when it was already sleeping beneath the outspread cloak of night. And yet, early as it had awoken from its sleep, I could see the ground, when I opened the window and looked out, only as one sees it from the window of a country house, overlooking the lake, shrouded still in its soft white morning gown of mist which scarcely allowed me to make out anything at all. But I knew that, before the troopers who were busy with their horses in the square had finished grooming them, it would have cast its gown aside. In the meantime, I could see only a meagre hill, rearing close up against the side of the barracks a back already swept clear of darkness, rough and wrinkled. Through the transparent curtain of frost I could not take my eyes from this stranger who, too, was looking at me for the first time. But when I had formed the habit of coming to the barracks, my consciousness that the hill was there, more real, consequently, even when I did not see it, than the hotel at Balbec, than our house in Paris, of which I thought as of absent \u2014 or dead \u2014 friends, that is to say without any strong belief in their existence, brought it about that, even although I was not aware of it myself, its reflected shape outlined itself on the slightest impressions that I formed at Donci\u00e8res, and among them, to begin with this first morning, on the pleasing impression of warmth given me by the cup of chocolate prepared by Saint-Loup\u2019s batman in this comfortable room, which had the effect of being an optical centre from which to look out at the hill \u2014 the idea of there being anything else to do but just gaze at it, the idea of actually climbing it, being rendered impossible by this same mist. Imbibing the shape of the hill, associated with the taste of hot chocolate and with the whole web of my fancies at that particular time, this mist, without my having thought at all about it, succeeded in moistening all my subsequent thoughts about that period, just as a massive and unmelting lump of gold had remained allied to my impressions of Balbec, or as the proximity of the outside stairs of blackish sandstone gave a grey background to my impressions of Combray. It did not, however, persist late into the day; the sun began by hurling at it, in vain, a few darts which sprinkled it with brilliants before they finally overcame it. The hill might expose its grizzled rump to the sun\u2019s rays, which, an hour later, when I went down to the town, gave to the russet tints of the autumn leaves, to the reds and blues of the election posters pasted on the walls, an exaltation which raised my spirits also and made me stamp, singing as I went, on the pavements from which I could hardly keep myself from jumping in the air for joy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But after that first night I had to sleep at the hotel. And I knew beforehand that I was doomed to find sorrow there. It was like an unbreathable aroma which all my life long had been exhaled for me by every new bedroom, that is to say by every bedroom; in the one which I usually occupied I was not present, my mind remained elsewhere, and in its place sent only the sense of familiarity. But I could not employ this servant, less sensitive than myself, to look after things for me in a new place, where I preceded him, where I arrived by myself, where I must bring into contact with its environment that \u2018Self\u2019 which I rediscovered only at year-long intervals, but always the same, having not grown at all since Combray, since my first arrival at Balbec, weeping, without any possibility of consolation, on the edge of an unpacked trunk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it happened, I was mistaken. I had no time to be sad, for I was not left alone for an instant. The fact of the matter was that there remained of the old palace a superfluous refinement of structure and decoration, out of place in a modern hotel, which, released from the service of any practical purpose, had in its long spell of leisure acquired a sort of life: passages winding about in all directions, which one was continually crossing in their aimless wanderings, lobbies as long as corridors and as ornate as drawing-rooms, which had the air rather of being dwellers there themselves than of forming part of a dwelling, which could not be induced to enter and settle down in any of the rooms but wandered about outside mine and came up at once to offer me their company \u2014 neighbours of a sort, idle but never noisy, menial ghosts of the past who had been granted the privilege of staying, provided they kept quiet, by the doors of the rooms which were let to visitors, and who, every time that I came across them, greeted me with a silent deference. In short, the idea of a lodging, of simply a case for our existence from day to day which shields us only from the cold and from being overlooked by other people, was absolutely inapplicable to this house, an assembly of rooms as real as a colony of people, living, it was true, in silence, but things which one was obliged to meet, to avoid, to appreciate, as one came in. One tried not to disturb them, and one could not look without respect at the great drawing-room which had formed, far back in the eighteenth century, the habit of stretching itself at its ease, among its hangings of old gold and beneath the clouds of its painted ceiling. And one was seized with a more personal curiosity as to the smaller rooms which, without any regard for symmetry, ran all round it, innumerable, startled, fleeing in disorder as far as the garden, to which they had so easy an access down three broken steps\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I wished to go out or to come in without taking the lift or being seen from the main staircase, a smaller private staircase, no longer in use, offered me its steps so skilfully arranged, one close above another, that there seemed to exist in their gradation a perfect proportion of the same kind as those which, in colours, scents, savours, often arouse in us a peculiar, sensuous pleasure. But the pleasure to be found in going up and downstairs I had had to come here to learn, as once before to a health resort in the Alps to find that the act \u2014 as a rule not noticed \u2014 of drawing breath could be a perpetual delight. I received that dispensation from effort which is granted to us only by the things to which long use has accustomed us, when I set my feet for the first time on those steps, familiar before ever I knew them, as if they possessed, deposited on them, perhaps, embodied in them by the masters of long ago whom they used to welcome every day, the prospective charm of habits which I had not yet contracted and which indeed could only grow weaker once they had become my own. I looked into a room; the double doors closed themselves behind me, the hangings let in a silence in which I felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarating royalty; a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought brass \u2014 of which one would have been wrong to think that its sole idea was to represent the art of the Directory \u2014 offered me a fire, and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to warm myself as comfortably as if I had been sitting on the hearthrug. The walls held the room in \u00e0 close embrace, separating it from the rest of the world and, to let in, to enclose what made it complete, parted to make way for the bookcase, reserved a place for the bed, on either side of which a column airily upheld the raised ceiling of the alcove. And the room was prolonged in depth by two closets as large as itself, the latter of which had hanging from its wall, to scent the occasion on which one had recourse to it, a voluptuous rosary of orris-roots; the doors, if I left them open when I withdrew into this innermost retreat, were not content with tripling its dimensions without its ceasing to be well-proportioned, and not only allowed my eyes to enjoy the delights of extension after those of concentration, but added further to the pleasure of my solitude, which, while still inviolable, was no longer shut in, the sense of liberty. This closet looked out upon a courtyard, a fair solitary stranger whom I was glad to have for a neighbour when next morning my eyes fell on her, a captive between her high walls in which no other window opened, with nothing but two yellowing trees which were enough to give a pinkish softness to the pure sky above\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before going to bed I decided to leave the room in order to explore the whole of my fairy kingdom. I walked down a long gallery which did me homage successively with all that it had to offer me if I could not sleep, an armchair placed waiting in a corner, a spinet, on a table against the wall, a bowl of blue crockery filled with cinerarias, and, in an old frame, the phantom of a lady of long ago whose powdered hair was starred with blue flowers, holding in her hand a bunch of carnations. When I came to the end, the bare wall in which no door opened said to me simply \u201cNow you must turn and go back, but, you see, you are at home here, the house is yours,\u201d while the soft carpet, not to be left out, added that if I did not sleep that night I could easily come in barefoot, and\u2019 the unshuttered windows, looking out over the oper, country, assured me that they would hold a sleepless vigil and that, at whatever hour I chose to come in, I need not be afraid of disturbing anyone. And behind a hanging curtain I surprised only a little closet which, stopped by the wall and unable to escape any farther, had hidden itself there with a guilty conscience and gave me a frightened stare from its little round window, glowing blue in the moonlight. I went to bed, but the presence of the eiderdown quilt, of the pillars, of the neat fireplace, by straining my attention to a pitch beyond that of Paris, prevented me from letting myself go upon my habitual train of fancies. And as it is this particular state of strained attention that enfolds our slumbers, acts upon them, modifies them, brings them into line with this or that series of past impressions, the images that filled my dreams that first night were borrowed from a memory entirely distinct from that on which I was in the habit of drawing. If I had been tempted while asleep to let myself be swept back upon my ordinary current of remembrance, the bed to which I was not accustomed, the comfortable attention which I was obliged to pay to the position of my various limbs when I turned over, were sufficient to correct my error, to disentangle and to keep running the new thread of my dreams. It is the same with sleep as with our perception of the external world. It needs only a modification in our habits to make it poetic, it is enough that while undressing we should have dozed off unconsciously upon the bed, for the dimensions of our dream-world to be altered and its beauty felt. We awake, look at our watch, see \u2018four o\u2019clock\u2019; it is only four o\u2019clock in the morning, but we imagine that the whole day has gone by, so vividly does this nap of a few minutes, unsought by us, appear to have come down to us from the skies, by virtue of some divine right, full-bodied, vast, like an Emperor\u2019s orb of gold. In the morning, while worrying over the thought that my grandfather was ready, and was waiting for me to start on our walk along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I was awakened by the blare of a regimental band which passed every day beneath my windows. But on several occasions \u2014 and I mention these because one cannot properly describe human life unless one shews it soaked in the sleep in which it plunges, which, night after night, sweeps round it as a promontory is encircled by the sea \u2014 the intervening layer of sleep was strong enough to bear the shock of the music and I heard nothing. On the other mornings it gave way for a moment; but, still velvety with the refreshment of having slept, my consciousness (like those organs by which, after a local anaesthetic, a cauterisation, not perceived at first, is felt only at the very end and then as a faint burning smart) was touched only gently by the shrill points of the fifes which caressed it with a vague, cool, matutinal warbling; and after this brief interruption in which the silence had turned to music it relapsed into my slumber before even the dragoons had finished passing, depriving me of the latest opening buds of the sparkling clangorous nosegay. And the zone of my consciousness which its springing stems had brushed was so narrow, so circumscribed with sleep that later on, when Saint-Loup asked me whether I had heard the band, I was no longer ertain that the sound of its brasses had not been as imaginary as that which I heard during the day echo, after the slightest noise, from the paved streets of the town. Perhaps I had heard it only in a dream, prompted by my fear of being awakened, or else of not being awakened and so not seeing the regiment march past. For often, when I was still asleep at the moment when, on the contrary, I had supposed that the noise would awaken me, for the next hour I imagined that I was awake, while still drowsing, and I enacted to myself with tenuous shadow-shapes on the screen of my slumber the various scenes of which it deprived me but at which I had the illusion of looking on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What one has meant to do during the day, as it turns out, sleep intervening, one accomplishes only in one\u2019s dreams, that is to say after it has been distorted by sleep into following another line than one would have chosen when awake. The same story branches off and has a different ending. When all is said, the world in which we live when we are asleep is so different that people who have difficulty in going to sleep seek first of all to escape from the waking world. After having desperately, for hours on end, with shut eyes, revolved in their minds thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their eyes open, they take heart again on noticing that the last minute has been crawling under the weight of an argument in formal contradiction of the laws of thought, and their realisation of this, and the brief \u2018absence\u2019 to which it points, indicate that the door is now open through which they will perhaps be able, presently, to escape from the perception of the real, to advance to a resting-place more or less remote on the other side, which will mean their having a more or less \u2018good\u2019 night. But already a great stride has been made when we turn our back on the real, when we reach the cave in which \u2018auto-suggestions\u2019 prepare \u2014 like witches \u2014 the hell-broth of imaginary maladies or of the recurrence of nervous disorders, and watch for the hour at which the storm that has been gathering during our unconscious sleep will break with sufficient force to make sleep cease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not far thence is the secret garden in which grow like strange flowers the kinds of sleep, so different one from another, the sleep induced by datura, by the multiple extracts of ether, the sleep of belladonna, of opium, of valerian, flowers whose petals remain shut until the day when the predestined visitor shall come and, touching them, bid them open, and for long hours inhale the aroma of their peculiar dreams into a marvelling and bewildered being. At the end of the garden stands the convent with open windows through which we hear voices repeating the lessons learned before we went to sleep, which we shall know only at the moment of awakening; while, a presage of that moment, sounds the resonant tick of that inward alarum which our preoccupation has so effectively regulated that when our housekeeper comes in with the warning: \u201cIt is seven o\u2019clock,\u201d she will find us awake and ready. On the dim walls of that chamber which opens upon our dreams, within which toils without ceasing that oblivion of the sorrows of love whose task, interrupted and brought: to nought at times by a nightmare big with reminiscence, is ever speedily resumed, hang, even after we are awake, the memories of our dreams, but so overshadowed that otten we catch sight of them for the first time only in the broad light of the afternoon when the ray of a similar idea happens by chance to strike them; some of them brilliant and harmonious while we slept, but already so distorted that, having failed to recognise them, we can but hasten to lay them in the earth like dead bodies too quickly decomposed or relics so seriously damaged, so nearly crumbling into dust that the most skilful restorer could not bring them back to their true form or make anything of them. Near the gate is the quarry to which our heavier slumbers repair in search of substances which coat the brain with so unbreakable a glaze that, to awaken the sleeper, his own will is obliged, even on a golden morning, to smite him with mighty blows like a young Siegfried. Beyond this, again, are the nightmares of which the doctors foolishly assert that they tire us more than does insomnia, whereas on the contrary they enable the thinker to escape from the strain of thought; those nightmares with their fantastic picture-books in which our relatives who are dead are shewn meeting with a serious accident which at the same time does not preclude their speedy recovery. Until then we keep them in a little rat-cage, in which they are smaller than white mice and, covered with big red spots, out of each of which a feather sprouts, engage us in Ciceronian dialogues. Next to this picture-book is the revolving disc of awakening, by virtue of which we submit for a moment to the tedium of having to return at once to a house which was pulled down fifty years ago, the memory of which is gradually effaced as sleep grows more distant by a number of others, until we arrive at that memory which the disc presents only when it has ceased to revolve and which coincides with what we shall see with opened eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I had heard nothing, being in one of those slumbers into which we fall as into a pit from which we are heartily glad to be drawn up a little later, heavy, overfed, digesting all that has been brought to us (as by the nymphs who fed the infant Hercules) by those agile, vegetative powers whose activity is doubled while we sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That kind of sleep is called \u2018sleeping like lead,\u2019 and it seems as though one has become, oneself, and remains for a few moments after such a sleep is ended, simply a leaden image. One is no longer a person. How then, seeking for one\u2019s mind, one\u2019s personality, as one seeks for a thing that is lost, does one recover one\u2019s own self rather than any other? Why, when one begins again to think, is it not another personality than yesterday\u2019s that is incarnate in one? One fails to see what can dictate the choice, or why, among the millions of human beings any one of whom one might be, it is on him who one was overnight that unerringly one lays one\u2019s hand? What is it that guides us, when there has been an actual interruption \u2014 whether it be that our unconsciousness has been complete or our dreams entirely different from ourselves? There has indeed been death, as when the heart has ceased to beat and a rhythmical friction of the tongue revives us. No doubt the room, even if we have seen it only once before, awakens memories to which other, older memories cling. Or were some memories also asleep in us of which we now become conscious? The resurrection at our awakening \u2014 after that healing attack of mental alienation which is sleep \u2014 must after all be similar to what occurs when we recapture a name, a line, a refrain that we had forgotten. And perhaps the resurrection of the soul after death is to be conceived as a phenomenon of memory\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had finished sleeping, tempted by the sunlit sky \u2014 but discouraged by the chill \u2014 of those last autumn mornings, so luminous and so cold, in which winter begins, to get up and look at the trees on which the leaves were indicated now only by a few strokes, golden or rosy, which seemed to have been left in the air, on an invisible web, I raised my head from the pillow and stretched my neck, keeping my body still hidden beneath the bedclothes; like a chrysalis in the process of change I was a dual creature, with the different parts of which a single environment did not agree; for my eyes colour was sufficient, without warmth; my chest on the other hand was anxious for warmth and not for colour. I rose only after my fire had been lighted, and studied the picture, so delicate and transparent, of the pink and golden morning, to which I had now added by artificial means the element of warmth that it lacked, poking my fire which burned and smoked like a good pipe and gave me, as a pipe would have given me, a pleasure at once coarse because it was based upon a material comfort and delicate because beyond it was printed a pure vision. The walls of my dressing-room were covered with a paper on which a violent red background was patterned with black and white flowers, to which it seemed that I should have some difficulty in growing accustomed. But they succeeded only in striking me as novel, in forcing me to enter not into conflict but into contact with them, in modulating the gaiety, the songs of my morning toilet, they succeeded only in imprisoning me in the heart of a sort of poppy, out of which to look at a world which I saw quite differently from in Paris, from the gay screen which was this new dwelling-place, of a different aspect from the house of my parents, and into which flowed a purer air. On certain days, I was agitated by the desire to see my grandmother again, or by the fear that she might be ill, or else it was the memory of some undertaking which I had left half-finished in Paris, and which seemed to have made no progress; sometimes again it was some difficulty in which, even here, I had managed to become involved. One or other of these anxieties had kept me from sleeping, and I was without strength to face my sorrow which in a moment grew to fill the whole of my existence. Then from the hotel I sent a messenger to the barracks, with a line to Saint-Loup: I told him that, should it be materially possible \u2014 I knew that it was extremely difficult for him \u2014 I should be most grateful if he would look in for a minute. An hour later he arrived; and on hearing his ring at the door I felt myself liberated from my obsessions. I knew that, if they were stronger than I, he was stronger than they, and my attention was diverted from them and concentrated on him who would have to settle them. He had come into the room, and already he had enveloped me in the gust of fresh air in which from before dawn he had been displaying so much activity, a vital atmosphere very different from that of my room, to which I at once adapted myself by appropriate reactions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t angry with me for bothering you; there is something that is worrying me, as you probably guessed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; I just supposed you wanted to see me, and I thought it very nice of you. I was delighted that you should have sent for me. But what is the trouble? Things not going well? What can I do to help?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He listened to my explanations, and gave careful answers; but before he had uttered a word he had transformed me to his own likeness; compared with the important occupations which kept him so busy, so alert, so happy, the worries which, a moment ago, I had been unable to endure for another instant seemed to me as to him negligible; I was like a man who, not having been able to open his eyes for some days, sends for a doctor, who neatly and gently raises his eyelid, removes from beneath it and shews him a grain of sand; the sufferer is healed and comforted. All my cares resolved themselves into a telegram which Saint-Loup undertook to dispatch. Life seemed to me so different, so delightful; I was flooded with such a surfeit of strength that I longed for action\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d I asked him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI must leave you, I\u2019m afraid; we\u2019re going on a route march in three quarters of an hour, and I have to be on parade.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen it\u2019s been a great bother to you, coming here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no bother at all, the Captain was very good about it; he told me that if it was for you I must go at once; but you understand, I don\u2019t like to seem to be abusing the privilege.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut if I got up and dressed quickly and went by myself to the place where you\u2019ll be training, it would interest me immensely, and I could perhaps talk to you during the breaks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shouldn\u2019t advise you to do that; you have been lying awake, racking your brains over a thing which, I assure you, is not of the slightest importance, but now that it has ceased to worry you, lay your head down on the pillow and go to sleep, which you will find an excellent antidote to the d\u00e9min\u00e9ralisation of your nerve-cells; only you mustn\u2019t go to sleep too soon, because our band-boys will be coming along under your windows; but as soon as they\u2019ve passed I think you\u2019ll be left in peace, and we shall meet again this evening, at dinner.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But soon I was constantly going to see the regiment being trained in field operations, when I began to take an interest in the military theories which Saint-Loup\u2019s friends used to expound over the dinner-table, and when it had become the chief desire of my life to see at close quarters their various leaders, just as a person who makes music his principal study and spends his life in the concert halls finds pleasure in frequenting the caf\u00e9s in which one mingles with the life of the members of the orchestra. To reach the training ground I used to have to take tremendously long walks. In the evening after dinner the longing for sleep made my head drop every now and then as in a swoon. Next morning I realised that I had no more heard the band than, at Balbec, after the evenings on which Saint-Loup had taken me to dinner at Rivebelle, I used to hear the concert on the beach. And at the moment when I wished to rise I had a delicious feeling of incapacity; I felt myself fastened to a deep, invisible ground by the articulations (of which my tiredness made me conscious) of muscular and nutritious roots. I felt myself full of strength; life seemed to extend more amply before me; this was because I had reverted to the good tiredness of my childhood at Combray on the mornings following days on which we had taken the Guermantes walk. Poets make out that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth. But these are most hazardous pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success. The fixed places, contemporary with different years, it is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find them. This is where the advantage comes in, to a certain extent, of great exhaustion followed by a good night\u2019s rest. Good nights, to make us descend into the most subterranean galleries of sleep, where no reflexion from overnight, no gleam of memory comes to lighten the inward monologue (if so be that it cease not also), turn so effectively the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we discover there, where our muscles dive down and throw out their twisted roots and breathe the air of the new life, the garden in which as a child we used to play. There is no need to travel in order to see it again; we must dig down inwardly to discover it. What once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath; a mere excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city, excavation is necessary also. But we shall see how certain impressions, fugitive and fortuitous, carry us back even more effectively to the past, with a more delicate precision, with a flight more light-winged, more immaterial, more headlong, more unerring, more immortal than these organic dislocations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes my exhaustion was greater still; I had, without any opportunity of going to bed, been following the operations for several days on end. How blessed then was my return to the hotel! As I got into bed I seemed to have escaped at last from the hands of enchanters, sorcerers like those who people the \u2018romances\u2019 beloved of our forebears in the seventeenth century. My sleep that night and the lazy morning that followed it were no more than a charming fairy tale. Charming; beneficent perhaps also. I reminded myself that the keenest sufferings have their place of sanctuary, that one can always, when all else fails, find repose. These thoughts carried me far\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On days when, although there was no parade, Saint-Loup had to stay in barracks, I used often to go and visit him there. It was a long way; I had to leave the town and cross the viaduct, from either side of which I had an immense view. A strong breeze blew almost always over this high ground, and filled all the buildings erected on three sides of the barrack-square, which howled incessantly like a cave of the winds. While I waited for Robert \u2014 he being engaged on some duty or other \u2014 outside the door of his room or in the mess, talking to some of his friends to whom he had introduced me (and whom later on I came now and then to see, even when he was not to be there), looking down from the window three hundred feet to the country below, bare now except where recently sown fields, often still soaked with rain and glittering in the sun, shewed a few stripes of green, of the brilliance and translucent limpidity of enamel, I could hear him discussed by the others, and I soon learned what a popular favourite he was. Among many of the volunteers, belonging to other squadrons^ sons of rich business or professional men who looked at the higher aristocratic society only from outside and without penetrating its enclosure, the attraction which they naturally felt towards what they knew of Saint-Loup\u2019s character was reinforced by the distinction that attached in their eyes to the young man whom, on Saturday evenings, when they went on pass to Paris, they had seen supping in the Caf\u00e9 de la Paix with the Duc d\u2019Uz\u00e8s and the Prince d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. And on that account, into his handsome face, his casual way of walking and saluting officers, the perpetual dance of his eyeglass, the affectation shewn in the cut of his service dress \u2014 the caps always too high, the breeches of too fine a cloth and too pink a shade \u2014 they had introduced the idea of a \u2018tone\u2019 which, they were positive, was lacking in the best turned-out officers in the regiment, even the majestic Captain to whom I had been indebted for the privilege of sleeping in barracks, who seemed, in comparison, too pompous and almost common\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of them said that the Captain had bought a new horse. \u201cHe can buy as many horses as he likes. I passed Saint-Loup on Sunday morning in the All\u00e9e des Acacias; now he\u2019s got some style on a horse!\u201d replied his companion, and knew what he was talking about, for these young fellows belonged to a class which, if it does not frequent the same houses and know the same people, yet, thanks to money and leisure, does not differ from the nobility in its experience of all those refinements of life which money can procure. At any rate their refinement had, in the matter of clothes, for instance, something about it more studied, more impeccable than that free and easy negligence which had so delighted my grandmother in Saint-Loup. It gave quite a thrill to these sons of big stockbrokers or bankers, as they sat eating oysters after the theatre, to see at an adjoining table Serjeant Saint-Loup. And what a tale there was to tell in barracks on Monday night, after a week-end leave, by one of them who was in Robert\u2019s squadron, and to whom he had said how d\u2019ye do \u2018most civilly,\u2019 while another, who was not in the same squadron, was quite positive that, in spite of this, Saint-Loup had recognised him, for two or three times he had put up his eyeglass and stared in the speaker\u2019s direction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, my brother saw him at the Paix,\u201d said another, who had been spending the day with his mistress; \u201cmy brother says his dress coat was cut too loose and didn\u2019t fit him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat was the waistcoat like?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe wasn\u2019t wearing a white waistcoat; it was purple, with sort of palms on it; stunning!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the \u2018old soldiers\u2019 (sons of the soil who had never heard of the Jockey Club and simply put Saint-Loup in the category of ultra-rich non-commissioned officers, in which they included all those who, whether bankrupt or not, lived in a certain style, whose income or debts ran into several figures, and who were generous towards their men), the gait, the eyeglass, the breeches, the caps of Saint-Loup, even if they saw in them nothing particularly aristocratic, furnished nevertheless just as much interest and meaning. They recognised in these peculiarities the character, the style which they had assigned once and for all time to this most popular of the \u2018stripes\u2019 in the regiment, manners like no one\u2019s else, scornful indifference to what his superior officers might think, which seemed to them the natural corollary of his goodness to his subordinates. The morning cup of coffee in the canteen, the afternoon \u2018lay-down\u2019 in the barrack-room seemed pleasanter, somehow, when some old soldier fed the hungering, lazy section with some savoury titbit as to a cap in which Saint-Loup had appeared on parade\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was the height of my pack.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome off it, old chap, you don\u2019t expect us to believe that; it couldn\u2019t have been the height of your pack,\u201d interrupted a young college graduate who hoped by using these slang terms not to appear a \u2018learned beggar,\u2019 and by venturing on this contradiction to obtain confirmation of a fact the thought of which enchanted him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, so it wasn\u2019t the height of my pack, wasn\u2019t it? You measured it, I suppose! I tell you this much, the C. O. glared at it as if he\u2019d have liked to put him in clink. But you needn\u2019t think the great Saint-Loup felt squashed; no, he went and he came, and down with his head and up with his head, and that blinking glass screwed in his eye all the time. We\u2019ll see what the \u2018Capstan\u2019 has to say when he hears. Oh, very likely he\u2019ll say nothing, but you may be sure he won\u2019t be pleased. But there\u2019s nothing so wonderful about that cap. I hear he\u2019s got thirty of \u2019em and more at home, at his house in town.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did you hear that, old man? From our blasted corporal-dog?\u201d asked the young graduate, pedantically displaying the new forms of speech which he had only recently acquired and with which he took a pride in garnishing his conversation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did I hear it? From his batman; what d\u2019you think?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Now you\u2019re talking. That\u2019s a chap who knows when he\u2019s well off!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should say so! He\u2019s got more in his pocket than I have, certain sure! And besides he gives him all his own things, and everything. He wasn\u2019t getting his grub properly, he says. Along comes de Saint-Loup, and gives cooky hell: \u2018I want him to be properly fed, d\u2019you hear,\u2019 he says, \u2018and I don\u2019t care what it costs.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The old soldier made up for the triviality of the words quoted by the emphasis of his tone, in a feeble imitation of the speaker which had an immense success\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On leaving the barracks I would take a stroll, and then, to fill up the time before I went, as I did every evening, to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel in which he and his friends had established their mess, I made for my own, as soon as the sun had set, so as to have a couple of hours in which to rest and read. In the square, the evening light bedecked the pepper-pot turrets of the castle with little pink clouds which matched the colour of the bricks, and completed the harmony by softening the tone of the latter where it bathed them. So strong a current of vitality coursed through my nerves that no amount of movement on my part could exhaust it; each step I took, after touching a stone of the pavement, rebounded off it. I seemed to have growing on my heels the wings of Mercury. One of the fountains was filled with a ruddy glow, while in the other the moonlight had already begun to turn the water opalescent. Between them were children at play, uttering shrill cries, wheeling in circles, obeying some necessity of the hour, like swifts or bats. Next door to the hotel, the old National Courts and the Louis XVI orangery, in which were installed now the savings-bank and the Army Corps headquarters, were lighted from within by the palely gilded globes of their gas-jets which, seen in the still clear daylight outside, suited those vast, tall, eighteenth-century windows from which the last rays of the setting sun had not yet departed, as would have suited a complexion heightened with rouge a headdress of yellow tortoise-shell, and persuaded me to seek out my fireside and the lamp which, alone in the shadowy front of my hotel, was striving to resist the gathering darkness, and for the sake of which I went indoors before it was quite dark, for pleasure, as to an appetising meal. I kept, when I was in my room, the same fulness of sensation that I had felt outside. It gave such an apparent convexity of surface to things which as a rule seem flat and empty, to the yellow flame of the fire, the coarse blue paper on the ceiling, on which the setting sun had scribbled corkscrews and whirligigs, like a schoolboy with a piece of red chalk, the curiously patterned cloth on the round table, on which a ream of essay paper and an inkpot lay in readiness for me, with one of Bergotte\u2019s novels, that ever since then these things have continued to seem to me to be enriched with a whole form of existence which I feel that I should be able to extract from them if it were granted me to set eyes on them again. I thought with joy of the barracks that I had just left and of their weather-cock turning with every wind that blew. Like a diver breathing through a pipe which rises above the surface of the water, I felt that I was in a sense maintaining contact with a healthy, open-air life when I kept as a baiting-place those barracks, that towering observatory, dominating a country-side furrowed with canals of green enamel, into whose various buildings I esteemed as a priceless privilege, which I hoped would last, my freedom to go whenever I chose, always certain of a welcome\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At seven o\u2019clock I dressed myself and went out again to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel where he took his meals. I liked to go there on foot. It was by now pitch dark, and after the third day of my visit there began to blow, as soon as night had fallen, an icy wind which seemed a harbinger of snow. As I walked, I ought not, strictly speaking, to have ceased for a moment to think of Mme. de Guermantes; it was only in the attempt to draw nearer to her that I had come to visit Robert\u2019s garrison. But a memory, a grief, are fleeting things. There are days when they remove so far that we are barely conscious of them, we think that they have gone for ever. Then we pay attention to other things. And the streets of this town had not yet become for me what streets are in the place where one is accustomed to live, simply means of communication between one part and another. The life led by the inhabitants of this unknown world must, it seemed to me, be a marvellous thing, and often the lighted windows of some dwelling-house kept me standing for a long while motionless in the darkness by laying before my eyes the actual and mysterious scenes of an existence into which I might not penetrate. Here the fire-spirit displayed to me in purple colouring the booth of a chestnut seller in which a couple of serjeants, their belts slung over the backs of chairs, were playing cards, never dreaming that a magician\u2019s wand was making them emerge from the night, like a transparency on the stage, and presenting them in their true lineaments at that very moment to the eyes of an arrested passerby whom they could not see. In a little curiosity shop a candle, burned almost to its socket, projecting its warm glow over an engraving reprinted it in sanguine, while, battling against the darkness, the light of the big lamp tanned a scrap of leather, inlaid a dagger with fiery spangles, on pictures which were only bad copies spread a priceless film of gold like the patina of time or the varnish used by a master, made in fact of the whole hovel, in which there was nothing but pinchbeck rubbish, a marvellous composition by Rembrandt. Sometimes I lifted my gaze to some huge old dwelling-house on which the shutters had not been closed and in which amphibious men and women floated slowly to and fro in the rich liquid that after nightfall rose incessantly from the wells of the lamps to fill the rooms to the very brink of the outer walls of stone and glass, the movement of their bodies sending through it long unctuous golden ripples. I proceeded on my way, and often, in the dark alley that ran past the cathedral, as long ago on the road to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, the force of my desire caught and held me; it seemed that a woman must be on the point of appearing, to satisfy it; if, in the darkness, I felt suddenly brush past me a skirt, the violence of the pleasure which I then felt made it impossible for me to believe that the contact was accidental and I attempted to seize in my arms a terrified stranger. This gothic alley meant for me something so real that if I had been successful in raising and enjoying a woman there, it would have been impossible for me not to believe that it was the ancient charm of the place that was bringing us together, and even though she were no more than a common street-walker, stationed there every evening, still the wintry night, the strange place, the darkness, the mediaeval atmosphere would have lent her their mysterious glamour. I thought of what might be in store for me; to try to forget Mme. de Guermantes seemed to me a dreadful thing, but reasonable, and for the first time possible, easy perhaps even. In the absolute quiet of this neighbourhood I could hear ahead of me shouted words and laughter which must come from tipsy revellers staggering home. I waited to see them, I stood peering in the direction from which I had heard the sound. But I was obliged to wait for some time, for the surrounding silence was so intense that it allowed to travel with the utmost clearness and strength sounds that were still a long way off. Finally the revellers did appear; not, as I had supposed, in front of me, but ever so far behind. Whether the intersection of sidestreets, the interposition of buildings had, by reverberation, brought about this acoustic error, or because it is very difficult to locate a sound when the place from which it comes is not known, I had been as far wrong over direction as over distance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wind grew stronger. It was thick and bristling with coming snow. I returned to the main street and jumped on board the little tramway-car on which, from its platform, an officer, without apparently seeing them, was acknowledging the salutes of the loutish soldiers who trudged past along the pavement, their faces daubed crimson by the cold, reminding me, in this little town which the sudden leap from autumn into early winter seemed to have transported farther north, of the rubicund faces which Breughel gives to his merry, junketing, frostbound peasants\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And sure enough at the hotel where I was to meet Saint-Loup and his friends and to which the fair now beginning had attracted a number of people from near and far, I found, as I hurried across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in which chickens were turning on spits, pigs were roasting, lobsters being flung, alive, into what the landlord called the \u2018everlasting fire,\u2019 an influx (worthy of some Numbering of the People Before Bethlehem such as the old Flemish masters used to paint) of new arrivals who assembled there in groups, asking the landlord or one of his staff (who, if he did not like the look of them, would recommend lodgings elsewhere in the town) whether they could have dinner and beds, while a scullion hurried past holding a struggling fowl by the neck. And similarly, in the big dining-room which I crossed the first day before coming to the smaller room in which my friend was waiting for me, it was of some feast in the Gospels portrayed with a mediaeval simplicity and an exaggeration typically Flemish that one was reminded by the quantity of fish, pullets, grouse, woodcock, pigeons, brought in dressed and garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who slid over the polished floor to gain speed and set them down on the huge carving table where they were at once cut up but where \u2014 for most of the people had nearly finished dinner when I arrived \u2014 they accumulated untouched, as though their profusion and the haste of those who brought them in were due not so much to the requirements of the diners as to respect for the sacred text, scrupulously followed in the letter but quaintly illustrated by real details borrowed from local custom, and to an aesthetic and religious scruple for making evident to the eye the solemnity of the feast by the profusion of the victuals and the assiduity of the servers. One of these stood lost in thought at the far end of the room by a sideboard; and to find out from him, who alone appeared calm enough to be capable of answering me, in which room our table had been laid, making my way forward among the chafing-dishes that had been lighted here and there to keep the late comers\u2019 plates from growing cold (which did not, however, prevent the dessert, in the centre of the room, from being piled on the outstretched hands of a huge mannikin, sometimes supported on the wings of a duck, apparently of crystal, but really of ice, carved afresh every day with a hot iron by a sculptor-cook, quite in the Flemish manner), I went straight \u2014 at the risk of being knocked down by his colleagues \u2014 towards this servitor, in whom I felt that I recognised a character who is traditionally present in all these sacred subjects, for he reproduced with scrupulous accuracy the blunt features, fatuous and ill-drawn, the musing expression, already half aware of the miracle of a divine presence which the others have not yet begun to suspect. I should add that, in view probably of the coming fair, this presentation was strengthened by a celestial contingent, recruited in mass, of cherubim and seraphim. A young angel musician, whose fair hair enclosed a fourteen-year-old face, was not, it was true, playing on any instrument, but stood musing before a gong or a pile of plates, while other less infantile angels flew swiftly across the boundless expanse of the room, beating the air with the ceaseless fluttering of the napkins which fell along the lines of their bodies like the wings in \u2018primitive\u2019 paintings, with pointed ends. Fleeing those ill-defined regions, screened by a hedge of palms through which the angelic servitors looked, from a distance, as though they had floated down out of the empyrean, I explored my way to the smaller room in which Saint-Loup\u2019s table was laid. I found there several of his friends who dined with him regularly, nobles except for one or two commoners in whom the young nobles had, in their school days, detected likely friends, and with whom they readily associated, proving thereby that they were not on principle hostile to the middle class, even though it were Republican, provided it had clean hands and went to mass. On the first of these evenings, before we sat down to dinner, I drew Saint-Loup into a corner and, in front of all the rest but so that they should not hear me, said to him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert, this is hardly the time or the place for what I am going to say, but I shan\u2019t be a second. I keep on forgetting to ask you when I\u2019m in the barracks; isn\u2019t that Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s photograph that you have on your table?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; my good aunt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course she is; what a fool I am; you told me before that she was; I\u2019d forgotten all about her being your aunt. I say, your friends will be getting impatient, we must be quick, they\u2019re looking at us; another time will do; it isn\u2019t at all important.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s all right; go on as long as you like. They can wait.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no; I do want to be polite to them; they\u2019re so nice; besides, it doesn\u2019t really matter in the least, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know that worthy Oriane, then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \u2018worthy Oriane,\u2019 as he might have said, \u2018that good Oriane,\u2019 did not imply that Saint-Loup regarded Mme. de Guermantes as especially good. In this instance the words \u2018good,\u2019 \u2018excellent,\u2019 \u2018worthy\u2019 are mere reinforcements of the demonstrative \u2018that,\u2019 indicating a person who is known to both parties and of whom the speaker does not quite know what to say to someone outside the intimate circle. The word \u2018good\u2019 does duty as a stopgap and keeps the conversation going for a moment until the speaker has hit upon \u201cDo you see much of her?\u201d or \u201cI haven\u2019t set eyes on her for months,\u201d or \u201cI shall be seeing her on Tuesday,\u201d or \u201cShe must be getting on, now, you know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how funny it is that it should be her photograph, because we\u2019re living in her house now, in Paris, and I\u2019ve been hearing the most astounding things\u201d (I should have been hard put to it to say what) \u201cabout her, which have made me immensely interested in her, only from a literary point of view, don\u2019t you know, from a \u2014 how shall I put it \u2014 from a Balzacian point of view; but you\u2019re so clever you can see what I mean; I don\u2019t need to explain things to you; but we must hurry up; what on earth will your friends think of my manners?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey will think absolutely nothing; I have told them that you are sublime, and they are a great deal more alarmed than you are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are too kind. But listen, what I want to say is this: I suppose Mme. de Guermantes hasn\u2019t any idea that I know you, has she?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t say; I haven\u2019t seen her since the summer, because I haven\u2019t had any leave since she\u2019s been in town.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I was going to say is this: I\u2019ve been told that she looks on me as an absolute idiot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat I do not believe; Oriane is not exactly an eagle, but all the same she\u2019s by no means stupid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know that, as a rule, I don\u2019t care about your advertising the good opinion you\u2019re kind enough to hold of me; I\u2019m not conceited. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sorry you should have said flattering things about me to your friends here (we will go back to them in two seconds). But Mme. de Guermantes is different; if you could let her know \u2014 if you would even exaggerate a trifle \u2014 what you think of me, you would give me great pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course I will, if that\u2019s all you want me to do; it\u2019s not very difficult; but what difference can it possibly make to you what she thinks of you? I suppose you think her no end of a joke, really; anyhow, if that\u2019s all you want we can discuss it in front of the others or when we are by ourselves; I\u2019m afraid of your tiring yourself if you stand talking, and it\u2019s so inconvenient too, when we have heaps of opportunities of being alone together.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was precisely this inconvenience that had given me courage to approach Robert; the presence of the others was for me a pretext that justified my giving my remarks a curt and incoherent form, under cover of which I could more easily dissemble the falsehood of my saying to my friend that I had forgotten his connexion with the Duchess, and also did not give him time to frame \u2014 with regard to my reasons for wishing that Mme. de Guermantes should know that I was his friend, was clever, and so forth \u2014 questions which would have been all the more disturbing in that I should not have been able to answer them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert, I\u2019m surprised that a man of your intelligence should fail to understand that one doesn\u2019t discuss the things that will give one\u2019s friends pleasure; one does them. Now I, if you were to ask me no matter what, and indeed I only wish you would ask me to do something for you, I can assure you I shouldn\u2019t want any explanations. I may ask you for more than I really want; I have no desire to know Mme. de Guermantes, but just to test you I ought to have said that I was anxious to dine with Mme. de Guermantes; I am sure you would never have done it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot only should I have done it, I will do it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNext time I\u2019m in Paris, three weeks from now, I expect.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe shall see; I dare say she won\u2019t want to see me, though. I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t say that; it\u2019s everything in the world, because now I can see what sort of friend you are; whether what I ask you to do is important or not, disagreeable or not, whether I am really keen about it or ask you only as a test, it makes no difference; you say you will do it, and there you shew the fmeness of your mind and heart. A stupid friend would have started a discussion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which was exactly what he had just been doing; but perhaps I wanted to flatter his self-esteem; perhaps also I was sincere, the sole touchstone of merit seeming to me to be the extent to which a friend could be useful in respect of the one thing that seemed to me to have any importance, namely my love. Then I went on, perhaps from cunning, possibly from a genuine increase of affection inspired by gratitude, expectancy, and the copy of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s very features which nature had made in producing her nephew Robert: \u201cBut, I say, we mustn\u2019t keep them waiting any longer, and I\u2019ve mentioned only one of the two things I wanted to ask you, the less important; the other is more important to me, but I\u2019m afraid you will never consent. Would it bore you if we were to call each other tu?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBore me? My dear fellow! Joy! Tears of joy! Undreamed-of happiness!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you \u2014 tu I mean; you begin first \u2014 ever so much. It is such a pleasure to me that you needn\u2019t do anything about Mme. de Guermantes if you\u2019d rather not, this is quite enough for me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can do both.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, Robert! Listen to me a minute,\u201d I said to him later while we were at dinner. \u201cOh, it\u2019s really too absurd the way our conversation is always being interrupted, I can\u2019t think why \u2014 you remember the lady I was speaking to you about just now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re quite sure you know who\u2019 I mean?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, what do you take me for, a village idiot?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t care to give me her photograph, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0had meant to ask him only for the loan of it. But when the time came to speak I felt shy, I decided that the request was indiscreet, and in order to hide my confusion I put the question more bluntly, and increased my demand, as if it had been quite natural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; I should have to ask her permission first,\u201d was his answer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He blushed as he spoke. I could see that he had a reservation in his mind, that he credited me also with one, that he would give only a partial service to my love, under the restraint of certain moral principles, and for this I hated him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time I was touched to see how differently Saint-Loup behaved towards me now that I was no longer alone with him, and that his friends formed an audience. His increased affability would have left me cold had I thought that it was deliberately assumed; but I could feel that it was spontaneous and consisted only of all that he had to say about me in my absence and refrained as a rule from saying when we were together by ourselves. In our private conversations I might certainly suspect the pleasure that he found in talking to me, but that pleasure he almost always left unexpressed. Now, at the same remarks from me which, as a rule, he enjoyed without shewing it, he watched from the corner of his eye to see whether they produced on his friends the effect on which he had counted, an effect corresponding to what he had promised them beforehand. The mother of a girl in her first season could be no more unrelaxing in her attention to her daughter\u2019s responses and to the attitude of the public. If I had made some remark at which, alone in my company, he would merely have smiled, he was afraid that the others might not have seen the point, and put in a \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d to make me repeat what I had said, to attract attention, and turning at once to his friends and making himself automatically, by facing them with a hearty laugh, the fugleman of their laughter, presented me for the first time with the opinion that he actually held of me and must often have expressed to them. So that I caught sight of myself suddenly from without, like a person who reads his name in a newspaper or sees himself in a mirror\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It occurred to me, one of these evenings, to tell a mildly amusing story about Mme. Blandais, but I stopped at once, remembering that Saint-Loup knew it already, and that when I had tried to tell him it on the day following my arrival he had interrupted me with: \u201cYou told me that before, at Balbec.\u201d I was surprised, therefore, to find him begging me to go on and assuring me that he did not know the story, and that it would amuse him immensely. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten it for the moment,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut you\u2019ll remember as I go on.\u201d \u201cNo, really; I swear you\u2019re mistaken. You\u2019ve never told me. Do go on.\u201d And throughout the story he fixed a feverish and enraptured gaze alternately on myself and on his friends. I realised only after I had finished, amid general laughter, that it had struck him that this story would give his friends a good idea of my wit, and that it was for this reason that he had pretended not to know it. Such is the stuff of friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the third evening, one of his friends, to whom I had not had an opportunity before of speaking, conversed with me at great length; and I overheard him telling Saint-Loup how much he had been enjoying himself. And indeed we sat talking together almost all evening, leaving our glasses of sauterne untouched on the table before us, isolated, sheltered from the others by the sumptuous curtains of one of those intuitive sympathies between man and man which, when they are not based upon any physical attraction, are the only kind that is altogether mysterious. Of such an enigmatic nature had seemed to me, at Balbec, that feeling which Saint-Loup had for me, which was not to be confused with the interest of our conversations, a feeling free from any material association, invisible, intangible, and yet a thing of the presence of which in himself, like a sort of inflammatory gas, he had been so far conscious as to refer to it with a smile. And yet there was perhaps something more surprising still in this sympathy born here in a single evening, like a flower that had budded and opened in a few minutes in the warmth of this little room. I could not help asking Robert when he spoke to me about Balbec whether it were really settled that he was to marry Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac. He assured me that not only was it not settled, but there had never been any thought of such a match, he had never seen her, he did not know who she was. If at that moment I had happened to see any of the social gossipers who had told me of this coming event, they would promptly have announced the betrothal of Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac to some one who was not Saint-Loup and that of Saint-Loup to some one who was not Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac. I should have surprised them greatly had I reminded them of their incompatible and still so recent predictions. In order that this little game may continue, and multiply false reports by attaching the greatest possible number to every name in turn, nature has furnished those who play it with a memory as short as their credulity is long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup had spoken to me of another of his friends who was present also one with whom he was on particularly good terms just then, since they were the only two advocates in their mess of the retrial of Dreyfus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as a brother of this friend of Saint-Loup, who had been trained at the Schola Cantorum, thought about every new musical work not at all what his father, his mother, his cousins, his club friends thought, but exactly what the other students thought at the Schola, so this non-commissioned nobleman (of whom Bloch formed an extraordinary opinion when I told him about him, because, touched to hear that he belonged to the same party as himself, he nevertheless imagined him on account of his aristocratic birth and religious and military upbringing to be as different as possible, endowed with the same romantic attraction as a native of a distant country) had a \u2018mentality,\u2019 as people were now beginning to say, analogous to that of the whole body of Dreyfusards in general and of Bloch in particular, on which the traditions of his family and the interests of his career could retain no hold whatever. Similarly one of Saint-Loup\u2019s cousins had married a young Eastern princess who was said to write poetry quite as fine as Victor Hugo\u2019s or Alfred de Vigny\u2019s, and in spite of this was supposed to have a different type of mind from what one would naturally expect, the mind of an Eastern princess immured in an Arabian Nights palace. For the writers who had the privilege of meeting her was reserved the disappointment or rather the joy of listening to conversation which gave the impression not of Scheherazade but of a person of genius of the type of Alfred de Vigny or Victor Hugo\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat fellow? Oh, he\u2019s not like Saint-Loup, he\u2019s a regular devil,\u201d my new friend informed me; \u201che\u2019s not even straight about it. At first, he used to say: \u2018Just wait a little, there\u2019s a man I know well, a clever, kind-hearted fellow, General de Boisdeffre; you need have no hesitation in accepting his decision.\u2019 But as soon as he heard that Boisdeffre had pronounced Dreyfus guilty, Boisdeffre ceased to count: clericalism, staff prejudices, prevented his forming a candid opinion, although there is no one in the world (or was, rather, before this Dreyfus business) half so clerical as our friend. Next he told us that now we were sure to get the truth, the case had been put in the hands of Saussier, and he, a soldier of the Republic (our friend coming of an ultra-monarchist family, if you please), was a man of bronze, a stern unyielding conscience. But when Saussier pronounced Esterhazy innocent, he found fresh reasons to account for the decision, reasons damaging not to Dreyfus but to General Saussier. It was the militarist spirit that blinded Saussier (and I must explain to you that our friend is just as much militarist as clerical, or at least he was; I don\u2019t know what to think of him now). His family are all brokenhearted at seeing him possessed by such ideas.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you think,\u201d I suggested, turning half towards Saint-Loup so as not to appear to be cutting myself off from him, as well as towards his friend, and so that we might all three join in the conversation, \u201cthat the influence we ascribe to environment is particularly true of intellectual environment. One is the man of one\u2019s idea. There are far fewer ideas than men, therefore all men with similar ideas are alike. As there is nothing material in an idea, so the people who are only materially neighbours of the man with an idea can do nothing to alter it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point I was interrupted by Saint-Loup, because another of the young men had leaned across to him with a smile and, pointing to me, exclaimed: \u201cDuroc! Duroc all over!\u201d I had no idea what this might mean, but I felt the expression on the shy young face to be more than friendly. While I was speaking, the approbation of the party seemed to Saint-Loup superfluous; he insisted on silence. And just as a conductor stops his orchestra with a rap from his baton because some one in the audience has made a noise, so he rebuked the author of this disturbance: \u201cGibergue, you must keep your mouth shut when people are speaking. You can tell us about it afterwards.\u201d And to me: \u201cPlease go on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I gave a sigh of relief, for I had been afraid that he was going to make me begin all over again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd as an idea,\u201d I went on, \u201cis a thing that cannot participate in human interests and would be incapable of deriving any benefit from them, the men who are governed by an idea are not influenced by material considerations.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had finished, \u201cThat\u2019s one in the eye for you, my boys,\u201d exclaimed Saint-Loup, who had been following me with his gaze with the same anxious solicitude as if I had been walking upon a tight-rope. \u201cWhat were you going to say, Gibergue?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just saying that your friend reminded me of Major Duroc. I seemed to hear him speaking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, I\u2019ve often thought so myself,\u201d replied Saint-Loup; \u201cthey have several points in common, but you\u2019ll find there are a thousand things in this fellow that Duroc hasn\u2019t got.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup was not satisfied with this comparison. In an ecstasy of joy, into which there no doubt entered the joy that he felt in making me shine before his friends, with extreme volubility, stroking me as though he were rubbing down a horse that had just come first past the post, he reiterated: \u201cYou\u2019re the cleverest man I know, do you hear?\u201d He corrected himself, and added: \u201cYou and Elstir. \u2014 You don\u2019t mind my bracketing him with you, I hope. You understand \u2014 punctiliousness. It\u2019s like this: I say it to you as one might have said to Balzac: \u2018You are the greatest novelist of the century \u2014 you and Stendhal.\u2019 Excessive punctiliousness, don\u2019t you know, and at heart an immense admiration. No? You don\u2019t admit Stendhal?\u201d he went on, with an ingenuous confidence in my judgment which found expression in a charming, smiling, almost childish glance of interrogation from his green eyes. \u201cOh, good! I see you\u2019re on my side; Bloch can\u2019t stand Stendhal. I think it\u2019s idiotic of him. The Chartreuse is after all an immense work, don\u2019t you think? I am so glad you agree with me. What is it you like best in theChartreuse, answer me?\u201d he appealed to me with a boyish impetuosity. And the menace of his physical strength made the question almost terrifying. \u201cMosca? Fabrice?\u201d I answered timidly that Mosca reminded me a little of M. de Norpois. Whereupon peals of laughter from the young Siegfried Saint-Loup. And while I was going on to explain: \u201cBut Mosca is far more intelligent, not so pedantic,\u201d I heard Robert cry: \u201cBravo!\u201d actually clapping his hands, and, helpless with laughter, gasp: \u201cOh, perfect! Admirable! You really are astounding.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took a particular pleasure in talking to this young man, as for that matter to all Robert\u2019s friends and to Robert himself, about their barracks, the officers of the garrison, and the army in general. Thanks to the immensely enlarged scale on which we see the things, however petty they may be, in the midst of which we eat, and talk, and lead our real life; thanks to that formidable enlargement which they undergo, and the effect of which is that the rest of the world, not being present, cannot compete with them, and assumes in comparison the unsubstantiality of a dream, I had begun to take an interest in the various personalities of the barracks, in the officers whom I saw in the square when I went to visit Saint-Loup, or, if I was awake then, when the regiment passed beneath my windows. I should have liked to know more about the major whom Saint-Loup so greatly admired, and about the course of military history which would have appealed to me \u201ceven from an aesthetic point of view.\u201d I knew that with Robert the spoken word was, only too often, a trifle hollow, but at other times implied the assimilation of valuable ideas which he was fully capable of grasping. Unfortunately, from the military point of view Robert was exclusively preoccupied at this time with the case of Dreyfus. He spoke little about it, since he alone of the party at table was a Dreyfusard; the others were violently opposed to the idea of a fresh trial, except my other neighbour, my new friend, and his opinions appeared to be somewhat vague. A firm admirer of the colonel, who was regarded as an exceptionally competent officer and had denounced the current agitation against the Army in several of his regimental orders, which won him the reputation of being an anti-Dreyfusard, my neighbour had heard that his commanding officer had let fall certain remarks which had led to the supposition that he had his doubts as to the guilt of Dreyfus and retained his admiration for Picquart. In the latter respect, at any rate, the rumour of Dreyfusism as applied to the colonel was as ill-founded as are all the rumours, springing from none knows where, which float around any great scandal. For, shortly afterwards, this colonel having been detailed to interrogate the former Chief of the Intelligence Branch, had treated him with a brutality and contempt the like of which had never been known before. However this might be (and naturally he had not taken the liberty of going direct to the colonel for his information), my neighbour had paid Saint-Loup the compliment of telling him \u2014 in the tone in which a Catholic lady might tell a Jewish lady that her parish priest denounced the pogroms in Russia and might openly admire the generosity of certain Israelites \u2014 that their colonel was not, with regard to Dreyfusism \u2014 to a certain kind of Dreyfusism, at least \u2014 the fanatical, narrow opponent that he had been made out to be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not surprised,\u201d was Saint-Loup\u2019s comment; \u201cfor he\u2019s a sensible man. But in spite of that he is blinded by the prejudices of his caste, and above all by his clericalism. Now,\u201d he turned to me, \u201cMajor Duroc, the lecturer on military history I was telling you about; there\u2019s a man who is whole-heartedly in support of our views, or so I\u2019m told. And I should have been surprised to hear that he wasn\u2019t, for he\u2019s not only a brilliantly clever man, but a Radical-Socialist and a freemason.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Partly out of courtesy to his friends, whom these expressions of Saint-Loup\u2019s faith in Dreyfus made uncomfortable, and also because the subject was of more interest to myself, I asked my neighbour if it were true that this major gave a demonstration of military history which had a genuine aesthetic beauty. \u201cIt is absolutely true.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut what do you mean by that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, all that you read, let us say, in the narrative of a military historian, the smallest facts, the most trivial happenings, are only the outward signs of an idea which has to be analysed, and which often brings to light other ideas, like a palimpsest. So that you have a field for study as intellectual as any science you care to name, or any art, and one that is satisfying to the mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGive me an example or two, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is not very easy to explain,\u201d Saint-Loup broke in. \u201cYou read, let us say, that this or that Corps has tried . . . but before we go any further, the serial number of the Corps, its order of battle are not without their significance. If it is not the first time that the operation has been attempted, and if for the same operation we find a different Corps being brought up, it is perhaps a sign that the previous Corps have been wiped out or have suffered heavy casualties in the said operation; that they are no longer in a fit state to carry it through successfully. Next, we must ask ourselves what was this Corps which is now out of action; if it was composed of shock troops, held in reserve for big attacks, a fresh Corps of inferior quality will have little chance of succeeding where the first has failed. Furthermore, if we are not at the start of a campaign, this fresh Corps may itself be a composite formation of odds and ends withdrawn from other Corps, which throws a light on the strength of the forces the belligerent still has at his disposal and the proximity of the moment when his forces shall be definitely inferior to the enemy\u2019s, which gives to the operation on which this Corps is about to engage a different meaning, because, if it is no longer in a condition to make good its losses, its successes even will only help mathematically to bring it nearer to its ultimate destruction. And then, the serial number of the Corps that it has facing it is of no less significance. If, for instance, it is a much weaker unit, which has already accounted for several important units of the attacking force, the whole nature of the operation is changed, since, even if it should end in the loss of the position which the defending force has been holding, simply to have held it for any length of time may be a great success if a very small defending force has been sufficient to disable highly important forces on the other side. You can understand that if, in the analysis of the Corps engaged on both sides, there are all these points of importance, the study of the position itself, of the roads, of the railways which it commands, of the lines of communication which it protects, is of the very highest. One must study what I may call the whole geographical context,\u201d he added with a laugh. And indeed he was so delighted with this expression that, every time he employed it, even months afterwards, it was always accompanied by the same laugh. \u201cWhile the operation is being prepared by one of the belligerents, if you read that one of his patrols has been wiped out in the neighbourhood of the position by the other belligerent, one of the conclusions which you are entitled to draw is that one side was attempting to reconnoitre the defensive works with which the other intended to resist his attack. An exceptional burst of activity at a given point may indicate the desire to capture that point, but equally well the desire to hold the enemy in check there, not to retaliate at the point at which he has attacked you; or it may indeed be only a feint, intended to cover by an increased activity the relief of troops in that sector. (Which was a classic feint in Napoleon\u2019s wars.) On the other hand, to appreciate the significance of any movement, its probable object, and, as a corollary, the other movements by which it will be accompanied or followed, it is not immaterial to consult, not so much the announcements issued by the Higher Command, which may be intended to deceive the enemy, to mask a possible check, as the manual of field operations in use in the country in question. We are always entitled to assume that the manoeuvre which an army has attempted to carry out is that prescribed by the rules that are applicable to the circumstances. If, for instance, the rule lays down that a frontal attack should be accompanied by a flank attack; if, after the flank attack has failed, the Higher Command makes out that it had no connexion with the main attack and was merely a diversion, there is a strong likelihood that the truth will be found by consulting the rules and not the reports issued from Headquarters. And there are not only the regulations governing each army to be considered, but their traditions, their habits, their doctrines; the study of diplomatic activities, with their perpetual action or reaction upon military activities, must not be neglected either. Incidents apparently insignificant, which at the time are not understood, will explain to you how the enemy, counting upon a support which these incidents shew to have been withheld, was able to carry out only a part of his strategic plan. So that, if you can read between the lines of military history, what is a confused jumble for the ordinary reader becomes a chain of reasoning as straightforward as a picture is for the picture-lover who can see what the person portrayed is wearing and has in his hands, while the visitor hurrying through the gallery is bewildered by a blur of colour which gives him a headache. But just as with certain pictures, in which it is not enough to observe that the figure is holding a chalice, but one must know why the painter chose to place a chalice in his hands, what it is intended to symbolise, so these military operations, apart from their immediate object, are quite regularly traced, in the mind of the general responsible for the campaign, from the plans of earlier battles, which we may call the past experience, the literature, the learning, the etymology, the aristocracy (whichever you like) of the battles of to-day. Observe that I am not speaking for the moment of the local, the (what shall I call it?) spatial identity of battles. That exists also. A battle-field has never been, and never will be throughout the centuries, simply the ground upon which a particular battle has been fought. If it has been a battle-field, that was because it combined certain conditions of geographical position, of geological formation, drawbacks even, of a kind that would obstruct the enemy (a river, for instance, cutting his force in two), which made it a good field of battle. And so what it has been it will continue to be. A painter doesn\u2019t make a studio out of any old room; so you don\u2019t make a battle-field out of any old piece of ground. There are places set apart for the purpose. But, once again, this is not what I was telling you about; it was the type of battle which one follows, in a sort of strategic tracing, a tactical imitation, if you like. Battles like Ulm, Lodi, Leipzig, Cannae. I can\u2019t say whether there is ever going to be another war, or what nations are going to fight in it, but, if a war does come, you may be sure that it will include (and deliberately, on the commander\u2019s part) a Cannae, an Austerlitz, a Rosbach, a Waterloo. Some of our people say quite openly that Marshal von Schieffer and General Falkenhausen have prepared a Battle of Cannae against France, in the Hannibal style, pinning their enemy down along his whole front, and advancing on both flanks, especially through Belgium, while Bernhardi prefers the oblique order of Frederick the Great, Lenthen rather than Cannae. Others expound their views less crudely, but I can tell you one thing, my boy, that Beauconseil, the squadron commander I introduced you to the other day, who is an officer with a very great future before him, has swotted up a little Pratzen attack of his own; he knows it inside out, he is keeping it up his sleeve, and if he ever has an opportunity to put it into practice he will make a clean job of it and let us have it on a big scale. The break through in the centre at Rivoli, too; that\u2019s a thing that will crop up if there\u2019s ever another war. It\u2019s no more obsolete than the Iliad. I must add that we are practically condemned to make frontal attacks, because we can\u2019t afford to repeat the mistake we made in Seventy; we must assume the offensive, and nothing else. The only thing that troubles me is that if I see only the slower, more antiquated minds among us opposing this splendid doctrine, still, one of the youngest of my masters, who is a genius, I mean Mangin, would like us to leave room, provisionally of course, for the defensive. It is not very easy to answer him when he cites the example of Austerlitz, where the defence was merely a prelude to attack and victory.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The enunciation of these theories by Saint-Loup made me happy. They gave me to hope that perhaps I was not being led astray, in my life at Donci\u00e8res, with regard to these officers whom I used to hear being discussed while I sat sipping a sauterne which bathed them in its charming golden glint, by the same magnifying power which had swollen to such enormous proportions in my eyes while I was at Balbec the King and Queen of the South Sea Island, the little group of the four epicures, the young gambler, Legrandin\u2019s brother-in-law, now shrunken so in my view as to appear nonexistent. What gave me pleasure to-day would not, perhaps, leave me indifferent to-morrow, as had always happened hitherto; the creature that I still was at this moment was not, perhaps, doomed to immediate destruction since to the ardent and fugitive passion which I had felt on these few evenings for everything connected with military life, Saint-Loup, by what he had just been saying to me, touching the art of war, added an intellectual foundation, of a permanent character, capable of attaching me to itself so strongly that I might, without any attempt to deceive myself, feel assured that after I had left Donci\u00e8res I should continue to take an interest in the work of my friends there, and should not be long in coming to pay them another visit. At the same time, so as to make quite sure that this art of war was indeed an art in the true sense of the word:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou interest me \u2014 I beg your pardon, tu interest me enormously,\u201d I said to Saint-Loup, \u201cbut tell me, there is one point that puzzles me. I feel that I could be keenly thrilled by the art of strategy, but if so I must first be sure that it is not so very different from the other arts, that knowing the rules is not everything. You tell me that plans of battles are copied. I do find something aesthetic, just as you said, in seeing beneath a modern battle the plan of an older one, I can\u2019t tell you how attractive it sounds. But then, does the genius of the commander count for nothing? Does he really do no more than apply the rules? Or, in point of science, are there great generals as there are great surgeons, who, when the symptoms exhibited by two states of ill-health are identical to the outward eye, nevertheless feel, for some infinitesimal reason, founded perhaps on their experience, but interpreted afresh, that in one case they ought to do one thing, in another case another; that in one case it is better to operate, in another to wait?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should just say so! You will find Napoleon not attacking when all the rules ordered him to attack, but some obscure divination warned him not to. For instance, look at Austerlitz, or in 1806 take his instructions to Lannes. But you will find certain generals slavishly imitating one of Napoleon\u2019s movements and arriving at a diametrically opposite result. There are a dozen examples of that in 1870. But even for the interpretation of what the enemy may do, what he actually does is only a symptom which may mean any number of different things. Each of them has an equal chance of being the right thing, if one looks only to reasoning and science, just as in certain difficult cases all the medical science in the world will be powerless to decide whether the invisible tumour is malignant or not, whether or not the operation ought to be performed. It is his instinct, his divination \u2014 like Mme. de Th\u00e8bes (you follow me?)\u2014 which decides, in the great general as in the great doctor. Thus I\u2019ve been telling you, to take one instance, what might be meant by a reconnaissance on the eve of a battle. But it may mean a dozen other things also, such as to make the enemy think you are going to attack him at one point whereas you intend to attack him at another, to put out a screen which will prevent him from seeing the preparations for your real operation, to force him to bring up fresh troops, to hold them, to immobilise them in a different place from where they are needed, to form an estimate of the forces at his disposal, to feel him, to force him to shew his hand. Sometimes, indeed, the fact that you employ an immense number of troops in an operation is by no means a proof that that is your true objective; for you may be justified in carrying it out, even if it is only a feint, so that your feint may have a better chance of deceiving the enemy. If I had time now to go through the Napoleonic wars from this point of view, I assure you that these simple classic movements which we study here, and which you will come and see us practising in the field, just for the pleasure of a walk, you young rascal \u2014 no, I know you\u2019re not well, I apologise! \u2014 well, in a war, when you feel behind you the vigilance, the judgment, the profound study of the Higher Command, you are as much moved by them as by the simple lamps of a lighthouse, only a material combustion, but an emanation of the spirit, sweeping through space to warn ships of danger. I may have been wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you only of the literature of war. In reality, as the formation of the soil, the direction of wind and light tell us which way a tree will grow, so the conditions in which a campaign is fought, the features of the country through which you march, prescribe, to a certain extent, and limit the number of the plans among which the general has to choose. Which means that along a mountain range, through a system of valleys, over certain plains, it is almost with the inevitability and the tremendous beauty of an avalanche that you can forecast the line of an army on the march.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow you deny me that freedom of choice in the commander, that power of divination in the enemy who is trying to discover his plan, which you allowed me a moment ago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all. You remember that book of philosophy we read together at Balbec, the richness of the world of possibilities compared with the real world. Very well. It is the same again with the art of strategy. In a given situation there will be four plans that offer themselves, one of which the general has to choose, as a disease may pass through various phases for which the doctor has to watch. And here again the weakness and greatness of the human elements are fresh causes of uncertainty. For of these four plans let us assume that contingent reasons (such as the attainment of minor objects, or time, which may be pressing, or the smallness of his effective strength and shortage of rations) lead the general to prefer the first, which is less perfect, but less costly also to carry out, is more rapid, and has for its terrain a richer country for feeding his troops. He may, after having begun with this plan, which the enemy, uncertain at first, will soon detect, find that success lies beyond his grasp, the difficulties being too great (that is what I call the element of human weakness), abandon it and try the second or third or fourth. But it may equally be that he has tried the first plan (and this is what I call human greatness) merely as a feint to pin down the enemy, so as to surprise him later at a point where he has not been expecting an attack. Thus at Ulm, Mack, who expected the enemy to advance from the west, was surrounded from the north where he thought he was perfectly safe. My example is not a very good one, as a matter of fact. And Ulm is a better type of enveloping battle, which the future will see reproduced, because it is not only a classic example from which generals will seek inspiration, but a form that is to some extent necessary (one of several necessities, which leaves room for choice, for variety) like a type of crystallisation. But it doesn\u2019t much matter, really, because these conditions are after all artificial. To go back to our philosophy book; it is like the rules of logic or scientific laws, reality does conform to it more or less, but bear in mind that the great mathematician Poincar\u00e9 is by no means certain that mathematics are strictly accurate. As to the rules themselves, which I mentioned to you, they are of secondary importance really, and besides they are altered from time to time. We cavalrymen, for instance, have to go by the Field Service of 1895, which, you may say, is out of date since it is based on the old and obsolete doctrine which maintains that cavalry warfare has little more than a moral effect, in the panic that the charge creates in the enemy. Whereas the more intelligent of our teachers, all the best brains in the cavalry, and particularly the major I was telling you about, anticipate on the contrary that the decisive victory will be obtained by a real hand-to-hand encounter in which our weapons will be sabre and lance and the side that can hold out longer will win, not simply morally and by creating panic, but materially.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSaint-Loup is quite right, and it is probable that the next Field Service will shew signs of this evolution,\u201d put in my other neighbour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not ungrateful for your support, for your opinions seem to make more impression upon my friend than mine,\u201d said Saint-Loup with a smile, whether because the growing attraction between his comrade and myself annoyed him slightly or because he thought it graceful to solemnise it with this official confirmation. \u201cPerhaps I may have underestimated the importance of the rules; I don\u2019t know. They do change, that must be admitted. But in the meantime they control the military situation, the plans of campaign and concentration. If they reflect a false conception of strategy they may be the principal cause of defeat. All this is a little too technical for you,\u201d he remarked to me. \u201cAfter all, you may say that what does most to accelerate the evolution of the art of war is wars themselves. In the course of a campaign, if it is at all long, you will see one belligerent profiting by the lessons furnished him by the successes and mistakes, perfecting the methods of the other, who will improve on him in turn. But all that is a thing of the past. With the terrible advance of artillery, the wars of the future, if there are to be any more wars, will be so short that, before we have had time to think of putting our lessons into practice, peace will have been signed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t be so touchy,\u201d I told Saint-Loup, reverting to the first words ol this speech. \u201cI was listening to you quite eagerly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you will kindly not fly into a passion, and will allow me to speak,\u201d his friend went on, \u201cI shall add to what you have just been saying that if battles copy and coincide with one another it is not merely due to the mind of the commander. It may happen that a mistake on his part (for instance, his failure to appreciate the strength of the enemy) will lead him to call upon his men for extravagant sacrifices, sacrifices which certain units will make with an abnegation so sublime that their part in the battle will be analogous to that played by some other unit in some other battle, and these will be quoted in history as interchangeable examples: to stick to 1870, we have the Prussian Guard at Saint-Privat, and the Turcos at Froeschviller and Wissembourg.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Interchangeable; very neat! Excellent! The lad has brains,\u201d was Saint-Loup\u2019s comment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was not unmoved by these last examples, as always when, beneath the particular instance, I was afforded a glimpse of the general law. Still, the genius of the commander, that was what interested me, I was anxious to discover in what it consisted, what steps, in given circumstances, when the commander who lacked genius could not withstand the enemy, the inspired leader would take to re-establish his jeopardised position, which, according to Saint-Loup, was quite possible and had been done by Napoleon more than once. And to understand what military worth meant I asked for comparisons between the various generals whom I knew by name, which of them had most markedly the character of a leader, the gifts of a tactician; at the risk of boring my new friends, who however shewed no signs of boredom, but continued to answer me with an inexhaustible good nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt myself isolated, not only from the great, freezing night which extended far around us and in which we heard from time to time the whistle of a train which only rendered more keen the pleasure of being where we were, or the chime of an hour which, happily, was still a long way short of that at which these young men would have to buckle on their sabres and go, but also from all my external obsessions, almost from the memory of Mme. de Guermantes, by the hospitality of Saint-Loup, to which that of his friends, reinforcing it, gave, so to speak, a greater solidity; by the warmth also of this little dining-room, by the savour of the well-chosen dishes that were set before us. They gave as much pleasure to my imagination as to my appetite; sometimes the little piece of still life from which they had been taken, the rugged holy water stoup of the oyster in which lingered a few drops of brackish water, or the knotted stem, the yellow leaves of a bunch of grapes still enveloped them, inedible, poetic and remote as a landscape, and producing, at different points in the course of the meal, the impressions of rest in the shade of a vine and of an excursion out to sea; on other evenings it was the cook alone who threw into relief these original properties of our food, which he presented in its natural setting, like a work of art; and a fish cooked in wine was brought in on a long earthenware dish, on which, as it stood out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs, unbreakable now but still contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water, surrounded by a circle of satellite creatures in their shells, crabs, shrimps and mussels, it had the appearance of being part of a ceramic design by Bernard Palissy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am jealous, furious,\u201d Saint-Loup attacked me, half smiling, half in earnest, alluding to the interminable conversations aside which I had been having with his friend. \u201cIs it because you find him more intelligent than me; do you like him better than me? Well, I suppose he\u2019s everything now, and no one else is to have a look in!\u201d Men who are enormously in love with a woman, who live in the society of woman-lovers, allow themselves pleasantries on which others, who would see less innocence in them, would never venture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the conversation became general, they avoided any reference to Dreyfus for fear of offending Saint-Loup. The following week, however, two of his friends were remarking what a curious thing it was that, living in so military an atmosphere, he was so keen a Dreyfusard, almost an anti-militarist. \u201cThe reason is,\u201d I suggested, not wishing to enter into details, \u201cthat the influence of environment is not so important as people think . . . \u201d I intended of course to stop at this point, and not to reiterate the observations which I had made to Saint-Loup a few days earlier. Since, however, I had repeated these words almost textually, I proceeded to excuse myself by adding: \u201cAs, in fact, I was saying the other day . . . \u201d But I had reckoned without the reverse side of Robert\u2019s polite admiration of myself and certain other persons. That admiration reached its fulfilment in so entire an assimilation of their ideas that, in the course of a day or two, he would have completely forgotten that those ideas were not his own. And so, in the matter of my modest theory, Saint-Loup, for all the world as though it had always dwelt in his own brain, and as though I were merely poaching on his preserves, felt it incumbent upon him to greet my discovery with warm approval\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; environment is of no importance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my interrupting, or failing to understand him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe real influence is that of one\u2019s intellectual environment! One is the man of one\u2019s idea!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stopped for a moment, with the satisfied smile of one who has digested his dinner, dropped his eyeglass and, fixing me with a gimlet-like stare:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll men with similar ideas are alike,\u201d he informed me, with a challenging air. Probably he had completely forgotten that I myself had said to him, only a few days earlier, what on the other hand he remembered so well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not arrive at Saint-Loup\u2019s restaurant every evening in the same state of mind. If a memory, a sorrow that weigh on us are able to leave us so effectively that we are no longer aware of them, they can also return and sometimes remain with us for a long time. There were evenings when, as I passed through the town on my way to the restaurant, I felt so keen a longing for Mme. de Guermantes that I could scarcely breathe; you might have said that part of my breast had been cut open by a skilled anatomist, taken out, and replaced by an equal part of immaterial suffering, by an equivalent load of longing and love. And however neatly the wound may have been stitched together, there is not much comfort in life when regret for the loss of another person is substituted for one\u2019s entrails, it seems to be occupying more room than they, one feels it perpetually, and besides, what a contradiction in terms to be obliged to think a part of one\u2019s body. Only it seems that we are worth more, somehow. At the whisper of a breeze we sigh, from oppression, but from weariness also. I would look up at the sky. If it were clear, I would say to myself: \u201cPerhaps she is in the country; she is looking at the same stars; and, for all I know, when I arrive at the restaurant Robert may say to me: \u2018Good news! I have just heard from my aunt; she wants to meet you; she is coming down here.\u2019\u201d It was not in the firmament alone that I enshrined the thought of Mme. de Guermantes, A passing breath of air, more fragrant than the rest, seemed to bring me a message from her, as, long ago, from Gilberte in the cornfields of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. We do not change; we introduce into the feeling with which we regard a person many slumbering elements which that feeling revives but which are foreign to it. Besides, with these feelings for particular people, there is always something in us that is trying to bring them nearer to the truth, that is to say, to absorb them in a more general feeling, common to the whole of humanity, with which people and the suffering that they cause us are merely a means to enable us to communicate. What brought a certain pleasure into my grief was that I knew it to be a tiny fragment of the universal love. Simply because I thought that I recognised sorrows which I had felt on Gilberte\u2019s account, or else when in the evenings at Combray Mamma would not stay in any room, and also the memory of certain pages of Bergotte, in the agony I now felt, to which Mme. de Guermantes, her coldness, her absence, were not clearly linked, as cause is to effect in the mind of a philosopher, I did not conclude that Mme. de Guermantes was not the cause of that agony. Is there not such a thing as a diffused bodily pain, extending, radiating out into other parts, which, however, it leaves, to vanish altogether, if the practitioner lays his finger on the precise spot from which it springs? And yet, until that moment, its extension gave it for us so vague, so fatal a semblance that, powerless to explain or even to locate it, we imagined that there was no possibility of its being healed. As I made my way to the restaurant I said to myself: \u201cA fortnight already since I last saw Mme. de Guermantes.\u201d A fortnight which did not appear so enormous an interval save to me, who, when Mme. de Guermantes was concerned, reckoned time by minutes. For me it was no longer the stars and the breeze merely, but the arithmetical divisions of time that assumed a dolorous and poetic aspect. Each day now was like the loose crest of a crumbling mountain, down one side of which I felt that I could descend into oblivion, but down the other was borne by the necessity of seeing the Duchess again. And I was continually inclining one way or the other, having no stable equilibrium. One day I said to myself: \u201cPerhaps there will be a letter to-night;\u201d and on entering the dining-room I found courage to ask Saint-Loup:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have had any news from Paris?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he replied gloomily; \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I breathed a sigh of relief when I realised that it was only he who was unhappy, and that the news came from his mistress. But I soon saw that one of its consequences would be to prevent Robert, for ever so long, from taking me to see his aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I learned that a quarrel had broken out between him and his mistress, through the post presumably, unless she had come down to pay him a flying visit between trains. And the quarrels, even when relatively slight, which they had previously had, had always seemed as though they must prove insoluble. For she was a girl of violent temper, who would stamp her foot and burst into tears for reasons as incomprehensible as those that make children shut themselves into dark cupboards, not come out for dinner, refuse to give any explanation, and only redouble their sobs when, our patience exhausted, we visit them with a whipping. To say that Saint-Loup suffered terribly from this estrangement would be an understatement of the truth, which would give the reader a false impression of his grief. When he found himself alone, the only picture in his mind being that of his mistress parting from him with the respect which she had felt for him at the sight of his energy, the anxieties which he had had at first gave way before the irreparable, and the cessation of an anxiety is so pleasant a thing that the rupture, once it was certain, assumed for him something of the same kind of charm as a reconciliation. What he began to suffer from, a little later, was a secondary and accidental grief, the tide of which flowed incessantly from his own heart, at the idea that perhaps she would be glad to make it up, that it was not inconceivable that she was waiting for a word from him, that in the mean time, to be avenged on him, she would perhaps on a certain evening, in a certain place, do a certain thing, and that he had only to telegraph to her that he was coming for it not to happen, that others perhaps were taking advantage of the time which he was letting slip, and that in a few days it would be too late to recapture her, for she would be already bespoke. Among all these possibilities he was certain of nothing; his mistress preserved a silence which wrought him up to such a frenzy of grief that he began to ask himself whether she might not be in hiding at Donci\u00e8res, or have sailed for the Indies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has been said that silence is a force; in another and widely different sense it is a tremendous force in the hands of those who are loved. It increases the anxiety of the lover who has to wait. Nothing so tempts us to approach another person as what is keeping us apart; and what barrier is there so insurmountable as silence? It has been said also that silence is a torture, capable of goading to madness him who is condemned to it in a prison cell. But what a torture \u2014 keener than that of having to keep silence \u2014 to have to endure the silence of the person one loves! Robert asked himself: \u201cWhat can she be doing, never to send me a single word, like this? She hates me, perhaps, and will always go on hating me.\u201d And he reproached himself. Thus her silence did indeed drive him mad with jealousy and remorse. Besides, more cruel than the silence of prisons, that kind of silence is in itself a prison. An immaterial enclosure, I admit, but impenetrable, this interposed slice of empty atmosphere through which, despite its emptiness, the visual rays of the abandoned lover cannot pass. Is there a more terrible illumination than that of silence which shews us not one absent love but a thousand, and shews us each of them in the act of indulging in some fresh betrayal? Sometimes, in an abrupt relaxation of his strain, Robert would imagine that this period of silence was just coming to an end, that the long expected letter was on its way. He saw it, it arrived, he started at every sound, his thirst was already quenched, he murmured: \u201cThe letter! The letter!\u201d After this glimpse of a phantom oasis of affection, he found himself once more toiling across the real desert of a silence without end\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He suffered in anticipation, without a single omission, all the griefs and pains of a rupture which at other moments he fancied he might somehow contrive to avoid, like people who put all their affairs in order with a view to a migration abroad which they never make, whose minds, no longer certain where they will find themselves living next day, flutter helplessly for the time being, detached from them, like a heart that is taken out of a dying man and continues to beat, though disjoined from the rest of his body. Anyhow, this hope that his mistress would return gave him courage to persevere in the rupture, as the belief that one will return alive from the battle helps one to face death. And inasmuch as habit is, of all the plants of human growth, the one that has least need of nutritious soil in order to live, and is the first to appear upon what is apparently the most barren rock, perhaps had he begun by effecting their rupture as a feint he would in the end have grown genuinely accustomed to it. But his uncertainty kept him in a state of emotion which, linked with the memory of the woman herself, was akin to love. He forced himself, nevertheless, not to write to her, thinking perhaps that it was a less cruel torment to live without his mistress than with her in certain conditions, or else that, after the way in which they had parted, it was necessary to wait for excuses from her, if she was to keep what he believed her to feel for him in the way, if not of love, at any rate of esteem and regard. He contented himself with going to the telephone, which had recently been installed at Donci\u00e8res, and asking for news from, or giving instructions to a lady\u2019s maid whom he had procured and placed with his friend. These communications were, as it turned out, complicated and took up much of his time, since, influenced by what her literary friends preached to her about the ugliness of the capital, but principally for the sake of her animals, her dogs, her monkey, her canaries and her parrokeet, whose incessant din her Paris landlord had declined to tolerate for another moment, Robert\u2019s mistress had now taken a little house in the neighbourhood of Versailles. Meanwhile he, down at Donci\u00e8res, no longer slept a wink all night. Once, in my room, overcome by exhaustion, he dozed off for a little. But suddenly he began to talk, tried to get up and run, to stop something from happening, said: \u201cI hear her; you shan\u2019t . . . you shan\u2019t. . . . \u201d He awoke. He had been dreaming, he explained to me, that he was in the country with the serjeant-major. His host had tried to keep him away from a certain part of the house. Saint-Loup had discovered that the serjeant-major had staying with him a subaltern, extremely rich and extremely vicious, whom he knew to have a violent passion for his mistress. And suddenly in his dream he had distinctly heard the spasmodic, regular cries which his mistress was in the habit of uttering at the moment of gratification. He had tried to force the serjeant-major to take him to the room in which she was. And the other had held him back, to keep him from going there, with an air of annoyance at such a want of discretion in a guest which, Robert said, he would never be able to forget\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was an idiotic dream,\u201d he concluded, still quite breathless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the same I could see that, during the hour that followed, he was more than once on the point of telephoning to his mistress to beg for a reconciliation. My father had now had the telephone for some time at home, but I doubt whether that would have been of much use to Saint-Loup. Besides, it hardly seemed to me quite proper to make my parents, or even a mechanical instrument installed in their house, play pander between Saint-Loup and his mistress, ladylike and high-minded as the latter might be. His bad dream began to fade from his memory. With a fixed and absent stare, he came to see me on each of those cruel days which traced in my mind as they followed one after the other the splendid sweep of a staircase forged in hard metal on which Robert stood asking himself what decision his friend was going to take\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At length she wrote to ask whether he would consent to forgive her. As soon as he realised that a definite rupture had been avoided he saw all the disadvantages of a reconciliation. Besides, he had already begun to suffer less acutely, and had almost accepted a grief the sharp tooth of which he would have, in a few months perhaps, to feel again if their intimacy were to be resumed. He did not hesitate for long. And perhaps he hesitated only because he was now certain of being able to recapture his mistress, of being able to do it and therefore of doing it. Only she asked him, so that she might have time to recover her equanimity, not to come to Paris at the New Year. Now he had not the heart to go to Paris without seeing her. On the other hand, she had declared her willingness to go abroad with him, bot for that he would need to make a formal application for leave, which Captain de Borodino was unwilling to grant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it, because of your meeting with my aunt, which will have to be put off. I dare say I shall be in Paris at Easter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe shan\u2019t be able to call on Mme. de Guermantes then, because I shall have gone to Balbec. But, really, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo Balbec? But you didn\u2019t go there till August.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know; but next year they\u2019re making me go there earlier, for my health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All that he feared was that I might form a bad impression of his mistress, after what he had told me. \u201cShe is violent simply because she is too frank, too thorough in her feelings. But she is a sublime creature. You can\u2019t imagine what exquisite poetry there is in her. She goes every year to spend all Souls\u2019 Day at Bruges. \u2018Nice\u2019 of her, don\u2019t you think? If you ever do meet her you\u2019ll see what I mean; she has a greatness. . . . \u201d And, as he was infected with certain of the mannerisms used in the literary circles in which the lady moved: \u201cThere is something sidereal about her, in fact something bardic; you know what I mean, the poet merging into the priest.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was searching all through dinner for a pretext which would enable Saint-Loup to ask his aunt to see me without my having to wait until he came to Paris. Now such a pretext was furnished by the desire that I had to see some more pictures by Elstir, the famous painter whom Saint-Loup and I had met at Balbec. A pretext behind which there was, moreover, an element of truth, for if, on my visits to Elstir, what I had asked of his painting had been that it should lead me to the comprehension and love of things better than itself, a real thaw, an authentic square in a country town, live women on a beach (all the more would I have commissioned from it the portraits of the realities which I had not been able to fathom, such as a lane of hawthorn-blossoms, not so much that it might perpetuate their beauty for me as that it might reveal that beauty to me), now, on the other hand, it was the originality, the seductive attraction of those paintings that aroused my desire, and what I wanted above anything else was to look at other pictures by Elstir\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to me, also, that the least of his pictures were something quite different from the masterpieces even of greater painters than himself. His work was like a realm apart, whose frontiers were not to be passed, matchless in substance. Eagerly collecting the infrequent periodicals in which articles on him and his work had appeared, I had learned that it was only recently that he had begun to paint landscapes and still life, and that he had started with mythological subjects (I had seen photographs of two of these in his studio), and had then been for long under the influence of Japanese art\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several of the works most characteristic of his various manners were scattered about the provinces. A certain house at les Andelys, in which there was one of his finest landscapes, seemed to me as precious, gave me as keen a desire to go there and see it as did a village in the Chartres district, among whose millstone walls was enshrined a glorious painted window; and towards the possessor of this treasure, towards the man who, inside his ugly house, on the main Street, closeted like an astrologer, sat questioning one of those mirrors of the world which Elstir\u2019s pictures were, and who had perhaps bought it for many thousands of francs, I felt myself borne by that instinctive sympathy which joins the very hearts, the inmost natures of those who think alike upon a vital subject. Now three important works by my favourite painter were described in one of these articles as belonging to Mme. de Guermantes. So that it was, after all, quite sincerely that, on the evening on which Saint-Loup told me of his lady\u2019s projected visit to Bruges, I was able, during dinner, in front of his friends, to let fall, as though on the spur of the moment:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, if you don\u2019t mind. Just one last word on the subject of the lady we were speaking about. You remember Elstir, the painter I met at Balbec?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou remember how much I admired his work?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI do, quite well; and the letter we sent him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well, one of the reasons \u2014 not one of the chief reasons, a subordinate reason \u2014 why I should like to meet the said lady \u2014 you do know who\u2019 I mean, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course I do. How involved you\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs that she has in her house one very fine picture, at least, by Elstir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, I never knew that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cElstir will probably be at Balbec at Easter; you know he stays down there now all the year round, practically. I should very much like to have seen this picture before I leave Paris. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re on sufficiently intimate terms with your aunt: but couldn\u2019t you manage, somehow, to give her so good an impression of me that she won\u2019t refuse, and then ask her if she\u2019ll let me come and see the picture without you, since you won\u2019t be there?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll answer for her; I\u2019ll make a special point of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Robert, you are an angel; I do love you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s very nice of you to love me, but it would be equally nice if you were to call me tu, as you promised, and as you began to do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope it\u2019s not your departure that you two are plotting together,\u201d one of Robert\u2019s friends said to me. \u201cYou know, if Saint-Loup does go on leave, it needn\u2019t make any difference, we shall still be here. It will be less amusing for you, perhaps, but we\u2019ll do all we can to make you forget his absence.\u201d As a matter of fact, just as we had decided that Robert\u2019s mistress would have to go to Bruges by herself, the news came that Captain de Borodino, obdurate hitherto in his refusal, had given authority for Serjeant Saint-Loup to proceed on long leave to Bruges. What had happened was this. The Prince, extremely proud of his luxuriant head of hair, was an assiduous customer of the principal hairdresser in the town, who had started life as a boy under Napoleon III\u2019s barber. Captain de Borodino was on the best of terms with the hairdresser, being, in spite of his air of majesty, quite simple in his dealings with his inferiors. But the hairdresser, through whose books the Prince\u2019s account had been running without payment for at least five years, swollen no less by bottles of Portugal and Eau des Souverains, irons, razors, and strops, than by the ordinary charges for shampooing, haircutting and the like, had a greater respect for Saint-Loup, who always paid on the nail and kept several carriages and saddle-horses. Having learned of Saint-Loup\u2019s vexation at not being able to go with his mistress, he had spoken strongly about it to the Prince at a moment when he was trussed up in a white surplice with his head held firmly over the back of the chair and his throat menaced by a razor. This narrative of a young man\u2019s gallant adventures won from the princely captain a smile of Bonapartish indulgence. It is hardly probable that he thought of his unpaid bill, but the barber\u2019s recommendation tended to put him in as good a humour as one from a duke would have put him in a bad. While his chin was still smothered in soap, the leave was promised, and the warrant was signed that evening. As for the hairdresser, who was in the habit of boasting all day long of his own exploits, and in order to do so claimed for himself, shewing an astonishing faculty for lying, distinctions that were pure fabrications, having for once rendered this signal service to Saint-Loup, not only did he refrain from publishing it broadcast, but, as if vanity were obliged to lie, and when there was no scope for lying gave place to modesty, he never mentioned the matter to Robert again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All his friends assured me that, as long as I stayed at Donci\u00e8res, or if I should come there again at any time, even although Robert were away, their horses, their quarters, their time would be at my disposal, and I felt that it was with the greatest cordiality that these young men put their comfort and youth and strength at the service of my weakness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy on earth,\u201d they went on, after insisting that I should stay, \u201cdon\u2019t you come down here every year; you see how our quiet life appeals to you! Besides you\u2019re so keen about everything that goes on in the regiment; quite the old soldier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For I continued my eager demands that they would classify the different officers whose names I knew according to the degree of admiration which they seemed to deserve, just as, in my schooldays, I used to make the other boys classify the actors of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais. If, in the place of one of the generals whom I had always heard mentioned at the head of the list, such as Galliffet or N\u00e9grier, one of Saint-Loup\u2019s friends, with a contemptuous: \u201cBut N\u00e9grier is one of the feeblest of our general officers,\u201d put the new, intact, appetising name of Pau or Geslin de Bourgogne, I felt the same joyful surprise as long ago when the outworn name of Thiron or Febvre was sent flying by the sudden explosion of the unfamiliar name of Amaury. \u201cBetter even than N\u00e9grier? But in what respect; give me an example?\u201d I should have liked there to exist profound differences even among the junior officers of the regiment, and I hoped in the reason for these differences to seize the essential quality of what constituted military superiority. The one whom I should have been most interested to hear discussed, because he was the one whom I had most often seen, was the Prince de Borodino. But neither Saint-Loup nor his friends, if they did justice to the fine officer who kept his squadron up to the supreme pitch of efficiency, liked the man. Without speaking of him, naturally, in the same tone as of certain other officers, rankers and freemasons, who did not associate much with the rest and had, in comparison, an uncouth, barrack-room manner, they seemed not to include M. de Borodino among the officers of noble birth, from whom, it must be admitted, he differed considerably in his attitude even towards Saint-Loup. The others, taking advantage of the fact that Robert was only an N.C.O., and that therefore his influential relatives might be grateful were he invited to the houses of superior officers on whom ordinarily they would have looked down, lost no opportunity of having him to dine when any bigwig was expected who might be of use to a young cavalry serjeant. Captain de Borodino alone confined himself to his official relations (which, for that matter, were always excellent) with Robert. The fact was that the Prince, whose grandfather had been made a Marshal and a Prince-Duke by the Emperor, with whose family he had subsequently allied himself by marriage, while his father had married a cousin of Napoleon III and had twice been a Minister after the Coup d\u2019Etat, felt that in spite of all this he did not count for much with Saint-Loup and the Guermantes connexion, who in turn, since he did not look at things from the same point of view as they, counted for very little with him. He suspected that, for Saint-Loup, he himself was \u2014 he, a kinsman of the Hohenzollern \u2014 not a true noble but the grandson of a farmer, but at the same time he regarded Saint-Loup as the son of a man whose Countship had been confirmed by the Emperor \u2014 one of what were known in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as \u2018touched-up\u2019 Counts \u2014 and who had besought him first for a Prefecture, then for some other post a long way down the list of subordinates to His Highness the Prince de Borodino, Minister of State, who was styled on his letters \u2018Monseigneur\u2019 and was a nephew of the Sovereign\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something more than a nephew, possibly. The first Princesse de Borodino was reputed to have bestowed her favours on Napoleon I, whom she followed to the Isle of Elba, and the second hers on Napoleon III. And if, in the Captain\u2019s placid countenance, one caught a trace of Napoleon I\u2014 if not in his natural features, at least in the studied majesty of the mask \u2014 the officer had, particularly in his melancholy and kindly gaze, in his drooping moustache, something that reminded one also of Napoleon III; and this in so striking a fashion that, having asked leave, after Sedan, to join the Emperor in captivity, and having been sent away by Bismarck, before whom he had been brought, the latter, happening to look up at the young man who was preparing to leave the room, was at once impressed by the likeness and, reconsidering his decision, recalled him and gave him the authorisation which he, in common with every one else, had just been refused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Prince de Borodino was not prepared to make overtures to Saint-Loup nor to the other representatives of Faubourg Saint-Germain society that there were in the regiment (while he frequently invited two subalterns of plebeian origin who were pleasant companions) it was because, looking down upon them all from the height of his Imperial grandeur, he drew between these two classes of inferiors the distinction that one set consisted of inferiors who knew themselves to be such and with whom he was delighted to spend his time, being beneath his outward majesty of a simple, jovial humour, and the other of inferiors who thought themselves his superiors, a claim which he could not allow. And so, while all the other officers of the regiment made much of Saint-Loup, the Prince de Borodino, to whose care the young man had been recommended by Marshal X\u2014 \u2014 confined himself to being obliging with regard to the military duties which Saint-Loup always performed in the most exemplary fashion, but never had him to his house except on one special occasion when he found himself practically compelled to invite him, and when, as this occurred during my stay at Donci\u00e8res, he asked him to bring me to dinner also. I had no difficulty that evening, as I watched Saint-Loup sitting at his Captain\u2019s table, in distinguishing, in their respective manners and refinements, the difference that existed between the two aristocracies: the old nobility and that of the Empire. The offspring of a caste the faults of which, even if he repudiated them with all the force of his intellect, had been absorbed into his blood, a caste which, having ceased to exert any real authority for at least a century, saw nothing more now in the protective affability which formed part of its regular course of education, than an exercise, like horsemanship or fencing, cultivated without any serious purpose, as a sport; on meeting representatives of that middle class on which the old nobility so far looked down as to believe that they were nattered by its intimacy and would be honoured by the informality of its tone, Saint-Loup would take the hand of no matter who might be introduced to him, though he had failed perhaps to catch the stranger\u2019s name, in a friendly grip, and as he talked to him (crossing and uncrossing his legs all the time, flinging himself back in his chair in an attitude of absolute unconstraint, one foot in the palm of his hand) call him \u2018my dear fellow.\u2019 Belonging o the other hand to a nobility whose titles still preserved their original meaning, provided that their holders still possessed the splendid emoluments given in reward for glorious services and bringing to mind the record of high offices in which one is in command of numberless men and must know how to deal with men, the Prince de Borodino \u2014 not perhaps very distinctly or with any clear personal sense of superiority, but at any rate in his body, which revealed it by its attitudes and behaviour generally \u2014 regarded his own rank as a prerogative that was still effective; those same commoners whom Saint-Loup would have slapped on the shoulder and taken by the arm he addressed with a majestic affability, in which a reserve instinct with grandeur tempered the smiling good-fellowship that came naturally to him, in a tone marked at once by a genuine kindliness and a stiffness deliberately assumed. This was due, no doubt, to his being not so far removed from the great Embassies, and the Court itself, at which his father had held the highest posts, whereas the manners of Saint-Loup, the elbow on the table, the foot in the hand, would not have been well received there; but principally it was due to the fact that he looked down less upon the middle classes because they were the inexhaustible source from which the first Emperor had chosen his marshals and his nobles and in which the second had found a Rouher and a Fould\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Son, doubtless, or grandson of an Emperor, who had nothing more important to do than to command a squadron, the preoccupations of his putative father and grandfather could not, for want of an object on which to fasten themselves, survive in any real sense in the mind of M. de Borodino. But as the spirit of an artist continues to model, for many years after he is dead, the statue which he carved, so they had taken shape in him, were materialised, incarnate in him, it was they that his face reflected. It was with, in his voice, the vivacity of the first Emperor that he worded a reprimand to a corporal, with the dreamy melancholy of the second that he puffed out the smoke of a cigarette. When he passed in plain clothes through the streets of Donci\u00e8res, a certain sparkle in his eyes escaping from under the brim of the bowler hat sent radiating round this captain of cavalry a regal incognito; people trembled when he strode into the serjeant-major\u2019s office, followed by the adjutant and the quartermaster, as though by Berthier and Mass\u00e9na. When he chose the cloth for his squadron\u2019s breeches, he fastened on the master-tailor a gaze capable of baffling Talleyrand and deceiving Alexander; and at times, in the middle of an inspection, he would stop, let his handsome blue eyes cloud with dreams, twist his moustache, with the air of one building up a new Prussia and a new Italy. But a moment later, reverting from Napoleon III to Napoleon I, he would point out that the equipment was not properly polished, and would insist on tasting the men\u2019s rations. And at home, in his private life, it was for the wives of middle class officers (provided that their husbands were not freemasons) that he would bring out not only a dinner service of royal blue S\u00e8vres, fit for an Ambassador (which had been given to his father by Napoleon, and appeared even more priceless in the commonplace house on a provincial street in which he was living, like those rare porcelains which tourists admire with a special delight in the rustic china-cupboard of some old manor that has been converted into a comfortable and prosperous farmhouse), but other gifts of the Emperor also: those noble and charming manners, which too would have won admiration in some diplomatic post abroad, if, for some men, it did not mean a lifelong condemnation to the most unjust form of ostracism, merely to be well born; his easy gestures, his kindness, his grace, and, embedding beneath an enamel that was of royal blue, also glorious images, the mysterious, illuminated, living reliquary of his gaze. And, in treating of the social relations with the middle classes which the Prince had at Donci\u00e8res, it may be as well to add these few words. The lieutenant-colonel played the piano beautifully; the senior medical officer\u2019s wife sang like a Conservatoire medallist. This latter couple, as well as the lieutenant-colonel and his wife, used to dine every week with M. de Borodino. They were flattered, unquestionably, knowing that when the Prince went to Paris on leave he dined with Mme. de Pourtal\u00e8s, and the Murats, and people like that. \u201cBut,\u201d they said to themselves, \u201che\u2019s just a captain, after all; he\u2019s only too glad to get us to come. Still, he\u2019s a real friend, you know.\u201d But when M. de Borodino, who had long been pulling every possible wire to secure an appointment for himself nearer Paris, was posted to Beauvais, he packed up and went, and forgot as completely the two musical couples as he forgot the Donci\u00e8res theatre and the little restaurant to which he used often to send out for his luncheon, and, to their great indignation, neither the lieutenant-colonel nor the senior medical officer, who had so often sat at his table, ever had so much as a single word from him for the rest of their lives. One morning, Saint-Loup confessed to me that he had written to my grandmother to give her news of me, with the suggestion that, since there was telephonic connexion between Paris and Donci\u00e8res, she might make use of it to speak to me. In short, that very day she was to give me a call, and he advised me to be at the post office at about a quarter to four. The telephone was not yet at that date as commonly in use as it is to-day. And yet habit requires so short a time to divest of their mystery the sacred forces with which we are in contact, that, not having had my call at once, the only thought in my mind was that it was very slow, and badly managed, and I almost decided to lodge a complaint. Like all of us nowadays I found not rapid enough for my liking in its abrupt changes the admirable sorcery for which a few moments are enough to bring before us, invisible but present, the person to whom we have been wishing to speak, and who, while still sitting at his table, in the town in which he lives (in my grandmother\u2019s case, Paris), under another sky than ours, in weather that is not necessarily the same, in the midst of circumstances and worries of which we know nothing, but of which he is going to inform us, finds himself suddenly transported hundreds of miles (he and all the surroundings in which he remains immured) within reach of our ear, at the precise moment which our fancy has ordained. And we are like the person in the fairy-tale to whom a sorceress, on his uttering the wish, makes appear with supernatural clearness his grandmother or his betrothed in the act of turning over a book, of shedding tears, of gathering flowers, quite close to the spectator and yet ever so remote, in the place in which she actually is at the moment. We need only, so that the miracle may be accomplished, apply our lips to the magic orifice and invoke \u2014 occasionally for rather longer than seems to us necessary, I admit \u2014 the Vigilant Virgins to whose voices we listen every day without ever coming to know their faces, and who are our Guardian Angels in the dizzy realm of darkness whose portals they so jealously keep; the All Powerful by whose intervention the absent rise up at our side, without our being permitted to set eyes on them; the Danaids of the Unseen who without ceasing empty, fill, transmit the urns of sound; the ironic Furies who, just as we were murmuring a confidence to a friend, in the hope that no one was listening, cry brutally: \u201cI hear you!\u201d; the ever infuriated servants of the Mystery, the umbrageous priestesses of the Invisible, the Young Ladies of the Telephone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, the moment our call has sounded, in the night filled with phantoms to which our ears alone are unsealed, a tiny sound, an abstract sound \u2014 the sound of distance overcome \u2014 and the voice of the dear one speaks to us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is she, it is her voice that is speaking, that is there. But how remote it is! How often have I been unable to listen without anguish, as though, confronted by the impossibility of seeing, except after long hours of journeying, her whose voice has been so close to my ear, I felt more clearly the sham and illusion of meetings apparently most pleasant, and at what a distance we may be from the people we love at the moment when it seems that we have only to stretch out our hand to seize and hold them. A real presence indeed that voice so near \u2014 in actual separation. But a premonition also of an eternal separation! Over and again, as I listened in this way, without seeing her who spoke to me from so far away, it has seemed to me that the voice was crying to me from depths out of which one does not rise again, and I have known the anxiety that was one day to wring my heart when a voice should thus return (alone, and attached no longer to a body which I was never more to see), to murmur, in my ear, words I would fain have kissed as they issued from lips for ever turned to dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This afternoon, alas, at Donci\u00e8res, the miracle did not occur. When I reached the post office, my grandmother\u2019s call had already been received; I stepped into the box; the line was engaged; some one was talking who probably did not realise that there was nobody to answer him, for when I raised the receiver to my ear, the lifeless block began squeaking like Punchinello; I silenced it, as one silences a puppet, by putting it back on its hook, but, like Punchinello, as soon as I took it again in my hand, it resumed its gabbling. At length, giving it up as hopeless, by hanging up the receiver once and for all, I stifled the convulsions of this vociferous stump which kept up its chatter until the last moment, and went in search of the operator, who told me to wait a little; then I spoke, and, after a few seconds of silence, suddenly I heard that voice which I supposed myself, mistakenly, to know so well; for always until then, every time that my grandmother had talked to me, I had been accustomed to follow what she was saying on the open score of her face, in which the eyes figured so largely; but her voice itself I was hearing this afternoon for the first time. And because that voice appeared to me to have altered in its proportions from the moment that it was a whole, and reached me in this way alone and without the accompaniment of her face and features, I discovered for the first time how sweet that voice was; perhaps, too, it had never oeen so sweet, for my grandmother, knowing me to be alone and unhappy, felt that she might let herself go in the outpouring of an affection which, on her principle of education, she usually restrained and kept hidden. It was sweet, but also how sad it was, first of all on account of its very sweetness, a sweetness drained almost \u2014 more than any but a few human voices can ever have been \u2014 of every element of resistance to others, of all selfishness; fragile by reason of its delicacy it seemed at every moment ready to break, to expire in a pure flow of tears; then, too, having it alone beside me, seen, without the mask of her face, I noticed for the first time the sorrows that had scarred it in the course of a lifetime\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it, however, solely the voice that, because it was alone, gave me this new impression which tore my heart? Not at all; it was rather that this isolation of the voice was like a symbol, a presentation, a direct consequence of another isolation, that of my grandmother, separated, for the first time in my life, from myself. The orders or prohibitions which she addressed to me at every moment in the ordinary course of my life, the tedium of obedience or the fire of rebellion which neutralised the affection that I felt for her were at this moment eliminated, and indeed might be eliminated for ever (since my grandmother no longer insisted on having me with her under her control, was in the act of expressing her hope that I would stay at Donci\u00e8res altogether, or would at any rate extend my visit for as long as possible, seeing that both my health and my work seemed likely to benefit by the change); also, what I held compressed in this little bell that was ringing in my ear was, freed from the conflicting pressures which had, every day hitherto, given it a counterpoise, and from this moment irresistible, carrying me altogether away, our mutual affection. My grandmother, by telling me to stay, filled me with an anxious, an insensate longing to return. This freedom of action which for the future she allowed me and to which I had never dreamed that she would consent, appeared to me suddenly as sad as might be my freedom of action after her death (when I should still love her and she would for ever have abandoned me). \u201cGranny!\u201d I cried to her, \u201cGranny!\u201d and would fain have kissed her, but I had beside me only that voice, a phantom, as impalpable as that which would come perhaps to revisit me when my grandmother was dead. \u201cSpeak to me!\u201d but then it happened that, left more solitary still, I ceased to catch the sound of her voice. My grandmother could no longer hear me; she was no longer in communication with me; we had ceased to stand face to face, to be audible to one another; I continued to call her, sounding the empty night, in which I felt that her appeals also must be straying. I was shaken by the same anguish which, in the distant past, I had felt once before, one day when, a little child, in a crowd, I had lost her, an anguish due less to my not finding her than to the thought that she must be searching for me, must be saying to herself that I was searching for her; an anguish comparable to that which I was to feel on the day when we speak to those who can no longer reply and whom we would so love to have hear all the things that we have not told them, and our assurance that we are not unhappy. It seemed as though it were already a beloved ghost that I had allowed to lose herself in the ghostly world, and, standing alone before the instrument, I went on vainly repeating: \u201cGranny, Granny!\u201d as Orpheus, left alone, repeats the name of his dead wife, is decided to leave the post office, to go and find Robert at his restaurant, in order to tell him that, as I was half expecting a telegram which would oblige me to return to Paris, I wished at all costs to find out at what times the trains left. And yet, before reaching this decision, I felt I must make one attempt more to invoke the Daughters of the Night, the Messengers of the Word, the Deities without form or feature; but the capricious Guardians had not deigned once again to unclose the miraculous portals, or more probably, had not been able; in vain might they untiringly appeal, as was their custom, to the venerable inventor of printing and the young prince, collector of impressionist paintings and driver of motor-cars (who was Captain de Borodino\u2019s nephew); Gutenberg and Wagram left their supplications unanswered, and I came away, feeling that the Invisible would continue to turn a deaf ear\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I came among Robert and his friends, I withheld the confession that my heart was no longer with them, that my departure was now irrevocably fixed. Saint-Loup appeared to believe me, but I learned afterwards that he had from the first moment realised that my uncertainty was feigned and that he would not see me again next day. And while, letting their plates grow cold, his friends joined him in searching through the time-table for a train which would take me to Paris, and while we heard in the cold, starry night the whistling of the engines on the line, I certainly felt no longer the same peace of mind which on all these last evenings I had derived from the friendship of the former and the latter\u2019s distant passage. And yet they did not fail me this evening, performing the same office in a different way. My departure overpowered me less when I was no longer obliged to think of it by myself, when I felt that there was concentrated on what was to be done the more normal, more wholesome activity of my strenuous friends, Robert\u2019s brothers in arms, and of those other strong creatures, the trains, whose going and coming, night and morning, between Donci\u00e8res and Paris, broke up in retrospect what had been too compact and insupportable in my long isolation from my grandmother into daily possibilities of return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t doubt the truth of what you\u2019re saying, or that you aren\u2019t thinking of leaving us just yet,\u201d said Saint-Loup, smiling; \u201cbut pretend you are going, and come and say good-bye to me to-morrow morning; early, otherwise there\u2019s a risk of my not seeing you; I\u2019m going out to luncheon, I\u2019ve got leave from the Captain; I shall have to be back in barracks by two, as we are to be on the march all afternoon. I suppose the man to whose house I\u2019m going, a couple of miles out, will manage to get me back in time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarcely had he uttered these words when a messenger came for me from my hotel; the telephone operator had sent to find me. I ran to the post office, for it was nearly closing time. The word \u2018trunks\u2019 recurred incessantly in the answers given me by the officiais. I was in a fever of anxiety, for it was my grandmother who had asked for me. The office was closing for the night. Finally I got my connexion. \u201cIs that you, Granny?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice, with a strong English accent, answered: \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t know your voice.\u201d Neither did I recognise the voice that was speaking to me; besides, my grandmother called me tu, and not vous. And then all was explained. The young man for whom his grandmother had called on the telephone had a name almost identical with my own, and was staying in an annex of my hotel. This call coming on the very day on which I had been telephoning to my grandmother, I had never for a moment doubted that it was she who was asking for me. Whereas it was by pure coincidence that the post office and the hotel had combined to make a twofold error\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following morning I rose late, and failed to catch Saint-Loup, who had already started for the country house where he was invited to luncheon. About half past one, I had decided to go in any case to the barracks, so as to be there before he arrived, when, as I was crossing one of the avenues on the way there, I noticed, coming behind me in the same direction as myself, a tilbury which, as it overtook me, obliged me to jump out of its way; an N.C.O. was driving it, wearing an eyeglass; it was Saint-Loup. By his side was the friend whose guest he had been at luncheon, and whom I had met once before at the hotel where we dined. I did not dare shout to Robert since he was not alone, but, in the hope that he would stop and pick me up, I attracted his attention by a sweeping wave of my hat, which might be regarded as due to the presence of a stranger. I knew that Robert was short-sighted; still, I should have supposed that, provided he saw me at all, he could not fail to recognise me; he did indeed see my salute, and returned it, but without stopping; driving on at full speed, without a smile, without moving a muscle of his face, he confined himself to keeping his hand raised for a minute to the peak of his cap, as though he were acknowledging the salute of a trooper whom he did not know personally. I ran to the barracks, but it was a long way; when I arrived, the regiment was parading on the square, on which I was not allowed to stand, and I was heart-broken at not having been able to say good-bye to Saint-Loup; I went up to his room, but he had gone; I was reduced to questioning a group of sick details, recruits who had been excused route-marches, the young graduate, one of the \u2018old soldiers,\u2019 who were watching the regiment parade\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Serjeant Saint-Loup, have you, by any chance?\u201d I asked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s gone on parade, sir,\u201d said the old soldier\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never saw him,\u201d said the graduate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou never saw him,\u201d exclaimed the old soldier, losing all interest in me, \u201cyou never saw our famous Saint-Loup, the figure he\u2019s cutting with his new breeches! When the Capstan sees that, officer\u2019s cloth, my word!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, you\u2019re a wonder, you are; officer\u2019s cloth,\u201d replied the young graduate, who, reported \u2018sick in quarters,\u2019 was excused marching and tried, not without some misgivings, to be on easy terms with the veterans. \u201cThis officer\u2019s cloth you speak of is cloth like that, is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir?\u201d asked the old soldier angrily\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was indignant that the young graduate should throw doubt on the breeches\u2019 being made of officer\u2019s cloth, but, being a Breton, coming from a village that went by the name of Penguern-Stereden, having learned French with as much difficulty as if it had been English or German, whenever he felt himself overcome by emotion he would go on saying \u2018Sir?\u2019 to give himself time to find words, then, after this preparation, let loose his eloquence, confining himself to the repetition of certain words which he knew better than others, but without haste, taking every precaution to gloss over his unfamiliarity with the pronunciation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! It is cloth like that,\u201d he broke out, with a fury the intensity of which increased as the speed of his utterance diminished. \u201cAh! It is cloth like that; when I tell you that it is, officer\u2019s cloth, when-I-tell-you-a-thing, if-I-tell-you-a-thing, it\u2019s because I know, I should think.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well, then;\u201d replied the young graduate, overcome by the force of this argument. \u201cKeep your hair on, old boy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere, look, there\u2019s the Capstan coming along. No, but just look at Saint-Loup; the way he throws his leg out; and his head. Would you call that a non-com? And his eyeglass; oh, he\u2019s hot stuff, he is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I asked these troopers, who did not seem at all embarrassed by my presence, whether I too might look out of the window. They neither objected to my doing so nor moved to make room for me. I saw Captain de Borodino go majestically by, putting his horse into a trot, and apparently under the illusion that he was taking part in the Battle of Austerlitz. A few loiterers had stopped by the gate to see the regiment file out. Erect on his charger, his face inclined to plumpness, his cheeks of an Imperial fulness, his eye lucid, the Prince must have been the victim of some hallucination, as I was myself whenever, after the tramway-car had passed, the silence that followed its rumble seemed to me to throb and echo with a vaguely musical palpitation. I was wretched at not having said good-bye to Saint-Loup, but I went nevertheless, for my one anxiety was to return to my grandmother; always until then, in this little country town, when I thought of what my grandmother must be doing by herself, I had pictured her as she was when with me, suppressing my own personality but without taking into account the effects of such a suppression; now, I had to free myself, at the first possible moment, in her arms, from the phantom, hitherto unsuspected and suddenly called into being by her voice, of a grandmother really separated from me, resigned, having, what I had never yet thought of her as having, a definite age, who had just received a letter from me in an empty house, as I had once before imagined Mamma in a house by herself, when I had left her to go to Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, this phantom was just what I did see when, entering the drawing-room before my grandmother had been told of my return, I found her there, reading. I was in the room, or rather I was not yet in the room since she was not aware of my presence, and, like a woman whom one surprises at a piece of work which she will lay aside if anyone comes in, she had abandoned herself to a train of thoughts which she had never allowed to be visible by me. Of myself \u2014 thanks to that privilege which does not last but which one enjoys during the brief moment of return, the faculty of being a spectator, so to speak, of one\u2019s own absence \u2014 there was present only the witness, the observer, with a hat and travelling coat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photographer who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again. The process that mechanically occurred in my eyes when I caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph. We never see the people who are dear to us save in the animated system, the perpetual motion of our incessant love for them, which before allowing the images that their faces present to reach us catches them in its vortex, flings them back upon the idea that we have always had of them, makes them adhere to it, coincide with it. How, since into the forehead, the cheeks of my grandmother I had been accustomed to read all the most delicate, the most permanent qualities of her mind; how, since every casual glance is an act of necromancy, each face that we love a mirror of the past, how could I have failed to overlook what in her had become dulled and changed, seeing that in the most trivial spectacles of our daily life, our eye, charged with thought, neglects, as would a classical tragedy, every image that does not assist the action of the play and retains only those that may help to make its purpose intelligible. But if, in place of our eye, it should be a purely material object, a photographic plate, that has watched the action, then what we shall see, in the courtyard of the Institute, for example, will be, instead of the dignified emergence of an Academician who is going to hail a cab, his staggering gait, his precautions to avoid tumbling upon his back, the parabola of his fall, as though he were drunk, or the ground frozen over. So is it when some casual sport of chance prevents our intelligent and pious affection from coming forward in time to hide from our eyes what they ought never to behold, when it is forestalled by our eyes, and they, arising first in the field and having it to themselves, set to work mechanically, like films, and shew us, in place of the loved friend who has long ago ceased to exist but whose death our affection has always hitherto kept concealed from us, the new person whom a hundred times daily that affection has clothed with a dear and cheating likeness. And, as a sick man who for long has not looked at his own reflexion, and has kept his memory of the face that he never sees refreshed from the ideal image of himself that he carries in his mind, recoils on catching sight in the glass, in the midst of an arid waste of cheek, of the sloping red structure of a nose as huge as one of the pyramids of Egypt, I, for whom my grandmother was still myself, I who had never seen her save in my own soul, always at the same place in the past, through the transparent sheets of contiguous, overlapping memories, suddenly in our drawing-room which formed part of a new world, that of time, that in which dwell the strangers of whom we say \u201cHe\u2019s begun to age a good deal,\u201d for the first time and for a moment only, since she vanished at once, I saw, sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp, red-faced, heavy and common, sick, lost in thought, following the lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane, a dejected old woman whom I did not know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My request to be allowed to inspect the Elstirs in Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s collection had been met by Saint-Loup with: \u201cI will answer for her.\u201d And indeed, as ill luck would have it, it was he and he alone who did answer. We answer readily enough for other people when, setting our mental stage with the little puppets that represent them, we manipulate these to suit our fancy. No doubt even then we take into account the difficulties due to another person\u2019s nature being different from our own, and we do not fail to have recourse to some plan of action likely to influence that nature, an appeal to his material interest, persuasion, the rousing of emotion, which will neutralise contrary tendencies on his part. But these differences from our own nature, it is still our own nature that is imagining them, these difficulties, it is we that are raising them; these compelling motives, it is we that are applying them. And so with the actions which before our mind\u2019s eye we have made the other person rehearse, and which make him act as we choose; when we wish to see him perform them in real life, the case is altered, we come up against unseen resistances which may prove insuperable. One of the strongest is doubtless that which may be developed in a woman who is not in love with him by the disgust inspired in her, a fetid, insurmountable loathing, by the man who is in love with her; during the long weeks in which Saint-Loup still did not come to Paris, his aunt, to whom I had no doubt of his having written begging her to do so, never once asked me to call at her house to see the Elstirs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I perceived signs of coldness on the part of another occupant of the building. This was Jupien. Did he consider that I ought to have gone in and said how d\u2019ye do to him, on my return from Donci\u00e8res, before even going upstairs to our own flat? My mother said no, that there was nothing unusual about it. Fran\u00e7oise had told her that he was like that, subject to sudden fits of ill humour, without any cause. These invariably passed off after a little time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the winter was drawing to an end. One morning, after several weeks of showers and storms, I heard in my chimney \u2014 instead of the wind, formless, elastic, sombre, which convulsed me with a longing to go to the sea \u2014 the cooing of the pigeons that were nesting in the wall outside; shimmering, unexpected, like a first hyacinth, gently tearing open its fostering heart that there might shoot forth, purple and satin-soft, its flower of sound, letting in like an opened window into my bedroom still shuttered and dark the heat, the dazzling brightness, the fatigue of a first fine day. That morning, I was surprised to find myself humming a music-hall tune which had never entered my head since the year in which I had been going to Florence and Venice. So profoundly does the atmosphere, as good days and bad recur, act on our organism and draw from dim shelves where we had forgotten them, the melodies written there which our memory rould not decipher. Presently a more conscious dreamer accompanied this musician to whom I was listening inside myself, without having recognised at first what he was playing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I quite realised that it was not for any reason peculiar to Balbec that on my arrival there I had failed to find in its church the charm which it had had for me before I knew it; that at Florence or Parma or Venice my imagination could no more take the place of my eyes when I looked at the sights there. I realised this. Similarly, one New Year\u2019s afternoon, as night fell, standing before a column of playbills, I had discovered the illusion that lies in our thinking that certain solemn holidays differ essentially from the other days in the calendar. And yet I could not prevent my memory of the time during which I had looked forward to spending Easter in Florence from continuing to make that festival the atmosphere, so to speak, of the City of Flowers, to give at once to Easter Day something Florentine and to Florence something Paschal. Easter was still a long way off; but in the range of days that stretched out before me the days of Holy Week stood out more clearly at the end of those that merely came between. Touched by a far-flung ray, like certain houses in a village which one sees from a distance when the rest are in shadow, they had caught and kept all the sun\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weather had now become milder. And my parents themselves, by urging me to take more exercise, gave me an excuse for resuming my morning walks. I had meant to give them up, since they meant my meeting Mme. de Guermantes. But it was for this very reason that I kept thinking all the time of those walks, which led to my finding, every moment, a fresh reason for taking them, a reason that had no connexion with Mme. de Guermantes and no difficulty in convincing me that, had she never existed, I should still have taken a walk, without fail, at that hour every morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, if to me meeting any person other than herself would not have mattered, I felt that to her meeting anyone in the world except myself would have been endurable. It happened that, in the course of her morning walks, she received the salutations of plenty of fools whom she regarded as such. But the appearance of these in her path seemed to her, if not to hold out any promise of pleasure, to be at any rate the result of mere accident. And she stopped them at times, for there are moments in which one wants to escape from oneself, to accept the hospitality offered by the soul of another person, provided always that the other, however modest and plain it may be, is a different soul, whereas in my heart she was exasperated to feel that what she would have found was herself. And so, even when I had, for taking the same way as she, another reason than my desire to see her, I trembled like a guilty man as she came past; and sometimes, so as to neutralise anything extravagant that there might seem to have been in my overtures, I would barely acknowledge her bow, or would fasten my eyes on her face without raising my hat, and succeed only in making her angrier than ever, and begin to regard me as insolent and ill-bred besides\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was now wearing lighter, or at any rate brighter, clothes, and would come strolling down the street in which already, as though it were spring, in front of the narrow shops that were squeezed in between the huge fronts of the old aristocratic mansions, over the booths of the butter-woman and the fruit-woman and the vegetable-woman, awnings were spread to protect them from the sun. I said to myself that the woman whom I could see far off, walking, opening her sunshade, crossing the street, was, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the greatest living exponent of the art of performing those movements and of making out of them something exquisitely lovely. Meanwhile she was advancing towards me, unconscious of this widespread reputation, her narrow, stubborn body, which had absorbed none of it, was bent stiffly forward under a scarf of violet silk; her clear, sullen eyes looked absently in front of her, and had perhaps caught sight of me; she was biting her lip; I saw her straighten her muff, give alms to a beggar, buy a bunch of violets from a flower-seller, with the same curiosity that I should have felt in watching the strokes of a great painter\u2019s brush. And when, as she reached me, she gave me a bow that was accompanied sometimes by a faint smile, it was as though she had sketched in colour for me, adding a personal inscription to myself, a drawing that was a masterpiece of art. Each of her gowns seemed to me her natural, necessary surroundings, like the projection around her of a particular aspect of her soul. On one of these Lenten mornings, when she was on her way out to luncheon, I met her wearing a gown of bright red velvet, cut slightly open at the throat. The face of Mme. de Guermantes appeared to be dreaming, beneath its pile of fair hair. I was less sad than usual because the melancholy of her expression, the sort of claustration which the startling hue of her gown set between her and the rest of the world, made her seem somehow lonely and unhappy, and this comforted me. The gown struck me as being the materialisation round about her of the scarlet rays of a heart which I did not recognise as hers and might have been able, perhaps, to console; sheltered in the mystical light of the garment with its gently flowing folds, she made me think of some Saint of the early ages of Christianity. After which I felt ashamed of afflicting with the sight of myself this holy martyr. \u201cBut, after all, the streets are public.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The streets are public, I reminded myself, giving a different meaning to the words, and marvelling that indeed in the crowded thoroughfare often soaked with rain, which made it beautiful and precious as a street sometimes is in the old towns of Italy, the Duchesse de Guermantes mingled with the public life of the world moments of her own secret life, shewing herself thus to all and sundry, jostled by every passer-by, with the splendid gratuitousness of the greatest works of art. As I had been out in the morning, after staying awake all night, in the afternoon my parents would tell me to lie down for a little and try to sleep. There is no need, when one is trying to find sleep, to give much thought to the quest, but habit is very useful, and even freedom from thought. But in these afternoon hours both were lacking. Before going to sleep, I devoted so much time to thinking that I should not be able to sleep, that even after I was asleep a little of my thought remained. It was no more than a glimmer in the almost total darkness, but it was bright enough to cast a reflexion in my sleep, first of the idea that I could not sleep, and then, a reflexion of this reflexion, that it was in my sleep that I had had the idea that I was not asleep, then, by a further refraction, my awakening . . . to a fresh doze in which I was trying to tell some friends who had come into my room that, a moment earlier, when I was asleep, I had imagined that I was not asleep. These shades were barely distinguishable; it would have required a keen \u2014 and quite useless \u2014 delicacy of perception to seize them all. Similarly, in later years, at Venice, long after the sun had set, when it seemed to be quite dark, I have seen, thanks to the echo, itself imperceptible, of a last note of light, held indefinitely on the surface of the canals, as though some optical pedal were being pressed, the reflexion of the palaces unfurled, as though for all time, in a darker velvet, on the crepuscular greyness of the water. One of my dreams was the synthesis of what my imagination had often sought to depict, in my waking hours, of a certain seagirt place and its mediaeval past. In my sleep I saw a gothic fortress rising from a sea whose waves were stilled as in a painted window. An arm of the sea cut the town in two; the green water stretched to my feet; it bathed on the opposite shore the foundations of an oriental church, and beyond it houses which existed already in the fourteenth century, so that to go across to them would have been to ascend the stream of time. This dream in which nature had learned from art, in which the sea had turned gothic, this dream in which I longed to attain, in which I believed that I was attaining to the impossible, it seemed to me that I had often dreamed it before. But as it is the property of what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past, and to appear, even when novel, familiar, I supposed that I was mistaken. I noticed, however, that I did frequently have this dream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limitations, too, that are common to all sleep were reflected in mine, but in a symbolical manner; I could not in the darkness make out the faces of the friends who were in the room, for we sleep with our eyes shut. I, who could carry on endless arguments with myself while I dreamed, as soon as I tried to speak to these friends felt the words stick in my throat, for we do not speak distinctly in our sleep; I wanted to go to them, and I could not move my limbs, for we do not walk when we are asleep either; and suddenly I was ashamed to be seen by them, for we sleep without our clothes. So, my eyes blinded, my lips sealed, my limbs fettered, my body naked, the figure of sleep which my sleep itself projected had the appearance of those great allegorical figures (in one of which Giotto has portrayed Envy with a serpent in her mouth) of which Swann had given me photographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup came to Paris for a few hours only. He came with assurances that he had had no opportunity of mentioning me to his aunt. \u201cShe\u2019s not being at all nice just now, Oriane isn\u2019t,\u201d he explained, with innocent self-betrayal. \u201cShe\u2019s not my old Oriane any longer, they\u2019ve gone and changed her. I assure you, it\u2019s not worth while bothering your head about her. You pay her far too great a compliment. You wouldn\u2019t care to meet my cousin Poictiers?\u201d he went on, without stopping to reflect that this could not possibly give me any pleasure. \u201cQuite an intelligent young woman, she is; you\u2019d like her. She\u2019s married to my cousin, the Duc de Poictiers, who is a good fellow, but a bit slow for her. I\u2019ve told her about you. She said I was to bring you to see her. She\u2019s much better looking than Oriane, and younger, too. Really a nice person, don\u2019t you know, really a good sort.\u201d These were expressions recently \u2014 and all the more ardently \u2014 taken up by Robert, which meant that the person in question had a delicate nature. \u201cI don\u2019t go so far as to say she\u2019s a Dreyfusard, you must remember the sort of people she lives among; still, she did say to me: \u2018If he is innocent, how ghastly for him to be shut up on the Devil\u2019s Isle.\u2019 You see what I mean, don\u2019t you? And then she\u2019s the sort of woman who does a tremendous lot for her old governesses; she\u2019s given orders that they\u2019re never to be sent in by the servants\u2019 stair, when they come to the house. She\u2019s a very good sort, I assure you. The real reason why Oriane doesn\u2019t like her is that she feels she\u2019s the cleverer of the two.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although completely absorbed in the pity which she felt for one of the Guermantes footmen \u2014 who had no chance of going to see his girl, even when the Duchess was out, for it would immediately have been reported to her from the lodge \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise was heartbroken at not having been in the house at the moment of Saint-Loup\u2019s visit, but this was because now she herself paid visits also. She never failed to go out on the days when I most wanted her. It was always to see her brother, her niece and, more particularly, her own daughter, who had recently come to live in Paris. The intimate nature of these visits itself increased the irritation that I felt at being deprived of her services, for I had a foreboding that she would speak of them as being among those duties from which there was no dispensation, according to the laws laid down at Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I never listened to her excuses without an ill humour which was highly unjust to her, and was brought to a climax by the way Fran\u00e7oise had of saying not: \u201cI have been to see my brother,\u201d or \u201cI have been to see my niece,\u201d but \u201cI have been to see the brother,\u201d \u201cI just looked in as I passed to bid good day to the niece\u201d (or \u201cto my niece the butcheress\u201d). As for her daughter, Fran\u00e7oise would have been glad to see her return to Combray. But this recent Parisian, making use, like a woman of fashion, of abbreviations, though hers were of a vulgar kind, protested that the week she was going shortly to spend at Combray would seem quite long enough without so much as a sight of \u201cthe Intran.\u201d She was still less willing to go to Franchise\u2019s sister, who lived in a mountainous country, for \u201cmountains,\u201d said the daughter, giving to the adjective a new and terrible meaning, \u201caren\u2019t really interesting.\u201d She could not make Up her mind to go back to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, where \u201cthe people are so stupid,\u201d where in the market the gossips at their stalls would call cousins with her, and say \u201cWhy, it\u2019s never poor Bazireau\u2019s daughter?\u201d She would sooner die than go back and bury herself down there, now that she had \u201ctasted the life of Paris,\u201d and Fran\u00e7oise, traditionalist as she was, smiled complacently nevertheless at the spirit of innovation that was incarnate in this new Parisian when she said: \u201cVery well, mother, if you don\u2019t get your day out, you have only to send me a pneu.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weather had turned chilly again. \u201cGo out? What for? To catch your death?\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, who preferred to remain in the house during the week which her daughter and brother and the butcher-niece had gone to spend at Combray. Being, moreover, the last surviving adherent of the sect in whom persisted obscurely the doctrine of my aunt L\u00e9onie \u2014 a natural philosopher \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise would add, speaking of this unseasonable weather: \u201cIt is the remnant of the wrath of God!\u201d But I responded to her complaints only in a languid smile; all the more indifferent to these predictions, in that whatever befell it would be fine for me; already I could see the morning sun shine on the slope of Fiesole, I warmed myself in its rays; their strength obliged me to half open, half shut my eyelids, smiling the while, and my eyelids, like alabaster lamps, were filled with a rosy glow. It was not only the bells that came from Italy, Italy had come with them. My faithful hands would not lack flowers to honour the anniversary of the pilgrimage which I ought to have made long ago, for since, here in Paris, the weather had turned cold again as in another year at the time of our preparations for departure at the end of Lent, in the liquid, freezing air which bathed the chestnuts and planes on the boulevards, the tree in the courtyard of our house, there were already opening their petals, as in a bowl of pure water, the narcissi, the jonquils, the anemones of the Ponte Vecchio\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had informed us that he now knew, from his friend A. J., where M. de Norpois was going when he met him about the place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s to see Mme. de Villeparisis, they are great friends; I never knew anything about it. It seems she\u2019s a delightful person, a most superior woman. You ought to go and call on her,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnother thing that surprised me very much. He spoke to me of M. de Guermantes as quite a distinguished man; I had always taken him for a boor. It seems, he knows an enormous amount, and has perfect taste, only he\u2019s very proud of his name and his connexions. But for that matter, according to Norpois, he has a tremendous position, not only here but all over Europe. It appears, the Austrian Emperor and the Tsar treat him just like one of themselves. Old Norpois told me that Mme. de Villeparisis had taken quite a fancy to you, and that you would meet all sorts of interesting people in her house. He paid a great tribute to you; you will see him if you go there, and he may have some good advice for you even if you are going to be a writer. For you\u2019re not likely to do anything else; I can see that. It might turn out quite a good career; it\u2019s not what I should have chosen for you, myself; but you\u2019ll be a man in no time now, we shan\u2019t always be here to look after you, and we mustn\u2019t prevent you from following your vocation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If only I had been able to start writing! But whatever the conditions in which I approached the task (as, too, alas, the undertakings not to touch alcohol, to go to bed early, to sleep, to keep fit), whether it were with enthusiasm, with method, with pleasure, in depriving myself of a walk, or postponing my walk and keeping it in reserve as a reward of industry, taking advantage of an hour of good health, utilising the inactivity forced on me by a day of illness, what always emerged in the end from all my effort was a virgin page, undefiled by any writing, ineluctable as that forced card which in certain tricks one invariably is made to draw, however carefully one may first have shuffled the pack. I was merely the instrument of habits of not working, of not going to bed, of not sleeping, which must find expression somehow, cost what it might; if I offered them no resistance, if I contented myself with the pretext they seized from the first opportunity that the day afforded them of acting as they chose, I escaped without serious injury, I slept for a few hours after all, towards morning, I read a little, I did not over-exert myself; but if I attempted to thwart them, if I pretended to go to bed early, to drink only water, to work, they grew restive, they adopted strong measures, they made me really ill, I was obliged to double my dose of alcohol, did not lie down in bed for two days and nights on end, could not even read, and I vowed that another time I would be more reasonable, that is to say less wise, like the victim of an assault who allows himself to be robbed for fear, should he offer resistance, of being murdered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father, in the meantime, had met M. de Guermantes once or twice, and, now that M. de Norpois had told him that the Duke was a remarkable man, had begun to pay more attention to what he said. As it happened, they met in the courtyard and discussed Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cHe tells me, she\u2019s his aunt; \u2018Viparisi,\u2019 he pronounces it. He tells me, too, she\u2019s an extraordinarily able woman. In fact he said she kept a School of Wit,\u201d my father announced to us, impressed by the vagueness of this expression, which he had indeed come across now and then in volumes of memoirs, but without attaching to it any definite meaning. My mother, so great was her respect for him, when she saw that he did not dismiss as of no importance the fact that Mme. de Villeparisis kept a School of Wit, decided that this must be of some consequence. Albeit from my grandmother she had known all the time the exact amount of the Marquise\u2019s intellectual worth, it was immediately enhanced in her eyes. My grandmother, who was not very well just then, was not in favour at first of the suggested visit, and afterwards lost interest in the matter. Since we had moved into our new flat, Mme. de Villeparisis had several times asked my grandmother to call upon her. And invariably my grandmother had replied that she was not going out just at present, in one of those letters which, by a new habit of hers which we did not understand, she no longer sealed herself, but employed Fran\u00e7oise to lick the envelopes for her. As for myself, without any very clear picture in my mind of this School of Wit, I should not have been greatly surprised to find the old lady from Balbec installed behind a desk, as, for that matter, I eventually did\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father would have been glad to know, into the bargain, whether the Ambassador\u2019s support would be worth many votes to him at the Institute, for which he had thoughts of standing as an independent candidate. To tell the truth, while he did not venture to doubt that he would have M. de Norpois\u2019s support, he was by no means certain of it. He had thought it merely malicious gossip when they assured him at the Ministry that M. de Norpois, wishing to be himself the only representative there of the Institute, would put every possible obstacle in the way of my father\u2019s candidature, which besides would be particularly awkward for him at that moment, since he was supporting another candidate already. And yet, when M. Leroy-Beaulieu had first advised him to stand, and had reckoned up his chances, my father had been struck by the fact that, among the colleagues upon whom he could count for support, the eminent economist had not mentioned M. de Norpois. He dared not ask the Ambassador point-blank, but hoped that I should return from my call on Mme. de Villeparisis with his election as good as secured. This call was now imminent. That M. de Norpois would carry on propaganda calculated to assure my father the votes of at least two thirds of the Academy seemed to him all the more probable since the Ambassador\u2019s willingness to oblige was proverbial, those who liked him least admitting that no one else took such pleasure in being of service. And besides, at the Ministry, his protective influence was extended over my father far more markedly than over any other official\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had also another encounter about this time, but one at which his extreme surprise ended in equal indignation. In the street one day he ran into Mme. Sazerat, whose life in Paris her comparative poverty restricted to occasional visits to a friend. There was no one who bored my father quite so intensely as did Mme. Sazerat, so much so that Mamma was obliged, once a year, to intercede with him in sweet and suppliant tones: \u201cMy dear, I really must invite Mme. Sazerat to the house, just once; she won\u2019t stay long;\u201d and even: \u201cListen, dear, I am going to ask you to make a great sacrifice; do go and call upon Mme. Sazerat. You know I hate bothering you, but it would be so nice of you.\u201d He would laugh, raise various objections, and go to pay the call. And so, for all that Mme. Sazerat did not appeal to him, on catching sight of her in the street my father went towards her, hat in hand; but to his profound astonishment Mme. Sazerat confined her greeting to the frigid bow enforced by politeness towards a person who is guilty of some disgraceful action or has been condemned to live, for the future, in another hemisphere. My father had come home speechless with rage. Next day my mother met Mme. Sazerat in some one\u2019s house. She did not offer my mother her hand, but only smiled at her with a vague and melancholy air as one smiles at a person with whom one used to play as a child, but with whom one has since severed all one\u2019s relations because she has led an abandoned life, has married a convict or (what is worse still) a co-respondent. Now, from all time my parents had accorded to Mme. Sazerat, and inspired in her, the most profound respect. But (and of this my mother was ignorant) Mme. Sazerat, alone of her kind at Combray, was a Dreyfusard. My father, a friend of M. M\u00e9line, was convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. He had flatly refused to listen to some of his colleagues who had asked him to sign a petition demanding a fresh trial. He never spoke to me for a week, after learning that I had chosen to take a different line. His opinions were well known. He came near to being looked upon as a Nationalist. As for my grandmother, in whom alone of the family a generous doubt was likely to be kindled, whenever anyone spoke to her of the possible innocence of Dreyfus, she gave a shake of her head, the meaning of which we did not at the time understand, but which was like the gesture of a person who has been interrupted while thinking of more serious things. My mother, torn between her love for my father and her hope that I might turn out to have brains, preserved an impartiality which she expressed by silence. Finally my grandfather, who adored the Army (albeit his duties with the National Guard had been the bugbear of his riper years), could never, at Combray, see a regiment go by the garden railings without baring his head as the colonel and the colours passed. All this was quite enough to make Mme. Sazerat, who knew every incident of the disinterested and honourable careers of my father and grandfather, regard them as pillars of Injustice. We pardon the crimes of individuals, but not their participation in a collective crime. As soon as she knew my father to be an anti-Dreyfusard she set between him and herself continents and centuries. Which explains why, across such an interval of time and space, her bow had been imperceptible to my father, and why it had not occurred to her to hold out her hand, or to say a few words which would never have carried across the worlds that lay between\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup, who was coming anyhow to Paris, had promised to take me to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, where I hoped, though I had not said so to him, that we might meet Mme. de Guermantes. He invited me to luncheon in a restaurant with his mistress, whom we were afterwards to accompany to a rehearsal. We were to go out in the morning and call for her at her home on the outskirts of Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had asked Saint-Loup that the restaurant to which we went for luncheon (in the lives of young noblemen with money to spend the restaurant plays as important a part as do bales of merchandise in Arabian stories), might, if possible, be that to which Aim\u00e9 had told me that he would be going as head waiter until the Balbec season started. It was a great attraction to me who dreamed of so many expeditions and made so few to see again some one who formed part not merely of my memories of Balbec but of Balbec itself, who went there year after year, who when ill health or my studies compelled me to stay in Paris would be watching, just the same, through the long July afternoons while he waited for the guests to come in to dinner, the sun creep down the sky and set in the sea, through the glass panels of the great dining-room, behind which, at the hour when the light died, the motionless wings of vessels, smoky blue in the distance, looked like exotic and nocturnal moths in a show-case. Himself magnetised by his contact with the strong lodestone of Balbec, this head waiter became in turn a magnet attracting me. I hoped by talking to him to get at once into communication with Balbec, to have realised here in Paris something of the delights of travel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I left the house early, with Fran\u00e7oise complaining bitterly because the footman who was engaged to be married had once again been prevented, the evening before, from going to see his girl. Fran\u00e7oise had found him in tears; he had been itching to go and strike the porter, but had restrained himself, for he valued his place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before reaching Saint-Loup\u2019s, where he was to be waiting for me at the door, I ran into Legrandin, of whom we had lost sight since our Combray days, and who, though now grown quite grey, had preserved his air of youthful candour. Seeing me, he stopped:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! So it\u2019s you,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201ca man of fashion, and in a frock coat too! That is a livery in which my independent spirit would be ill at ease. It is true that you are a man of the world, I suppose, and go out paying calls! To go and dream, as I do, before some half ruined tomb, my flowing tie and jacket are not out of place. You know how I admire the charming quality of your soul; that is why I tell you how deeply I regret that you should go forth and deny it among the Gentiles. By being capable of remaining for a moment in the nauseating atmosphere \u2014 which I am unable to breathe \u2014 of a drawing-room, you pronounce on your own future the condemnation, the damnation of the Prophet. I can see it all, you frequent the \u2018light hearts,\u2019 the houses of the great, that is the vice of our middle class to-day. Ah! Those aristocrats! The Terror was greatly to blame for not cutting the heads off every one of them. They are all sinister debauchees, when they are not simply dreary idiots. Still, my poor boy, if that sort of thing amuses you! While you are on your way to your tea-party your old friend will be more fortunate than you, for alone in an outlying suburb he will be watching the pink moon rise in a violet sky. The truth is that I scarcely belong to this Earth upon which I feel myself such an exile; it takes all the force of the law of gravity to hold me here, to keep nie from escaping into another sphere. I belong to a different planet. Goodbye; do not take amiss the old-time frankness of the peasant of the Vivonne, who has also remained a peasant of the Danube. To prove to you that I am your sincere well-wisher, I am going to send you my last novel. But you will not care for it; it is not deliquescent enough, not fin de si\u00e8cle enough for you; it is too frank, too honest; what you want is Bergotte, you have confessed it, high game for the jaded palates of pleasure-seeking epicures. I suppose I am looked upon, in your set, as an old campaigner; I do wrong to put my heart into what I write, that is no longer done; besides, the life of the people is not distinguished enough to interest your little snobbicules. Go, get you gone, try to recall at times the words of Christ: \u2018Do this and ye shall live.\u2019 Farewell, Friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not with any particular resentment against Legrandin that I parted from him. Certain memories are like friends in common, they can bring about reconciliations; set down amid fields starred with buttercups, upon which were piled the ruins of feudal greatness, the little wooden bridge still joined us, Legrandin and me, as it joined the two banks of the Vivonne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After coming out of a Paris in which, although spring had begun, the trees on the boulevards had hardly put on their first leaves, it was a marvel to Saint-Loup and myself, when the circle train had set us down at the suburban village in which his mistress was living, to see every cottage garden gay with huge festal altars of fruit trees in blossom. It was like one of those peculiar, poetical, ephemeral, local festivals which people travel long distances to attend on certain fixed occasions, only this one was held by Nature. The bloom of the cherry tree is stuck so close to its branches, like a white sheath, that from a distance, among the other trees that shewed as yet scarcely a flower or leaf, one might have taken it, on this day of sunshine that was still so cold, for snow, melted everywhere else, which still clung to the bushes. But the tall pear trees enveloped each house, each modest courtyard in a whiteness more vast, more uniform, more dazzling, as if all the dwellings, all the enclosed spaces in the village were on their way to make, on one solemn date, their first communion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It had been a country village, and had kept its old mayor\u2019s office sunburned and brown, in front of which, in the place of maypoles and streamers, three tall pear trees were, as though for some civic and local festival, gallantly beflagged with white satin. These villages in the environs of Paris still have at their gates parks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were the \u2018follies\u2019 of the stewards and favourites of the great. A fruit-grower had utilised one of these which was sunk below the road for his trees, or had simply, perhaps, preserved the plan of an immense orchard of former days. Laid out in quincunxes, these pear trees, less crowded and not so far on as those that I had seen, formed great quadrilaterals \u2014 separated by low walls \u2014 of snowy blossom, on each side of which the light fell differently, so that all these airy roofless chambers seemed to belong to a Palace of the Sun, such as one might unearth in Crete or somewhere; and made one think also of the different ponds of a reservoir, or of those parts of the sea which man, for some fishery, or to plant oyster-beds, has subdivided, when one saw, varying with the orientation of the boughs, the light fall and play upon their trained arms as upon water warm with spring, and coax into unfolding here and there, gleaming amid the open, azure-panelled trellis of the branches, the foaming whiteness of a creamy, sunlit flower\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Never had Robert spoken to me so tenderly of his friend as he did during this walk. She alone had taken root in his heart; his future career in the Army, his position in society, his family, he was not, of course, indifferent altogether to these, but they were of no account compared with the veriest trifle that concerned his mistress. That alone had any importance in his eyes, infinitely more importance than the Guermantes and all the kings of the earth put together. I do not know whether he had formulated the doctrine that she was of a superior quality to anyone else, but I do know that he considered, took trouble only about what affected her. Through her and for her he was capable of suffering, of being happy, perhaps of doing murder. There was really nothing that interested, that could excite him except what his mistress wished, was going to do, what was going on, discernible at most in fleeting changes of expression, in the narrow expanse of her face and behind her privileged brow. So nice-minded in all else, he looked forward to the prospect of a brilliant marriage, solely in order to be able to continue to maintain her, to keep her always. If one had asked oneself what was the value that he set on her, I doubt whether one could ever have imagined a figure high enough. If he did not marry her, it was because a practical instinct warned him that as soon as she had nothing more to expect from him she would leave him, or would at least live as she chose, and that he must retain his hold on her by keeping her in suspense from day to day. For he admitted the possibility that she did not love him. No doubt the general affection called love must have forced him \u2014 as it forces all men \u2014 to believe at times that she did. But in his heart of hearts he felt that this love which she felt for him did not exhaust the possibility of her remaining with him only on account of his money, and that on the day when she had nothing more to expect from him she would make haste (the dupe of her friends and their literary theories, and loving him all the time, really \u2014 he thought) to leave him. \u201cIf she is nice to me to-day,\u201d he confided to me, \u201cI am going to give her something that she\u2019ll like. It\u2019s a necklace she saw at Boucheron\u2019s. It\u2019s rather too much for me just at present \u2014 thirty thousand francs. But, poor puss, she gets so little pleasure out of life. She will be jolly pleased with it, I know. She mentioned it to me and told me she knew somebody who would perhaps give it to her. I don t believe that is true, really, but I wasn\u2019t taking any risks, so I\u2019ve arranged with Boucheron, who is our family jeweller, to keep it for me. I am glad to think that you\u2019re going to meet her; she\u2019s nothing so very wonderful to look at, you know,\u201d (I could see that he thought just the opposite and had said this only so as to make me, when I did see her, admire her all the more) \u201cwhat she has got is a marvellous judgment; she\u2019ll perhaps be afraid to talk much before you, but, by Jove! the things she\u2019ll say to me about you afterwards, you know she says things one can go on thinking about for hours; there\u2019s really something about her that\u2019s quite Pythian.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our way to her house we passed by a row of little gardens, and I was obliged to stop, for they were all aflower with pear and cherry blossoms; as empty, no doubt, and lifeless only yesterday as a house that no tenant has taken, they were suddenly peopled and adorned by these newcomers, arrived during the night, whose lovely white garments we could see through the railings along the garden paths\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen; I can see you\u2019d rather stop and look at that stuff, and grow poetical about it,\u201d said Robert, \u201cso just wait for me here, will you; my friend\u2019s house is quite close, I will go and fetch her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I waited I strolled up and down the road, past these modest gardens. If I raised my head I could see, now and then, girls sitting in the windows, but outside, in the open air, and at the height of a half-landing, here and there, light and pliant, in their fresh pink gowns, hanging among the leaves, young lilac-clusters were letting themselves be swung by the breeze without heeding the passer-by who was turning his eyes towards their green mansions. I recognised in them the platoons in violet uniform posted at the entrance to M. Swann\u2019s park, past the little white fence, in the warm afternoons of spring, like an enchanting rustic tapestry. I took a path which led me into a meadow. A cold wind blew keenly along it, as at Combray, but from the midst of the rich, moist, country soil, which might have been on the bank of the Vivonne, there had nevertheless arisen, punctual at the trysting place like all its band of brothers, a great white pear tree which waved smilingly in the sun\u2019s face, like a curtain of light materialised and made palpable, its flowers shaken by the breeze but polished and frosted with silver by the sun\u2019s rays\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly Saint-Loup appeared, accompanied by his mistress, and then, in this woman who was for him all the love, every possible delight in life, whose personality, mysteriously enshrined in a body as in a Tabernacle, was the object that still occupied incessantly the toiling imagination of my friend, whom he felt that he would never really know, as to whom he was perpetually asking himself what could be her secret self, behind the veil of eyes and flesh, in this woman I recognised at once \u2018Rachel when from the Lord,\u2019 her who, but a few years since \u2014 women change their position so rapidly in that world, when they do change \u2014 used to say to the procuress: \u201cTo-morrow evening, then, if you want me for anyone, you will send round, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when they had \u2018come round\u2019 for her, and she found herself alone in the room with the \u2018anyone,\u2019 she had known so well what was required of her that after locking the door, as a prudent woman\u2019s precaution or a ritual gesture, she would begin to take off all her things, as one does before the doctor who is going to sound one\u2019s chest, never stopping in the process unless the \u2018some one,\u2019 not caring for nudity, told her that she might keep on her shift, as specialists do sometimes who, having an extremely fine ear and being afraid of their patient\u2019s catching a chill, are satisfied with listening to his breathing and the beating of his heart through his shirt. On this woman whose whole life, all her thoughts, all her past, all the men who at one time or another had had her were to me so utterly unimportant that if she had begun to tell me about them I should have listened to her only out of politeness, and should barely have heard what she said, I felt that the anxiety, the torment, the love of Saint-Loup had been concentrated in such a way as to make \u2014 out of what was for me a mechanical toy, nothing more \u2014 the cause of endless suffering, the very object and reward of existence. Seeing these two elements separately (because I had known \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019 in a house of ill fame), I realised that many women for the sake of whom men live, suffer, take their lives, may be in themselves or for other people what Rachel was for me. The idea that any one could be tormented by curiosity with regard to her life stupefied me. I could have told Robert of any number of her unchastities, which seemed to me the most uninteresting things in the world. And how they would have pained him! And what had he not given to learn them, without avail!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I realised also then all that the human imagination can put behind a little scrap of face, such as this girl\u2019s face was, if it is the imagination that was the first to know it; and conversely into what wretched elements, crudely material and utterly without value, might be decomposed what had been the inspiration of countless dreams if, on the contrary, it should be so to speak controverted by the slightest actual acquaintance. I saw that what had appeared to me to be not worth twenty francs when it had been offered to me for twenty francs in the house of ill fame, where it was then for me simply a woman desirous of earning twenty francs, might be worth more than a million, more than one\u2019s family, more than all the most coveted positions in life if one had begun by imagining her to embody a strange creature, interesting to know, difficult to seize and to hold. No doubt it was the same thin and narrow face that we saw, Robert and I. But we had arrived at it by two opposite ways, between which there was no communication, and we should never both see it from the same side. That face, with its stares, its smiles, the movements of its lips, I had known from outside as being simply that of a woman of the sort who for twenty francs would do anything that I asked. And so her stares, her smiles, the movements of her lips had seemed to me significant merely of the general actions of a class without any distinctive quality. And beneath them I should not have had the curiosity to look for a person. But what to me had in a sense been offered at the start, that consenting face, had been for Robert an ultimate goal towards which he had made his way through endless hopes and doubts, suspicions, dreams. He gave more than a million francs in order to have for himself, in order that there might not be offered to others what had been offered to me, as to all and sundry, for a score. That he too should not have enjoyed it at the lower price may have been due to the chance of a moment, the instant in which she who seemed ready to yield herself makes off, having perhaps an assignation elsewhere, some reason which makes her more difficult of access that day. Should the man be a sentimentalist, then, even if she has not observed it, but infinitely more if she has, the direst game begins. Unable to swallow his disappointment, to make himself forget about the woman, he starts afresh in pursuit, she flies him, until a mere smile for which he no longer ventured to hope is bought at a thousand times what should have been the price of the last, the most intimate favours. It happens even at times in such a case, when one has been led by a mixture of simplicity in one\u2019s judgment and cowardice in the face of suffering to commit the crowning folly of making an inaccessible idol of a girl, that these last favours, or even the first kiss one is fated never to obtain, one no longer even ventures to ask for them for fear of destroying one\u2019s chances of Platonic love. And it is then a bitter anguish to leave the world without having ever known what were the embraces of the woman one has most passionately loved. As for Rachel\u2019s favours, however, Saint-Loup had by mere accident succeeded in winning them all. Certainly if he had now learned that they had been offered to all the world for a louis, he would have suffered, of course, acutely, but would still have given a million francs for the right to keep them, for nothing that he might have learned could have made him emerge \u2014 since that is beyond human control and can be brought to pass only in spite of it by the action of some great natural law \u2014 from the path he was treading, from which that face could appear to him only through the web of the dreams that he had already spun. The immobility of that thin face, like that of a sheet of paper subjected to the colossal pressure of two atmospheres, seemed to me to be being maintained by two infinities which abutted on her without meeting, for she held them apart. And indeed, when Robert and I were both looking at her we did not both see her from the same side of the mystery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019\u2014 who seemed to me a small matter \u2014 it was the power of the human imagination, the illusion on which were based the pains of love; these I felt to be vast. Robert noticed that I appeared moved. I turned my eyes to the pear and cherry trees of the garden opposite, so that he might think that it was their beauty that had touched me. And it did touch me in somewhat the same way; it also brought close to me things of the kind which we not only see with our eyes but feel also in our hearts. These trees that I had seen in the garden, likening them in my mind to strange deities, had not my mistake been like the Magdalene\u2019s when, in another garden, she saw a human form and \u2018thought it was the gardener.\u2019 Treasurers of our memories of the age of gold, keepers of the promise that reality is not what we suppose, that the splendour of Poetry, the wonderful radiance of innocence may shine in it and may be the recompense which we strive to earn, these great white creatures, bowed in a marvellous fashion above the shade propitious for rest, for angling or for reading, were they not rather angels? I exchanged a few words with Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress. We cut across the village. Its houses were sordid. But by each of the most wretched, of those that looked as though they had been scorched and branded by a rain of brimstone, a mysterious traveller, halting for a day in the accursed city, a resplendent angel stood erect, extending broadly over it the dazzling protection of the wings of flowering innocence: it was a pear tree. Saint-Loup drew me a little way in front to explain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should have liked it if you and I could have been alone together, in fact I would much rather have had luncheon just with you, and stayed with you until it was time to go to my aunt\u2019s. But this poor girl of mine here, it is such a pleasure to her, and she is so decent to me, don\u2019t you know, I hadn\u2019t the heart to refuse her. You\u2019ll like her, however, she\u2019s literary, you know, a most sensitive nature, and besides it\u2019s such a pleasure to be with her in a restaurant, she is so charming, so simple, always delighted with every, thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I fancy nevertheless that, on this same morning, and then probably for the first and last time, Robert did detach himself for a moment from the woman whom out of successive layers of affection he had gradually created, and beheld suddenly at some distance from himself another Rachel, outwardly the double of his but entirely different, who was nothing more or less than a little light of love. We had left the blossoming orchard and were making for the train which was to take us to Paris when, at the station, Rachel, who was walking by herself, was recognised and accosted by a pair of common little \u2018tarts\u2019 like herself, who first of all, thinking that she was alone, called out: \u201cHello, Rachel, you come with us; Lucienne and Germaine are in the train, and there\u2019s room for one more. Come on. We\u2019re all going to the rink,\u201d and were just going to introduce to her two counter-jumpers, their lovers, who were escorting them, when, noticing that she seemed a little uneasy, they looked up and beyond her, caught sight of us, and with apologies bade her a good-bye to which she responded in a somewhat embarrassed, but still friendly tone. They were two poor little \u2018tarts\u2019 with collars of sham otter skin, looking more or less as Rachel must have looked when Saint-Loup first met her. He did not know them, or their names even, and seeing that they appeared to be extremely intimate with his mistress he could not help wondering whether she too might not once have had, had not still perhaps her place in a life of which he had never dreamed, utterly different from the life she led with him, a life in which one had women for a louis apiece, whereas he was giving more than a hundred thousand francs a year to Rachel, He caught only a fleeting glimpse of that life, but saw also in the thick of it a Rachel other than her whom he knew, a Rachel like the two little \u2018tarts\u2019 in the train, a twenty-franc Rachel. In short, Rachel had for the moment duplicated herself in his eyes, he had seen, at some distance from his own Rachel, the little \u2018tart\u2019 Rachel, the real Rachel, assuming that Rachel the \u2018tart\u2019 was more real than the other. It may then have occurred to Robert that from the hell in which he was living, with the prospect of a rich marriage, of the sale of his name, to enable him to go on giving Rachel a hundred thousand francs every year, he might easily perhaps have escaped, and have enjoyed the favours of his mistress, as the two counter-jumpers enjoyed those of their girls, for next to nothing. But how was it to be done? She had done nothing to forfeit his regard. Less generously rewarded she would be less kind to him, would stop saying and writing the things that so deeply moved him> things which he would quote, with a touch of ostentation, to his friends, taking care to point out how nice it was of her to say them, but omitting to mention that he was maintaining her in the most lavish fashion, or even that he ever gave her anything at all, that these inscriptions on photographs, or greetings at the end of telegrams were but the conversion into the most exiguous, the most precious of currencies of a hundred thousand francs. If he took care not to admit that these rare kindnesses on Rachel\u2019s part were handsomely paid for by himself, it would be wrong to say \u2014 and yet, by a crude piece of reasoning, we do say it, absurdly, of every lover who pays in cash for his pleasure, and of a great many husbands \u2014 that this was from self-esteem or vanity. Saint-Loup had enough sense to perceive that all the pleasures which appeal to vanity he could have found easily and without cost to himself in society, on the strength of his historic name and handsome face, and that his connexion with Rachel had rather, if anything, tended to ostracise him, led to his being less sought after. No; this self-esteem which seeks to appear to be receiving gratuitously the outward signs of the affection of her whom one loves is simply a consequence of love, the need to figure in one\u2019s own eyes and in other people\u2019s as loved in return by the person whom one loves so well. Rachel rejoined us, leaving the two \u2018tarts\u2019 to get into their compartment; but, no less than their sham otter skins and the self-conscious appearance of their young men, the names Lucienne and Germaine kept the new Rachel alive for a moment longer. For a moment Robert imagined a Place Pigalle existence with unknown associates, sordid love affairs, afternoons spent in simple amusements, excursions or pleasure-parties, in that Paris in which the sunny brightness of the streets from the Boulevard de Clichy onwards did not seem the same as the solar radiance in which he himself strolled with his mistress, but must be something different, for love, and suffering which is one with love, have, like intoxication, the power to alter for us inanimate things. It was almost an unknown Paris in the heart of Paris itself that he suspected, his connexion appeared to him like the exploration of a strange form of life, for if when with him Rachel was somewhat similar to himself, it was nevertheless a part of her real life that she lived with him, indeed the most precious part, in view of his reckless expenditure on her, the part that made her so greatly envied by her friends and would enable her one day to retire to the country or to establish herself in the leading theatres, when she had made her pile. Robert longed to ask her who Lucienne and Germaine were, what they would have said to her if she had joined them in their compartment, how they would all have spent a day which would have perhaps ended, as a supreme diversion, after the pleasures of the rink, at the Olympia Tavern, if Robert and I had not been there. For a moment the purlieus of the Olympia, which until then had seemed to him merely deadly dull, aroused curiosity in him and pain, and the sunshine of this spring day beating upon the Rue Caumartin where, possibly, if she had not known Robert, Rachel might have gone in the course of the evening and nave earned a louis, filled him with a vague longing. But what use was it to ply Rachel with questions when he already knew that her answer would be merely silence, or a lie, or something extremely painful for him to hear, which would yet explain nothing. The porters were shutting the doors; we jumped into a first-class carriage; Rachel\u2019s magnificent pearls reminded Robert that she was a woman of great price, he caressed her, restored her to her place in his heart where he could contemplate her, internalised, as he had always done hitherto \u2014 save during this brief instant in which he had seen her in the Place Pigalle of an impressionist painter \u2014 and the train began to move\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was, by the way, quite true that she was \u2018literary.\u2019 She never stopped talking to me about books, new art and Tolstoyism except to rebuke Saint-Loup for drinking so much wine:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! If you could live with me for a year, we\u2019d see a fine change. I should keep you on water and you\u2019d be ever so much better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight you are. Let\u2019s begin now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut you know quite well I have to work all day!\u201d For she took her art very seriously. \u201cBesides, what would your people say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she began to abuse his family to me in terms which for that matter seemed to me highly reasonable, and with which Saint-Loup, while disobeying her orders in the matter of champagne, entirely concurred. I, who was so much afraid of the effect of wine on him, and felt the good influence of his mistress, was quite prepared to advise him to let his family go hang. Tears sprang to the young woman\u2019s eyes; I had been rash enough to refer to Dreyfus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe poor martyr!\u201d she almost sobbed; \u201cit will be the death of him in that dreadful place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t upset yourself, Z\u00e9zette, he will come back, he will be acquitted all right, they will admit they\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut long before then he\u2019ll be dead! Oh, well at any rate his children will bear a stainless name. But just think of the agony he must be going through; that\u2019s what makes my heart bleed. And would you believe that Robert\u2019s mother, a pious woman, says that he ought to be left on the Devil\u2019s Isle, even if he is innocent; isn\u2019t it appalling?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, it\u2019s absolutely true, she does say that,\u201d Robert assured me. \u201cShe\u2019s my mother, I\u2019ve no fault to find with her, but it\u2019s quite clear she hasn\u2019t got a sensitive nature, like Z\u00e9zette.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact these luncheons which were said to be \u2018such a pleasure\u2019 always ended in trouble. For as soon as Saint-Loup found himself in a public place with his mistress, he would imagine that she was looking at every other man in the room, and his brow would darken; she would remark his ill-humour, which she may have thought it amusing to encourage, or, as was more probable, by a foolish piece of conceit preferred, feeling wounded by his tone, not to appear to be seeking to disarm; and would make a show of being unable to take her eyes off some man or other, not that this was always a mere pretence. In fact, the gentleman who, in theatre or caf\u00e9, happened to sit next to them, or, to go no farther, the driver of the cab they had engaged need only have something attractive about him, no matter what, and Robert, his perception quickened by jealousy, would have noticed it before his mistress; he would see in him immediately one of those foul creatures whom he had denounced to me at Balbec, who corrupted and dishonoured women for their own amusement, would beg his mistress to take her eyes off the man, thereby drawing her attention to him. And sometimes she found that Robert had shewn such good judgment in his suspicion that after a little she even left off teasing him in order that he might calm down and consent to go off by himself on some errand which would give her time to begin conversation with the stranger, often to make an assignation, sometimes even to bring matters quickly to a head. I could see as soon as we entered the restaurant that Robert was looking troubled. The fact of the matter was that he had at once remarked, what had escaped our notice at Balbec, namely that, standing among his coarser colleagues, Aim\u00e9, with a modest brilliance, emitted, quite unconsciously of course, that air of romance which emanates until a certain period in life from fine hair and a Grecian nose, features thanks to which he was distinguishable among the crowd of waiters. The others, almost all of them well on in years, presented a series of types, extraordinarily ugly and criminal, of hypocritical priests, sanctimonious confessors, more numerously of comic actors of the old school, whose sugar-loaf foreheads are scarcely to be seen nowadays outside the collections of portraits that hang in the humbly historic green-rooms of little, out of date theatres, where they are represented in the parts of servants or high priests, though this restaurant seemed, thanks to a selective method of recruiting and perhaps to some system of hereditary nomination, to have preserved their solemn type in a sort of College of Augurs. As ill luck would have it, Aim\u00e9 having recognised us, it was he who came to take our order, while the procession of operatic high priests swept past us to other tables. Aim\u00e9 inquired after my grandmother\u2019s health; I asked for news of his wife and children. He gave it with emotion, being a family man. He had an intelligent, vigorous, but respectful air. Robert\u2019s mistress began to gaze at him with a strange attentiveness. But Aim\u00e9\u2018s sunken eyes, in which a slight short-sightedness gave one the impression of veiled depths, shewed no sign of consciousness in his still face. In the provincial hotel in which he had served for many years before coming to Balbec, the charming sketch, now a trifle discoloured and faded, which was his face, and which, for all those years, like some engraved portrait of Prince Eug\u00e8ne, had been visible always at the same place, at the far end of a dining-room that was almost always empty, could not have attracted any very curious gaze. He had thus for long remained, doubtless for want of sympathetic admirers, in ignorance of the artistic value of his face, and but little inclined for that matter to draw attention to it, for he was temperamentally cold. At the most, some passing Parisian, stopping for some reason in the town, had raised her eyes to his, had asked him perhaps to bring something to her in her room before she left for the station, and in the pellucid, Monotonous, deep void of this existence of a faithful husband and servant in a country town had hidden the secret of a caprice without sequel which no one would ever bring to light. And yet Aim\u00e9 must have been conscious of the insistent emphasis with which the eyes of the young actress were fastened upon him now. Anyhow, it did not escape Robert beneath whose skin I saw gathering a flush, not vivid like that which burned his cheeks when he felt any sudden emotion, but faint, diffused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnything specially interesting about that waiter, Z\u00e9zette?\u201d he inquired, after sharply dismissing Aim\u00e9. \u201cOne would think you were studying the part.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere you are, beginning again; I knew it was coming.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBeginning what again, my dear girl? I may have been mistaken; I haven\u2019t said anything, I\u2019m sure. But I have at least the right to warn you against the fellow, seeing that I knew him at Balbec (otherwise I shouldn\u2019t give a damn), and a bigger scoundrel doesn\u2019t walk the face of the earth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed anxious to pacify Robert and began to engage me in a literary conversation in which he joined. I found that it did not bore me to talk to her, for she had a thorough knowledge of the books that I most admired, and her opinion of them agreed more or less with my own; but as I had heard Mme. de Villeparisis declare that she had no talent, I attached but little importance to this evidence of culture. She discoursed wittily on all manner of topics, and would have been genuinely entertaining had she not affected to an irritating extent the jargon of the sets and studios. She applied this, moreover, to everything under the sun; for instance, having acquired the habit of saying of a picture, if it were impressionist, or an opera, if Wagnerian, \u201cAh! That is good!\u201d one day when a young man had kissed her on the ear, and, touched by her pretence of being thrilled, had affected modesty, she said: \u201cYes, as a sensation I call it distinctly good.\u201d But what more surprised me was that the expressions peculiar to Robert (which, moreover, had come to him, perhaps, from literary men whom she knew) were used by her to him and by him to her as though they had been a necessary form of speech, and without any conception of the pointlessness of an originality that is universal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In eating, she managed her hands so clumsily that one assumed that she must appear extremely awkward upon the stage. She recovered her dexterity only when making love, with that touching prescience latent in women who love the male body so intensely that they immediately guess what will give most pleasure to that body, which is yet so different from their own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ceased to take part in the conversation when it turned upon the theatre, for on that topic Rachel was too malicious for my liking. She did, it was true, take up in a tone of commiseration \u2014 against Saint-Loup, which proved that he was accustomed to hearing Rachel attack her \u2014 the defence of Berma, saying: \u201cOh, no, she\u2019s a wonderful person, really. Of course, the things she does no longer appeal to us, they don\u2019t correspond quite to what we are looking for, but one must think of her at the period to which she belongs; we owe her a great deal. She has done good work, you know. And besides she\u2019s such a fine woman, she has such a good heart; naturally she doesn\u2019t care about the things that interest us, but she has had in her time, with a rather impressive face, a charming quality of mind.\u201d (Our ringers, by the way, do not play the same accompaniment to all our aesthetic judgments. If it is a picture that is under discussion, to shew that it is a fine work with plenty of paint, it is enough to stick out one\u2019s thumb. But the \u2018charming quality of mind\u2019 is more exacting. It requires two fingers, or rather two fingernails, as though one were trying to flick off a particle of dust.) But, with this single exception, Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress referred to the best-known actresses in a tone of ironical superiority which annoyed me because I believed \u2014 quite mistakenly, as it happened \u2014 that it was she who was inferior to them. She was clearly aware that I must regard her as an indifferent actress, and on the other hand have a great regard for those she despised. But she shewed no resentment, because there is in all great talent while it is still, as hers was then, unrecognised, however sure it may be of itself, a vein of humility, and because we make the consideration that we expect from others proportionate not to our latent powers but to the position to which we have attained. (I was, an hour or so later, at the theatre, to see Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress shew great deference towards those very artists against whom she was now bringing so harsh a judgment to bear.) And so, in however little doubt my silence may have left her, she insisted nevertheless on our dining together that evening, assuring me that never had anyone\u2019s conversation delighted her so much as mine. If we were not yet in the theatre, to which we were to go after luncheon, we had the sense of being in a green-room hung with portraits of old members of the company, so markedly were the waiters\u2019 faces those which, one thought, had perished with a whole generation of obscure actors of the Palais-Royal; they had a look, also, of Academicians; stopping before a side table one of them was examining a dish of pears with the expression of detached curiosity that M. de Jussieu might have worn. Others, on either side of him, were casting about the room that gaze instinct with curiosity and coldness which Members of the Institute, who have arrived early, throw at the public, while they exchange a few murmured words which one fails to catch. They were faces well known to all the regular guests. One of them, however, was being pointed out, a newcomer with distended nostrils and a smug upper lip, who looked like a cleric; he was entering upon his duties there for the first time, and everyone gazed with interest at this newly elected candidate. But presently, perhaps to drive Robert away so that she might be alone with Aim\u00e9, Rachel began to make eyes at a young student, who was feeding with another man at a neighbouring table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cZ\u00e9zette, let me beg you not to look at that young man like that,\u201d said Saint-Loup, on whose face the hesitating flush of a moment ago had been gathered now into a scarlet tide which dilated and darkened his swollen features, \u201cif you must make a scene here, I shall simply finish eating by myself and join you at the theatre afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point a messenger came up to tell Aim\u00e9 that he was wanted to speak to a gentleman in a carriage outside. Saint-Loup, ever uneasy, and afraid now that it might be some message of an amorous nature that was to be conveyed to his mistress, looked out of the window and saw there, sitting up in his brougham, his hands tightly buttoned in white gloves with black seams, a flower in his buttonhole, M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere; you see!\u201d he said to me in a low voice, \u201cmy family hunt me down even here. Will you, please \u2014 I can\u2019t very well do it myself, but you can, as you know the head waiter so well and he\u2019s certain to give us away \u2014 ask him not to go to the carriage. He can ahvays send some other waiter who doesn\u2019t know me. I know my uncle; if they tell him that I\u2019m not known here, he\u2019ll never come inside to look for me, he loathes this sort of place. Really, it\u2019s pretty disgusting that an old petticoat-chaser like him, who is still at it, too, should be perpetually lecturing me and coming to spy on me!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aim\u00e9 on receiving my instructions sent one of his underlings to explain that he was busy and could not come out at the moment, and (should the gentleman ask for the Marquis de Saint-Loup) that they did not know any such person. But Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, who had failed to catch our whispered conversation and thought that it was still about the young man at whom Robert had been finding fault with her for making eyes, broke out in a torrent of rage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, indeed! So it\u2019s the young man over there, now, is it? Thank you for telling me; it\u2019s a real pleasure to have this sort of thing with one\u2019s meals! Don\u2019t listen to him, please; he\u2019s rather cross to-day, and, you know,\u201d she went on, turning to me, \u201che just says it because he thinks it smart, that it\u2019s the gentlemanly thing to appear jealous always.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous irritation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Z\u00e9zette, it is I who find it unpleasant. You are making us all ridiculous before that gentleman, who will begin to imagine you\u2019re making overtures to him, and an impossible bounder he looks, too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, no, I think he\u2019s charming; for one thing, he\u2019s got the most adorable eyes, and a way of looking at women \u2014 you can feel he must love them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can at least keep quiet until I\u2019ve left the room, if you have lost your senses,\u201d cried Robert. \u201cWaiter, my things.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not know whether I was expected to follow him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, I want to be alone,\u201d he told me in the same tone in which he had just been addressing his mistress, and as if he were quite furious with me. His anger was like a single musical phrase to which in an opera several lines are sung which are entirely different from one another, if one studies the words, in meaning and character, but which the music assimilates by a common sentiment. When Robert had gone, his mistress called Aim\u00e9 and asked him various questions. She then wanted to know what I thought of him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAn amusing expression, hasn\u2019t he? Do you know what I should like; it would be to know what he really thinks about things, to have him wait on me often, to take him travelling. But that would be all. If we were expected to love all the people who attract us, life would be pretty ghastly, wouldn\u2019t it? It\u2019s silly of Robert to get ideas like that. All that sort of thing, it\u2019s only just what comes into my head, that\u2019s all; Robert has nothing to worry about.\u201d She was still gazing at Aim\u00e9. \u201cDo look, what dark eyes he has. I should love to know what there is behind them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently came a message that Robert was waiting for her in a private room, to which he had gone to finish his luncheon, by another door, without having to pass through the restaurant again. I thus found myself alone, until I too was summoned by Robert. I found his mistress stretched out on a sofa laughing under the kisses and caresses that he was showering on her. They were drinking champagne. \u201cHallo, you!\u201d she cried to him, having recently picked up this formula which seemed to her the last word in playfulness and wit. I had fed badly, I was extremely uncomfortable, and albeit Legrandin\u2019s words had had no effect on me I was sorry to think that I was beginning in a back room of a restaurant and should be finishing in the wings of a theatre this first afternoon of spring. Looking first at the time to see that she was not making herself late, she offered me a glass of champagne, handed me one of her Turkish cigarettes and unpinned a rose for me from her bodice. Whereupon I said to myself: \u201cI have nothing much to regret, after all; these hours spent in this young woman\u2019s company are not wasted, since I have had from her, charming gifts which could not be bought too dear, a rose, a scented cigarette and a glass of champagne.\u201d I told myself this because I felt that it endowed with an aesthetic character and thereby justified, saved these hours of boredom. I ought perhaps to have reflected that the very need which I felt of a reason that would console me for my boredom was sufficient to prove that I was experiencing no aesthetic sensation. As for Robert and his mistress, they appeared to have no recollection of the quarrel which had been raging between them a few minutes earlier, or of my having been a witness to it. They made no allusion to it, sought no excuse for it any more than for the contrast with it which their present conduct formed. By dint of drinking champagne with them, I began to feel a little of the intoxication that used to come over me at Rivebelle, though probably not quite the same. Not only every kind of intoxication, from that which the sun or travelling gives us to that which we get from exhaustion or wine, but every degree of intoxication \u2014 and each must have a different figure, like the numbers of fathoms on a chart \u2014 lays bare in us exactly at the depth to which it reaches a different kind of man. The room which Saint-Loup had taken was small, but the mirror which was its sole ornament was of such a kind that it seemed to reflect thirty others in an endless vista; and the electric bulb placed at the top of the frame must at night, when the light was on, followed by the procession of thirty flashes similar to its own, give to the drinker, even when alone, the idea that the surrounding space was multiplying itself simultaneously with his sensations heightened by intoxication, and that, shut up by himself in this little cell, he was reigning nevertheless over something far more extensive in its indefinite luminous curve than a passage in the Jardin de Paris. Being then myself at this moment the said drinker, suddenly, looking for him in the glass, I caught sight of him, hideous, a stranger, who was staring at me. The joy of intoxication was stronger than my disgust; from gaiety or bravado I smiled at him, and simultaneously ne smiled back at me. And I felt myself so much under the ephemeral and Potent sway of the minute in which our sensations are so strong, that I am not sure whether my sole regret was not at the thought that this hideous self of whom I had just caught sight in the glass was perhaps there for the last time on earth, and that I should never meet the stranger again in the whole course of my life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert was annoyed only because I was not being more brilliant before his mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat about that fellow you met this morning, who combines snobbery with astronomy; tell her about him, I\u2019ve forgotten the story,\u201d and he watched her furtively\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy, there\u2019s nothing more than what you\u2019ve just said.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a bore you are. Then tell her about Fran\u00e7oise in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. She\u2019ll enjoy that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, do! Bobby is always talking about Fran\u00e7oise.\u201d And taking Saint-Loup by the chin, she repeated, for want of anything more original, drawing the said chin nearer to the light: \u201cHallo, you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since actors had ceased to be for me exclusively the depositaries, in their diction and playing, of an artistic truth, they had begun to interest me in themselves; I amused myself, pretending that what I saw before me were the characters in some old humorous novel, by watching, struck by the fresh face of the young man who had just come into the stalls, the heroine listen distractedly to the declaration of love which the juvenile lead in the piece was addressing to her, while he, through the fiery torrent of his impassioned speech, still kept a burning gaze fixed on an old lady seated in a stage box, whose magnificent pearls had caught his eye; and thus, thanks especially to the information that Saint-Loup gave me as to the private lives of the players, I saw another drama, mute but expressive, enacted beneath the words of the spoken drama which in itself, although of no merit, interested me also; for I could feel in it that there were budding and opening for an hour in the glare of the footlights, created out of the agglutination on the face of an actor of another face of grease paint and pasteboard, on his own human soul the words of a part\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These ephemeral vivid personalities which the characters are in a play that is entertaining also, whom one loves, admires, pities, whom one would like to see again after one has left the theatre, but who by that time are already disintegrated into a comedian who is no longer in the position which he occupied in the play, a text which no longer shews one the comedian\u2019s face, a coloured powder which a handkerchief wipes off, who have returned in short to elements that contain nothing of them, since their dissolution, effected so soon after the end of the show, make us \u2014 like the dissolution of a dear friend \u2014 begin to doubt the reality of our ego and meditate on the mystery of death\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One number in the programme I found extremely trying. A young woman whom Rachel and some of her friends disliked was, with a set of old songs, to make a first appearance on which she had based all her hopes for the future of herself and her family. This young woman was blessed with unduly, almost grotesquely prominent hips and a pretty but too slight voice, weakened still farther by her excitement and in marked contrast to her muscular development. Rachel had posted among the audience a certain number of friends, male and female, whose business it was by their sarcastic comments to put the novice, who was known to be timid, out of countenance, to make her lose her head so that her turn should prove a complete failure, after which the manager would refuse to give her a contract. At the first notes uttered by the wretched woman, several of the male audience, recruited for that purpose, began pointing to her backward profile with jocular comments, several of the women, also in the plot, laughed out loud, each flute-like note from the stage increased the deliberate hilarity, which grew to a public scandal. The unhappy woman, sweating with anguish through her grease-paint, tried for a little longer to hold out then stopped and looked round the audience with an appealing gaze of misery and anger which succeeded only in increasing the uproar. The instinct to imitate others, the desire to shew their own wit and daring added to the party several pretty actresses who had not been forewarned but now threw at the others glances charged with malicious connivance, and sat convulsed with laughter which rang out in such violent peals that at the end of the second song, although there were still five more on the programme, the stage manager rang down the curtain. I tried to make myself pay no more heed to the incident than I had paid to my grandmother\u2019s sufferings when my great-aunt, to tease her, used to give my grandfather brandy, the idea of deliberate wickedness being too painful for me to bear. And yet, just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not very exact since in our imagination we recreate a whole world of grief by which the unfortunate who has to struggle against it has no time to think of being moved to self-pity, so wickedness has probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine. Hatred inspires him, anger gives him an ardour, an activity in which there is no great joy; he must be a sadist to extract any pleasure from it; ordinarily, the wicked man supposes himself to be punishing the wickedness of his victim; Rachel imagined certainly that the actress whom she was making suffer was far from being of interest to any one, and that anyhow, in having her hissed off the stage, she was herself avenging an outrage on good taste and teaching an unworthy comrade a lesson. Nevertheless, I preferred not to speak of this incident since I had had neither the courage nor the power to prevent it, and it would have been too painful for me, by saying any good of their victim, to approximate to a gratification of the lust for cruelty the sentiments which animated the tormentors who had strangled this career in its infancy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the opening scene of this afternoon\u2019s performance interested me in quite another way. It made me realise in part the nature of the illusion of which Saint-Loup was a victim with regard to Rachel, and which had set a gulf between the images that he and I respectively had in mind of his mistress, when we beheld her that morning among the blossoming pear trees. Rachel was playing a part which involved barely more than her walking on in the little play. But seen thus, she was another woman. She had one of those faces to which distance \u2014 and not necessarily that between stalls and stage, the world being in this respect only a larger theatre \u2014 gives form and outline and which, seen close at hand, dissolve back into dust. Standing beside her one saw only a nebula, a milky way of freckles, of tiny spots, nothing more. At a proper distance, all this ceased to be visible and, from cheeks that withdrew, were reabsorbed into her face, rose like a crescent moon a nose so fine, so pure that one would have liked to be object of Rachel\u2019s attention, to see her again as often as one chose, to her close to one, provided that one had not already seen her differently and at close range. This was not my case but it had been Saint-Loup\u2019s when he first saw her on the stage. Then he had asked himself how he might approach her, how come to know her, there had opened in him a whole fairy realm \u2014 that in which she lived \u2014 from which emanated an exquisite radiance but into which he might not penetrate. He had left the theatre telling himself that it would be madness to write to her, that she would not answer his letter, quite prepared to give his fortune and his name for the creature who was living in him in a world so vastly superior to those too familiar realities, a world made beautiful by desire and dreams of happiness, when at the back of the theatre, a little old building which had itself the air of being a piece of scenery, from the stage door he saw debouch the gay and daintily hatted band of actresses who had just been playing. Young men who knew them were waiting for them outside. The number of pawns on the human chessboard being less than the number of combinations that they are capable of forming, in a theatre from which are absent all the people we know and might have expected to find, there turns up one whom we never imagined that we should see again and who appears so opportunely that the coincidence seems to us providential, although no doubt some other coincidence would have occurred in its stead had we been not in that place but in some other, where other desires would have been aroused and we should have met some other old acquaintance to help us to satisfy them. The golden portals of the world of dreams had closed again upon Rachel before Saint-Loup saw her emerge from the theatre, so that the freckles and spots were of little importance. They vexed him nevertheless, especially as, being no longer alone, he had not now the same opportunity to dream as in the theatre. But she, for all that he could no longer see her, continued to dictate his actions, like those stars which govern us by their attraction even during the hours in which they are not visible to our eyes. And so his desire for the actress with the fine features which had no place now even in Robert\u2019s memory had the result that, dashing towards the old friend whom chance had brought to the spot, he insisted upon an introduction to the person with no features and with freckles, since she was the same person, telling himself that later on he would take care to find out which of the two this same person really was. She was in a hurry, she did not on this occasion say a single word to Saint-Loup, and it was only some days later that he finally contrived, by inducing her to leave her companions, to escort her home. He loved her already. The need for dreams, the desire to be made happy by her of whom one has dreamed, bring it about that not much time is required before one entrusts all one\u2019s chances of happiness to her who a few days since was but a fortuitous apparition, unknown, unmeaning, upon the boards of the theatre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, the curtain having fallen, we moved on to the stage, alarmed at finding myself there for the first time, I felt the need to begin a spirited conversation with Saint-Loup. In this way my attitude, as I did not know what one ought to adopt in a setting that was strange to me, would be entirely dominated by our talk, and people would think that I was so absorbed in it, so unobservant of my surroundings, that it was quite natural that I should not shew the facial expressions proper to a place in which, to judge by what I appeared to be saying, I was barely conscious of standing; and seizing, to make a beginning, upon the first topic that came to my mind:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cI did come to say good-bye to you the day I left Donci\u00e8res; I\u2019ve not had an opportunity to mention it. I waved to you in the street.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t speak about it,\u201d he replied, \u201cI was so sorry. I passed you just outside the barracks, but I couldn\u2019t stop because I was late already. I assure you, I felt quite wretched about it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he had recognised me! I saw again in my mind the wholly impersonal salute which he had given me, raising his hand to his cap, without a glance to indicate that he knew me, without a gesture to shew that he was sorry he could not stop. Evidently this fiction, which he had adopted at that moment, of not knowing me must have simplified matters for him greatly. But I was amazed to find that he had been able to compose himself to it so swiftly and without any instinctive movement to betray his original impression. I had already observed at Balbec that, side by side with that childlike sincerity of his face, the skin of which by its transparence rendered visible the sudden tide of certain emotions, his body had been admirably trained to perform a certain number of well-bred dissimulations, and that, like a consummate actor, he could, in his regimental and in his social life, play alternately quite different parts. In one of his parts he loved me tenderly, he acted towards me almost as if he had been my brother; my brother he had been, he was now again, but for a moment that day he had been another person who did not know me and who, holding the reins, his glass screwed to his eye, without a look or a smile had lifted his disengaged hand to the peak of his cap to give me correctly the military salute\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The stage scenery, still in its place, among which I was passing, seen thus at close range and without the advantage of any of those effects of lighting and distance on which the eminent artist whose brush had painted it had calculated, was a depressing sight, and Rachel, when I came near her, was subjected to a no less destructive force. The curves of her charming nose had stood out in perspective, between stalls and stage, like the relief of the scenery. It was no longer herself, I recognised her only thanks to her eyes, in which her identity had taken refuge. The form, the radiance of this young star, so brilliant a moment ago, had vanished. On the other hand \u2014 as though we came close to the moon and it ceased to present the appearance of a disk of rosy gold \u2014 on this face, so smooth a surface until now, I could distinguish only protuberances, discolourations, cavities. Despite the incoherence into which were resolved at close range not only the feminine features but the painted canvas, I was glad to be there to wander among the scenery, all that setting which at one time my love of nature had prompted me to dismiss as tedious and artificial until the description of it by Goethe in Wilhelm Meister had given it a sort of beauty in my eyes; and I had already observed with delight, in the thick of a crowd of journalists or men of friends of the actresses, who were greeting one another, talking, smoking, as though in a public thoroughfare, a young man in a black velvet cap and hortensia-coloured skirt, his cheeks chalked in red like a page from a Watteau album, who with his smiling lips, his eyes raised to the ceiling, as he sprang lightly into the air, seemed so entirely of another species than the rational folk in everyday clothes, in the midst of whom he was pursuing like a madman the course of his ecstatic dream, so alien to the preoccupations of their life, so anterior to the habits of their civilisation, so enfranchised from all the laws of nature, that it was as restful and as fresh a spectacle as watching a butterfly straying along a crowded street to follow with one\u2019s eyes, between the strips of canvas, the natural arabesques traced by his winged capricious painted oscillations. But at that moment Saint-Loup conceived the idea that his mistress was paying undue attention to this dancer, who was engaged now in practising for the last time the figure of fun with which he was going to take the stage, and his face darkened\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou might look the other way,\u201d he warned her gloomily. \u201cYou know that none of those dancer-fellows is worth the rope they can at least fall off and break their necks, and they\u2019re the sort of people who go about afterwards boasting that you\u2019ve taken notice of them. Besides, you know very well you\u2019ve been told to go to your dressing-room and change. You\u2019ll be missing your call again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A group of men \u2014 journalists \u2014 noticing the look of fury on Saint-Loup\u2019s face, came nearer, amused, to listen to what we were saying. And as the stage-hands had just set up some scenery on our other side we were forced into close contact with them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but I know him; he\u2019s a friend of mine,\u201d cried Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, her eyes still fixed on the dancer. \u201cLook how well made he is, do watch those little hands of his dancing away by themselves like his whole body!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dancer turned his head towards her, and his human person appeared beneath the sylph that he was endeavouring to be, the clear grey jelly of his eyes trembled and sparkled between eyelids stiff with paint, and a smile extended the corners of his mouth into cheeks plastered with rouge; then, to amuse the girl, like a singer who hums to oblige us the air of the song in which we have told her that we admired her singing, he began to repeat the movement of his hands, counterfeiting himself with the fineness of a parodist and the good humour of a child\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, that\u2019s too lovely, the way he copies himself,\u201d she cried, clapping her hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI implore you, my dearest girl,\u201d Saint-Loup broke in, in a tone of utter misery, \u201cdo not make a scene here, I can\u2019t stand it; I swear, if you say another word I won\u2019t go with you to your room, I shall walk straight out; come, don\u2019t be so naughty. . . . You oughtn\u2019t to stand about in the cigar smoke like that, it\u2019ll make you ill,\u201d he went on, to me, with the solicitude he had shewn for me in our Balbec days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! What a good thing it would be if you did go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI warn you, if I do I shan\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s more than I should venture to hope.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen; you know, I promised you the necklace if you behaved nicely to me, but the moment you treat me like this. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Well, that doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. You gave me your promise; I ought to have known you\u2019d never keep it. You want the whole world to know you\u2019re made of money, but I\u2019m not a money-grubber like you. You can keep your blasted necklace; I know some one else who\u2019ll give it to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo one else can possibly give it to you; I\u2019ve told Boucheron he\u2019s to keep it for me, and I have his promise not to let anyone else have it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere you are, trying to blackmail me, you\u2019ve arranged everything, I see. That\u2019s what they mean by Marsantes, Mater Semita, it smells of the race,\u201d retorted Rachel quoting an etymology which was founded on a wild misinterpretation, for Semita means \u2018path\u2019 and not \u2018Semite,\u2019 but one which the Nationalists applied to Saint-Loup on account of the Dreyfusard views for which, so far as that went, he was indebted to the actress. She was less entitled than anyone to apply the word \u2018Jew\u2019 to Mme. de Marsantes, in whom the ethnologists of society could succeed in finding no trace of Judaism apart from her connexion with the L\u00e9vy-Mirepoix family. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t the last of it, I can tell you. An agreement like that isn\u2019t binding. You have acted treacherously towards me. Boucheron shall be told of it and he\u2019ll be paid twice as much for his necklace. You\u2019ll hear from me before long; don\u2019t you worry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert was in the right a hundred times over. But circumstances are always so entangled that the man who is in the right a hundred times may have been once in the wrong. And I could not help recalling that unpleasant and yet quite innocent expression which he had used at Balbec: \u201cIn that way I keep a hold over her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I mean about the necklace. I made no formal promise: once you start doing everything you possibly can to make me leave you, it\u2019s only natural, surely, that I shouldn\u2019t give it to you; I fail to understand what treachery you can see in that, or what my ulterior motive is supposed to be. You can\u2019t seriously maintain that I brag about my money, I\u2019m always telling you that I\u2019m only a poor devil without a cent to my name. It\u2019s foolish of you take it in that way, my dear. What possible interest can I have in hurting you? You know very well that my one interest in life is yourself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, yes, please go on,\u201d she retorted ironically, with the sweeping gesture of a barber wielding his razor. And turning to watch the dancer:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIsn\u2019t he too wonderful with his hands. A woman like me couldn\u2019t do the things he\u2019s doing now.\u201d She went closer to him and, pointing to Robert\u2019s furious face: \u201cLook, he\u2019s hurt,\u201d she murmured, in the momentary elation of a sadic impulse to cruelty totally out of keeping with the genuine feelings of affection for Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, for the last time, I swear to you it doesn\u2019t matter what you do \u2014 in a week you\u2019ll be giving anything to get me back \u2014 I shan\u2019t come; it\u2019s a clean cut, do you hear, it\u2019s irrevocable; you will be sorry one day, when it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps he was sincere in saying this, and the torture of leaving his mistress may have seemed to him less cruel than that of remaining with her in certain circumstances\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy,\u201d he went on, to me, \u201cyou oughtn\u2019t to stand about here, I tell you, it will make you cough.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I pointed to the scenery which barred my way. He touched his hat and said to one of the journalists:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould you mind, sir, throwing away your cigar; the smoke is bad for my friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His mistress had not waited for him to accompany her; on her way to her dressing-room she turned round and:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo they do those tricks with women too, those nice little hands?\u201d she flung to the dancer from the back of the stage, in an artificially melodious tone of girlish innocence. \u201cYou look just like one yourself, I\u2019m sure I could have a wonderful time with you and a girl I know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s no rule against smoking that I know of; if people aren\u2019t well, they have only to stay at home,\u201d said the journalist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! Do stop! You\u2019ll make me quite mad,\u201d she cried to him. \u201cThen there will be trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn any case, sir, you are not very civil,\u201d observed Saint-Loup to the journalist, still with a courteous suavity, in the deliberate manner of a man judging retrospectively the rights and wrongs of an incident that is already closed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment I saw Saint-Loup raise his arm vertically above his head as if he had been making a signal to some one whom I could not see, or like the conductor of an orchestra, and indeed \u2014 without any greater transition than when, at a simple wave of the baton, in a symphony or a ballet, violent rhythms succeed a graceful andante \u2014 after the courteous words that he had just uttered he brought down his hand with a resounding smack upon the journalist\u2019s cheek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now that to the measured conversations of the diplomats, to the smiling arts of peace had succeeded the furious onthrust of war, since blows lead to blows, I should not have been surprised to see the combatants swimming in one another\u2019s blood. But what I could not understand (like people who feel that it is not according to the rules when a war breaks out between two countries after some question merely of the rectification of a frontier, or when a sick man dies after nothing more serious than a swelling of the liver) was how Saint-Loup had contrived to follow up those words, which implied a distinct shade of friendliness, with an action which in no way arose out of them, which they had not, so to speak, announced, that action of an arm raised in defiance not only of the rights of man but of the law of cause and effect, that action created ex nihilo. Fortunately the journalist who, staggering back from the violence of the blow, had turned pale and hesitated for a moment, did not retaliate. As for his friends, one of them had promptly turned away his head and was looking fixedly into the wings for some one who evidently was not there; the second pretended that a speck of dust had got into his eye, and began rubbing and squeezing his eyelid with every sign of being in pain; while the third had rushed off, exclaiming: \u201cGood heavens, I believe the curtain\u2019s going up; we shan\u2019t get into our seats.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to speak to Saint-Loup, but he was so full of his indignation with the dancer that it adhered exactly to the surface of his eyeballs; like a subcutaneous structure it distended his cheeks with the result that, his internal agitation expressing itself externally in an entire immobility, he had not even the power of relaxation, the \u2018play\u2019 necessary to take in a word from me and to answer it. The journalist\u2019s friends, seeing that the incident was at an end, gathered round him again, still trembling. But, ashamed of having deserted him, they were absolutely determined that be should be made to suppose that they had noticed nothing. And so they dilated, one upon the speck of dust in his eye, one upon his false alarm when he had thought that the curtain was going up, the third upon the astonishing resemblance between a man who had just gone by and the speaker\u2019s brother. Indeed they seemed quite to resent their friend\u2019s not having shared their several emotions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, didn\u2019t it strike you? You must be going blind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I say is that you\u2019re a pack of curs,\u201d growled the journalist whom Saint-Loup had punished\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting the poses they had adopted, to be consistent with which they ought \u2014 but they did not think of it \u2014 to have pretended not to understand what he meant, they fell back on certain expressions traditional in the circumstances: \u201cWhat\u2019s all the excitement? Keep your hair on, old chap. Don\u2019t take the bit in your teeth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had realised that morning beneath the pear blossom how illusory were the grounds upon which Robert\u2019s love for \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019 was based; I was bound now to admit how very real were the sufferings to which that love gave rise. Gradually the feeling that had obsessed him for the last hour, without a break, began to diminish, receded into him, an unoccupied pliable zone appeared in his eyes. I had stopped for a moment at a corner of the Avenue Gabriel from which I had often in the past seen Gilberte appear. I tried for a few seconds to recall those distant impressions, and was hurrying at a \u2018gymnastic\u2019 pace to overtake Saint-Loup when I saw that a gentleman, somewhat shabbily attired, appeared to be talking to him confidentially. I concluded that this was a personal friend of Robert; at the same time they seemed to be drawing even closer to one another; suddenly, as a meteor flashes through the sky, I saw a number of ovoid bodies assume with a giddy swiftness all the positions necessary for them to form, before Saint-Loup\u2019s face and body, a flickering constellation. Flung out like stones from a catapult, they seemed to me to be at the very least seven in number. They were merely, however, Saint-Loup\u2019s pair of fists, multiplied by the speed with which they were changing their places in this \u2014 to all appearance ideal and decorative \u2014 arrangement. But this elaborate display was nothing more than a pummelling which Saint-Loup was administering, the true character of which, aggressive rather than aesthetic, was first revealed to me by the aspect of the shabbily dressed gentleman who appeared to be losing at once his self-possession, his lower jaw and a quantity of blood. He gave fictitious explanations to the people who came up to question him, turned his head and, seeing that Saint-Loup had made off and was hastening to rejoin me, stood gazing after him with an offended, crushed, but by no means furious expression on his face. Saint-Loup, on the other hand, was furious, although he himself had received no blow, and his eyes were still blazing with anger when he reached me. The incident was in no way connected (as I had supposed) with the assault in the theatre. It was an impassioned loiterer who, seeing the fine looking young soldier that Saint-Loup was, had made overtures to him. My friend could not get over the audacity of this \u2018clique\u2019 who no longer even waited for the shades of night to cover their operations, and spoke of the suggestion that had been made to him with the same indignation as the newspapers use in reporting an armed assault and robbery, in broad daylight, in the centre of Paris. And yet the recipient of his blow was excusable in one respect, for the trend of the downward slope brings desire so rapidly to the point of enjoyment that beauty by itself appears to imply consent. Now, that Saint-Loup was beautiful was beyond dispute. Castigation such as he had just administered has this value, for men of the type that had accosted him, that it makes them think seriously of their conduct, though never for long enough to enable them to amend their ways and thus escape correction at the hands of the law. And so, although Saint-Loup\u2019s arm had shot out instinctively, without any preliminary thought, all such punishments, even when they reinforce the law, are powerless to bring about any uniformity in morals\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These incidents, particularly the one that was weighing most on his mind, seemed to have prompted in Robert a desire to be left alone for a while. After a moment\u2019s silence he asked me to leave him, and to go by myself to call on Mme. de Villeparisis. He would join me there, but preferred that we should not enter the room together, so that he might appear to have only just arrived in Paris, instead of having spent half the day already with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I had supposed before making the acquaintance of Mme. de Villeparisis at Balbec, there was a vast difference between the world in which she lived and that of Mme. de Guermantes. Mme. de Villeparisis was one of those women who, born of a famous house, entering by marriage into another no less famous, do not for all that enjoy any great position in the social world, and, apart from a few duchesses who are their nieces or sisters-in-law, perhaps even a crowned head or two, old family friends, see their drawing-rooms filled only by third-rate people, drawn from the middle classes or from a nobility either provincial or tainted in some way, whose presence there has long since driven away all such smart and snobbish folk as are not obliged to come to the house by ties of blood or the claims of a friendship too old to be ignored. Certainly I had no difficulty after the first few minutes in understanding how Mme. de Villeparisis, at Balbec, had come to be so well informed, better than ourselves even, as to the smallest details of the tour through Spain which my father was then making with M. de Norpois. Even this, however, did not make it possible to rest content with the theory that the intimacy \u2014 of more than twenty years\u2019 standing \u2014 between Mme. de Villeparisis and the Ambassador could have been responsible for the lady\u2019s loss of caste in a world where the smartest women boasted the attachment of lovers far less respectable than he not to mention that it was probably years since he had been anything more to the Marquise than just an old friend. Had Mme. de Villeparisis then had other adventures in days gone by? Being then of a more passionate temperament than now, in a calm and religious old age which nevertheless owed some of its mellow colouring to those ardent, vanished years, had she somehow failed, in the country neighbourhood where she had lived for so long, to avoid certain scandals unknown to the younger generation who simply took note of their effect in the unequal and defective composition of a visiting list bound, otherwise, to have been among the purest of any taint of mediocrity? That \u2018sharp tongue\u2019 which her nephew ascribed to her, had it in those far-off days made her enemies? Had it driven her into taking advantage of certain successes with men so as to avenge herself upon women? All this was possible; nor could the exquisitely sensitive way in which \u2014 giving so delicate a shade not merely to her words but to her intonation \u2014 Mme. de Villeparisis spoke of modesty or generosity be held to invalidate this supposition; for the people who not only speak with approval of certain virtues but actually feel their charm and shew a marvellous comprehension of them (people in fact who will, when they come to write their memoirs, present a worthy picture of those virtues) are often sprung from but not actually part of the silent, simple, artless generation which practised them. That generation is reflected in them but is not continued. Instead of the character which it possessed we find a sensibility, an intelligence which are not conducive to action. And whether or not there had been in the life of Mme. de Villeparisis any of those scandals, which (if there had) the lustre of her name would have blotted out, it was this intellect, resembling rather that of a writer of the second order than that of a woman of position, that was undoubtedly the cause of her social degradation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that they were not specially elevating, the qualities, such as balance and restraint, which Mme. de Villeparisis chiefly extolled; but to speak of restraint in a manner that shall be entirely adequate, the word \u2018restraint\u2019 is not enough, we require some of the qualities of authorship which presuppose a quite unrestrained exaltation; I had remarked at Balbec that the genius of certain great artists was completely unintelligible to Mme. de Villeparisis; and that all she could do was to make delicate fun of them and to express her incomprehension in a graceful and witty form. But this wit and grace, at the point to which she carried them, became themselves \u2014 on another plane, and even although they were employed to belittle the noblest masterpieces \u2014 true artistic qualities. Now the effect of such qualities on any social position is a morbid activity of the kind which doctors call elective, and so disintegrating that the most firmly established pillars of society are hard put to it to hold out for any length of time. What artists call intellect seems pure presumption to the fashionable world which, unable to place itself at the sole point of view from which they, the artists, look at and judge things, incapable of understanding the particular attraction to which they yield when they choose an ex-Pression or start a friendship, feel in their company an exhaustion, an irritation, from which antipathy very shortly springs. And yet in her conversation, and the same may be said of the Memoirs which she afterwards published, Mme. de Villeparisis shewed nothing but a sort of grace that was eminently social. Having passed by great works without mastering sometimes without even noticing them, she had preserved from the period in which she had lived and which, moreover, she described with great aptness and charm, little more than the most frivolous of the gifts that they had had to offer her. But a narrative of this sort, even when it treats exclusively of subjects that are not intellectual, is still a work of the intellect, and to give in a book or in conversation, which is almost the same thing, a deliberate impression of frivolity, a serious touch is required which a purely frivolous person would be incapable of supplying. In a certain book of reminiscences written by a woman and regarded as a masterpiece, the phrase that people quote as a model of airy grace has always made me suspect that, in order to arrive at such a pitch of lightness, the author must originally have had a rather stodgy education, a boring culture, and that as a girl she probably appeared to her friends an insufferable prig. And between certain literary qualities and social failure the connexion is so inevitable that when we open Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s Memoirs to-day, on any page a fitting epithet, a sequence of metaphors will suffice to enable the reader to reconstruct the deep but icy bow which must have been bestowed on the old Marquise on the staircases of the Embassies by a snob like Mme. Leroi, who perhaps may have left a card on her when she went to call on the Guermantes, but never set foot in her house for fear of losing caste among all the doctors\u2019 or solicitors\u2019 wives whom she would find there. A bluestocking Mme. de Villeparisis had perhaps been in her earliest youth, and, intoxicated with the ferment of her own knowledge, had perhaps failed to realise the. importance of not applying to people in society, less intelligent and less educated than herself, those cutting strokes which the injured party never forgets\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, talent is not a separate appendage which one artificially attaches to those qualities which make for social success, in order to create from the whole what people in society call a \u2018complete woman.\u2019 It is the living product of a certain moral complexion, from which as a rule many moral qualities are lacking and in which there predominates a sensibility of which other manifestations such as we do not notice in a book may make themselves quite distinctly felt in the course of a life, certain curiosities for instance, certain whims, the desire to go to this place or that for one\u2019s own amusement and not with a view to the extension, the maintenance or even the mere exercise of one\u2019s social relations. I had seen at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis hemmed in by a bodyguard of her own servants without even a glance, as she passed, at the people sitting in the hall of the hotel. But I had had a presentiment that this abstention was due not to indifference, and it seemed that she had not always confined herself to it. She would get a sudden craze to know some one or other because she had seen him and thought him good-looking, or merely because she had been told that he was amusing, or because he had struck her as different from the people she knew, who at this period, when she had not yet begun to appreciate them because she imagined that they would never fail her, belonged, all of them, to the purest cream of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. To the bohemian, the humble middle-class gentleman whom she had marked out with her favour she was obliged to address invitations the importance of which he was unable to appreciate, with an insistence which began gradually to depreciate her in the eyes of the snobs who were in the habit of estimating the smartness of a house by the people whom its mistress excluded rather than by those whom she entertained. Certainly, if at a given moment in her youth Mme. de Villeparisis, surfeited with the satisfaction of belonging to the fine flower of the aristocracy, had found a sort of amusement in scandalising the people among whom she lived, and in deliberately impairing her own position in society, she had begun to attach its full importance to that position once it was definitely lost. She had wished to shew the Duchesses that she was better than they, by saying and doing all the things that they dared not say or do. But now that they all, save such as were closely related to her, had ceased to call, she felt herself diminished, and sought once more to reign, but with another sceptre than that of wit. She would have liked to attract to her house all those women whom she had taken such pains to drive away. How many women\u2019s lives, lives of which little enough is known (for we all live in different worlds according to our ages, and the discretion of their elders prevents the young from forming any clear idea of the past and so completing the cycle), have been divided in this way into contrasted periods, the last being entirely devoted to the reconquest of what in the second has been so light-heartedly flung on the wind. Flung on the wind in what way? The young people are all the less capable of imagining it, since they see before them an elderly and respectable Marquise de Villeparisis and have no idea that the grave diarist of the present day, so dignified beneath her pile of snowy hair, can ever have been a gay midnight-reveller who was perhaps the delight in those days, devoured the fortunes perhaps of men now sleeping in their graves; that she should also have set to work, with a persevering and natural industry, to destroy the position which she owed to her high birth does not in the least imply that even at that remote period Mme. de Villeparisis did not attach great importance to her position. In the same way the web of isolation, of inactivity in which a neurasthenic lives may be woven by him from morning to night without therefore seeming endurable, and while he is hastening to add another mesh to the net which holds him captive, it is possible that he is dreaming only of dancing, sport and travel. We are at work every moment upon giving its form to our life, but we do so by copying unintentionally, like the example in a book, the features of the person that we are and not of him who we should like to be. The disdainful bow of Mme. Leroi might to some extent be expressive of the true nature of Mme. de Villeparisis; it in no way corresponded to her ambition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt at the same moment at which Mme. Leroi was \u2014 to use an expression beloved of Mme. Swann \u2014\u2018cutting\u2019 the Marquise, the latter could seek consolation in remembering how Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie had once said to her: \u201cYou are just like a daughter to me.\u201d But such marks of royal friendship, secret and unknown to the world, existed for the Marquise alone, dusty as the diploma of an old Conservatoire medalist. The only true social advantages are those that create life, that can disappear without the person who has benefited by them needing to try to keep them or to make them public, because on the same day a hundred others will take their place. And for all that she could remember the Queen\u2019s using those words to her, she would nevertheless have bartered them gladly for the permanent faculty of being asked everywhere which Mme. Leroi possessed as in a restaurant a great but unknown artist whose genius is written neither in the lines of his bashful face nor in the antiquated cut of his threadbare coat, would willingly be even the young stock-jobber, of the lowest grade of society, who is sitting with a couple of actresses at a neighbouring table to which in an obsequious and incessant chain come hurrying manager, head waiter, pages and even the scullions who file out of the kitchen to salute him, as in the fairy-tales, while the wine waiter advances, dust-covered like his bottles, limping and dazed, as if on his way up from the cellar he had twisted his foot before emerging into the light of day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be remarked, however, that in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room the absence of Mme. Leroi, if it distressed the lady of the house, passed unperceived by the majority of her guests. They were entirely ignorant of the peculiar position which Mme. Leroi occupied, a: position known only to the fashionable world, and never doubted that Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s receptions were, as the readers of her Memoirs to-day are convinced that they must have been, the most brilliant in Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the occasion of this first call which, after leaving Saint-Loup, I went to pay on Mme. Villeparisis, following the advice given by M. de Norpois to my father, I found her in her drawing-room hung with yellow silk, against which the sofas and the admirable armchairs upholstered in Beauvais tapestry stood out with the almost purple redness of ripe raspberries. Side by side with the Guermantes and Villeparisis portraits one saw those \u2014 gifts from the sitters themselves \u2014 of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie, the Queen of the Belgians, the Prince de Joinville and the Empress of Austria. Mme. de Villeparisis herself, capped with an old-fashioned bonnet of black lace (which she preserved with the same instinctive sense of local or historical colour as a Breton inn-keeper who, however Parisian his customers may have become, feels it more in keeping to make his maids dress in coifs and wide sleeves), was seated at a little desk on which in front of her, as well as her brushes, her palette and an unfinished flower-piece in water-colours, were arranged in glasses, in saucers, in cups, moss-roses, zinnias, maidenhair ferns, which on account of the sudden influx of callers she had just left off painting, and which had the effect of being piled on a florist\u2019s counter in some eighteenth-century mezzotint. In this drawing-room, which had been slightly heated on purpose because the Marquise had caught cold on the journey from her house in the country, there were already when I arrived a librarian with whom Mme. de Villeparisis had spent the morning in selecting the autograph letters to herself from various historical personages which were to figure in facsimile as documentary evidence in the Memoirs which she was preparing for the press, and a historian, solemn and tongue-tied, who hearing that she had inherited and still possessed a portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, had come to ask her permission to reproduce it as a plate in his work on the Fronde; a party strengthened presently by the addition of my old friend Bloch, now a rising dramatist, upon whom she counted to secure the gratuitous services of actors and actresses at her next series of afternoon parties. It was true that the social kaleidoscope was in the act of turning and that the Dreyfus case was shortly to hurl the Jews down to the lowest rung of the social ladder. But, for one thing, the anti-Dreyfus cyclone might rage as it would, it is not in the first hour of a storm that the waves are highest. In the second place, Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving a whole section of her family to fulminate against the Jews, had hitherto kept herself entirely aloof from the Case and never gave it a thought. Lastly, a young man like Bloch, whom no one knew, might pass unperceived, whereas leading Jews, representatives of their party, were already threatened. He had his chin pointed now by a goat-beard, wore double glasses and a long frock coat, and carried a glove like a roll of papyrus in his hand. The Rumanians, the Egyptians, the Turks may hate the Jews. But in a French drawing-room the differences between those peoples are not so apparent, and an Israelite making his entry as though he were emerging from the heart of the desert, his body crouching like a hyaena\u2019s, his neck thrust obliquely forward, spreading himself in profound \u2018salaams,\u2019 completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental. Only it is essential that the Jew should not be actually \u2018in\u2019 society, otherwise he will readily assume the aspect of a lord and his manners become so Gallicised that on his face a rebellious nose, growing like a nasturtium in any but the right direction, will make one think rather of Mascarille\u2019s nose than of Solomon\u2019s. But Bloch, not having been rendered supple by the gymnastics of the Faubourg, nor ennobled by a crossing with England or Spain, remained for a lover of the exotic as strange and savoury a spectacle, in spite of his European costume, as one of Decamps\u2019s Jews. Marvellous racial power which from the dawn of time thrusts to the surface, even in modern Paris, on the stage of our theatres, behind the pigeonholes of our public offices, at a funeral, in the street, a solid phalanx, setting their mark upon our modern ways of hairdressing, absorbing, making us forget, disciplining the frock coat which on them remains not at all unlike the garment in which Assyrian scribes are depicted in ceremonial attire on the frieze of a monument at Susa before the gates of the Palace of Darius. (Later in the afternoon Bloch might have imagined that it was out of anti-semitic malice that M. de Charlus inquired whether his first name was Jewish, whereas it was simply from aesthetic interest and love of local colour.) But, to revert for a moment, when we speak of racial persistence we do not accurately convey the impression we receive from Jews, Greeks, Persians, all those peoples whom it is better to leave with their differences. We know from classical paintings the faces of the ancient Greeks, we have seen Assyrians on the walls of a palace at Susa. And so we feel, on encountering in a Paris drawing-room Orientals belonging to one or another group, that we are in the presence of creatures whom the forces of necromancy must have called to life. We knew hitherto only a superficial image; behold it has gained depth, it extends into three dimensions, it moves. The young Greek lady, daughter of a rich banker and the latest favourite of society, looks exactly like one of those dancers who in the chorus of a ballet at once historical and aesthetic symbolise in flesh and blood the art of Hellas; and yet in the theatre the setting makes these images somehow trite; the spectacle, on the other hand, to which the entry into a drawing-room of a Turkish lady or a Jewish gentleman admits us, by animating their features makes them appear stranger still, as if they really were creatures evoked by the effort of a medium. It is the soul (or rather the pigmy thing to which \u2014 up to the present, at any rate \u2014 the soul is reduced in this sort of materialisation), it is the soul of which we have caught glimpses hitherto in museums alone, the soul of the ancient Greeks, of the ancient Hebrews, torn from a life at once insignificant and transcendental, which seems to be enacting before our eyes this disconcerting pantomime. In the young Greek lady who is leaving the room what we seek in vain to embrace is the figure admired long ago on the side of a vase. I felt that if I had in the light of Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room taken photographs of Bloch, they would have furnished of Israel the same image \u2014 so disturbing because it does not appear to emanate from humanity, so deceiving because all the same it is so strangely like humanity \u2014 which we find in spirit photographs. There is nothing, to speak more generally, not even the insignificance of the remarks made by the people among whom we spend our lives, that does not give us a sense of the supernatural, in our everyday world where even a man of genius from whom we expect, gathered as though around a turning-table, to learn the secret of the Infinite utters only these words \u2014 the same that had just issued from the lips of Bloch: \u201cTake care of my top hat.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Ministers, my dear sir,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis was saying, addressing herself specially to my friend, and picking up the thread of a conversation which had been broken by my arrival: \u201cnobody ever wanted to see them. I was only a child at the time, but I can remember so well the King begging my grandfather to invite M. Decazes to a rout at which my father was to dance with the Duchesse de Berry. \u2018It will give me pleasure, Florimond,\u2019 said the King. My grandfather, who was a little deaf, thought he had said M. de Castries, which seemed a perfectly natural thing to ask. When he understood that it was M. Decazes, he was furious at first, but he gave in, and wrote a note the same evening to M. Decazes, begging him to pay my grandfather the compliment and give him the honour of his presence at the ball which he was giving the following week. For we were polite, sir, in those days, and no hostess would have dreamed of simply sending her card and writing on it \u2018Tea\u2019 or \u2018Dancing\u2019 or \u2018Music.\u2019 But if we understood politeness we were not incapable of impertinence either. M. Decazes accepted, but the day before the ball it was given out that my grandfather felt indisposed and had cancelled his invitations. He had obeyed the King, but he had not had M. Decazes at his ball. . . . Yes, sir, I remember M. Mole very well, he was a clever man \u2014 he shewed that in his reception of M. de Vigny at the Academy \u2014 but he was very pompous, and I can see him now coming downstairs to dinner in his own house with his tall hat in his hand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! that is typically suggestive of what must have been a pretty perniciously philistine epoch, for it was no doubt a universal habit to carry one\u2019s hat in one\u2019s hand in one\u2019s own house,\u201d observed Bloch, anxious to make the most of so rare an opportunity of learning from an eyewitness details of the aristocratic life of another day, while the librarian, who was a sort of intermittent secretary to the Marquise, gazed at her tenderly as though he were saying to the rest of us: \u201cThere, you see what she\u2019s like, she knows everything, she has met everybody, you can ask her anything you like, she\u2019s quite amazing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, no,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, drawing nearer to her as she spoke the glass containing the maidenhair which presently she would begin again to paint, \u201cit was a habit M. Mole had; that was all. I never saw my father carry his hat in the house, except of course when the King came, because the King being at home wherever he is the master of the house is only a visitor then in his own drawing-room.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAristotle tells us in the second chapter of . . . \u201d ventured M. Pierre, the historian of the Fronde, but so timidly that no one paid any attention. Having been suffering for some weeks from a nervous insomnia which resisted every attempt at treatment, he had given up going to bed, and, half-dead with exhaustion, went out only whenever his work made it imperative. Incapable of repeating at all often these expeditions which, simple enough for other people, cost him as much effort as if, to make them, he was obliged to come down from the moon, he was surprised to be brought up so frequently against the fact that other people\u2019s lives were not organised on a constant and permanent basis so as to furnish the maximum utility to the sudden outbursts of his own. He sometimes found the doors shut of a library which he had reached only after setting himself artificially on his feet and in a frock coat like some automaton in a story by Mr. Wells. Fortunately he had found Mme. de Villeparisis at home and was going to be shewn the portrait\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile he was cut short by Bloch. \u201cIndeed,\u201d the latter remarked, referring to what Mme. de Villeparisis had said as to the etiquette for royal visits. \u201cDo you know, I never knew that,\u201d as though it were strange that he should not have known it always\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTalking of that sort of visit, you heard the stupid joke my nephew Basin played on me yesterday morning?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis asked the librarian. \u201cHe told my people, instead of announcing him, to say that it was the Queen of Sweden who had called to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! He made them tell you just like that! I say, he must have a nerve,\u201d exclaimed Bloch with a shout of laughter, while the historian smiled with a stately timidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was quite surprised, because I had only been back from the country a few days; I had specially arranged, just to be left in peace for a little, that no one was to be told that I was in Paris, and I asked myself how the Queen of Sweden could have heard so soon,\u201d went on Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving her guests amazed to find that a visit from the Queen of Sweden was in itself nothing out of the common to their hostess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earlier in the day Mme. de Villeparisis might have been collaborating with the librarian in arranging the illustrations to her Memoirs; now she was, quite unconsciously, trying their effect on an average public typical of that from which she would eventually have to enlist her readers. Hers might be different in many ways from a really fashionable drawing-room in which you would have been struck by the absence of a number of middle dass ladies to whom Mme. de Villeparisis was \u2018at home,\u2019 and would have noticed instead such brilliant leaders of fashion as Mme. Leroi had in course of time managed to secure, but this distinction is not perceptible in her Memoirs, from which certain unimportant friendships of the author have disappeared because there is never any occasion to refer to them; while the absence of those who did not come to see her leaves no gap because, in the necessarily restricted space at the author\u2019s disposal, only a few persons can appear, and if these persons are royal personages, historic personalities, then the utmost impression of distinction which any volume of memoirs can convey to the public is achieved. In the opinion of Mme. Leroi, Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s parties were third-rate; and Mme. de Villeparisis felt the sting of Mme. Leroi\u2019s opinion. But hardly anyone to-day remembers who Mme. Leroi was, her opinions have vanished into thin air, and it is the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, frequented as it was by the Queen of Sweden, and as it had been by the Due d\u2019Aumale, the Duc de Broglie, Thiers, Montalembert, Mgr. Dupanloup, which will be looked upon as one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century by that posterity which has not changed since the days of Homer and Pindar, and for which the enviable things are exalted birth, royal or quasi-royal, and the friendship of kings, the leaders of the people and other eminent men\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now of all this Mme. de Villeparisis had her share in the people who still came to her house and in the memories \u2014 sometimes slightly \u2018touched up\u2019\u2014 by means of which she extended her social activity into the past. And then there was M. de Norpois who, while unable to restore his friend to any substantial position in society, did indeed bring to her house such foreign or French statesmen as might have need of his services and knew that the only effective method of securing them was to pay court to Mme. de Villeparisis. Possibly Mme. Leroi also knew these European celebrities. But, as a well-mannered woman who avoids anything that suggests the bluestocking, she would as little have thought of mentioning the Eastern question to her Prime Ministers as of discussing the nature of love with her novelists and philosophers. \u201cLove?\u201d she had once replied to a pushing lady who had asked her: \u201cWhat are your views on love?\u201d\u2014\u201cLove? I make it, constantly, but I never talk about it.\u201d When she had any of these literary or political lions in her house she contented herself, as did the Duchesse de Guermantes, with setting them down to play poker. They often preferred this to the serious conversations on general ideas in which Mme. de Villeparisis forced them to engage. But these conversations, ridiculous as in the social sense they may have been, have furnished the Memoirs of Mme. de Villeparisis with those admirable passages, those dissertations on politics which read so well in volumes of autobiography, as they do in Corneille\u2019s tragedies. Furthermore, the parties of the Villeparisis of this world are alone destined to be handed down to posterity, because the rerois of this world cannot write, and, if they could, would not have the time. And if the literary bent of the Villeparisis is the cause of the Lerois\u2019 disdain, the disdain of the Lerois does, in its turn, a singular service to the literary bent of the Villeparisis by affording the bluestockings that leisure which the career of letters requires. God, Whose Will it is that there should be a few books in the world well written, breathes with that purpose such disdain into the hearts of the Lerois, for He knows that if these should invite the Villeparisis to dinner the latter would at once rise from their writing tables and order their carriages to be round at eight\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently there came into the room, with slow and solemn step, an oid lady of tall stature who, beneath the raised brim of her straw hat, revealed a monumental pile of snowy hair in the style of Marie-Antoinette. I did not then know that she was one of three women who were still to be seen in Parisian society and who, like Mme. de Villeparisis, while all of the noblest birth, had been reduced, for reasons which were IKJW lost in the night of time and could have been told us only by some old gallant of their period, to entertaining only certain of the dregs of society who were not sought after elsewhere. Each of these ladies had her own \u2018Duchesse de Guermantes,\u2019 the brilliant niece who came regularly to pay her respects, but none of them could have succeeded in attracting to her house the \u2018Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019 of either of the others. Mme. de Villeparisis was on the best of terms with these three ladies, but she did not like them. Perhaps the similarity between their social position and her own gave her an impression of them which was not pleasing. Besides, soured bluestockings as they were, seeking by the number and frequency of the drawing-room comedies which they arranged in their houses to give themselves the illusion of a regular salon, there had grown up among them a rivalry which the decay of her fortune in the course of a somewhat tempestuous existence reduced for each of them, when it was a question of securing the kind assistance of a professional actor or actress, into a sort of struggle for life. Furthermore, the lady with the Mark-Antoinette hair, whenever she set eyes on Mme. de Villeparisis, could not help being reminded of the fact that the Duchesse de Guermantes did not come to her Fridays. Her consolation was that at these same Fridays she could always count on having, blood being thicker than water, the Princesse de Poix, who was her own personal Guermantes, and who never went near Mme. de Villeparisis, albeit Mme. de Poix was an intimate friend of the Duchess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless from the mansion on the Quai Malaquais to the drawing-rooms of the Rue de Tournon, the Rue de la Chaise and the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, a bond as compelling as it was hateful united the three fallen goddesses, as to whom I would fain have learned by searching in some dictionary of social mythology through what gallant adventure, what sacrilegious presumption, they had incurred their punishment. Their common brilliance of origin, the common decay of their present state entered largely, no doubt, into the necessity which compelled them, while hating one another, to frequent one another\u2019s society. Besides, each of them found in the others a convenient way of being polite to her own guests. How should these fail to suppose that they had scaled the most inaccessible peak of the Faubourg when they were introduced to a lady with a string of titles whose sister was married to a Duc de Sagan or a Prince de Ligne? Especially as there was infinitely more in the newspapers about these sham salons than about the genuine ones. Indeed these old ladies\u2019 \u2018men about town\u2019 nephews \u2014 and Saint-Loup the foremost of them \u2014 when asked by a friend to introduce him to people, would answer at once \u201cI will take you to see my aunt Villeparisis,\u201d (or whichever it was) \u201cyou meet interesting people there.\u201d They knew very well that this would mean less trouble for themselves than trying to get the said friends invited by the smart nieces or sisters-in-law of these ladies. Certain very old men and young women who had heard it from those men, told me that if these ladies were no longer received in society it was because of the extraordinary irregularity of their conduct, which, when I objected that irregular conduct was not necessarily a barrier to social success, was represented to me as having gone far beyond anything that we know to-day. The misconduct of these solemn dames who held themselves so erect assumed on the lips of those who hinted at it something that I was incapable of imagining, proportionate to the magnitude of prehistoric days, to the age of the mammoth. In a word, these three Parcae with their white or blue or red locks had spun the fatal threads of an incalculable number of gentlemen. I felt that the people of to-day exaggerated the vices of those fabulous times, like the Greeks who created Icarus, Theseus, Heracles out of men who had been but little different from those who long afterwards deified them. But one does not tabulate the sum of a person\u2019s vices until he has almost ceased to be in a fit state to practise them, when from the magnitude of his social punishment, which is then nearing the completion of its term and which alone one can estimate, one measures, one imagines, one exaggerates that of the crime that has been committed. In that gallery of symbolical figures which is \u2018society,\u2019 the really light women, the true Messalinas, invariably present the solemn aspect of a lady of at least seventy, with an air of lofty distinction, who entertains everyone she can but not everyone she would like to have, to whose house women will never consent to go whose own conduct falls in any way short of perfection, to whom the Pope regularly sends his Golden Rose, and who as often as not has written \u2014 on the early days of Lamartine \u2014 an essay that has been crowned by the French Academy. \u201cHow d\u2019ye do, Alix?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis greeted the Marie-Antoinette lady, which lady cast a searching glance round the assembly to see whether there was not in this drawing-room any item that might be a valuable addition to her own, in which case she would have to discover it for herself, for Mme. de Villeparisis, she was sure, would be spiteful enough to try to keep it from her. Thus Mme. de Villeparisis took good care not to introduce Bloch to the old lady for fear of his being asked to produce the same play that he was arranging for her in the drawing-room of the Quai Malaquais. Besides it was only tit for tat. For, the evening before, the old lady had had Mme. Ristori, who had recited, and had taken care that Mme. de Villeparisis, from whom she had filched the Italian artist, should not hear of this function until it was over. So that she should not read it first in the newspapers and feel annoyed, the old lady had come ill nerson to tell her about it, shewing no sense of guilt. Mme. de Villeparisis, considering that an introduction of myself was not likely to have the same awkward results as that of Bloch, made me known to the Marie-Antoinette of the Quai Malaquais. The latter, who sought, by making the fewest possible movements, to preserve in her old age those lines, as of a Coysevox goddess, which had years ago charmed the young men of fashion and which spurious poets still celebrated in rhymed charades \u2014 and had acquired the habit of a lofty and compensating stiffness common to all those whom a personal degradation obliges to be continually making advances \u2014 just perceptibly lowered her head with a frigid majesty, and, turning the other way, took no more notice of me than if I had not existed. By this crafty attitude she seemed to be assuring Mme. de Villeparisis: \u201cYou see, I\u2019m nowhere near him; please understand that I\u2019m not interested \u2014 in any sense of the word, you old cat \u2014 in little boys.\u201d But when, twenty minutes later, she left the room, taking advantage of the general conversation, she slipped into my ear an invitation to come to her box the following Friday with another of the three, whose high-sounding name \u2014 she had been born a Choiseul, moreover \u2014 had a prodigious effect on me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI understand, sir, that you are thinkin\u2019 of writin\u2019 somethin\u2019 about Mme. la Duchesse de Montmorency,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the historian of the Fronde in that grudging tone which she allowed, quite unconsciously, to spoil the effect of her great and genuine kindness, a tone due to the shrivelling crossness, the sense of grievance that is a physiological accompaniment of age, as well as to the affectation of imitating the almost rustic speech of the old nobility: \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to let you see her portrait, the original of the copy they have in the Louvre.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She rose, laying down her brushes beside the flowers, and the little apron which then came into sight at her waist, and which she wore so as not to stain her dress with paints, added still further to the impression of an old peasant given by her bonnet and her big spectacles, and offered a sharp contrast to the luxury of her appointments, the butler who had brought in the tea and cakes, the liveried footman for whom she now rang to light up the portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, Abbess of one of the most famous Chapters in the East of France. Everyone had risen. \u201cWhat is rather amusin\u2019,\u201d said our hostess, \u201cis that in these Chapters where our great-aunts were so often made Abbesses, the daughters of the King of France would not have been admitted. They were very close corporations.\u201d \u201cNot admit the King\u2019s daughters,\u201d cried Bloch in amazement, \u201cwhy ever not?\u201d \u201cWhy, because the House of France had not enough quartering after that low marriage.\u201d Bloch\u2019s bewilderment increased. \u201cA low marriage? The House of France? When was that?\u201d \u201cWhy, when they married into the Medicis,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis in the most natural manner. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine picture, ain\u2019t it, and in a perfect state of preservation,\u201d she added\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018My dear,\u201d put in the Marie-Antoinette lady, \u201csurely you remember that when I brought Liszt to see you he said that it was this one that was the copy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should bow to any opinion of Liszt on music, but not on painthe Besides, he was quite off his head then, and I don\u2019t remember his ever saying anything of the sort. But it wasn\u2019t you that brought him here. I had met him any number of times at dinner at Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alix\u2019s shot had missed fire; she stood silent, erect and motionless. Plastered with layers of powder, her face had the appearance of a face of stone. And, as the profile was noble, she seemed, on a triangular and moss-grown pedestal hidden by her cape, the time-worn stucco goddess of a park\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, I see another fine portrait,\u201d began the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The door opened and the Duchesse de Guermantes entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, how are you?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis greeted her without moving her head, taking from her apron-pocket a hand which she held out to the newcomer; and then ceasing at once to take any notice of her niece, in order to return to the historian: \u201cThat is the portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A young servant with a bold manner and a charming face (but so finely chiselled, to ensure its perfection, that the nose was a little red and the rest of the skin slightly flushed as though they were still smarting from the recent and sculptural incision) came in bearing a card on a salver\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is that gentleman who has been several times to see Mme. la Marquise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you tell him I was at home?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe heard the voices.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, very well then, shew him in. It\u2019s a man who was introduced to me,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe told me he was very anxious to come to the house. I certainly never said he might. But here he\u2019s taken the trouble to call five times now; it doesn\u2019t do to hurt people\u2019s feelings. Sir,\u201d she went on to me, \u201cand you, Sir,\u201d to the historian of the Fronde, \u201clet me introduce my niece, the Duchesse de Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The historian made a low bow, as I did also, and since he seemed to suppose that some friendly remark ought to follow this salute, his eyes brightened and he was preparing to open his mouth when he was once more frozen by the sight of Mme. de Guermantes who had taken advantage of the independence of her torso to throw it forward with an exaggerated politeness and bring it neatly back to a position of rest without letting face or eyes appear to have noticed that anyone was standing before them; after breathing a gentle sigh she contented herself with manifesting the nullity of the impression that had been made on her by the sight of the historian and myself by performing certain movements of her nostrils with a precision that testified to the absolute inertia of her unoccupied attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importunate visitor entered the room, making straight for Mme. de Villeparisis with an ingenuous, fervent air: it was Legrandin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you so very much for letting me come and see you,\u201d he began, laying stress on the word \u2018very.\u2019 \u201cIt is a pleasure of a quality altogether rare and subtle that you confer on an old solitary; I assure you that its repercussion . . . \u201d He stopped short on catching sight of me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just shewing this gentleman a fine portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, the wife of the author of the Maxims; it\u2019s a family picture.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes meanwhile had greeted Alix, with apologies for not having been able, that year as in every previous year, to go and see her. \u201cI hear all about you from Madeleine,\u201d she added\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe was at luncheon with me to-day,\u201d said the Marquise of the Quai Malaquais, with the satisfying reflexion that Mme. de Villeparisis could never say that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I had been talking to Bloch, and fearing, from what I had been told of his father\u2019s change of attitude towards him, that he might be envying my life, I said to him that his must be the happier of the two. My remark was prompted solely by my desire to be friendly. But such friendliness readily convinces those who cherish a high opinion of themselves of their own good fortune, or gives them a desire to convince other people. \u201cYes, I do lead a delightful existence,\u201d Bloch assured me with a beatified smile. \u201cI have three great friends; I do not wish for one more; an adorable mistress; I am infinitely happy. Rare is the mortal to whom Father Zeus accords so much felicity.\u201d I fancy that he was anxious principally to extol himself and to make me envious. Perhaps too there was some desire to shew originality in his optimism. It was evident that he did not wish to reply in the commonplace phraseology that everybody uses: \u201cOh, it was nothing, really,\u201d and so forth, when, to my question: \u201cWas it a good show?\u201d put with regard to an afternoon dance at his house to which I had been prevented from going, he replied in a level, careless tone, as if the dance had been given by some one else: \u201cWhy, yes, it was quite a good show, couldn\u2019t have been better. It was really charming!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat you have just told us interests me enormously,\u201d said Legrandin to Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cfor I was saying to myself only the other day that you shewed a marked likeness to him in the clear-cut turn of your speech, in a quality which I will venture to describe by two contradictory terms, monumental rapidity and immortal instantaneousness. I should have liked this afternoon to take down all the things you say; but I shall remember them. They are, in a phrase which comes, I think, from Joubert, friends of the memery. You have never read Joubert? Oh! he would have admired you so! I will take the liberty this evening of sending you a set of him, it is a privilege to make you a present of his mind. He had not your strength. But he had a great deal of charm all the same.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would have gone up to Legrandin at once and spoken to him, but he kept as far away from me as he could, no doubt in the hope that I might not overhear the stream of flattery which, with a remarkable felicity of expression, he kept pouring out, whatever the topic, to Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She shrugged her shoulders, smiling, as though he had been trying to make fun of her, and turned to the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd this is the famous Marie de Rohan, Duchesse de Chevreuse, who was married first of all to M. de Luynes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear, speaking of Mme. de Luynes reminds me of Yolande; she came to me yesterday evening, and if I had known that you weren\u2019t engaged I\u2019d have sent round to ask you to come. Mme. Ristori turned up quite by chance, and recited some poems by Queen Carmen Sylva in the author\u2019s presence. It was too beautiful!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat treachery!\u201d thought Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cOf course that was what she was whispering about the other day to Mme. de Beaulaincourt and Mme. de Chaponay. I had no engagement,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I should not have come. I heard Ristori in her great days, she\u2019s a mere wreck now. Besides I detest Carmen Sylva\u2019s poetry. Ristori came here once, the Duchess of Aosta brought her, to recite a canto of the Inferno, by Dante. In that sort of thing she\u2019s incomparable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alix bore the blow without flinching. She remained marble. Her gaze was piercing and blank, her nose proudly arched. But the surface of one cheek was scaling. A faint, strange vegetation, green and pink, was invading her chin. Perhaps another winter would level her with the dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow, sir, if you are fond of painting, look at the portrait of Mme, de Montmorency,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis said to Legrandin, to stop the flow of compliments which was beginning again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seizing her opportunity, while his back was turned, Mme. de Guermantes pointed to him, with an ironical, questioning look at her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s M. Legrandin,\u201d murmured Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201che has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer, not that that conveys any more to you than it does to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! Oh, but I know her quite well!\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes, and put her hand over her lips. \u201cThat is to say, I don\u2019t know her, but for some reason or other Basin, who meets the husband heaven knows where, took it into his head to tell the wretched woman she might call on me. And she did. I can\u2019t tell you what it was like. She informed me that she had been to London, and gave me a complete catalogue of all the things in the British Museum. And this very day, the moment I leave your house, I\u2019m going, just as you see me now, to drop a card on the monster. And don\u2019t for a moment suppose that it\u2019s an easy thing to do. On the pretence that she\u2019s dying of some disease she\u2019s always at home, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you arrive at seven at night or nine in the morning, she\u2019s ready for you with a dish of strawberry tarts\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, but seriously, you know, she is a monstrosity,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes replied to a questioning glance from her aunt. \u201cShe\u2019s an impossible person, she talks about \u2018plumitives\u2019 and things like that.\u201d \u201cWhat does \u2018plumitive\u2019 mean?\u201d asked Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea!\u201d cried the Duchess in mock indignation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t speak that sort of language.\u201d And seeing that her aunt really did not know what a plumitive was, to give herself the satisfaction of shewing that she was a scholar as well as a purist, and to make fun of her aunt, now, after making fun of Mme. de Cambremer: \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d she said, with a half-laugh which the last traces of her pretended ill humour kept in check, \u201ceverybody knows what it means; a plumitive is a writer, a person who holds a pen. But it\u2019s a dreadful word. It\u2019s enough to make your wisdom teeth drop out. Nothing will ever make me use words like that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd so that\u2019s the brother, is it? I hadn\u2019t realized that yet. But after all it\u2019s not inconceivable. She has the same doormat docility and the same mass of information like a circulating library. She\u2019s just as much of a flatterer as he is, and just as boring. Yes, I\u2019m beginning to see the family likeness now quite plainly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit down, we\u2019re just going to take a dish of tea,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to her niece. \u201cHelp yourself; you don\u2019t want to look at the pictures of your great-grandmothers, you know them as well as I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently Mme. de Villeparisis sat down again at her desk and went on with her painting. The rest of the party gathered round her, and I took the opportunity to go up to Legrandin and, seeing no harm myself in his presence in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room and never dreaming how much my words would at once hurt him and make him believe that I had deliberately intended to hurt him, say: \u201cWell, sir, I am almost excused for coming to a tea-party when I find you here too.\u201d M. Legrandin concluded from this speech (at least this was the opinion which he expressed of me a few days later) that I was a thoroughly spiteful little wretch who delighted only in doing mischief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou might at least have the civility to begin by saying how d\u2019ye do to me,\u201d he replied, without offering me his hand and in a coarse and angry voice which I had never suspected him of possessing, a voice which bearing no traceable relation to what he ordinarily said did bear another more immediate and striking relation to something that he was feeling at the moment. What happens is that since we are determined always to keep our feelings to ourselves, we have never given any thought to the manner in which we should express them. And suddenly there is within us a strange and obscene animal making its voice heard, the tones of which may inspire as much terror in the listener who receives the involuntary elliptical irresistible communication of our defect or vice as would the sudden avowal indirectly and uncouthly proffered by a criminal who can no longer refrain from confessing a murder of which one had never imagined him to be guilty. I knew, of course, that idealism, even subjective idealism, did not prevent great philosophers from still having hearty appetites or from presenting themselves with untiring perseverance for election to the Academy. But really Legrandin had no occasion to remind people so often that he belonged to another planet when all his convulsive movements of anger or affability were governed by the desire to occupy a good position on this\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNaturally, when people pester me twenty times on end to go anywhere,\u201d he went on in lower tones, \u201calthough I am perfectly free to do what I choose, still I can\u2019t behave like an absolute boor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes had sat down. Her name, accompanied as it was by her title, added to her corporeal dimensions the duchy which projected itself round about her and brought the shadowy, sun-splashed coolness of the woods of Guermantes into this drawing-room, to surround the tuffet on which she was sitting. I felt surprised only that the likeness of those woods was not more discernible on the face of the Duchess, about which there was nothing suggestive of vegetation, and at the most the ruddy discolouration of her cheeks \u2014 which ought rather, surely, to have been emblazoned with the name Guermantes \u2014 was the effect, but did not furnish a picture of long gallops in the open air. Later on, when she had ceased to interest me, I came to know many of the Duchess\u2019s peculiarities, notably (to speak for the moment only of that one of which I already at this time felt the charm though without yet being able to discover what it was) her eyes, in which was held captive as in a picture the blue sky of an afternoon in France, broadly expansive, bathed in light even when no sun shone; and a voice which one would have thought, from its first hoarse sounds, to be almost plebeian, through which there trailed, as over the steps of the church at Combray or the pastry-cook\u2019s in the square, the rich and lazy gold of a country sun. But on this first day I discerned nothing, the warmth of my attention volatilised at once the little that I might otherwise have been able to extract from her, in which I should have found some indication of the name Guermantes. In any case, I told myself that it was indeed she who was designated for all the world by the title Duchesse de Guermantes: the inconceivable life which that name signified, this body did indeed contain; it had just introduced that life into a crowd of different creatures, in this room which enclosed it on every side and on which it produced so violent a reaction that I thought I could see, where the extent of that mysterious life ceased, a fringe of effervescence outline its frontiers: round the circumference of the circle traced on the carpet by the balloon of her blue pekin skirt, and in the bright eyes of the Duchess at the point of intersection of the preoccupations, the memories, the incomprehensible, scornful, amused and curious thoughts which filled them from within and the outside images that were reflected on their surface. Perhaps I should have been not quite so deeply stirred had I met her at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s at an evening party, instead of seeing her thus on one of the Marquise\u2019s \u2018days,\u2019 at one of those tea-parties which are for women no more than a brief halt in the course of their afternoon\u2019s outing, when, keeping on the hats in which they have been driving through the streets, they waft into the close atmosphere of a drawing-room the quality of the fresh air outside, and give one a better view of Paris in the late afternoon than do the tall, open windows through which one can hear the bowling wheels of their victorias: Mme. de Guermantes wore a boating-hat trimmed with cornflowers, and what they recalled to me was not, among the tilled fields round Combray where I had so often gathered those flowers, on the slope adjoining the Tansonville hedge, the suns of bygone years; it was the scent and dust of twilight as they had been an hour ago, when Mme. de Guermantes drove through them, in the Rue de la Paix. With a smiling, disdainful, vague air, and a grimace on her pursed lips, with the point of her sunshade, as with the extreme tip of an antenna of her mysterious life, she was tracing circles on the carpet; then, with that indifferent attention which begins by eliminating every point of contact with what one is actually studying, her gaze fastened upon each of us in turn; then inspected the sofas and armchairs, but softened this time by that human sympathy which is aroused by the presence, however insignificant, of a thing one knows, a thing that is almost a person; these pieces of furniture were not like us, they belonged vaguely to her world, they were bound up with the life of her aunt; then from the Beauvais furniture her gaze was carried back to the person sitting on it, and resumed then the same air of perspicacity and that same disapproval which the respect that Mme. de Guermantes felt for her aunt would have prevented her from expressing in words, but which she would obviously have felt had she discovered on the chairs, instead of our presence, that of a spot of grease or a layer of dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That admirable writer G\u2014\u2014-entered the room; he had come to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis which he regarded as a tiresome duty. The Duchess, although delighted to see him again, gave him no sign of welcome, but instinctively he made straight for her, the charm that she possessed, her tact, her simplicity making him look upon her as a woman of exceptional intelligence. He was bound, moreover, in common politeness to go and talk to her, for, since he was a pleasant and a distinguished man, Mme. de Guermantes frequently invited him to luncheon even when there were only her husband and herself besides, or in the autumn to Guermantes, making use of this intimacy to have him to dinner occasionally with Royalties who were curious to meet him. For the Duchess liked to entertain certain eminent men, on condition always that they were bachelors, a condition which, even when married, they invariably fulfilled for her, for, as their wives, who were bound to be more or less common, would have been a blot on a drawing-room in which there were never any but the most fashionable beauties in Paris, it was always without them that their husbands were invited; and the Duke, to avoid hurting any possible susceptibility, used to explain to these involuntary widowers that the Duchess never had women in the house, could not endure feminine society, almost as though this had been under doctor\u2019s orders, and as be might have said that she could not stay in a room in which there were smells, or eat salt food, or travel with her back to the engine, or wear stays. It was true that these eminent men used to see at the Guermantes\u2019 the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Sagan (whom Fran\u00e7oise, hearing her constantly mentioned, had taken to calling, in the belief that this feminine, ending was required by the laws of accidence, \u2018the Sagante\u2019), and plenty more, but their presence was accounted for by the explanation that they were relatives, or such very old friends that it was impossible to exclude them. Whether or not they were convinced by the explanations which the Due de Guermantes had given of the singular malady that made it impossible for the Duchess to associate with other women, the great men duly transmitted them to their wives. Some of these thought that this malady was only an excuse to cloak her jealousy, because the Duchess wished to reign alone over a court of worshippers. Others more simple still thought that perhaps the Duchess had some peculiar habit, a scandalous past it might be, that women did not care to go to her house and that she gave the name of a whim to what was stern necessity. The better among them, hearing their husbands expatiate on the Duchess\u2019s marvellous brain, assumed that She must be so far superior to the rest of womankind that she found their Society boring since they could not talk intelligently about anything. And it was true that the Duchess was bored by other women, if their princely rank did not render them specially interesting. But the excluded wives were mistaken when they imagined that she chose to entertain men alone in order to be free to discuss with them literature, science and philosophy. For she never referred to these, at least with the great intellectuals. If, by virtue of a family tradition such as makes the daughters of great soldiers preserve, in the midst of their most frivolous distractions a respect for military matters, she, the granddaughter of women who had been on terms of friendship with Thiers, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Augier, felt that a place must always be kept in her drawing-room for men of intellect, she had on the other hand derived from the manner, at once condescending and intimate, in which those famous men had been received at Guermantes the foible of looking on men of talent as family friends whose talent does not dazzle one, to whom one does not speak of their work, and who would not be at all interested if one did. Moreover the type of mind illustrated by M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy, which was hers also, led her by reaction from the verbal sentimentality of an earlier generation to a style in conversation that rejects everything to do with fine language and the expression of lofty thoughts, so that she made it a sort of element of good breeding when she was with a poet or a musician to talk only of the food that they were eating or the game of cards to which they would afterwards sit down. This abstention had, on a third person not conversant with her ways, a disturbing effect which amounted to mystification. Mme. de Guermantes having asked him whether it would amuse him to come to luncheon to meet this or that famous poet, devoured by curiosity he would arrive at the appointed hour. The Duchess was talking to the poet about the weather. They sat down to luncheon. \u201cDo you like this way of doing eggs?\u201d she asked the poet. On hearing his approval, which she shared, for everything in her own house appeared to her exquisite, including a horrible cider which she imported from Guermantes: \u201cGive Monsieur some more eggs,\u201d she would tell the butler, while the anxious fellow-guest sat waiting for what must surely have been the object of the party, since they had arranged to meet, in spite of every sort of difficulty, before the Duchess, the poet and he himself left Paris. But the meal went on, one after another the courses were cleared away, not without having first provided Mme. de Guermantes with opportunities for clever witticisms or apt stories. Meanwhile the poet went on eating, and neither Duke nor Duchess shewed any sign of remembering that he was a poet. And presently the luncheon came to an end and the party broke up, without a word having been said about the poetry which, for all that, everyone admired but to which, by a reserve analogous to that of which Swann had given me a foretaste, no one might refer. This reserve was simply a matter of good form. But for the fellow-guest, if he thought at all about the matter, there was something strangely melancholy about it all, and these meals in the Guermantes household made him think of the hours which timid lovers often spend together in talking trivialities until it is time to part, without \u2014 whether from shyness, from audacity or from awkwardness \u2014 the great secret which they would have been happier had they confessed ever succeeding in passing from their hearts to their lips. It must, however, be added that this silence with regard to the serious matters which one was always waiting in vain to see approached, if it might pass as characteristic of the Duchess, was by no means constant with her. Mme. de Guermantes had spent her girlhood in a society somewhat different, equally aristocratic but less brilliant and above all less futile than that in which she now lived, and one of wide culture. It had left beneath her present frivolity a sort of bed-rock of greater solidity, invisibly nutritious, to which indeed the Duchess would repair in search (very rarely, though, for she detested pedantry) of some quotation from Victor Hugo or Lamartine which, extremely appropriate, uttered with a look of true feeling from her fine eyes, never failed to surprise and charm her audience. Sometimes, even, without any pretence of authority, pertinently and quite simply, she would give some dramatist and Academician a piece of sage advice, would make him modify a situation or alter an ending\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, just as in the church at Combray, on the day of Mlle. Percepied\u2019s wedding, I had difficulty in discovering, in the handsome, too human face of Mme. de Guermantes the unknown element of her name, I at least thought that, when she spoke, her conversation, profound, mysterious, would have a strangeness as of a mediaeval tapestry or a gothic window. But in order that I should not be disappointed by the words which I should hear uttered by a person who called herself Mme. de Guermantes, even if I had not been in love with her, it would not have sufficed that those words were fine, beautiful and profound, they would have had to reflect that amaranthine colour of the closing syllable of her name, that colour which I had on my first sight of her been disappointed not to find in her person and had driven to take refuge in her mind. Of course I had already heard Mme. de Villeparisis, Saint-Loup, people whose intelligence was in no way extraordinary, pronounce without any precaution this name Guermantes, simply as that of a person who was coming to see them or with whom they had promised to dine, without seeming to feel that there were latent in her name the glow of yellowing woods in autumn and a whole mysterious tract of country. But this must have been an affectation on their part, as when the classic poets give us no warning of the profound purpose which they had, all the same, in writing, an affectation which I myself also strove to imitate, saying in the most natural tone: \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes,\u201d as though it were a name that was just like other names. And then everybody assured me that she was a highly intelligent woman, a clever talker, that she was one of a little group of most interesting people: words which became accomplices of my dream. For when they spoke of an intelligent group, of clever talk, it was not at all the sort of intelligence that I knew that I imagined, not even that of the greatest minds, it was not at all with men like Bergotte that I peopled this group. No, by intelligence I understood an ineffable faculty gilded by the sun, impregnated with a sylvan coolness. Indeed, had she made the most intelligent remarks (in the sense in which I understood the word when it was used of a philosopher or critic), Mme. de Guermantes would perhaps have disappointed even more keenly my expectation of so special a faculty than if, in the course of a trivial conversation, she had confined herself to discussing kitchen recipes or the furnishing of a country house, to mentioning the names of neighbours and relatives of her own, which would have given me a picture of her life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI thought I should find Basin here, he was meaning to come and see you to-day,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t set eyes on your husband for some days,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis in a somewhat nettled tone. \u201cIn fact, I haven\u2019t seen him.\u2019 well, I have seen him once, perhaps \u2014 since that charming joke he played on me of making my servants announce him as the Queen of Sweden.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners of her mouth as though she were biting her veil\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe met her at dinner last night at Blanche Leroi\u2019s. You wouldn\u2019t know her now, she\u2019s positively enormous; I\u2019m sure she must have something the matter with her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked like a frog,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to signify that she acknowledged the compliment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t remember making such a charming comparison, but if she was one before, now she\u2019s the frog that has succeeded in swelling to the size of the ox. Or rather, it isn\u2019t quite that, because all her swelling is concentrated in front of her waist, she\u2019s more like a frog in an interesting condition.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, that is quite clever,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, secretly proud that her guests should be witnessing this display of her niece\u2019s wit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is purely arbitrary, though,\u201d answered Mme. de Guermantes, ironically detaching this selected epithet, as Swann would have done, \u201cfor I must admit I never saw a frog in the family way. Anyhow, the frog in question, who, by the way, is not asking for a king, for I never saw her so skittish as she\u2019s been since her husband died, is coming to dine with us one day next week. I promised I\u2019d let you know in good time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis gave vent to a confused growl, from which emerged: \u201cI know she was dining with the Mecklenburgs the night before last. Hannibal de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was there. He came and told me about it, and was quite amusing, I must say.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere was a man there who\u2019s a great deal wittier than Babal,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes who, in view of her close friendship wih M. de Br\u00e9\u00e0ut\u00e9-Consalvi, felt that she must advertise their intimacy by the use of this abbreviation. \u201cI mean M. Bergotte.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had never imagined that Bergotte could be regarded as witty; in fact, I thought of him always as mingling with the intellectual section of humanity, that is to say infinitely remote from that mysterious realm of which I had caught a glimpse through the purple hangings of a theatre box, behind which, making the Duchess smile, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was holding with her, in the language of the gods, that unimaginable thing, a conversation between people of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. I was stupefied to see the balance upset, and Bergotte rise above M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. But above all I was dismayed to think that I had avoided Bergotte on the evening of Ph\u00e8dre, that I had not gone up and spoken to him, when I heard Mme. de Guermantes say to Mme. de Villeparisis:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is the only person I have any wish to know,\u201d went on the Duchess, in whom one could always, as at the turn of a mental tide, see the flow of curiosity with regard to well-known intellectuals sweep over the ebb of her aristocratic snobbishness. \u201cIt would be such a pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The presence of Bergotte by my side, which it would have been so easy for we to secure but which I had thought liable to give Mme. de Guermantes a bad impression of myself, would no doubt, on the contrary, have had the result that she would have signalled to me to join her in her box, and would have invited me to bring the eminent writer, one day, to luncheon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI gather that he didn\u2019t behave very well, he was presented to M. de Cobourg, and never uttered a word to him,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, dwelling on this odd characteristic as she might have recounted that a Chinaman had blown his nose on a sheet of paper. \u201cHe never once said \u2018Monseigneur\u2019 to him,\u201d she added, with an air of amusement at this detail, as important to her mind as the refusal of a Protestant, during an audience with the Pope, to go on his knees before his Holiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interested by these idiosyncrasies of Bergotte, she did not, however, appear to consider them reprehensible, and seemed rather to find a certain merit in them, though she would have been put to it to say of what sort. Despite this unusual mode of appreciating Bergotte\u2019s originality, it was a fact which I was later oh not to regard as wholly negligible that Mme. de Guermantes, greatly to the surprise of many of her friends, did consider Bergotte more witty than M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. Thus it is that such judgments, subversive, isolated, and yet after all just, are delivered in the world of fashion by those rare minds that are superior to the rest. And they sketch then the first rough outlines of the hierarchy of values as the next generation will establish it, instead of abiding eternally by the old standards\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Comte d\u2019Argencourt, Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires at the Belgian Legation and a remote connexion of Mme. de Villeparisis, came limping in, followed presently by two young men, the Baron de Guermantes and H. H. the Due de Ch\u00e2tellerault, whom Mme. de Guermantes greeted with: \u201cHow d\u2019ye do, young Ch\u00e2tellerault,\u201d in a careless tone and without moving from her tuffet, for she was a great friend of the young Duke\u2019s mother, which had given him a deep and lifelong respect for her. Tall, slender, with golden hair and sunny complexions, thoroughly of the Guermantes type, these two young men looked like a condensation of the light of the spring evening which was flooding the spacious room. Following a custom which was the fashion at that time they laid their silk hats on the floor, by their feet. The historian of the Fronde thought that they were embarrassed, like a peasant coming into the mayor\u2019s office and not knowing what to do with his hat. Feeling that he ought in charity to come to the rescue of the awkwardness and timidity which he ascribed to them:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t leave them on the floor, they\u2019ll be trodden on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A glance from the Baron de Guermantes, tilting the plane of his pupils, shot suddenly from them a wave of pure and piercing azure which froze the well-meaning historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat is that person\u2019s name?\u201d I was asked by the Baron, who had just been introduced to me by Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM. Pierre,\u201d I whispered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPierre what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPierre: it\u2019s his name, he\u2019s a historian, a most distinguished man.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally? You don\u2019t say so.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, it\u2019s a new fashion with these young men to put their hats on the floor,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis explained. \u201cI\u2019m like you, I can never get used to it. Still, it\u2019s better than my nephew Robert, who always leaves his in the hall. I tell him when I see him come in that he looks just like a clock-maker, and I ask him if he\u2019s come to wind the clocks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou were speaking just now, Madame la Marquise, of M. Mole\u2019s hat; we shall soon be able, like Aristotle, to compile a chapter on hats,\u201d said the historian of the Fronde, somewhat reassured by Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s intervention, but in so faint a voice that no one but myself overheard him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe really is astonishing, the little Duchess,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt, pointing to Mme. de Guermantes who was talking to G\u2014\u2014. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a famous man in the room you\u2019re sure to find him sitting with her. Evidently that must be the lion of the party over there. It can\u2019t always be M. de Borelli, of course, or M. Schlumberger or M. d\u2019Avenel. But then it\u2019s bound to be M. Pierre Loti or M. Edmond Rostand. Yesterday evening at the Doudeauvilles\u2019, where by the way she was looking splendid in her emerald tiara and a pink dress with a long train, she had M. Deschanel on one side and the German Ambassador on the other: she was holding forth to them about China; the general public, at a respectful distance where they couldn\u2019t hear what was being said, were wondering whether there wasn\u2019t going to be war. Really, you\u2019d have said she was a Queen, holding her circle.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everyone had gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her painting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThose flowers are a truly celestial pink,\u201d said Legrandin, \u201cI should say sky-pink. For there is such a thing as sky-pink just as there is sky-blue. But,\u201d he lowered his voice in the hope that he would not be heard by anyone but the Marquise, \u201cI think I shall still give my vote to the silky, living flesh tint of your rendering of them. You leave Pisanello and Van Huysun a long way behind, with their laborious, dead herbals.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An artist, however modest, is always willing to hear himself preferred to his rivals, and tries only to see that justice is done them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat makes you think that is that they painted the flowers of their period, which we don\u2019t have now, but they did it with great skill.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! The flowers of their period! That is a most ingenious theory,\u201d exclaimed Legrandin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see you\u2019re painting some fine cherry blossoms \u2014 or are they may-flowers?\u201d began the historian of the Fronde, not without hesitation as to the flower, but with a note of confidence in his voice, for he was beginning to forget the incident of the hats\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; they\u2019re apple blossom,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, addressing her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I see you\u2019re a good countrywoman like me; you can tell one flower from another.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy yes, so they are! But I thought the season for apple blossom was over now,\u201d said the historian, seeking wildly to cover his mistake\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh dear, no; far from it, it\u2019s not out yet; the trees won\u2019t be in blossom for another fortnight, not for three weeks perhaps,\u201d said the librarian who, since he helped with the management of Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s estates, was better informed upon country matters\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt least three weeks,\u201d put in the Duchess; \u201ceven round Paris, where they\u2019re very far forward. Down in Normandy, don\u2019t you know, at his father\u2019s place,\u201d she went on, pointing to the young Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault, \u201cwhere they have some splendid apple trees close to the seashore, like a Japanese screen, they\u2019re never really pink until after the twentieth of May.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never see them,\u201d said the young Duke, \u201cbecause they give me hay fever. Such a bore.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHay fever? I never heard of that before,\u201d said the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the fashionable complaint just now,\u201d the librarian informed him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat all depends, you won\u2019t get it at all, probably, if it\u2019s a good year for apples. You know Le Normand\u2019s saying: \u2018When it\u2019s a good year for apples . . . \u2019,\u201d put in M. d\u2019Argencourt who, not being really French, was always trying to give himself a Parisian air\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis told her niece, \u201cthese are from the South. It was a florist who sent them round and asked me to accept them as a present. You\u2019re surprised, I dare say, Monsieur Valm\u00e8re,\u201d she turned to the librarian, \u201cthat a florist should make me a present of apple blossom. Well, I may be an old woman, but I\u2019m not quite on the shelf yet, I have still a few friends,\u201d she went on with a smile that might have been taken as a sign of her simple nature but meant rather, I could not help feeling, that she thought it effective to pride herself on the friendship of a mere florist when she moved in such distinguished circles\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which Mme. de Villeparisis was painting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever mind, Marquise,\u201d said the historian, sitting down again, \u201ceven though we should have another of those Revolutions which have stained so many pages of our history with blood \u2014 and, upon my soul, in these days one can never tell,\u201d he added, with a circular and circumspect glance, as though to make sure that there was no \u2018disaffected\u2019 person in the room, though he had not the least suspicion that there actually was, \u201cwith a talent like yours and your five languages you would be certain to get on all right.\u201d The historian of the Fronde was feeling quite refreshed, for he had forgotten his insomnia. But he suddenly remembered that he had not slept for the last six nights, whereupon a crushing weariness, born of his mind, paralysed his limbs, made him bow his shoulders, and his melancholy face began to droop like an old man\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch tried to express his admiration in an appropriate gesture, but only succeeded in knocking over with his elbow the glass containing the spray of apple blossom, and all the water was spilled on the carpet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally, you have the fingers of a fairy,\u201d went on (to the Marquise) the historian who, having his back turned to me at that moment, had not noticed Bloch\u2019s clumsiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Bloch took this for a sneer at himself, and to cover his shame in insolence retorted: \u201cIt\u2019s not of the slightest importance; I\u2019m not wet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis rang the bell and a footman came to wipe the carpet and pick up the fragments of glass. She invited the two young men to her theatricals, and also Mme. de Guermantes, with the injunction:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRemember to tell Gis\u00e8le and Berthe\u201d (the Duchesses d\u2019Auberjon and de Portefin) \u201cto be here a little before two to help me,\u201d as she might have told the hired waiters to come early to arrange the tables\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She treated her princely relatives, as she treated M. de Norpois, without any of the little courtesies which she shewed to the historian, Cottard, Bloch and myself, and they seemed to have no interest for her beyond the possibility of serving them up as food for our social curiosity. This was because she knew that she need not put herself out to entertain people for whom she was not a more or less brilliant woman but the touchy old sister \u2014 who needed and received tactful handling \u2014 of their father or uncle. There would have been no object in her trying to shine before them, she could never have deceived them as to the strength and weakness of her position, for they knew (none so well) her whole history and respected the illustrious race from which she sprang. But, above all, they had ceased to be anything more for her than a dead stock which would not bear fruit again, they would not let her know their new friends, or share their pleasures. She could obtain from them only their occasional presence, or the possibility of speaking of them, at her five o\u2019clock tea-parties as, later on, in her Memoirs, of which these parties were only a sort of rehearsal, a preliminary reading aloud of the manuscript before a selected audience. And the society which all these noble kinsmen and kinswomen served to interest, to dazzle, to enthral, the society of the Cottards, of the Blochs, of the dramatists who were in the public eye at the moment, of the historians of the Fronde and such matters; it was in this society that there existed for Mme. de Villeparisis \u2014 failing that section of the fashionable world which did not call upon her \u2014 the movement, the novelty, all the entertainment of life, it was from people like these that she was able to derive social benefits (which made it well worth her while to let them meet, now and then, though without ever coming to know her, the Duchesse de Guermantes), dinners with remarkable men whose work had interested her, a light opera or a pantomime staged complete by its author in her drawing-room, boxes for interesting shows. Bloch got up to go. He had said aloud that the incident of the broken flower-glass was of no importance, but what he said to himself was different, more different still what he thought: \u201cIf people can\u2019t train their servants to put flowers where they won\u2019t be knocked over and wet their guests and probably cut their hands, it\u2019s much better not to go in for such luxuries,\u201d he muttered angrily. He was one of those susceptible, highly strung persons who cannot bear to think of themselves as having made a blunder which, though they do not admit even to themselves that they have made it, is enough to spoil their whole day. In a black rage, he was just making up his mind never to go into society again. He had reached the point at which some distraction was imperative. Fortunately in another minute Mme. de Villeparisis was to press him to stay. Either because she was aware of the general feeling among her friends, and had noticed the tide of anti-semitism that was beginning to rise, or simply from carelessness, she had not introduced him to any of the people in the room. He, however, being little used to society, felt bound before leaving the room to take leave of them all, to shew his manners, but without any friendliness; he lowered his head several times, buried his bearded chin in his collar, scrutinised each of the party in turn through his glasses with a cold, dissatisfied glare. But Mme. de Villeparisis stopped him; she had still to discuss with him the little play which was to be performed in her house, and also she did not wish him to leave before he had had the pleasure of meeting M. de Norpois (whose failure to appear puzzled her), although as an inducement to Bloch this introduction was quite superfluous, he having already decided to persuade the two actresses whose names he had mentioned to her to come and sing for nothing in the Marquise\u2019s drawing-room, to enhance their own reputations, at one of those parties to which all that was best and noblest in Europe thronged. He had even offered her, in addition, a tragic actress \u2018with pure eyes, fair as Hera,\u2019 who would recite lyrical prose with a sense of plastic beauty. But On hearing this lady\u2019s name Mme. de Villeparisis had declined, for it was that of Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have better news,\u201d she murmured in my ear. \u201cI really believe he\u2019s quite cooled off now, and that before very long they\u2019ll be parted \u2014 in spite of an officer who has played an abominable part in the whole business,\u201d she added. For Robert\u2019s family were beginning to look with a deadly hatred on M. de Borodino, who had given him leave, at the hairdresser\u2019s instance, to go to Bruges, and accused him of giving countenance to an infamous intrigue. \u201cIt\u2019s really too bad of him,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis with that virtuous accent common to all the Guermantes, even the most depraved. \u201cToo, too bad,\u201d she repeated, giving the word a trio of t\u2019s. One felt that she had no doubt of the Prince\u2019s being present at all their orgies. But, as kindness of heart was the old lady\u2019s dominant quality, her expression of frowning severity towards the horrible captain, whose name she articulated with an ironical emphasis: \u201cThe Prince de Borodino!\u201d\u2014 speaking as a woman for whom the Empire simply did not count, melted into a gentle smile at myself with a mechanical twitch of the eyelid indicating a vague understanding between us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have a great admiration for de Saint-Loup-en-Bray,\u201d said Bloch, \u201cdirty dog as he is, because he\u2019s so extremely well-bred. I have a great admiration, not for him but for well-bred people, they\u2019re so rare,\u201d he went on, without thinking, since he was himself so extremely ill-bred, what offence his words were giving. \u201cI will give you an example which I consider most striking of his perfect breeding. I met him once with a young gentleman just as he was about to spring into his wheeled chariot, after he himself had buckled their splendid harness on a pair of steeds, whose mangers were heaped with oats and barley, who had no need of the flashing whip to urge them on. He introduced us, but I did not catch the gentleman\u2019s name; one never does catch people\u2019s names when one\u2019s introduced to them,\u201d he explained with a laugh, this being one of his father\u2019s witticisms. \u201cDe Saint-Loup-en-Bray was perfectly calm, made no fuss about the young gentleman, seemed absolutely at his ease. Well, I found out, by pure chance, a day or two later, that the young gentleman was the son of Sir Rufus Israels!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The end of this story sounded less shocking than its preface, for it remained quite incomprehensible to everyone in the room. The fact was that Sir Rufus Israels, who seemed to Bloch and his father an almost royal personage before whom Saint-Loup ought to tremble, was in the eyes of the Guermantes world a foreign upstart, tolerated in society, on whose friendship nobody would ever have dreamed of priding himself, far from it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI learned this,\u201d Bloch informed us, \u201cfrom the person who holds Sir Rufus\u2019s power of attorney; he is a friend of my father, and quite an extraordinary man. Oh, an absolutely wonderful individual,\u201d he assured us with that affirmative energy, that note of enthusiasm which one puts only into those convictions that did not originate with oneself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me,\u201d Bloch went on, lowering his voice, to myself, \u201chow much do you suppose Saint-Loup has? Not that it matters to me in the least, you quite understand, don\u2019t you. I\u2019m interested from the Balzacian point of view. You don\u2019t happen to know what it\u2019s in, French stocks, foreign stocks, or land or what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could give him no information whatsoever. Suddenly raising his voice, Bloch asked if he might open the windows, and without waiting for an answer, went across the room to do so. Mme. de Villeparisis protested that he must not, that she had a cold. \u201cOf course, if it\u2019s bad for you!\u201d Bloch was downcast. \u201cBut you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not hot in here.\u201d And breaking into a laugh he put into the gaze with which he swept the room an appeal for support against Mme. de Villeparisis. He received none, from these well-bred people. His blazing eyes, having failed to seduce any of the guests from their allegiance, faded with resignation to their normal gravity of expression; he acknowledged his defeat with: \u201cWhat\u2019s the temperature? Seventy-two, at least, I should say. I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019m simply dripping. And I have not, like the sage Antenor, son of the river Aipheus, the power to plunge myself in the paternal wave to stanch my sweat before laying my body in a bath of polished marble and anointing my limbs with fragrant oils.\u201d And with that need which people feel to outline for the use of others medical theories the application of which would be beneficial to their own health: \u201cWell, if you believe it\u2019s good for you! I must say, I think you\u2019re quite wrong. It\u2019s exactly what gives you your cold.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch was overjoyed at the idea of meeting M. de Norpois. He would like, he told us, to get him to talk about the Dreyfus case. \u201cThere\u2019s a mentality at work there which I don\u2019t altogether understand, and it would be quite sensational to get an interview out of this eminent diplomat,\u201d he said in a tone of sarcasm, so as not to appear to be rating himself below the Ambassador\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis was sorry that he had said this so loud, but minded less when she saw that the librarian, whose strong Nationalist views kept her, so to speak, on leash, was too far off to have overheard. She was more shocked to hear Bloch, led on by that demon of ill-breeding which made him permanently blind to the consequences of what he said, inquiring, with a laugh at the paternal pleasantry: \u201cHaven\u2019t I read a learned treatise by him in which he sets forth a string of irrefutable arguments to prove that the Japanese war was bound to end in a Russian victory and a Japanese defeat? He\u2019s fairly paralytic now, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s the old boy I\u2019ve seen taking aim at his chair before sliding across the room to it, as if he was on wheels.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, no! Not in the least like that! Just wait a minute,\u201d the Marquise went on, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he can be doing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She rang the bell and, when the servant had appeared, as she made no secret, and indeed liked to advertise the fact that her old friend spent the greater part of his time in her house: \u201cGo and tell M. de Norpois to come in\u201d she ordered him, \u201che is sorting some papers in my library; he said he would be twenty minutes, and I\u2019ve been waiting now for an hour and three-quarters. He will tell you about the Dreyfus case, anything you want to know,\u201d she said gruffly to Bloch. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t approve much of the way things are going.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For M. de Norpois was not on good terms with the Government of the day, and Mme. de Villeparisis, although he had never taken the liberty of bringing any actual Ministers to her house (she still preserved all the unapproachable dignity of a great lady, and remained outside and above the political relations which he was obliged to cultivate), was kept well informed by him of everything that went on. Then, too, the politicians of the day would never have dared to ask M. de Norpois to introduce them to Mme. de Villeparisis. But several of them had gone down to see him at her house in the country when they needed his advice or help at critical conjectures. One knew the address. One went to the house. One did not see its mistress. But at dinner that evening she would say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear they\u2019ve been down here bothering you. I trust things are going better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are not in a hurry?\u201d she now asked Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, not at all. I wanted to go because I am not very well; in fact there is some talk of my taking a cure at Vichy for my biliary ducts,\u201d he explained, articulating the last words with a fiendish irony\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, that\u2019s where my nephew Ch\u00e2tellerault\u2019s got to go, you must fix it up together. Is he still in the room? He\u2019s a nice boy, you know,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, and may quite well have meant what she said, feeling that two people whom she knew had no reason not to be friends with each other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I dare say he wouldn\u2019t care about that \u2014 I don\u2019t really know him \u2014 at least I barely know him. He is sitting over there,\u201d stammered Bloch in ecstasy of confusion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The butler could not have delivered his mistress\u2019s message properly, for M. de Norpois, to make believe that he had just come in from the street, and had not yet seen his hostess, had picked up the first hat that he had found in the hall, and came forward to kiss Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s hand with great ceremony, asking after her health with all the interest that people shew after a long separation. He was not aware that the Marquise had already destroyed any semblance of reality in this charade, which she cut short by taking M. de Norpois and Bloch into an adjoining room. Bloch, who had observed all the courtesy that was being shewn to a person whom he had not yet discovered to be M. de Norpois, had said to me, trying to seem at his ease: \u201cWho is that old idiot?\u201d Perhaps, too, all this bowing and scraping by M. de Norpois had really shocked the better element in Bloch\u2019s nature, the freer and more straightforward manners of a younger generation, and he was partly sincere in condemning it as absurd. However that might be, it ceased to appear absurd, and indeed delighted him the moment it was himself, Bloch, to whom the salutations were addressed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMonsieur l\u2019Ambassadeur,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cI should like you to know this gentleman. Monsieur Bloch, Monsieur le Marquis de Norpois.\u201d She made a point, despite her casual usage of M. de Norpois, of addressing him always as \u201cMonsieur l\u2019Ambassadeur,\u201d as a social convention as well as from an exaggerated respect for his Ambassadorial rank, a respect which the Marquis had inculcated in her, and also with an instinctive application to him of the special manner, less familiar and more ceremonious, in relation to one particular man \u2014 which, in the house of a distinguished woman, in contrast to the liberties that she takes with her other guests, marks that man out instantly as her lover\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois drowned his azure gaze in his white beard, bent his tall body deep down as though he were bowing before all the famous and (to him) imposing connotations of the name Bloch, and murmured: \u201cI am delighted . . . \u201d whereat his young listener, moved, but feeling that the illustrious diplomat was going too far, hastened to correct him, saying: \u201cNot at all! On the contrary, it is I who am delighted.\u201d But this ceremony, which M. de Norpois, in his friendship for Mme. de Villeparisis, repeated for the benefit of every fresh person that his old friend introduced to him, did not seem to her adequate to the deserts of Bloch, to whom she said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust ask him anything you want to know; take him into the other room if it\u2019s more convenient; he will be delighted to talk to you. I think you wished to speak to him about the Dreyfus case,\u201d she went on, no more considering whether this would suit M. de Norpois than she would have thought of asking leave of the Duchesse de Montmorency\u2019s portrait before having it lighted up for the historian, or of the tea before pouring it into a cup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou must speak loud,\u201d she warned Bloch, \u201che\u2019s a little deaf, but he will tell you anything you want to know; he knew Bismarck very well, and Cavour. That is so, isn\u2019t it;\u201d she raised her voice, \u201cyou knew Bismarck well?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you got anything on the stocks?\u201d M. de Norpois asked me with a knowing air as he shook my hand warmly. I took the opportunity to relieve him politely of the hat which he had felt obliged to bring ceremonially into the room, for I saw that it was my own which he had inadvertently taken. \u201cYou shewed me a somewhat laboured little thing in which you went in for a good deal of hair-splitting. I gave you my opinion quite frankly; what you had written was literally not worth the trouble of putting it on paper. Are you thinking of letting us have anything else? You were greatly smitten with Bergotte, if I remember rightly.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not to say anything against Bergotte,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cI don\u2019t dispute his talent as a painter; no one would, Duchess. He understands all about etching, if not brush-work on a large scale like M. Cherbuliez. But it seems to me that in these days we have a tendency to confuse the arts, and forget that the novelist\u2019s business is rather to weave a plot and edify his readers than to fiddle away at producing a frontispiece or tailpiece in drypoint. I shall be seeing your father on Sunday at our good friend A. J.\u2018s,\u201d he went on, turning again to myself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had hoped for a moment, when I saw him talking to Mme. de Guermantes, that he would perhaps afford me, for getting myself asked to her house, the help he had refused me for getting to Mme. Swann\u2019s. \u201cAnother of my great favourites,\u201d I told him, \u201cis Elstir. It seems the Duchesse de Guermantes has some wonderful examples of his work, particularly that admirable Bunch of Radishes which I remember at the Exhibition and should so much like to see again; what a masterpiece that is!\u201d And indeed, if I had been a prominent person and had been asked to state what picture I liked best, I should have named this Bunch of Radishes. \u201cA masterpiece?\u201d cried M. de Norpois with a surprised and reproachful air. \u201cIt makes no pretence of being even a picture, it is merely a sketch.\u201d (He was right.) \u201cIf you label a clever little thing of that sort \u2018masterpiece,\u2019 what have you got to say about H\u00e9bert\u2019s Virgin or Dagnan-Bouveret?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI heard you refusing to let him bring Robert\u2019s woman,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt, after Bloch had taken the Ambassador aside. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll miss much, she\u2019s a perfect horror, as you know, without a vestige of talent, and besides she\u2019s grotesquely ugly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you mean to say, you know her, Duchess?\u201d asked M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, didn\u2019t you know that she performed in my house before the whole of Paris, not that that\u2019s anything for me to be proud of,\u201d explained Mme. de Guermantes with a laugh, glad nevertheless, since the actress was under discussion, to let it be known that she herself had had the first fruits of her foolishness. \u201cHallo, I suppose I ought to be going now,\u201d she added, without moving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had just seen her husband enter the room, and these words were an allusion to the absurdity of their appearing to be paying a call together, like a newly married couple, rather than to the often strained relations that existed between her and the enormous fellow she had married, who, despite his increasing years, still led the life of a gay bachelor. Ranging over the considerable party that was gathered round the tea-table the genial, cynical gaze \u2014 dazzled a little by the brightness of the setting sun \u2014 of the little round pupils lodged in the exact centre of his eyes, like the \u2018bulls\u2019 which \u2018the excellent marksman that he was could always hit with such perfect aim and precision, the Duke came forward with a bewildered cautious slowness as though, alarmed by so brilliant a gathering, he was afraid of treading on ladies\u2019 skirts and interrupting conversations. A permanent smile \u2014 suggesting a \u2018Good King of Yvetot\u2019\u2014 slightly pompous, a half-open hand floating like a shark\u2019s fin by his side, which he allowed to be vaguely clasped by his old friends and by the strangers who were introduced to him, enabled him, without his having to make a single movement, or to interrupt his genial, lazy, royal progress, to reward the assiduity of them all by simply murmuring: \u201cHow do, my boy; how do, my dear friend; charmed, Monsieur Bloch; how do, Argencourt;\u201d and, on coming to myself, who was the most highly favoured, when he had been told my name: \u201cHow do, my young neighbour, how\u2019s your father? What a splendid fellow he is!\u201d He made no great demonstration except to Mme. de Villeparisis, who gave him good-day with a nod of her head, drawing one hand from a pocket of her little apron\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being formidably rich in a world where everyone was steadily growing poorer, and having secured the permanent attachment to his person of the idea of this enormous fortune, he displayed all the vanity of the great nobleman reinforced by that of the man of means, the refinement and breeding of the former just managing to control the latter\u2019s self-sufficiency. One could understand, moreover, that his success with women, which made his wife so unhappy, was not due merely to his name and fortune, for he was still extremely good looking, and his profile retained the purity, the firmness of outline of a Greek god\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you mean to tell me she performed in your house?\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt asked the Duchess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, don\u2019t you see, she came to recite, with a bunch of lilies in her hand, and more lilies on her dress.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes shared her aunt\u2019s affectation of pronouncing certain words in an exceedingly rustic fashion, but never rolled her r\u2019s like Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before M. de Norpois, under constraint from his hostess, had taken Bloch into the little recess where they could talk more freely, I went up to the old diplomat for a moment and put in a word about my father\u2019s Academic chair. He tried first of all to postpone the conversation to another day. I pointed out that I was going to Balbec. \u201cWhat? Going again to Balbec? Why, you\u2019re a regular globe-trotter.\u201d He listened to what I had to say. At the name of Leroy-Beaulieu, he looked at me suspiciously. I conjectured that he had perhaps said something disparaging to M. Leroy-Beaulieu about my father and was afraid of the economist\u2019s having repeated it to him. All at once he seemed animated by a positive affection for my father. And after one of those opening hesitations out of which suddenly a word explodes as though in spite of the speaker, whose irresistible conviction prevails over his half-hearted efforts at silence: \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said to me with emotion, \u201cyour father must not stand. In his own interest he must not; it is not fair to himself; he owes a certain respect to his own really great merits, which would be compromised by such an adventure. He is too big a man for that. If he should be elected, he will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. He is not an orator, thank heaven. And that is the one thing that counts with my dear colleagues, even if you only talk platitudes. Your father has an important goal in life; he should march straight ahead towards it, and not allow himself to turn aside to beat bushes, even the bushes (more thorny for that matter than flowery) of the grove of Academe. Besides, he would not get many votes. The Academy likes to keep a postulant waiting for some time before taking him to its bosom. For the present, there is nothing to be done. Later on, I don\u2019t say. But he must wait until the Society itself comes in quest of him. It makes a practice; not a very fortunate practice, a fetish rather, of the far\u00e0 da s\u00e8 of our friends across the Alps. Leroy-Beaulieu spoke to me about all this in a way I did not at all like. I pointed out to him, a little sharply perhaps, that a man accustomed as he is to dealing with colonial imports and metals could not be expected to understand the part played by the imponderables, as Bismarck used to say. But, whatever happens, your father must on no account put himself forward as a candidate, Principis obsta. His friends would find themselves placed in a delicate position if he suddenly called upon them for their votes. Indeed,\u201d he broke forth, with an air of candour, fixing his blue eyes on my face, \u201cI am going to say a thing that you will be surprised to hear coming from me, who am so fond of your father. Well, simply because I am fond of him (we are known as the inseparables \u2014Arcades ambo), simply because I know the immense service that he can still render to his country, the reefs from which he can steer her if he remains at the helm; out of affection, out of high regard for him, out of patriotism, I should not vote for him. I fancy, moreover, that I have given him to understand that I should not.\u201d (I seemed to discern in his eyes the stern Assyrian profile of Leroy-Beaulieu.) \u201cSo that to give him my vote now would be a sort of recantation on my part.\u201d M. de Norpois repeatedly dismissed his brpther Academicians as old fossils. Other reasons apart, every member of a club or academy likes to ascribe to his fellow members the type of character that is the direct converse of his own, less for the advantage of being able to say: \u201cAh! If it only rested with me!\u201d than for the satisfaction of making the election which he himself has managed to secure seem more difficult, a greater distinction. \u201cI may tell you,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthat in the best interests of you all, I should prefer to see your father triumphantly elected in ten or fifteen years\u2019 time.\u201d Words which I assumed to have been dictated if not by jealousy, at any rate by an utter lack of any willingness to oblige, and which later on I was to recall when the course of events had given them a different meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou haven\u2019t thought of giving the Institute an address on the price of bread during the Fronde, I suppose,\u201d the historian of that movement timidly inquired of M. de Norpois. \u201cYou could make a considerable success of a subject like that,\u201d (which was to say, \u201cyou would give me a colossal advertisement,\u201d) he added, smiling at the Ambassador pusillanimously, but with a warmth of feeling which made him raise his eyelids and expose a double horizon of eye. I seemed to have seen this look before, and yet I had met the historian for the first time this afternoon. Suddenly I remembered having seen the same expression in the eyes of a Brazilian doctor who claimed to be able to cure choking fits of the kind from which I suffered by some absurd inhalation of the essential oils of plants. When, in the hope that he would pay more attention to my case, I had told him that I knew Professor Cottard, he had replied, as though speaking in Cotterd\u2019s interest: \u201cNow this treatment of mine, if you were to tell him about it, would give him the material for a most sensational paper for the Academy of Medicine!\u201d He had not ventured to press the matter but had stood gazing at me with the same air of interrogation, timid, anxious, appealing, which it had just puzzled me to see on the face of the historian of the Fronde. Obviously the two men were not acquainted and had little nothing in common, but psychological like physical laws have a more or less general application. And the requisite conditions are the same; an identical expression lights the eyes of different human animals, as a single sunrise lights different places, a long way apart, which have no connexion with one another. I did not hear the Ambassador\u2019s reply, for the whole party, with a good deal of noise, had again gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her at work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know who\u2019 we\u2019re talking about, Basin?\u201d the Duchess asked her husband\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can make a pretty good guess,\u201d said the Duke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! As an actress she\u2019s not, I\u2019m afraid, in what one would call the great tradition.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes to M. d\u2019Argencourt \u201canything more ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn fact, it was drolatic,\u201d put in M. de Guermantes, whose odd vocabulary enabled people in society to declare that he was no fool and literary people, at the same time, to regard him as a complete imbecile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I fail to understand,\u201d resumed the Duchess, \u201cis how in the world Robert ever came to fall in love with her. Oh, of course I know one mustn\u2019t discuss that sort of thing,\u201d she added, with the charming pout of a philosopher and sentimentalist whose last illusion had long been shattered. \u201cI know that anybody may fall in love with anybody else. And,\u201d she went on, for, though she might still laugh at modern literature, it, either by its dissemination through the popular press or else in the course of conversation, had begun to percolate into her mind, \u201cthat is the really nice thing about love, because it\u2019s what makes it so \u2018mysterious.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMysterious! Oh, I must confess, cousin, that\u2019s a bit beyond me,\u201d said the Comte d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh dear, yes, it\u2019s a very mysterious thing, love,\u201d declared the Duchess, with the sweet smile of a good-natured woman of the world, but also with the rooted conviction with which a Wagnerian assures a bored gentleman from the Club that there is something more than just noise in the Walk\u00fcre. \u201cAfter all, one never does know what makes one person fall in love with another; it may not be at all what we think,\u201d she added with a smile, repudiating at once by this interpretation the idea she had just suggested. \u201cAfter all, one never knows anything, does one?\u201d she concluded with an air of weary scepticism. \u201cBesides, one understands, doesn\u2019t one; one simply can\u2019t explain other people\u2019s choices in love.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to abandon it and to criticise Saint-Loup\u2019s choice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll the same, don\u2019t you know, it is amazing to me that a man can find any attraction in a person who\u2019s simply silly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch, hearing Saint-Loup\u2019s name mentioned and gathering that he was in Paris, promptly made a remark about him so outrageous that everybody was shocked. He was beginning to nourish hatreds, and one felt that he would stop at nothing to gratify them. Once he had established the principle that he himself was of great moral worth and that the sort of people who frequented La Boulie (an athletic club which he supposed to be highly fashionable) deserved penal servitude, every blow he could get against them seemed to him praiseworthy. He went so far once as to speak of a lawsuit which he was anxious to bring against one of his La poulie friends. In the course of the trial he proposed to give certain evidence which would be entirely untrue, though the defendant would be unable to impugn his veracity. In this way Bloch (who, incidentally, never put his plan into action) counted on baffling and infuriating his antagonist. What harm could there be in that, since he whom he sought to injure was a man who thought only of doing the \u2018right thing,\u2019 a La Boulie man, and against people like that any weapon was justified, especially in the hands of a Saint, such as Bloch himself?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, though, what about Swann?\u201d objected M. d\u2019Argencourt, who having at last succeeded in understanding the point of his cousin\u2019s speech, was impressed by her accuracy of observation, and was racking his brains for instances of men who had fallen in love with women in whom he himself had seen no attraction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but Swann\u2019s case was quite different,\u201d the Duchess protested. \u201cIt was a great surprise, I admit, because she\u2019s just a well-meaning idiot, but she was never silly, and she was at one time good looking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, oh!\u201d muttered Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou never thought so? Surely, she had some charming points, very fine eyes, good hair, she used to dress, and does still dress, wonderfully. Nowadays, I quite agree, she\u2019s horrible, but she has been a lovely woman in her time. Not that that made me any less sorry when Charles married her, because it was so unnecessary.\u201d The Duchess had not intended to say anything out of the common, but as M. d\u2019Argencourt began to laugh she repeated these last words \u2014 either because she thought them amusing or because she thought it nice of him to laugh \u2014 and looked up at him with a coaxing smile, to add the enchantment of her femininity to that of her wit. She went on: \u201cYes, really, it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble, was it; still, after all, she did have some charm and I can quite understand anybody\u2019s falling in love with her, but if you saw Robert\u2019s girl, I assure you, you\u2019d simply die of laughter. Oh, I know somebody\u2019s going to quote Augier at me: \u2018What matters the bottle so long as one gets drunk?\u2019 Well, Robert may have got drunk, all right, but he certaintly hasn\u2019t shewn much taste in his choice of a bottle! First of all, would you believe that she actually expected me to fit up a staircase right in the middle of my drawing-room. Oh, a mere nothing \u2014 what? \u2014 and she announced that she was going to lie flat on her stomach on the steps. And then, if you\u2019d heard the things she recited, I only remember one scene, but I\u2019m sure nobody could imagine anything like it; it was called the Seven Princesses.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSeven Princesses! Dear, dear, what a snob she must be!\u201d cried M. d\u2019Argencourt. \u201cBut, wait a minute, why, I know the whole play. The author sent a copy to the King, who couldn\u2019t understand a word of it and called on me to explain it to him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt isn\u2019t by any chance, from the Sar Peladan?\u201d asked the historian of the Fronde, meaning to make a subtle and topical allusion, but in so low a tone that his question passed unnoticed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you know the Seven Princesses, do you?\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cI congratulate you! I only know one, but she\u2019s quite enough; I have no wish to make the acquaintance of the other six. If they are all like the one I\u2019ve seen!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a goose!\u201d I thought to myself. Irritated by the coldness of her greeting, I found a sort of bitter satisfaction in this proof of her complete inability to understand Maeterlinck. \u201cTo think that\u2019s the woman I walk miles every morning to see. Really, I\u2019m too kind. Well, it\u2019s my turn now not to want to see her.\u201d Thus I reasoned with myself; but my words ran counter to my thoughts; they were purely conversational words such as we say to ourselves at those moments when, too much excited to remain quietly alone, we feel the need, for want of another listener, to talk to ourselves, without meaning what we say, as we talk to a stranger\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it was like,\u201d the Duchess went on; \u201cyou simply couldn\u2019t help laughing. Not that anyone tried; rather the other way, I\u2019m sorry to say, for the young person was not at all pleased and Robert has never really forgiven me. Though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry, actually, because if it had been a success the lady would perhaps have come again, and I don\u2019t quite see Marie-Aynard approving of that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was the name given in the family to Robert\u2019s mother, Mme. de Marsantes, the widow of Aynard de Saint-Loup, to distinguish her from her cousin, the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, also a Marie, to whose Christian name her nephews and cousins and brothers-in-law added, to avoid confusion, either that of her husband or another of her own, making her Marie-Gilbert or Marie-Hedwige\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo begin with, there was a sort of rehearsal the night before, which was a wonderful affair!\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes in ironical pursuit of her theme. \u201cJust imagine, she uttered a sentence, no, not so much, not a quarter of a sentence, and then she stopped; she didn\u2019t open her mouth \u2014 I\u2019m not exaggerating \u2014 for a good five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I say,\u201d cried M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith the utmost politeness I took the liberty of hinting to her that this might seem a little unusual. And she said \u2014 I give you her actual words \u2014\u2018One ought always to repeat a thing as though one were just composing it oneself.\u2019 When you think of it, that really is monumental.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I understood she wasn\u2019t at all bad at reciting poetry,\u201d said one of the two young men\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe hasn\u2019t the ghost of a notion what poetry is,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t need to listen to her to tell that. It was quite enough to see her come in with her lilies. I knew at once that she couldn\u2019t have any talent when I saw those lilies!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everybody laughed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope, my dear aunt, you aren\u2019t angry with me, over my little joke the other day about the Queen of Sweden. I\u2019ve come to ask your forgiveness.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not at all angry, I even give you leave to eat at my table, if you\u2019re hungry. \u2014 Come along, M. Valm\u00e8re, you\u2019re the daughter of the house,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis went on to the librarian, repeating a time-honoured pleasantry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M de Guermantes sat upright in the armchair in which he had come to anchor his hat on the carpet by his side, and examined with a satisfied smile the plate of little cakes that was being held out to him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis gentleman makes you an admirable daughter,\u201d commented M. d\u2019Argencourt, whom the spirit of imitation prompted to keep Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s little joke in circulation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of the Fronde\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou perform your functions admirably,\u201d said the latter, startled into speech, and hoping also to win the sympathy of the crowd. At the same time he cast a covert glance of connivance at those who had anticipated him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me, my dear aunt,\u201d M. de Guermantes inquired of Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cwho was that rather good-looking man who was going out just now as I came in? I must know him, because he gave me a sweeping bow, but I couldn\u2019t place him at all; you know I never can remember names, it\u2019s such a nuisance,\u201d he added, in a tone of satisfaction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM. Legrandin.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but Oriane has a cousin whose mother, if I\u2019m not mistaken, was a Grandin. Yes, I remember quite well, she was a Grandin de l\u2019Epervier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cno relation at all. These are plain Grandins. Grandins of nothing at all. But they\u2019d be only too glad to be Grandins of anything you chose to name. This one has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, Basin, you know quite well who\u2019 my aunt means,\u201d cried the Duchess indignantly. \u201cHe\u2019s the brother of that great graminivorous creature you had the weird idea of sending to call on me the other day. She stayed a solid hour; I thought I should go mad. But I began by thinking it was she who was mad when I saw a person I didn\u2019t know come browsing into the room looking exactly like a cow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, Oriane; she asked me what afternoon you were at home; I couldn\u2019t very well be rude to her; and besides, you do exaggerate so, she\u2019s not in the least like a cow,\u201d he added in a plaintive tone, though not without a quick smiling glance at the audience\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He knew that his wife\u2019s lively wit needed the stimulus of contradiction, the contradiction of common sense which protests that one cannot (for instance) mistake a woman seriously for a cow; by this process Mme. de Guermantes, enlarging upon her original idea, had been inspired to produce many of her most brilliant sayings. And the Duke in his innocent fashion helped her, without seeming to do so, to bring off her effects like, in a railway carriage, the unacknowledged partner of the three-card player\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI admit she doesn\u2019t look like a cow, she looks like a dozen,\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cI assure you, I didn\u2019t know what to do when I saw a herd of cattle come marching into my drawing-room in a hat and heard them ask me how I was. I had half a mind to say: \u2018Please, herd of cattle, you must be making a mistake, you can\u2019t possibly know me, because you\u2019re a herd of cattle,\u2019 but after racking my brains over her I came to the conclusion that your Cambremer woman must be the Infanta Dorothea who had said she was coming to see me one day, and is rather bovine also, so that I was just on the point of saying: \u2018Your Royal Highness\u2019 and using the third person to a herd of cattle. The cut of her dewlap reminded me rather, too, of the Queen of Sweden. But this massed attack had been prepared for by long range artillery fire, according to all the rules of war. For I don\u2019t know how long before, I was bombarded with her cards; I used to find them lying about all over the house, on all the tables and chairs like prospectuses. I couldn\u2019t think what they were supposed to be advertising. You saw nothing in the house but \u2018Marquis et Marquise de Cambremer\u2019 with some address or other which I\u2019ve forgotten; you may be quite sure nothing will ever take me there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut it\u2019s a great distinction to look like a Queen,\u201d said the historian of the Fronde\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGad, sir, Kings and Queens, in these days, don\u2019t amount to much,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, partly because he liked to be thought broad-minded and modern, and also so as not to seem to attach any importance to his own royal friendships, which he valued highly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch and M. de Norpois had returned from the other room and came towards us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, sir,\u201d asked Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201chave you been talking to him about the Dreyfus case?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois raised his eyes to the ceiling, but with a smile, as though calling on heaven to witness the monstrosity of the caprices to which his Dulcinea compelled him to submit. Nevertheless he spoke to Bloch with great affability of the terrible, perhaps fatal period through which France was passing. As this presumably meant that M. de Norpois (to whom Bloch had confessed his belief in the innocence of Dreyfus) was an ardent anti-Dreyfusard, the Ambassador\u2019s geniality, his air of tacit admission that his listener was in the right, of never doubting that they were both of the same opinion, of being prepared to join forces with him to overthrow the Government, flattered Bloch\u2019s vanity and aroused his curiosity. What were the important points which M. de Norpois never specified but on which he seemed implicitly to affirm that he was in agreement with Bloch; what opinion, then, did he hold of the case, that could bring them together? Bloch was all the more astonished at the mysterious unanimity which seemed to exist between him and M. de Norpois, in that it was not confined to politics, Mme. de Villeparisis having spoken at some length to M. de Norpois of Bloch\u2019s literary work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are not of your age,\u201d the former Ambassador told him, \u201cand I congratulate you upon that. You are not of this age in which disinterested work no longer exists, in which writers offer the public nothing but obscenities or ineptitudes. Efforts such as yours ought to be encouraged, and would be, if we had a Government.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch was flattered by this picture of himself swimming alone amid a universal shipwreck. But here again he would have been glad of details, would have liked to know what were the ineptitudes to which M. de Norpois referred. Bloch had the feeling that he was working along the same lines as plenty of others; he had never supposed himself to be so exceptional. He returned to the Dreyfus case, but did not succeed in elucidating M. de Norpois\u2019s own views. He tried to induce him to speak of the officers whose names were appearing constantly in the newspapers at that time; they aroused more curiosity than the politicians who were involved also, because they were not, like the politicians, well known already, but, wearing a special garb, emerging from the obscurity of a different kind of life and a religiously guarded silence, simply stood up and spoke and disappeared again, like Lohengrin landing from a skiff drawn by a swan. Bloch had been able, thanks to a Nationalist lawyer of his acquaintance, to secure admission to several hearings of the Zola trial. He would arrive there in the morning and stay until the court rose, with a packet of sandwiches and a flask of coffee, as though for the final examination for a degree, and this change of routine stimulating a nervous excitement which the coffee and the emotional interest of the trial worked up to a climax, he would come out so enamoured of everything that had happened in court that, in the evening, as he sat at home, he would long to immerse himself again in that beautiful dream and would hurry out, to a restaurant frequented by both parties, in search of friends with whom he would go over interminably the whole of the day\u2019s proceedings, and make up, by a supper ordered in an imperious tone which gave him the illusion of power, for the hunger and exhaustion of a day begun so early and unbroken by any interval for luncheon. The human mind, hovering perpetually between the two planes of experience and imagination, seeks to fathom the ideal life of the people it knows and to know the people whose life it has had to imagine. To Bloch\u2019s questions M. de Norpois replied:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are two officers involved in the case now being tried of whom I remember hearing some time ago from a man in whose judgment I felt great confidence, and who praised them both highly \u2014 I mean M. de Miribel. They are Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and Lieutenant-Colonel Picquart.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut,\u201d exclaimed Bloch, \u201cthe divine Athena, daughter of Zeus, has put in the mind of one the opposite of what is in the mind of the other. And they are fighting against one another like two lions. Colonel Picquart had a splendid position in the Army, but his Moira has led him to the side that was not rightly his. The sword of the Nationalists will carve his tender flesh, and he will be cast out as food for the beasts of prey and the birds that wax fat upon the bodies of men.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois made no reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are those two palavering about over there?\u201d M. de Guermantes asked Mme. de Villeparisis, indicating M. de Norpois and Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Dreyfus case.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe devil they are. By the way, do you know who is a red-hot supporter of Dreyfus? I give you a thousand guesses. My nephew Robert! I can tell you that, at the Jockey, when they heard of his goings on, there was a fine gathering of the clans, a regular hue and cry. And as he\u2019s coming up for election next week . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course,\u201d broke in the Duchess, \u201cif they\u2019re all like Gilbert, who keeps on saying that all the Jews ought to be sent back to Jerusalem.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed; then the Prince de Guermantes is quite of my way of thinking,\u201d put in M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duke made a show of his wife, but did not love her. Extremely self-centred, he hated to be interrupted, besides he was in the habit, at home of treating her brutally. Convulsed with the twofold rage of a bad husband when his wife speaks to him, and a good talker wher he is not listened to, he stopped short and transfixed the Duchess with a glare which made everyone feel uncomfortable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat makes you think we want to hear about Gilbert and Jerusalem? It\u2019s nothing to do with that. But,\u201d he went on in a gentler tone, \u201cyou will agree that if one of our family were to be pilled at the Jockey, especially Robert, whose father was chairman for ten years, it would be a pretty serious matter. What can you expect, my dear, it\u2019s got \u2019em on the raw, those fellows; they\u2019re all over it. I don\u2019t blame them, either; personally, you know that I have no racial prejudice, all that sort of thing seems to me out of date, and I do claim to move with the times; but damn it all, when one goes by the name of \u2018Marquis de Saint-Loup\u2019 one isn\u2019t a Dreyfusard; what more can I say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes uttered the words: \u201cWhen one goes by the name of Marquis de Saint-Loup,\u201d with some emphasis. He knew very well that it was a far greater thing to go by that of Duc de Guermantes. But if his self-esteem had a tendency to exaggerate if anything the superiority of the title Duc de Guermantes over all others, it was perhaps not so much the rules of good taste as the laws of imagination that urged him thus to attenuate it. Each of us sees in the brightest colours what he sees at a distance, what he sees in other people. For the general laws which govern perspective in imagination apply just as much to dukes as to ordinary mortals. And not only the laws of imagination, but those of speech. Now, either of two laws of speech may apply here, one being that which makes us express ourselves like others of our mental category and not of our caste. Under this law M. de Guermantes might be, in his choice of expressions, even when he wished to talk about the nobility, indebted to the humblest little tradesman, who would have said: \u201cWhen one goes by the name of Duc de Guermantes,\u201d whereas an educated man, a Swann, a Legrandin would not have said it. A duke may write novels worthy of a grocer, even about life in high society, titles and pedigrees being of no help to him there, and the epithet \u2018aristocratic\u2019 be earned by the writings of a plebeian. Who had been, in this instance, the inferior from whom M. de Guermantes had picked up \u2018when one goes by the name,\u2019 he had probably not the least idea. But another law of speech is that, from time to time, as there appear and then vanish diseases of which nothing more is ever heard, there come into being, no one knows how, spontaneously perhaps or by an accident like that which introduced into France a certain weed from America, the seeds of which, caught in the wool of a travelling rug, fell on a railway embankment, forms of speech which one hears in the same decade on the lips of people who have not in any way combined together to use them. So, just as in a certain year I heard Bloch say, referring to himself, that \u201cthe most charming people, the most brilliant, the best known, the most exclusive had discovered that there was only one man in Paris whom they felt to be intelligent, pleasant, whom they could not do without \u2014 namely Bloch,\u201d and heard the same phrase used by countless other young men who did not know him and varied it only by substituting their own names for his, so I was often to hear this \u2018when one goes by the name.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat can one expect,\u201d the Duke went on, \u201cwith the influence he\u2019s come under; it\u2019s easy to understand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill it is rather comic,\u201d suggested the Duchess, \u201cwhen you think of his mother\u2019s attitude, how she bores us to tears with her Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, morning, noon and night.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, but there\u2019s not only his mother to be thought of, you can\u2019t humbug us like that. There\u2019s a damsel, too, a fly-by-night of the worst type; she has far more influence over him than his mother, and she happens to be a compatriot of Master Dreyfus. She has passed on her state of mind to Robert.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may not have heard, Duke, that there is a new word to describe that sort of mind,\u201d said the librarian, who was Secretary to the Anti-revisionist Committee. \u201cThey say \u2018mentality.\u2019 It means exactly the same thing, but it has this advantage that nobody knows what you\u2019re talking about. It is the very latest expression just now, the \u2018last word\u2019 as people say.\u201d Meanwhile, having heard Bloch\u2019s name, he was watching him question M. de Norpois with misgivings which aroused others as strong though of a different order in the Marquise. Trembling before the librarian, and always acting the anti-Dreyfusard in his presence, she dreaded what he would say were he to find out that she had asked to her house a Jew more or less affiliated to the \u2018Syndicate.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d said the Duke, \u201c\u2018mentality,\u2019 you say; I must make a note of that; I shall use it some day.\u201d This was no figure of speech, the Duke having a little pocketbook filled with such \u2018references\u2019 which he used to consult before dinner-parties. \u201cI like \u2018mentality.\u2019 There are a lot of new words like that which people suddenly start using, but they never last. I read somewhere the other day that some writer was \u2018talentuous.\u2019 You may perhaps know what it means; I don\u2019t. And since then I\u2019ve never come across the word again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut \u2018mentality\u2019 is more widely used than \u2018talentuous,\u2019\u201d the historian of the Fronde made his way into the conversation. \u201cI am on a Committee at the Ministry of Education at which I have heard it used several times, as well as at my Club, the Volney, and indeed at dinner at M. Emile Ollivier\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI, who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,\u201d replied the Duke with a feigned humility but with a vanity so intense that his lips could not refrain from curving in a smile, nor his eyes from casting round his audience a glance sparkling with joy, the ironical scorn in which made the poor historian blush, \u201cI who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,\u201d he repeated, relishing the sound of his words, \u201cnor to the Volney Club (my only clubs are the Union and the Jockey \u2014 you aren\u2019t in the Jockey, I think, sir?\u201d he asked the historian, who, blushing a still deeper red, scenting an insult and failing to understand it, began to tremble in every limb), \u201cI, who am not even invited to dine with M. Emile Ollivier, I must confess that I had never heard \u2018mentality.\u2019 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re in the same boat, Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d he went on, \u201cwhy they can\u2019t produce the proofs of Dreyfus\u2019s guilt. Apparently it\u2019s because the War Minister\u2019s wife was his mistress, that\u2019s what people are saying.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I thought it was the Prime Minister\u2019s wife,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think you\u2019re all equally tiresome about this wretched case,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, in the social sphere, was always anxious to shew that she did not allow herself to be led by anyone. \u201cIt can\u2019t make any difference to me, so far as the Jews are concerned, for the simple reason that I don\u2019t know any of them, and I intend to remain in that state of blissful ignorance. But on the other hand I do think it perfectly intolerable that just because they\u2019re supposed to hold \u2018sound\u2019 views and don\u2019t deal with Jewish tradesmen, or have \u2018Down with the Jews\u2019 printed on their sunshades, we should have a swarm of Durands and Dubois and so forth, women we should never have known but for this business, forced down our throats by Marie-Aynard or Victurnienne. I went to see Marie-Aynard a couple of days ago. It used to be so nice there. Nowadays one finds all the people one has spent one\u2019s life trying to avoid, on the pretext that they\u2019re against Dreyfus, and others of whom you have no idea who they can be.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; it was the War Minister\u2019s wife; at least, that\u2019s the bedside rumour,\u201d went on the Duke, who liked to flavour his conversation with certain expressions which he imagined to be of the old school. \u201cPersonally, of course, as everyone knows, I take just the opposite view to my cousin Gilbert. I am not feudal like him. I would go about with a Negro if he was a friend of mine, and I shouldn\u2019t care two straws what anybody thought; still after all you will agree with me that when one goes by the name of Saint-Loup one doesn\u2019t amuse oneself by running clean against the rails of public opinion, which has more sense than Voltaire or even my nephew. Nor does one go in for what I may be allowed to call these acrobatics of conscience a week before one comes up for a club. It is a bit stiff, really! No, it is probably that little wench of his that has put him on his high horse. I expect she told him that he would be classed among the \u2018intellectuals.\u2019 The intellectuals, they\u2019re the very cream of those gentry. It\u2019s given rise, by the way, to a rather amusing pun, though a very naughty one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the Duke murmured, lowering his voice, for his wife\u2019s and M. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s benefit, \u201cMater Semita,\u201d which had already made its way into the Jockey Club, for, of all the flying seeds in the world, that to which are attached the most solid wings, enabling it to be disseminated at the greatest distance from its parent branch, is still a joke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe might ask this gentleman, who has a nerudite air, to explain it to us,\u201d he went on, indicating the historian. \u201cBut it is better not to repeat it, especially as there\u2019s not a vestige of truth in the suggestion. I am not so ambitious as my cousin Mirepoix, who claims that she can trace the descent of her family before Christ to the Tribe of Levi, and I will undertake to prove that there has never been a drop of Jewish blood in our family. Still there is no good in our shutting our eyes to the fact, you may be sure that my dear nephew\u2019s highly original views are liable to make a considerable stir at Landerneau. Especially as Fezensac is ill just now, and Duras will be running the election; you know how he likes to make nuisances,\u201d concluded the Duke, who had never succeeded in learning the exact meaning of certain phrases, and supposed \u2018making nuisances\u2019 to mean \u2018making difficulties.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch tried to pin M. de Norpois down on Colonel Picquart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere can be no two opinions;\u201d replied M. de Norpois, \u201chis evidence had to be taken. I am well aware that, by maintaining this attitude, I have drawn screams of protest from more than one of my colleagues, but to my mind the Government were bound to let the Colonel speak. One can\u2019t dance lightly out of a blind alley like that, or if one does there\u2019s always the risk of falling into a ditch. As for the officer himself, his statement gave one, at the first hearing, a most excellent impression. When one saw him, looking so well in that smart Chasseur uniform, come into court and relate in a perfectly simple and frank tone what he had seen and what he had deduced, and say: \u2018On my honour as a soldier\u2019\u201d (here M. de Norpois\u2019s voice shook with a faint patriotic throb) \u201c\u2018such is my conviction,\u2019 it is impossible to deny that the impression he made was profound.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere; he is a Dreyfusard, there\u2019s not the least doubt of it,\u201d thought Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut where he entirely forfeited all the sympathy that he had managed to attract was when he was confronted with the registrar, Gribelin. When one heard that old public servant, a man who had only one answer to make,\u201d (here M. de Norpois began to accentuate his words with the energy of his sincere convictions) \u201cwhen one listened to him, when one saw him look his superior officer in the face, not afraid to hold his head up to him, and say to him in a tone that admitted of no response: \u2018Colonel, sir, you know very well that I have never told a lie, you know that at this moment, as always, I am speaking the truth,\u2019 the wind changed; M. Picquart might move heaven and earth at the subsequent hearings; he made a complete fiasco.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; evidently he\u2019s an anti-Dreyfusard; it\u2019s quite obvious,\u201d said Bloch to himself. \u201cBut if he considers Picquart a traitor and a liar, how can he take his revelations seriously, and quote them as if he found them charming and believed them to be sincere. And if, on the other hand, he sees in him an honest man easing his conscience, how can he suppose him to have been lying when he was confronted with Gribelin?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn any case, if this man Dreyfus is innocent,\u201d the Duchess broke in, \u201che hasn\u2019t done much to prove it. What idiotic, raving letters he writes from that island. I don\u2019t know whether M. Esterhazy is any better, but he does shew some skill in his choice of words, a different tone altogether. That can\u2019t be very pleasant for the supporters of M. Dreyfus. What a pity for them there\u2019s no way of exchanging innocents.\u201d Everybody laughed. \u201cYou heard what Oriane said?\u201d the Duc de Guermantes inquired eagerly of e. de Villeparisis. \u201cYes; I think it most amusing.\u201d This was not enough for the Duke. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t say that I thought it amusing; or rather it doesn\u2019t make the slightest difference to me whether a thing is amusing or not. I don\u2019t care about wit.\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt protested. \u201cIt is probably because I\u2019ve been a Member of Parliament, where I have listened to brilliant speeches that meant absolutely nothing. I learned there to value, more than anything, logic. That\u2019s probably why they didn\u2019t elect me again. Amusing things leave me cold.\u201d \u201cBasin, don\u2019t play the heavy father like that, my child, you know quite well that no one admires wit more than you do.\u201d \u201cPlease let me finish. It is just because I am unmoved by a certain type of humour, that I am often struck by my wife\u2019s wit. For you will find it based, as a rule, upon sound observation. She reasons like a man; she states her case like a writer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly the explanation of M. de Norpois\u2019s speaking in this way to Bloch, as though they had been in agreement, may have lain in the fact that he himself was so keen an anti-Dreyfusard that, finding the Government not anti-Dreyfusard enough, he was its enemy just as much as the Dreyfusards. Perhaps because the object to which he devoted himself in politics was something more profound, situated on another plane, from which Dreyfusism appeared as an unimportant modality which did not deserve the attention of a patriot interested in large questions of foreign policy. Perhaps, rather, because the maxims of his political wisdom being applicable only to questions of form, of procedure, of expediency, they were as powerless to solve questions of fact as in philosophy pure logic is powerless to tackle the problems of existence; or else because that very wisdom made him see danger in handling such subjects and so, in his caution, he preferred to speak only of minor incidents. But where Bloch made a mistake was in thinking that M. de Norpois, even had he been less cautious by nature and of a less exclusively formal cast of mind, could (supposing he would) have told him the truth as to the part played by Henry, Picquart or du Paty de Clam, or as to any of the different aspects of the case. The truth, indeed, as to all these matters Bloch could not doubt that M. de Norpois knew. How could he fail to know it seeing that he was a friend of all the Ministers? Naturally, Bloch thought that the truth in politics could be approximately reconstructed by the most luminous minds, but he imagined, like the man in the street, that it resided permanently, beyond the reach of argument and in a material form, in the secret files of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister, who imparted it to their Cabinet. Now, even when a political truth does take the form of written documents, it is seldom that these have any more value than a radiographic plate on which the layman imagines that the patient\u2019s disease is inscribed in so many words, when, as a matter of fact, the plate furnishes simply one piece of material for study, to be combined with a number of others, which the doctor\u2019s reasoning powers will take into consideration as a whole and upon them found his diagnosis. So, too, the truth in politics, when one goes to well-informed men and imagines that one is about to grasp it, eludes one. Indeed, later on (to confine ourselves to the Dreyfus case), when so startling an event occurred as Henry\u2019s confession, followed by his suicide, this fact was at once interpreted in opposite ways by the Dreyfusard Ministers, and by Cavaignac and Cuignet who had themselves made the discovery of the forgery and conducted the examination; still more so among the Dreyfusard Ministers themselves, men of the same shade of Dreyfusism, judging not only from the same documents but in the same spirit, the part played by Henry was explained in two entirely different ways, one set seeing in him an accomplice of Esterhazy, the others assigning that part to du Paty de Clam, thus rallying in support of a theory of their opponent Cuignet and in complete opposition to their supporter Reinach. All that Bloch could elicit from M. de Norpois was that if it were true that the Chief of Staff, M. de Boisdeffre, had had a secret communication sent to M. Rochefort, it was evident that a singularly regrettable irregularity had occurred\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may be quite sure that the War Minister must (in petto at any rate) be consigning his Chief of Staff to the infernal powers. An official disclaimer would not have been (to my mind) a work of supererogation. But the War Minister expresses himself very bluntly on the matter inter pocula. There are certain subjects, moreover, about which it is highly imprudent to create an agitation over which one cannot retain control afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut those documents are obviously forged,\u201d put in Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois made no reply to this, but announced that he did not approve of the manifestations that were being made by Prince Henri d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBesides, they can only ruffle the calm of the pretorium, and encourage agitations which, looked at from either point of view, would be deplorable. Certainly we must put a stop to the anti-militarist conspiracy, but we cannot possibly tolerate, either, a brawl encouraged by those elements on the Right who instead of serving the patriotic ideal themselves are hoping to make it serve them. Heaven be praised, France is not a South American Republic, and the need has not yet been felt here for a military pronunciamento.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bioch could not get him to speak on the question of Dreyfus\u2019s guilt, nor would he utter any forecast as to the judgment in the civil trial then proceeding. On the other hand, M. de Norpois seemed only too ready to indicate the consequences of this judgment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf it is a conviction,\u201d he said, \u201cit will probably be quashed, for it is seldom that, in a case where there has been such a number of witnesses, there is not some flaw in the procedure which counsel can raise on appeal. To return to Prince Henri\u2019s outburst, I greatly doubt whether it has met with his father\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think Chartres is for Dreyfus?\u201d asked the Duchess with a smile, her eyes rounded, her cheeks bright, her nose buried in her plate, her whole manner deliciously scandalised\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; I meant only that there runs through the whole family, on that side, a political sense which we have seen, in the admirable Princesse Cl\u00e9mentine, carried to its highest power, and which her son, Prince Ferdinand, has kept as a priceless inheritance. You would never have found the Prince of Bulgaria clasping Major Esterhazy to his bosom.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe would have preferred a private soldier,\u201d murmured Mme. de Guermantes, who often met the Bulgarian monarch at dinner at the Prince de Joinville\u2019s, and had said to him once, when he asked if she was not envious: \u201cYes, Sir, of your bracelets.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to Mme. de Sagan\u2019s ball this evening?\u201d M. de Norpois asked Mme. de Villeparisis, to cut short his conversation with Bloch. My friend had not failed to interest the Ambassador, who told us afterwards, not without a quaint simplicity, thinking no doubt of the traces that survived in Bloch\u2019s speech of the neo-Homeric manner which he had on the whole outgrown: \u201cHe is rather amusing, with that way of speaking, a trifle old fashioned, a trifle solemn. You expect him to come out with \u2018The Learned Sisters,\u2019 like Lamartine or Jean-Baptiste Rousseau. It has become quite uncommon in the youth of the present day, as it was indeed in the generation before them. We ourselves were inclined to be romantic.\u201d But however exceptional his companion may have seemed to him, M. de Norpois decided that the conversation had lasted long enough\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t go to balls any more,\u201d she replied with a charming grandmotherly smile. \u201cYou\u2019re going, all of you, I suppose? You\u2019re the right age for that sort of thing,\u201d she added, embracing in a comprehensive glance M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault, his friend and Bloch. \u201cStill, I was asked,\u201d she went on, pretending, just for fun, to be flattered by the distinction. \u201cIn fact, they came specially to ask me.\u201d (\u2018They\u2019 being the Princesse de Sagan.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t had a card,\u201d said Bloch, thinking that Mme. de Villeparisis would at once offer to procure him one, and that Mme. de Sagan would be glad to see at her ball the friend of a woman whom she had called in person to invite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquise made no reply, and Bloch did not press the point, for he had another, more serious matter to discuss with her, and, with that in view, had already asked her whether he might call again in a couple of days. Having heard the two young men say that they had both just resigned from the Rue Royale Club, which was letting in every Tom, Dick and Harry, he wished to ask Mme. de Villeparisis to arrange for his election there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAren\u2019t they rather bad form, rather stuck-up snobs, these Sagans?\u201d he inquired in a tone of sarcasm\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all, they\u2019re the best we can do for you in that line,\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt, who adopted all the catch-words of Parisian society, assured him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen,\u201d said Bloch, still half in irony, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s one of the solemnities, the great social fixtures of the season.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis turned merrily to Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell us, is it a great social solemnity, Mme. de Sagan\u2019s ball?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s no good asking me,\u201d answered the Duchess, \u201cI have never yet succeeded in finding out what a social solemnity is. Besides, society isn\u2019t my strong point.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed; I thought it was just the other way,\u201d said Bloch, who supposed Mme. de Guermantes to be speaking seriously\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He continued, to the desperation of M. de Norpois, to ply him with questions about the Dreyfus case. The Ambassador declared that, looking at it from outside, he got the impression from du Paty de Clam of a somewhat cloudy brain, which had perhaps not been very happily chosen to conduct that delicate operation, which required so much coolness and discernment, a judicial inquiry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know that the Socialist Party are crying aloud for his head on a charger, as well as for the immediate release of the prisoner from the Devil\u2019s Isle. But I think that we are not yet reduced to the necessity of passing the Caudine Forks of MM. G\u00e9rault-Richard and Company. So far, the whole case has been an utter mystery, I don\u2019t say that on one side just as much as on the other there has not been some pretty dirty work to be hushed up. That certain of your client\u2019s more or less disinterested protectors may have the best intentions I will not attempt to deny, but you know that heaven is paved with such things,\u201d he added, with a look of great subtlety. \u201cIt is essential that the Government should give the impression that they are not in the hands of the factions of the Left, and that they are not going to surrender themselves, bound hand and foot, at the demand of some pretorian guard or other, which, believe me, is not the same thing as the Army. It stands to reason that, should any fresh evidence come to light, a new trial would be ordered. And what follows from that? Obviously, that to demand a new trial is to force an open door. When the day comes, the Government will speak with no uncertain voice or will let fall into abeyance what is their essential prerogative. Cock and bull stories will no longer be enough. We must appoint judges to try Dreyfus. And that will be an easy matter because, although we have acquired the habit, in our sweet France, where we love to belittle ourselves, of thinking or letting it be thought that, in order to hear the words Truth and Justice, it is necessary to cross the Channel, which is very often only a roundabout way of reaching the Spree, there are judges to be found outside Berlin. But once the machinery of Government has been set in motion, will you have ears for the voice of authority? When it bids you perform your duty as a citizen will you have ears for its voice, will you take your stand in the ranks of law and order? When its patriotic appeal sounds, will you have the wisdom not to turn a deaf ear but to answer: \u2018Present!\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois put these questions to Bloch with a vehemence which, while it alarmed my friend, flattered him also; for the Ambassador spoke to him with the air of one addressing a whole party, questioned him as though he had been in the confidence of that party and might be held responsible for the decisions which it would adopt. \u201cShould you fail to disarm,\u201d M. de Norpois went on, without waiting for Bloch\u2019s collective answer, \u201cshould you, before even the ink had dried on the decree ordering the fresh trial of the case, obeying it matters not what insidious word of command, fail, I say, to disarm, and band yourselves, rather, in a sterile opposition which seems to some minds the ultima ratio of policy, should you retire to your tents and burn your boats, you would be doing so to your own, damnation. Are you the prisoners of those who foment disorder? Have you given them pledges?\u201d Bloch was in doubt how to answer. M. de Norpois gave him no time. \u201cIf the negative be true, as I should like to think, and if you have a little of what seems to me to be lamentably lacking in certain of your leaders and your friends, namely political sense, then, on the day when the Criminal Court assembles, if you do not allow yourselves to be dragooned by the fishers in troubled waters, you will have won your battle. I do not guarantee that the whole of the General Staff is going to get away unscathed, but it will be so much to the good if some of them at least can save their faces without setting the heather on fire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt stands to reason, moreover, that it is with the Government that it rests to pronounce judgment, and to close the list \u2014 already too long \u2014 of unpunished crimes, not certainly at the bidding of Socialist agitators, nor yet of any obscure military mouthpiece,\u201d he added, looking Bloch boldly in the face, perhaps with the instinct that leads all Conservatives to establish support for themselves in the enemy\u2019s camp. \u201cGovernment action is not to be dictated by the highest bidder, from wherever the bid may come. The Government are not, thank heaven, under the orders of Colonel Driant, nor, at the other end of the scale, under M. Clemenceau\u2019s. We must curb the professional agitators and prevent them from raising their heads again. France, the vast majority here in France, desires only to be allowed to work in orderly conditions. As to that, there can be no question whatever. But we must not be afraid to enlighten public opinion; and if a few sheep, of the kind our friend Rabelais knew so well, should dash headlong into the water, it would be as well to point out to them that the water in question was troubled, that it had been troubled deliberately by an agency not within our borders, in order to conceal the dangers lurking in its depths. And the Government ought not to give the impression that they are emerging from their passivity in self-defence when they exercise the right which is essentially their own, I mean that of setting the wheels of justice in motion. The Government will accept all your suggestions. If it is proved that there has been a judicial error, they can be sure of an overwhelming majority which would give them room to act with freedom.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou, sir,\u201d said Bloch, turning to M. d\u2019Argencourt, to whom he had been made known, with the rest of the party, on that gentleman\u2019s arrival, \u201cyou are a Dreyfusard, of course; they all are, abroad.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is a question that concerns only the French themselves, don\u2019t you think?\u201d replied M. d\u2019Argencourt with that peculiar form of insolence which consists in ascribing to the other person an opinion which one must, obviously, know that he does not hold since he has just expressed one directly its opposite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch coloured; M. d\u2019Argencourt smiled, looking round the room, and if this smile, so long as it was directed at the rest of the company, was charged with malice at Bloch\u2019s expense, it became tempered with cordiality when finally it came to rest on the face of my friend, so as to deprive him of any excuse for annoyance at the words which he had heard uttered, though those words remained just as cruel. Mme. de Guermantes murmured something to M. d\u2019Argencourt which I could not hear, but which must have referred to Bloch\u2019s religion, for there flitted at that moment over the face of the Duchess that expression to which one\u2019s fear of being noticed by the person of whom one is speaking gives a certain hesitancy and unreality, while there is blended with it the inquisitive, malicious amusement inspired in one by a group of human beings to which one feels oneself to be fundamentally alien. To retrieve himself, Bloch turned to the Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault. \u201cYou, sir, as a Frenchman, you must be aware that people abroad are all Dreyfusards, although everyone pretends that in prance we never know what is going on abroad. Anyhow, I know \u00cf can talk freely to you; Saint-Loup told me so.\u201d But the young Duke, who felt that every one was turning against Bloch, and was a coward as people often are in society, employing a mordant and precious form of wit which he seemed, by a sort of collateral atavism, to have inherited from M. de Charlus, replied: \u201cYou must not ask me, sir, to discuss the Dreyfus case with you; it is a subject which, on principle, I never mention except to Japhetics.\u201d Everyone smiled, except Bloch, not that he was not himself in the habit of making scathing references to his Jewish origin, to that side of his ancestry which came from somewhere near Sinai. But instead of one of these epigrams (doubtless because he had not one ready) the operation of the internal machine brought to Bloch\u2019s lips something quite different. And we caught only: \u201cBut how on earth did you know? Who told you?\u201d as though he had been the son of a convict. Whereas, given his name, which had not exactly a Christian sound, and his face, his surprise argued a certain simplicity of mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What M. de Norpois had said not having completely satisfied him, he went up to the librarian and asked him whether Mme. de Villeparisis did not sometimes have in her house M. du Paty de Clam or M. Joseph Reinach. The librarian made no reply; he was a Nationalist, and never ceased preaching to the Marquise that the social revolution might break out at any moment, and that she ought to shew more caution in the choice of her friends. He asked himself whether Bloch might not be a secret emissary of the Syndicate, come to collect information, and went off at once to repeat to Mme. de Villeparisis the questions that Bloch had put to him. She decided that, at the best, he was ill-bred and might be in a position to compromise M. de Norpois. Also, she wished to give satisfaction to the librarian, the only person of whom she went in fear, by whom she was being indoctrinated, though without any marked success (every morning he read her M. Judet\u2019s article in the Petit Journal). She decided, therefore, to make it plain to Bloch that he need not come to the house again, and had no difficulty in finding, among her social repertory, the scene by which a great lady shows anyone her door, a scene which does not in any way involve the raised finger and blazing eyes that people imagine. As Bloch came up to her to say good-bye, buried in her deep armchair, she seemed only half-awakened from a vague somnolence. Her sunken eyes gleamed with only the feeble though charming light of a pair of pearls. Bloch\u2019s farewell, barely pencilling on the Marquise\u2019s face a languid smile, drew from her not a word, nor did she offer him her hand. This scene left Bloch in utter bewilderment, but as he was surrounded by a circle of spectators he felt that it could not be prolonged without disadvantage to himself, and, to force the Marquise, the hand which she had made no effort to take he himself thrust out at her. Mme. de Villeparisis was startled. But doubtless, while still bent upon giving an immediate satisfaction to the librarian and the anti-Dreyfusard clan, she wished at the same time to provide for the future, and so contented herself with letting her eyelids droop over her closing eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI believe she\u2019s asleep,\u201d said Bloch to the librarian who, feeling that he had the support of the Marquise, assumed an indignant air. \u201cGood-bye madame,\u201d snouted Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The old lady made the slight movement with her lips of a dying woman who wants to open her mouth but whose eye can no longer recognise people. Then she turned, overflowing with a restored vitality, to M. d\u2019Argencourt, while Bloch left the room, convinced that she must be \u2018soft\u2019 in the head. Full of curiosity and anxious to have more light thrown upon so strange an incident, he came to see lier again a few days later. She received him in the most friendly fashion, because she was a good-natured woman, because the librarian was not there, because she had in mind the little play which Bloch was going to produce for her, and finally because she had acted once and for all the little scene of the indignant lady that she had wished to act, a scene that had been universally admired and discussed the same evening in various drawing-rooms, but in a version which had already ceased to bear any resemblance to the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou were speaking just now of the Seven Princesses, Duchess; you know (not that it\u2019s anything to be proud of) that the author of that \u2014 what shall I call it? \u2014 that production is a compatriot of mine,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt with a fine scorn blended with satisfaction at knowing more than anyone else in the room about the author of a work which had been under discussion. \u201cYes, he\u2019s a Belgian, by nationality,\u201d he went on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed! No, we don\u2019t accuse you of any responsibility for the Seven Princesses. Fortunately for yourself and your compatriots you are not like the author of that absurdity. I know several charming Belgians, yourself, your King, who is inclined to be shy, but full of wit, my Ligne cousins, and heaps of others, but you, I am thankful to say, do not speak the same language as the author of the Seven Princesses. Besides, if you want to know, it\u2019s not worth talking about, because really there is absolutely nothing in it. You know the sort of people who are always trying to seem obscure, and even plan to make themselves ridiculous to conceal the fact that they have not an idea in their heads. If there was anything behind it all, I may tell you that I\u2019m not in the least afraid of a little daring,\u201d she added in a serious tone, \u201cprovided that there is some idea in it. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen Borelli\u2019s piece. Some people seem to have been shocked by it, but I must say, even if they stone me through the streets for saying it,\u201d she went on, without stopping to think that she ran no very great risk of such a punishment, \u201cI found it immensely interesting. But theSeven Princesses! It\u2019s all very well, one of them having a fondness for my nephew, I cannot carry family feeling quite . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess broke off abruptly, for a lady came in who was the Comtesse de Marsantes, Robert\u2019s mother. Mme. de Marsantes was regarded in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as a superior being, of a goodness, a resignation that were positively angelic. So I had been told, and had had no particular reason to feel surprised, not knowing at the same time that she was the sister of the Duc de Guermantes. Later, I have always been taken aback, whenever I have learned that such women, melancholy, pure, victimised, venerated like the ideal forms of saints in church windows, had flowered from the same genealogical stem as brothers brutal, debauched and vile. Brothers and sisters, when they are closely alike in features as were the pue de Guermantes and Mme. de Marsantes, ought (I felt) to have a single intellect in common, the same heart, as a person would have who might vary between good and evil moods but in whom one could not, for all that, expect to find a vast breadth of outlook if he had a narrow mind, or a sublime abnegation if his heart was hard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes attended Bruneti\u00e8re\u2019s lectures. She fascinated the Faubourg Saint-Germain and, by her saintly life, edified it as well. But the morphological link of handsome nose and piercing gaze led one, nevertheless, to classify Mme. de Marsantes in the same intellectual and moral family as her brother the Duke. I could not believe that the mere fact of her being a woman, and perhaps those of her having had an unhappy life and won everyone\u2019s sympathy, could make a person be so different from the rest of her family, as in the old romances, where all the virtues and graces are combined in the sister of wild and lawless brothers. It seemed to me that nature, less unconventional than the old poets, must make use almost exclusively of the elements common to the family, and I was unable to credit her with enough power of invention to construct, out of materials analogous to those that composed a fool and clod, a lofty mind without the least strain of clownishness, a saint unsoiled by any brutality. Mme. de Marsantes was wearing a gown of white surah embroidered with large palms, on which stood out flowers of a different material, these being black. This was because, three weeks earlier, she had lost her cousin, M. de Montmorency, a bereavement which did not prevent her from paying calls or even from going to small dinners, but always in mourning. She was a great lady. Atavism had filled her with the frivolity of generations of life at court, with all the superficial, rigorous duties that that implies. Mme. de Marsantes had not had the strength of character to regret for any length of time the death of her father and mother, but she would not for anything in the world have appeared in colours in the month following that of a cousin. She was more than pleasant to me, both because I was Robert\u2019s friend and because I did not move in the same world as he. This pleasantness was accompanied by a pretence of shyness, by that sort of intermittent withdrawal of the voice, the eyes, the mind which a woman draws back to her like a skirt that has indiscreetly spread, so as not to take up too much room, to remain stiff and erect even in her suppleness, as a good upbringing teaches. A good upbringing which must not, however, be taken too literally, many of these ladies passing very swiftly into a complete dissolution of morals without ever losing the almost childlike correctness of their manners. Mme. de Marsantes was a trifle irritating in conversation since, whenever she had occasion to speak of a plebeian, as for instance Bergotte or Elstir, she would say, isolating the word, giving it its full value, intoning it on two different notes with a modulation peculiar to the Guermantes: \u201cI have had the honour, the great hon-our of meeting Monsieur Bergotte,\u201d or \u201cof making the acquaintance of Monsieur Elstir\u201d whether that her hearers might marvel at her humility or from the sam tendency that Mme. de Guermantes shewed to revert to the use of obsolete forms, as a protest against the slovenly usages of the present day, in which people never professed themselves sufficiently \u2018honoured.\u2019 Whichever Of these was the true reason, one felt that when Mme. de Marsantes said: \u201cI have had the honour, the great hon-our,\u201d she felt she was playing an important part and shewing that she could take in the names of distinguished men as she would have welcomed the men themselves at her home in the country, had they happened to be in the neighbourhood. On the other hand as her family connexion was numerous, as she was devoted to all her relatives, as, slow in speech and fond of explaining things at length, she was always trying to make clear the exact degree of kinship, she found herself (without any desire to create an effect and without really caring to talk about anyone except touching peasants and sublime gamekeepers) referring incessantly to all the mediatised houses in Europe, a failing which people less brilliantly connected than herself could not forgive, and, if they were at all intellectual, derided as a sign of stupidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the country, Mme. de Marsantes was adored for the good that she did, but principally because the purity of a strain of blood into which for many generations there had flowed only what was greatest in the history of France had taken from her manner everything that the lower orders call \u2018manners,\u2019 and had given her a perfect simplicity. She never shrank from kissing a poor woman who was in trouble, and would tell her to come up to the castle for a cartload of wood. She was, people said, the perfect Christian. She was determined to find an immensely rich wife for Robert. Being a great lady means playing the great lady, that is to say, to a certain extent, playing at simplicity. It is a pastime which costs an extremely high price, all the more because simplicity charms people only on condition that they know that you are not bound to live simply, that is to say that you are very rich. Some one said to me afterwards, when I had told him of my meeting her: \u201cYou saw of course that she must have been lovely as a young woman.\u201d But true beauty is so individual, so novel always, that one does not recognise it as beauty. I said to myself this afternoon only that she had a tiny nose, very blue eyes, a long neck and a sad expression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the Duchesse de Guermantes, \u201cI\u2019m expecting a woman at any moment whom you don\u2019t wish to know. I thought I\u2019d better warn you, to avoid any unpleasantness. But you needn\u2019t be afraid, I shall never have her here again, only I was obliged to let her come to-day. It\u2019s Swann\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Swann, seeing the dimensions that the Dreyfus case had begun to assume, and fearing that her husband\u2019s racial origin might be used against herself, had besought him never again to allude to the prisoner\u2019s innocence. When he was not present she went farther and used to profess the most ardent Nationalism; in doing which she was only following the example of Mme. Verdurin, in whom a middle-class anti-semitism, latent hitherto, had awakened and grown to a positive fury. Mme. Swann had won by this attitude the privilege of membership in several of the women\u2019s leagues that were beginning to be formed in anti-semitic society, and had succeeded in making friends with various members of the aristocracy. It may seem strange that, so far from following their example, the Duchesse de Guermantes, so close a friend of Swann, had on the contrary always resisted his desire, which he had not concealed from her, to introduce to her his wife. But we shall see in due course that this arose from the peculiar nature of the Duchess, who held that she was not \u2018bound to\u2019 do things, and laid down with despotic force what had been decided by her social \u2018free will,\u2019 which was extremely arbitrary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cIt would indeed be most unpleasant. But as I know her by sight I shall be able to get away in time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI assure you, Oriane, she is really quite nice; an excellent woman,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have no doubt she is, but I feel no need to assure myself of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you been invited to Lady Israels\u2019s?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis asked the Duchess, to change the conversation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, thank heaven, I don\u2019t know the woman,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cYou must ask Marie-Aynard. She knows her. I never could make out why.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI did indeed know her at one time,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes. \u201cI confess my faults. But I have decided not to know her any more. It seems she\u2019s one of the very worst of them, and makes no attempt to conceal it. Besides, we have all been too trusting, too hospitable. I shall never go near anyone of that race again. While we had old friends, country cousins, people of our own flesh and blood on whom we shut our doors, we threw them open to Jews. And now we see what thanks we get from them. But I\u2019ve no right to speak; I have an adorable son, and, like a young fool, he says and does all the maddest things you can imagine,\u201d she went on, having caught some allusion by M. d\u2019Argencourt to Robert. \u201cBut, talking of Robert, haven\u2019t you seen him?\u201d she asked Mme. de Villeparisis; \u201cbeing Saturday, I thought he\u2019d be coming to Paris on leave, and in that case he would be sure to pay you a visit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact Mme. de Marsantes thought that her son would not obtain leave that week; but knowing that, even if he did, he would never dream of coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis, she hoped, by making herself appear to have expected to find him in the room, to procure his forgiveness from her susceptible aunt for all the visits that he had failed to pay her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert here! But I have never had a single word from him; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen him since Balbec.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is so busy; he has so much to do,\u201d pleaded Mme. de Marsantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A faint smile made Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s eyelashes quiver as she studied the circle which, with the point of her sunshade, she was tracing on the carpet. Whenever the Duke had been too openly unfaithful to his wife, Mme. de Marsantes had always taken up the cudgels against her own brother on her sister-in-law\u2019s behalf. The latter had a grateful and bitter memory of this protection, and was not herself seriously shocked by Robert\u2019s pranks. At this point the door opened again and Robert himself entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, talk of the Saint!\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes, who had her back to the door, had not seen her son come in. When she did catch sight of him, her motherly bosom was convulsed with joy, as by the beating of a wing, her body half rose her seat, her face quivered and she fastened on Robert eyes big astonishment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! You\u2019ve come! How delightful! What a surprise!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Talk of the Saint! \u2014 I see,\u201d cried the Belgian diplomat, with a shout of laughter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDelicious, ain\u2019t it?\u201d came tartly from the Duchess, who hated puns and had ventured on this one only with a pretence of making fun of herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood afternoon, Robert,\u201d she said, \u201cI believe he\u2019s forgotten his aunt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They talked for a moment, probably about myself, for as Saint-Loup was leaving her to join his mother Mme. de Guermantes turned to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood afternoon; how are you?\u201d was her greeting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She allowed to rain on me the light of her azure gaze, hesitated for a moment, unfolded and stretched towards me the stem of her arm, leaned forward her body which sprang rapidly backwards like a bush that has been pulled down to the ground and, on being released, returns to its natural position. Thus she acted under the fire of Saint-Loup\u2019s eyes, which kept her under observation and were making frantic efforts to obtain some further concession still from his aunt. Fearing that our conversation might fail altogether, he joined in, to stimulate it, and answered for me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s not very well just now, he gets rather tired; I think he would be a great deal better, by the way, if he saw you more often, for I can\u2019t help telling you that he admires you immensely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but that\u2019s very nice of him,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes in a deliberately casual tone, as if I had brought her her cloak. \u201cI am most flattered.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLook, I must go and talk to my mother for a minute; take my chair,\u201d said Saint-Loup, thus forcing me to sit down next to his aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were both silent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see you sometimes in the morning,\u201d she said, as though she were telling me something that I did not know, and I for my part had never seen her. \u201cIt\u2019s so good for one, a walk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOriane,\u201d began Mme. de Marsantes in a low tone, \u201cyou said you were going on to Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u2019s; would you be so very kind as to tell her not to expect me to dinner, I shall stay at home now that I\u2019ve got Robert. And one other thing, but I hardly like to ask you, if you would leave word as you pass to tell them to send out at once for a box of the cigars Robert likes. \u2018Corona,\u2019 they\u2019re called. I\u2019ve none in the house.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert came up to us; he had caught only the name of Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho in the world is Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol?\u201d he inquired, in a sur \u2014 prised but decisive tone, for he affected a studied ignorance of everything to do with society\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy, you know quite well,\u201d said his mother. \u201cShe\u2019s Vermandois\u2019s sister. It was she gave you that nice billiard table you liked so much.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, she\u2019s Vermandois\u2019s sister, I had no idea of that. Really, my family are amazing,\u201d he went on, turning so as to include me in the conversation and adopting unconsciously Bloch\u2019s intonation just as he borrowed his ideas, \u201cthey know the most unheard-of people, people called Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u201d (emphasising the final consonant of each word) \u201cand names like that; they go to balls, they drive in victorias, they lead a fabulous existence. It\u2019s prodigious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes made in her throat a slight, short, sharp sound, as of an involuntary laugh which one chokes back, meaning thereby to shew that she paid just as much tribute as the laws of kinship imposed on her to her nephew\u2019s wit. A servant came in to say that the Prince von Faffenheim-Munsterburg-Weinigen had sent word to M. de Norpois that he was waiting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBring him in, sir,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the old Ambassador, who started in quest of the German Minister\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStop, sir; do you think I ought to shew him the miniature of the Empress Charlotte?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d said the Ambassador in a tone of conviction, and as though he were envying the fortunate Minister the favour that was in store for him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I know he\u2019s very sound,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes, \u201cand that is so rare among foreigners. But I\u2019ve found out all about him. He is anti-semitism personified.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Prince\u2019s name preserved in the boldness with which its opening syllables were \u2014 to borrow an expression from music \u2014 attacked, and in the stammering repetition that scanned them, the impulse, the mannered simplicity, the heavy delicacies of the Teutonic race, projected like green boughs over the \u2018heim\u2019 of dark blue enamel which glowed with the mystic light of a Rhenish window behind the pale and finely wrought gildings of the German eighteenth century. This name included, among the several names of which it was composed, that of a little German watering-place to which as a child I had gone with my grandmother, at the foot of a mountain honoured by the feet of Goethe, from the vineyards of which we used to drink, at the Kurhof, their illustrious vintages with elaborate and sonorous names, like the epithets which Homer applies to his heroes. And so, scarcely had I heard the Prince\u2019s name spoken than, before I had recalled the watering-place, the name itself seemed to shrink, to grow rich with humanity, to find large enough a little place in my memory to which it clung, familiar, earth to earth, picturesque, savoury, light, with something about it, too, that was authorised, prescribed. And then, M. de Guermantes, in explaining who the Prince was, quoted a number of his titles, and I recognised the name of a village threaded by the river on which, every evening, my cure finished for the day, I used to go in a boat amid the mosquitoes, and that of a forest so far away that the doctor would not allow me to make the excursion to it. And indeed it was comprehensible that the suzerainty of the lord extended to the surrounding places and associated afresh in the enumeration of his titles the names which one could read, close together, upon a map. Thus beneath the visor of the Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and Knight of Franconia it was the face of a dear and smiling land, on which had often lingered for me the light of the six-o\u2019clock sun, that I saw, at any rate before the Prince, Rheingraf and Elector Palatine had entered the room. For I speedily learned that the revenues which he drew from the forest and river, peopled with gnomes and undines, and from the enchanted mountain on which rose the ancient Burg that cherished memories of Luther and Lewis the Germanic, he employed in keeping five Charron motor-cars, a house in Paris and one in London, a box on Mondays at the Opera and another for the \u2018Tuesdays\u2019 at the \u2018Fran\u00e7ais.\u2019 He did not seem to me, nor did he seem to regard himself as different from other men of similar fortune and age who had a less poetic origin. He had their culture, their ideals, he was proud of his rank, but purely on account of the advantages it conferred on him, and had now only one ambition in life, to be elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, which was the reason of his coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis. If he, whose wife was a leader of the most exclusive set in Berlin, had begged to be introduced to the Marquise, it was not the result of any desire on his part for her acquaintance. Devoured for years past by this ambition to be elected to the Institute, he had unfortunately never been in a position to reckon above five the number of Academicians who seemed prepared to vote for him. He knew that M. de Norpois could by himself dispose of at least ten others, a number which he was capable, by skilful negotiations, of increasing still further. And so the Prince, who had known him in Russia when they were both there as Ambassadors, had gone to see him and had done everything in his power to win him over. But in vain might he multiply his friendly overtures, procure for the Marquis Russian decorations, quote him in articles on foreign politics; he had had before him an ingrate, a man in whose eyes all these attentions appeared to count as nothing, who had not advanced the prospects of his candidature one inch, had not even promised him his own vote. No doubt M. de Norpois received him with extreme politeness, indeed begged that he would not put himself out and \u201ctake the trouble to come so far out of his way,\u201d went himself to the Prince\u2019s residence, and when the Teutonic Knight had launched his: \u201cI should like immensely to be your colleague,\u201d replied in a tone of deep emotion: \u201cAh! I should be most happy!\u201d And no doubt a simpleton, a Dr. Cottard would have said to himself: \u201cWell, here he is in my house; it was he who insisted on coming, because he regards me as a more important person than himself; he tells me that he would be happy to see me in the Academy; words do have some meaning after all, damn it, probably if he doesn\u2019t offer to vote for me it is because it hasn\u2019t occurred to him. He lays so much stress on my great influence; presumably he imagines that larks drop into my mouth ready roasted, that I have all the support I want, and that is why he doesn\u2019t offer me his; but I have only got to get him with his back to the wall, and just say to him quietly: \u2018Very well, vote for me, will you?\u2019 and he will be obliged to do it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Prince von Faffenheim was no simpleton. He was what Dr. Cottard would have called \u2018a fine diplomat\u2019 and he knew that M. de Norpois was no less fine a one than himself, nor a man who would have failed to realise without needing to be told that he could confer a favour on a candidate by voting for him. The Prince, in his Embassies and as Foreign Minister, had conducted, on his country\u2019s behalf instead of, as in the present instance, his own, many of those conversations in which one knows beforehand just bow far one is prepared to go and at what point one will decline to commit oneself. He was not unaware that, in this diplomatic language, to talk meant to offer. And it was for this reason that he had arranged for M. de Norpois to receive the Cordon of Saint Andrew. But if he had had to report to his Government the conversation which he had subsequently had with M. de Norpois, he would have stated in his dispatch: \u201cI realised that I had gone the wrong way to work.\u201d For as soon as he had returned to the subject of the Institute, M. de Norpois had repeated:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should like nothing better; nothing could be better, for my colleagues. They ought, I consider, to feel genuinely honoured that you should have thought of them. It is a really interesting candidature, a little outside our ordinary course. As you know, the Academy is very conventional, it takes fright at everything which has at all a novel sound. Personally, I deplore this. How often have I had occasion to say as much to my colleagues! I cannot be sure, God forgive me, that I did not even once let the word \u2018hidebound\u2019 escape me,\u201d he added, in an undertone, with a scandalised smile, almost aside, as in a scene on the stage, casting at the Prince a rapid, sidelong glance from his blue eyes, like a veteran actor studying the effect on his audience. \u201cYou understand, Prince, that I should not care to allow a personality so eminent as yourself to embark on a venture which was hopeless from the start. So long as my colleagues\u2019 ideas linger so far behind the times, I consider that the wiser course will be to abstain. But you may rest assured that if I were ever to discern a mind that was a little more modern, a little more alive, shewing itself in that college, which is tending to become a mausoleum, if I could reckon upon any possible chance of your success, I should be the first to inform you of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Cordon was a mistake,\u201d thought the Prince; \u201cthe negotiations have not advanced in the least; that is not what he wanted. I have not yet laid my hand on the right key.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was a kind of reasoning of which M. de Norpois, formed in the same school as the Prince, would also have been capable. One may mock at the Pedantic silliness with which diplomats of the Norpois type go into ecstasies over some piece of official wording which is, for all practical purposes, meaningless. But their childishness has this compensation; diplomats know that, in the loaded scales which assure that European or other equilibrium which we call peace, good feeling, sounding speeches, earnest entreaties weigh very little; and that the heavy weight, the true determinant consists in something else, in the possibility which the adversary does (if he is strong enough) or does not enjoy of satisfying, in exchange for what one oneself wants, a desire. With this order of truths, which an entirely disinterested person, such as my grandmother for instance, would not have understood M. de Norpois and Prince von Faffenheim had frequently had to deal. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in countries with which we had been within an ace of going to war, M. de Norpois, in his anxiety as to the turn which events were about to take, knew very well that it was not by the word \u2018Peace,\u2019 nor by the word \u2018War\u2019 that it would be revealed to him, but by some other, apparently commonplace word, a word of terror or blessing, which the diplomat, by the aid of his cipher, would immediately read and to which, to safeguard the honour of France, he would respond in another word, quite as commonplace, but one beneath which the Minister of the enemy nation would at once see written: \u2018War.\u2019 Moreover, in accordance with a time-honoured custom, analogous to that which gave to the first meeting between two young people promised to one another in marriage the form of a chance encounter at a performance in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase, the dialogue in the course of which destiny was to dictate the word \u2018War\u2019 or the word \u2018Peace\u2019 was held, as a rule, not in the ministerial sanctum but on a bench in a Kurgarten where the Minister and M. de Norpois went independently to a thermal spring to drink at its source their little tumblers of some curative water. By a sort of tacit convention they met at the hour appointed for their cure, began by taking together a short stroll which, beneath its innocent appearance, each of the speakers knew to be as tragic as an order for mobilisation. And so, in a private matter like this nomination for election to the Institute, the Prince had employed the same system of induction which had served him in his public career, the same method of reading beneath superimposed symbols\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And certainly it would be wrong to pretend that my grandmother and the few who resembled her would have been alone in their failure to understand this kind of calculation. For one thing, the average human being, practising a profession the lines of which have been laid down for him from the start, comes near, by his want of intuition, to the ignorance which my grandmother owed to her lofty disinterestedness. Often one has to come down to \u2018kept\u2019 persons, male or female, before one finds the hidden spring of actions or words apparently of the most innocent nature in self-interest, in the bare necessity to keep alive. What man does not know that when a woman whom he is going to pay says to him: \u201cDon\u2019t let\u2019s talk about money,\u201d the speech must be regarded as what is called in music \u2018a silent beat\u2019 and that if, later on, she declares: \u201cYou are far too much trouble; you are always keeping things from me; I\u2019ve done with you,\u201d he must interpret this as: \u201cSome one else has been offering me more.\u201d And yet this is only the language of a lady of easy virtue, not so far removed from the ladies in society. The apache furnishes more striking examples. But M. as Norpois and the German Prince, if apaches and their ways were unknown to them, had been accustomed to living on the same plane as nations, which are also, despite their greatness, creatures of selfishness and cunning, kept in order only by force, by consideration of their material interests which may drive them to murder, a murder that is often symbolic also, since its mere hesitation or refusal to fight may spell for a nation the word \u2018Perish. But inasmuch as all this is not set forth in Yellow and otherwise coloured Books, the people as a whole are naturally pacific; should they be warlike, it is instinctively, from hatred, from a sense of injury, not for the reasons which have made up the mind of their ruler, on the advice of his Norpois\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following winter the Prince was seriously ill; he recovered, but his heart was permanently affected\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe devil!\u201d he said to himself, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose any time over the Institute. If I wait too long, I may be dead before they elect me. That really would be unpleasant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He composed, on the foreign politics of the last twenty years, an essay for the Revue des Deux Mondes, in which he referred more than once, and in the most flattering terms, to M. de Norpois. The French diplomat called upon him to thank him. He added that he did not know how to express his gratitude. The Prince said to himself, like a man who has been trying to fit various keys into a stubborn lock: \u201cStill not the right one!\u201d and, feeling somewhat out of breath as he shewed M. de Norpois to the door, thought: \u201cDamn it, these fellows will see me in my grave before letting me in. We must hurry up.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That evening, he met M. de Norpois again at the Opera\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear Ambassador,\u201d he began to him, \u201cyou told me to-day that you did not know what you could do to prove your gratitude; it was a great exaggeration, for you owe me none, but I am going to be so indelicate as to take you at your word.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois had no less high an esteem for the Prince\u2019s tact than the Prince had for his. He understood at once that it was not a request that Prince von Faffenheim was about to present to him, but an offer, and with a radiant affability made ready to hear it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell now, you will think me highly indiscreet. There are two people to whom I am greatly attached \u2014 in quite different ways, as you will understand in a moment \u2014 two people both of whom have recently settled in Paris, where they intend to remain for the future: my wife, and the Grand Duchess John. They are thinking of giving a few dinners, chiefly in honour of the King and Queen of England, and what they would have liked more than anything in the world would have been to be able to offer their guests the company of a person for whom, without knowing her, they both of them feel a great admiration. I confess that I did not know how I was going to gratify their wish when I learned just now, by the most extraordinary accident, that you were a friend of this person. I know that she lives a most retired life, and sees only a very few people \u2014\u2018happy few,\u2019 as Stendhal would say \u2014 but if you were to give me your backing, with the generosity that you have always shewn me, I am sure that she would allow you to present me to her and to convey to her the wishes of both the Grand Duchess and the Princess. Perhaps she would consent to dine with us, when the Queen of England comes, and then (one never knows) if we don\u2019t bore her too much, to spend the Easter holidays with us at Beaulieu, at the Grand Duchess John\u2019s. The person I allude to is called the Marquise de Villeparisis. I confess that the hope of becoming one of the frequenters of such a school of wit would console me, would make me contemplate without regret the abandoning of my attempt at the Institute. For in her house, too, I understand, there is a regular flow of intellect and brilliant talk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With an inexpressible sense of pleasure the Prince felt that the lock no longer resisted, and that at last the key was turning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSuch an alternative is wholly unnecessary, my dear Prince,\u201d replied M. de Norpois; \u201cnothing is more in harmony with the Institute than the house you speak of, which is a regular hotbed of Academicians. I shall convey your request to Mme. la Marquise de Villeparisis: she will undoubtedly be flattered. As for her dining with you, she goes out very little and that will perhaps be more difficult to arrange. But I shall present you to her and you can plead your cause in person. You must on no account give up the Academy; to-morrow fortnight, as it happens, I shall be having luncheon, before going on with him to an important meeting, at Leroy-Beaulieu\u2019s, without whom nobody can be elected; I had already allowed myself in conversation with him to let fall your name, with which, naturally, he was perfectly familiar. He raised certain objections. But it so happens that he requires the support of my group at the next election, and I fully intend to return to the charge; I shall tell him quite openly of the wholly cordial ties that unite us, I shall not conceal from him that, if you were to stand, I should ask all my friends to vote for you,\u201d (here the Prince breathed a deep sigh of relief) \u201cand he knows that I have friends. I consider that if I were to succeed in obtaining his assistance your chances would become very strong. Come that evening, at six, to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s; I will introduce you to her and I can give you an account then of my conversation with him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus it was that Prince von Faffenheim had been led to call upon Mme. de Villeparisis. My profound disillusionment occurred when he spoke. It had never struck me that, if an epoch in history has features both particular and general which are stronger than those of a nationality, so that in a biographical dictionary with illustrations, which go so far as to include an authentic portrait of Minerva, Leibniz with his wig and ruff differs little from Marivaux or Samuel Bernard, a nationality has particular features stronger than those of a caste. In the present instance these were rendered before me not by a discourse in which I had expected, before I saw him, to hear the rustling of the elves and the dance of the kobolds, but by a transposition which certified no less plainly that poetic origin: the fact that, as he bowed, short, red, corpulent, over the hand of Mme. de Villeparisis, the Rheingraf said to her: \u201cAow to you too, Matame la Marquise,\u201d in the accent of an Alsatian porter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWon\u2019t you let me give you a cup of tea or a little of this cake; it is so good?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked me, anxious to have shewn herself as friendly as possible. \u201cI do the honours in this house just as if it was mine,\u201d she explained in an ironical tone which gave a slightly guttural sound to her voice, as though she were trying to stifle a hoarse laugh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to M. de Norpois, \u201cyou won\u2019t forget that you have something to say to the Prince about the Academy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular turn to her wrist to look at the time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGracious! I must fly at once if I\u2019m to get to Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u2019s, and I\u2019m dining with Mme. Leroi.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she rose without bidding me good-bye. She had just caught sight of Mme. Swann, who appeared considerably embarrassed at finding me in the room. She remembered, doubtless, that she had been the first to assure me that she was convinced of Dreyfus\u2019s innocence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want my mother to introduce me to Mme. Swann,\u201d Saint-Loup said to me. \u201cShe\u2019s an ex-whore. Her husband\u2019s a Jew, and she comes here to pose as a Nationalist. Hallo, here\u2019s Uncle Palam\u00e8de.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The arrival of Mme. Swann had a special interest for me, due to an incident which had occurred a few days earlier and which I am obliged to record on account of the consequences which it was to have at a much later date, as the reader will learn in due course. Well, a few days before this visit to Mme. de Villeparisis, I had myself received a visitor whom I little expected, namely Charles Morel, the son (though I had never heard of his existence) of my great-uncle\u2019s old servant. This great-uncle (he in whose house I had met the lady in pink) had died the year before. His servant had more than once expressed his intention of coming to see me; I had no idea of the object of his visit, but should have been glad to see him for I had learned from Fran\u00e7oise that he had a genuine veneration for my uncle\u2019s memory and made a pilgrimage regularly to the cemetery in which he was buried. But, being obliged, for reasons of health, to retire to his home in the country, where he expected to remain for some time, he delegated the duty to his son. I was surprised to see come into my room a handsome young fellow of eighteen, dressed with expensive rather than good taste, but looking, all the same, like anything in the world except the son of a gentleman\u2019s servant. He made a point, moreover, at the start of our conversation, of severing all connexion with the domestic class from which he sprang, by informing me, with a smile of satisfaction, that he had won the first prize at the Conservatoire. The object of his visit to me was as follows: his father, when going through the effects of my uncle Adolphe, had set aside some which, he felt, could not very well be sent to my parents but were at the same time of a nature likely to interest a young man of my age. These were the photographs of the famous actresses, the notorious courtesans whom my uncle had known, the last fading pictures of that gay life of a man about town which he divided by a watertight compartment from his family life. While young Morel was shewing them to me, I noticed that he addressed me as though he were speaking to an equal. He derived from saying \u2018you\u2019 to me as often, and \u2018sir\u2019 as seldom, as possible the pleasure natural in one whose father had never ventured, when addressing my parents, upon anything but the third person. Almost all these photographs bore an inscription such as: \u201cTo my best friend.\u201d One actress, less grateful and more circumspect than the rest, had written: \u201cTo the best of friends,\u201d which enabled her (so I was assured) to say afterwards that my uncle was in no sense and had never been her best friend but was merely the friend who had done the most little services for her, the friend she made use of, a good, kind man, in other words an old fool. In vain might young Morel seek to divest himself of his lowly origin, one felt that the shade of my uncle Adolphe, venerable and gigantic in the eyes of the old servant, had never ceased to hover, almost a holy vision, over the childhood and boyhood of the son. While I was turning over the photographs Charles Morel examined my room. And as I was looking for some place in which I might keep them, \u201cHow is it,\u201d he asked me (in a tone in which the reproach had no need to find expression, so im, plicit was it in the words themselves), \u201cthat I don\u2019t see a single photograph of your uncle in your room?\u201d I felt the blood rise to my cheeks and stammered: \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t believe I have such a thing.\u201d \u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t one photograph of your uncle Adolphe, who was so devoted to you! I\u2014 will send you one of my governor\u2019s \u2014 he has quantities of them \u2014 and I hope you will set it up in the place of honour above that chest of drawers, which came to you from your uncle.\u201d It is true that, as I had not even a photograph of my father or mother in my room, there was nothing so very shocking in there not being one of my uncle Adolphe. But it was easy enough to see that for old Morel, who had trained his son in the same way of thinking, my uncle was the important person in the family, my parents only reflecting a diminished light from his. I was in higher favour, because my uncle used constantly to say that I was going to turn out a sort of Racine, or Vaulabelle, and Morel regarded me almost as an adopted son, as a child by election of my uncle. I soon discovered that this young man was extremely \u2018pushing.\u2019 Thus at this first meeting he asked me, being something of a composer as well and capable of setting short poems to music, whether I knew any poet who had a good position in society. I mentioned one. He did not know the work of this poet and had never heard his name, of which he made a note. Well, I found out that shortly afterwards he wrote to the poet telling him that, a fanatical admirer of his work, he, Morel, had composed a musical setting for one of his sonnets and would be grateful if the author would arrange for its performance at the Comtesse So-and-So\u2019s. This was going a little too fast, and exposing his hand. The poet, taking offence, made no reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the rest, Charles Morel seemed to have, besides his ambition, a strong leaning towards more concrete realities. He had noticed, as he came through the courtyard, Jupien\u2019s niece at work upon a waistcoat, and although he explained to me only that he happened to want a fancy waistcoat at that very moment, I felt that the girl had made a vivid impression on him. He had no hesitation about asking me to come downstairs and introduce him to her, \u201cbut not as a connexion of your family, you follow me, I rely on your discretion not to drag in my father, say just a distinguished artist of your acquaintance, you know how important it is to make a good impression on tradespeople.\u201d Albeit he had suggested to me that, not knowing him well enough to call him, he quite realised,\u2018dear friend,\u2019 I might address him, before the girl, in some such terms as \u201cnot dear master, of course,.. although . . . well, if you like, dear distinguished artist,\u201d once in the shop, I avoided \u2018qualifying\u2019 him, as Saint-Simon would have expressed it, and contented myself with reiterating his \u2018you.\u2019 He picked out from several patterns of velvet one of the brightest red imaginable and so loud that, for all his bad taste, he was never able to wear the waistcoat when it was made. The girl settled down to work again with her two \u2018apprentices,\u2019 but it struck me that the impression had been mutual, and that Charles Morel, whom she regarded as of her own \u2018station\u2019 (only smarter and richer), had proved singularly attractive to her. As I had been greatly surprised to find among the photographs which his father had sent me one of the portrait of Miss Sacripant (otherwise Odette) by Elstir, I said to Charles Morel as I went with him to the outer gate: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can tell me, but did my uncle know this lady well? I don\u2019t see at what stage in his life I can fit her in exactly; and it interests me, because of M. Swann . . . \u201d \u201cWhy, if I wasn\u2019t forgetting to tell you that my father asked me specially to draw your attention to that lady\u2019s picture. As a matter of fact, she was \u2018lunching\u2019 with your uncle the last time you ever saw him. My father was in two minds whether to let you in. It seems you made a great impression on the wench, and she hoped to see more of you. But just at that time there was some trouble in the family, by what my father tells me, and you never set eyes on your uncle again.\u201d He broke off with a smile of farewell, across the courtyard, at Jupien\u2019s niece. She was watching him and admiring, no doubt, his thin face and regular features, his fair hair and sparkling eyes. I, as I gave him my hand, was thinking of Mme. Swann and saying to myself with amazement, so far apart, so different were they in my memory, that I should have henceforth to identify her with the \u2018Lady in pink.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus was not long in taking his place by the side of Mme. Swann. At every social gathering at which he appeared and, contemptuous towards the men, courted by the women, promptly attached himself to the smartest of the latter, whose garments he seemed almost to put on as an ornament to his own, the Baron\u2019s frock coat or swallowtails made one think of a portrait by some great painter of a man dressed in black but having by his side, thrown over a chair, the brilliantly coloured cloak which he is about to wear at some costume ball. This partnership, generally with some royal lady, secured for M. de Charlus various privileges which he liked to enjoy. For instance, one result of it was that his hostesses, at theatricals or concerts, allowed the Baron alone to have a front seat, in a row of ladies, while the rest of the men were crowded together at the back of the room. And then besides, completely absorbed, it seemed, in repeating, at the top of his voice, amusing stories to the enraptured lady, M. de Charlus was dispensed from the necessity of going to shake hands with any of the others, was set free, in other words, from all social duties. Behind the scented barrier in which the beauty of his choice enclosed him, he was isolated amid a crowded drawing-room, as, in a crowded theatre or concert-hall, behind the rampart of a box; and when anyone came up to greet him, through, so to speak, the beauty of his companion, it was permissible for him to reply quite curtly and without interrupting his business of conversation with a lady. Certainly Mme. Swann was scarcely of the rank of the people with whom he liked thus to flaunt himself. But he professed admiration for her, friendship for Swann, he knew that she would be flattered by his attentions and was himself flattered at being compromised by the prettiest woman in the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis meanwhile was not too well pleased to receive a visit from M. de Charlus. He, while admitting serious defects in his aunt\u2019s character, was genuinely fond of her. But every now and then, carried away by anger, by an imaginary grievance, he would sit down and write to her without making any attempt to resist his impulse, letters full of the most violent abuse, in which in made the most of trifling incidents which until then he seemed never even to have noticed. Among other examples I may instance the following, which my stay at Balbec brought to my knowledge-Mme. de Villeparisis, fearing that she had not brought enough money with her to Balbec to enable her to prolong her holiday there, and not caring since she was of a thrifty disposition and shrank from unnecessary expenditure, to have money sent to her from Paris, had borrowed three thousand francs from M. de Charlus. A month later, annoyed, for some trivial reason, with his aunt, he asked her to repay him this sum by telegraph. He received two thousand nine hundred and ninety-odd francs. Meeting his aunt a few days later in Paris, in the course of a friendly conversation, he drew her attention, with the utmost politeness, to the mistake that her banker had made when sending the money. \u201cBut there was no mistake,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cthe money order cost six francs seventy-five.\u201d \u201cOh, of course, if it was intentional, it is all right,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cI mentioned it only in case you didn\u2019t know, because in that case, if the bank had done the same thing with anyone who didn\u2019t know you as well as I do, it might have led to unpleasantness.\u201d \u201cNo, no, there was no mistake.\u201d \u201cAfter all, you were quite right,\u201d M. de Charlus concluded easily, stooping to kiss his aunt\u2019s hand. And in fact he bore no resentment and was only amused at this little instance of her thrift. But some time afterwards, imagining that, in a family matter, his aunt had been trying to get the better of him and had \u2018worked up a regular conspiracy\u2019 against him, as she took shelter, foolishly enough, behind the lawyers with whom he suspected her of having plotted to undo him, he had written her a letter boiling over with insolence and rage. \u201cI shall not be satisfied with having my revenge,\u201d he added as a postscript; \u201cI shall take care to make you a laughing-stock. Tomorrow I shall tell everyone the story of the money order and the six francs seventy-five you kept back from me out of the three thousand I lent you; I shall disgrace you publicly.\u201d Instead of so doing, he had gone to his aunt the next day to beg her pardon, having already regretted a letter in which he had used some really terrible language. But apart from this, to whom could he have told the story of the money order? Seeking no longer vengeance but a sincere reconciliation, now was the time for him to keep silence. But already he had repeated the story everywhere, while still on the best of terms with his aunt; he had told it without any malice, as a joke, and because he was the soul of indiscretion. He had repeated the story, but without Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s knowledge. With the result that, having learned from his letter that he intended to disgrace her by making public a transaction in which he had told her with his own lips that she had acted rightly, she concluded that he had been deceiving her from the first, and had lied when he pretended to be fond of her. This storm had now died down, but neither of them knew what opinion exactly the other had of her or him. This sort of intermittent quarrel is of course somewhat exceptional. Of a different order were the quarrels of Bloch and his friends. Of a dif \u2014 ferent order again were those of M. de Charlus, as we shall presently see, with people wholly unlike Mme. de Villeparisis. In spite of which we must bear in mind that the opinions which we hold of one another, our relations with friends and kinsfolk, are in no sense permanent, save in appearance, but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself. Whence all the rumours of divorce between couples who have always seemed so perfectly united and will soon afterwards speak of one another with affection, hence all the terrible things said by one friend of another from whom we supposed him to be inseparable and with whom we shall find him once more reconciled before we have had time to recover from our surprise; all the ruptures of alliances, after so short a time, between nations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, my uncle and Mme. Swann are getting warm over there!\u201d remarked Saint-Loup. \u201cAnd look at Mamma in the innocence of her heart going across to disturb them. To the pure all things are pure, I suppose!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I studied M. de Charlus. The tuft of his grey hair, his eye, the brow of which was raised by his monocle to emit a smile, the red flowers in his buttonhole formed, so to speak, the three mobile apices of a convulsive and striking triangle. I had not ventured to bow to him, for he had given me no sign of recognition. And yet, albeit he had not turned his head in my direction, I was convinced that he had seen me; while he repeated some story to Mme. Swann, whose sumptuous, pansy-coloured cloak floated actually over the Baron\u2019s knee, his roving eye, like that of a street hawker who is watching all the time for the \u2018tecs\u2019 to appear, had certainly explored every corner of the room and taken note of all the people who were in it. M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault came up to bid him good day without any indication on M. de Charlus\u2019s face that he had seen the young Duke until he was actually standing in front of him. In this way, in fairly numerous gatherings such as this, M. de Charlus kept almost continuously on show a smile without any definite direction or particular object, which, pre-existing before the greetings of new arrivals, found itself, when these entered its zone, devoid of any indication of friendliness towards them. Nevertheless, it was obviously my duty to go across and speak to Mme. Swann. But as she was not certain whether I already knew Mme. de Marsantes and M. de Charlus, she was distinctly cold, fearing no doubt that I might ask her to introduce me to them. I then made my way to M. de Charlus, and at once regretted it, for though he could not have helped seeing me he shewed no sign whatsoever. As I stood before him and bowed I found standing out from his body, which it prevented me from approaching by the full length of his outstretched arm, a finger widowed, one would have said, of an episcopal ring, of which he appeared to be offering, for the kiss of the faithful, the consecrated site, and I was made to appear to have penetrated, without leave from the Baron and by an act of trespass for which he would hold me permanently responsible, the anonymous and vacant dispersion of his smile. This coldness was hardly of a kind to encourage Mme. Swann to melt from hers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow tired and worried you look,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes to her son who had come up to greet M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And indeed the expression in Robert\u2019s eyes seemed every minute to reach a depth from which it rose at once like a diver who has touched bottom This bottom which hurt Robert so when he touched it that he left it at once, to return to it a moment later, was the thought that he had quarrelled with his mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever mind,\u201d his mother went on, stroking his cheek, \u201cnever mind; it\u2019s good to see my little boy again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this show of affection seeming to irritate Robert, Mme. de Marsantes led her son away to the other end of the room where in an alcove hung with yellow silk a group of Beauvais armchairs massed their violet-hued tapestries like purple irises in a field of buttercups. Mme. Swann, finding herself alone and having realised that I was a friend of Saint-Loup, beckoned to me to come and sit beside her. Not having seen her for so long I did not know what to talk to her about. I was keeping an eye on my hat, among the crowd of hats that littered the carpet, and I asked myself with a vague curiosity to whom one of them could belong which was not that of the Duc de Guermantes and yet in the lining of which a capital \u2018G\u2019 was surmounted by a ducal coronet. I knew who everyone in the room was, and could not think of anyone whose hat this could possibly be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a pleasant man M. de Norpois is,\u201d I said to Mme. Swann, looking at the Ambassador. \u201cIt is true, Robert de Saint-Loup says he\u2019s a pest, but . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is quite right,\u201d she replied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing from her face that she was thinking of something which she was keeping from me, I plied her with questions. For the satisfaction of appearing to be greatly taken up by some one in this room where she knew hardly anyone, she took me into a corner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sure this is what M. de Saint-Loup meant,\u201d she began, \u201cbut you must never tell him I said so, for he would think me indiscreet, and I value his esteem very highly; I am an \u2018honest Injun,\u2019 don\u2019t you know. The other day, Charlus was dining at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s; I don\u2019t know how it was, but your name was mentioned. M. de Norpois seems to have told them \u2014 it\u2019s all too silly for words, don\u2019t go and worry yourself to death over it, nobody paid any attention, they all knew only too well the mischievous tongue that said it \u2014 that you were a hypocritical little flatterer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have recorded a long way back my stupefaction at the discovery that a friend of my father, such as M. de Norpois was, could have expressed himself thus in speaking of me. I was even more astonished to learn that my emotion on that evening long ago when I had asked him about Mme. Swann and Gilberte was known to the Princesse de Guermantes, whom I imagined never to have heard of my existence. Each of our actions, our words, our attitudes is cut off from the \u2018world,\u2019 from the people who have not directly perceived it, by a medium the permeability of which is of infinite variation and remains unknown to ourselves; having learned by experience that some important utterance which we eagerly hoped would be disseminated (such as those so enthusiastic speeches which I used at one time to make to all comers and on every occasion on the subject of Mme. Swann) has found itself, often simply on account of our anxiety, immediately hidden under a bushel, how immeasurably less do we suppose that some tiny word, which we ourselves have forgotten, or else a word never ottered by us but formed on its course by the imperfect refraction of a different word, can be transported without ever halting for any obstacle to infinite distances \u2014 in the present instance to the Princesse de Guermantes \u2014 and succeed in diverting at our expense the banquet of the gods. What we actually recall of our conduct remains unknown to our nearest neighbour; what we have forgotten that we ever said, or indeed what we never did say, flies to provoke hilarity even in another planet, and the image that other people form of our actions and behaviour is no more like that which we form of them ourselves, than is like an original drawing a spoiled copy in which, at one point, for a black line, we find an empty gap, and for a blank space an unaccountable contour. It may be, all the same, that what has not been transcribed is some non-existent feature which we behold merely in our purblind self-esteem, and that what seems to us added is indeed a part of ourselves, but so essential a part as to have escaped our notice. So that this strange print which seems to us to have so little resemblance to ourselves bears sometimes the same stamp of truth, scarcely flattering, indeed, but profound and useful, as a photograph taken by X-rays. Not that that is any reason why we should recognise ourselves in it. A man who is in the habit of smiling in the glass at his handsome face and stalwart figure, if you shew him their radiograph, will have, face to face with that rosary of bones, labelled as being the image of himself, the same suspicion of error as the visitor to an art gallery who, on coming to the portrait of a girl, reads in his catalogue: \u201cDromedary resting.\u201d Later on, this discrepancy between our portraits, according as it was our own hand that drew them or another, I was to register in the case of others than myself, living placidly in the midst of a collection of photographs which they themselves had taken while round about them grinned frightful faces, invisible to them as a rule, but plunging them in stupor if an accident were to reveal them with the warning: \u201cThis is you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few years earlier I should have been only too glad to tell Mme. Swann in what connexion I had fawned upon M. de Norpois, since the connexion had been my desire to know her. But I no longer felt this desire, I was no longer in love with Gilberte. On the other hand I had not succeeded in identifying Mme. Swann with the lady in pink of my childhood. Accordingly I spoke of the woman who was on my mind at the moment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you see the Duchesse de Guermantes just now?\u201d I asked Mme. Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But since the Duchess did not bow to Mme. Swann when they met, the latter chose to appear to regard her as a person of no importance, whose presence in a room one did not even remark\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know; I didn\u2019t realise her,\u201d she replied sourly, using an expression borrowed from England\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was anxious nevertheless for information with regard not only to Mme. de Guermantes but to all the people who came in contact with her, and (for all the world like Bloch), with the tactlessness of people who seek in their conversation not to give pleasure to others but to elucidate, from sheer egoism, facts that are interesting to themselves, in my effort to form an exact idea of the life of Mme. de Guermantes I questioned Mme de Villeparisis about Mme. Leroi\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, I know who\u2019 you mean,\u201d she replied with an affectation of contempt, \u201cthe daughter of those rich timber people. I\u2019ve heard that she\u2019s begun to go about quite a lot lately, but I must explain to you that I am rather old now to make new acquaintances. I have known such interesting such delightful people in my time that really I do not believe Mme. Lerol would be any addition to what I already have.\u201d Mme. de Marsantes, who was playing lady in waiting to the Marquise, presented me to the Prince and, while she was still doing so, M. de Norpois also presented me in the most glowing terms. Perhaps he found it convenient to do me a courtesy which could in no way damage his credit since I had just been presented, perhaps it was because he thought that a foreigner, even so distinguished a foreigner, was unfamiliar with French society and might think that he was having introduced to him a young man of fashion, perhaps to exercise one of his prerogatives, that of adding the weight of his personal recommendation as an Ambassador, or in his taste for the archaic to revive in the Prince\u2019s honour the old custom, flattering to his rank, that two sponsors were necessary if one wished to be presented\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis appealed to M. de Norpois, feeling it imperative that I should have his assurance that she had nothing to regret in not knowing Mme. Leroi\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAm I not right, M. l\u2019Ambassadeur, Mme. Leroi is quite uninteresting, isn\u2019t she, quite out of keeping with the people who come here; I was quite right not to make friends with her, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether from independence or because he was tired, M. de Norpois replied merely in a bow full of respect but devoid of meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir,\u201d went on Mme. de Villeparisis with a laugh, \u201cthere are some absurd people in the world. Would you believe that I had a visit this afternoon from a gentleman who tried to persuade me that he found more pleasure in kissing my hand than a young woman\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I guessed at once that this was Legrandin. M. de Norpois smiled with a slight quiver of the eyelid, as though such a remark had been prompted by a concupiscence so natural that one could not find fault with the person who had uttered it, almost as though it were the beginning of a romance which he was prepared to forgive, if not to encourage, with the perverse indulgence of a Voisenon or the younger Cr\u00e9billon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMany young women\u2019s hands would be incapable of doing what I see there,\u201d said the Prince, pointing to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s unfinished water-colours. And he asked her whether she had seen the flower paintings by Fantin-Latour which had recently been exhibited\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey are of the first order, and indicate, as people say nowadays, a fine painter, one of the masters of the palette,\u201d declared M. de Norpois; \u201cI consider, all the same, that they stand no comparison with these, in which I find it easier to recognise the colouring of the flower.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even supposing that the partiality of an old lover, the habit of flattering people, the critical standard admissible in a small circle, had dictated this speech to the ex-Ambassador, it proved upon what an absolute vacuum of true taste the judgment of people in society is based, so arbitrary that the smallest trifle can make it rush to the wildest absurdities, on the way to which it is stopped, held up by no genuinely felt impression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI claim no credit for knowing about flowers, I\u2019ve lived all my life among the fields,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis modestly. \u201cBut,\u201d she added graciously, turning to the Prince, \u201cif I did, when I was quite a girl, form a rather more serious idea of them than children generally do in the country, I owe that to a distinguished fellow-countryman of yours, Herr von Schlegel. I met him at Broglie, when I was staying there once with my aunt Cordelia (Marshal de Castellane\u2019s wife, don\u2019t you know?). I remember so well M. Lebrun, M. de Salvandy, M. Doudan, getting him to talk about flowers. I was only a little girl, I wasn\u2019t able to follow all he said. But he liked playing with me, and when he went back to your country he sent me a beautiful botany book to remind me of a drive we took together in a phaeton to the Val Richer, when I fell asleep on his knee. I have got the book still, and it taught me to observe many things about flowers which I should not have noticed otherwise. When Mme. de Barante published some of Mme. de Broglie\u2019s letters, charming and affected like herself, I hoped to find among them some record of those conversations with Herr von Schlegel. But she was a woman who looked for nothing from nature but arguments in support of religion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and his mother were\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou have been good to me,\u201d I said, \u201chow can I thank you? Can we dine together to-morrow?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo-morrow? Yes, if you like, but it will have to be with Bloch. I met him just now on the doorstep; he was rather stiff with me at first because I had quite forgotten to answer his last two letters. (At least, he didn\u2019t tell me that that was what had annoyed him, but I guessed it.) But after that he was so friendly to me that I simply can\u2019t disappoint him. Between ourselves, on his side at least, I can feel it\u2019s a life and death friendship.\u201d Nor do I consider that Robert was altogether mistaken. Furious detraction was often, with Bloch, the effect of a keen affection which he had supposed to be unreturned. And as he had little power of imagining the lives of other people, and never dreamed that one might have been ill, or away from home, or otherwise occupied, a week\u2019s silence was at once interpreted by him as meaning a deliberate coldness. And so I have never believed that his most violent outbursts as a friend, or in later years as a writer, went very deep. They rose to a paroxysm if one replied to them with an icy dignity, or by a platitude which encouraged him to redouble his onslaught, but yielded often to a warmly sympathetic attitude. \u201cAs for being good,\u201d went on Saint-Loup, \u201cyou say I have been to you, but I haven\u2019t been good at all, my aunt tells me that it\u2019s you who avoid her, that you never said a word to her. She wondered whether you had anything against her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately for myself, if I had been taken in by this speech, our departure, which I believed to be imminent, for Balbec would have prevented my making any attempt to see Mme. Guermantes again, to assure her that I had nothing against her, and so to put her under the necessity of proving that it was she who had something against me. But I had only to remind myself that she had not even offered to let me see her Elstirs. Besides, this was not a disappointment; I had never expected her to begin talking to me about them; I knew that I did not appeal to her, that I need have no hope of ever making her like me; the most that I had been able to look forward to was that, thanks to her kindness, I might there and then receive, since I should not be seeing her again before I left Paris, an entirely pleasing impression, which I could take with me to Balbec indefinitely prolonged, intact, instead of a memory broken by anxiety and sorrow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes kept on interrupting her conversation with Robert to tell me how often he had spoken to her about me, how fond he was of me; she treated me with a deference which almost hurt me because I felt it to be prompted by her fear of being embroiled, on my account, with this son whom she had not seen all day, with whom she was eager to be alone, and over whom she must accordingly have supposed that the influence which she wielded was not equal to and must conciliate mine. Having heard me, earlier in the afternoon, make some reference to Bloch\u2019s uncle, M. Nissim Bernard, Mme. de Marsantes inquired whether it was he who had at one time lived at Nice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn that case, he knew M. de Marsantes there before our marriage,\u201d she told me. \u201cMy husband used often to speak of him as an excellent man, with such a delicate, generous nature.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo think that for once in his life he wasn\u2019t lying! It\u2019s incredible,\u201d would have been Bloch\u2019s comment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All this time I should have liked to explain to Mme. de Marsantes that Robert felt infinitely more affection for her than for myself, and that had she shewn any hostility towards me it was not in my nature to attempt to set him against her, to detach him from her. But now that Mme. de Guermantes had left the room, I had more leisure to observe Robert, and I noticed then for the first time that, once again, a sort of flood of anger seemed to be coursing through him, rising to the surface of his stern and sombre features. I was afraid lest, remembering the scene in the theatre that afternoon, he might be feeling humiliated in my presence at having allowed himself to be treated so harshly by his mistress without making any rejoinder\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly he broke away from his mother, who had put her arm round his neck, and, coming towards me, led me behind the little flower-strewn counter at which Mme. de Villeparisis had resumed her seat, making a sign to me to follow him into the smaller room. I was hurrying after him when M. de Charlus, who must have supposed that I was leaving the house, turned abruptly from Prince von Faffenheim, to whom he had been talking, and made a rapid circuit which brought him face to face with me. I saw with alarm that he had taken the hat in the lining of which were a capital \u2018G\u2019 and a ducal coronet. In the doorway into the little room he said, without looking at me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs I see that you have taken to going into society, you must do me the pleasure of coming to see me. But it\u2019s a little complicated,\u201d he went on with a distracted, calculating air, as if the pleasure had been one that he was afraid of not securing again once he had let slip the opportunity of arranging with me the means by which it might be realised. \u201cI am very seldom at home; you will have to write to me. But I should prefer to explain things to you more quietly. I am just going. Will you walk a short way with me? I shall only keep you a moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019d better take care, sir,\u201d I warned him; \u201cyou have picked up the wrong hat by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you want to stop me taking my own hat?\u201d I assumed, a similar mishap having recently occurred to myself, that someone else having taken his hat he had seized upon one at random, so as not to go home bare-headed, and that I had placed him in a difficulty by exposing his stratagem. I told him that I must say a few words to Saint-Loup. \u201cHe is still talking to that idiot the Duc de Guermantes,\u201d I added. \u201cThat really is charming; I shall tell my brother.\u201d \u201cOh! you think that would interest M. de Charlus?\u201d (I imagined that, if he had a brother, that brother must be called Charlus also. Saint-Loup had indeed explained his family tree to me at Balbec, but I had forgotten the details.) \u201cWho has been talking to you about M. de Charlus?\u201d replied the Baron in an arrogant tone. \u201cGo to Robert.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you took part this morning in one of those orgies that he has with a woman who is disgracing him. You would do well to use your influence with him to make him realise the pain he is causing his poor mother, and all of us, by dragging our name in the dirt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should have liked to reply that at this degrading luncheon the conversation had been entirely about Emerson, Ibsen and Tolstoy, and that the young woman had lectured Robert to make him drink nothing but water. In the hope of bringing some balm to Robert, whose pride had, I felt, been wounded, I sought to find an excuse for his mistress. I did not know that at that moment, in spite of his anger with her, it was on himself that he was heaping reproaches. But it always happens, even in quarrels between a good man and a worthless woman, and when the right is all on one side, that some trifle crops up which enables the woman to appear not to have been in the wrong on one point. And as she ignores all the other points, the moment the man begins to feel the need of her company, or is demoralised by separation from her, his weakness will make his conscience more exacting, he will remember the absurd reproaches that have been flung at him and will ask himself whether they have not some foundation in fact\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion I was wrong about that matter of the necklace,\u201d Robert said to me. \u201cOf course, I never meant for a moment to do anything wrong, but, I know very well, other people don\u2019t look at things in the same way as oneself. She had a very hard time when she was young. In her eyes, I was bound to appear just the rich man who thinks he can get anything he wants with his money, and with whom a poor person cannot compete, whether in trying to influence Boucheron or in a lawsuit. Of course she has been horribly cruel to me, when I have never thought of anything but her good. But I do see clearly, she believes that I wanted to make her feel that one could keep a hold on her with money, and that\u2019s not true. And she\u2019s so fond of me; what must she be thinking of me? Poor darling, if you only knew, she has such charming ways, I simply can\u2019t tell you, she has often done the most adorable things for me. How wretched she must be feeling now! In any case, whatever happens in the long run, I don\u2019t want to let her think me a cad; I shall dash off to Boucheron\u2019s and get the necklace. You never know; very likely when she sees me with it, she will admit that she\u2019s been in the wrong. Don\u2019t you see, it\u2019s the idea that she is suffering at this moment that I can\u2019t bear. What one suffers oneself one knows; that\u2019s nothing. But with her \u2014 to say to oneself that she\u2019s suffering and not to be able to form any idea of what she feels \u2014 I think I shall go mad in a minute \u2014 I\u2019d much rather never see her again than let her suffer. She can be happy without me, if she must; that\u2019s all I ask. Listen; you know, to me everything that concerns her is enormously important, it becomes something cosmic; I shall run to the jeweller\u2019s and then go and ask her to forgive me. But until I get down there what will she be thinking of me? If she could only know that I was on my way! What about your going down there and telling her? For all we know, that might settle the whole business. Perhaps,\u201d he went on with a smile, as though he hardly ventured to believe in so idyllic a possibility, \u201cwe can all three dine together in the country. But we can\u2019t tell yet. I never know how to handle her. Poor child. I shall perhaps only hurt her more than ever. Besides, her decision may be irrevocable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert swept me back to his mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood-bye,\u201d he said to her. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now. I don\u2019t know when I shall get leave again. Probably not for a month. I shall write as soon as I know myself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly Robert was not in the least of the type of son who, when he goes out with his mother, feels that an attitude of exasperation towards her ought to balance the smiles and bows which he bestows on strangers. Nothing is more common than this odious form of vengeance on the part of those who appear to believe that rudeness to one\u2019s own family is the natural complement to one\u2019s ceremonial behaviour. Whatever the wretched mother may say, her son, as though he had been taken to the house against his will and wished to make her pay dearly for his presence, refutes immediately, with an ironical, precise, cruel contradiction, the timidly ventured assertion; the mother at once conforms, though without thereby disarming him, to the opinion of this superior being of whom she will continue to boast to everyone, when he is not present, as having a charming nature, and who all the same spares her none of his keenest thrusts. Saint-Loup was not at all like this; but the anguish which Rachel\u2019s absence provoked in him brought it about that, for different reasons, he was no less harsh with his mother than the sons I have been describing are with theirs. And as she listened to him I saw the same throb, like that of a mighty wing, which Mme. de Marsantes had been unable to repress when her son first entered the room, convulse her whole body once again; but this time it was an anxious face, eyes wide with grief that she fastened on him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, Robert, you\u2019re going away? Seriously? My little son! The one day I\u2019ve seen anything of you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then quite softly, in the most natural tone, in a voice from which she strove to banish all sadness so as not to inspire her son with a pity which would perhaps have been painful to him, or else useless and might serve only to irritate him, like an argument prompted by plain common sense she added:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not at all nice of you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to this simplicity she added so much timidity, to shew him that she was not trespassing on his freedom, so much affection, so that he should not reproach her with spoiling his pleasures, that Saint-Loup could not fail to observe in himself as it were the possibility of a similar wave of affection, that was to say an obstacle to his spending the evening with his lady. And so he grew angry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but, nice or not, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he heaped on his mother the reproaches which no doubt he felt that he himself perhaps deserved; thus it is that egoists have always the last word; having laid down at the start that their determination is unshakeable, the more the sentiment in them to which one appeals to make them abandon it is touched, the more fault they find, not with themselves who resist the appeal but with those persons who put them under the necessity of resisting it, with the result that their own firmness may be carried to the utmost degree of cruelty, which only aggravates all the more in their eyes the culpability of the person who is so indelicate as to be hurt, to be in the right, and to cause them thus treacherously the pain of acting against their natural instinct of pity. But of her own accord Mme. de Marsantes ceased to insist, for she felt that she would not be able to keep him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shall leave you here,\u201d he said to me, \u201cbut you\u2019re not to keep him long, Mamma, because he\u2019s got to go somewhere else in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was fully aware that my company could not afford any pleasure to Mme. de Marsantes, but I preferred, by not going with Robert, not to let her suppose that I was involved in these pleasures which deprived her of him. I should have liked to find some excuse for her son\u2019s conduct, less from affection for him than from pity tor her. But it was she who spoke first\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoor boy,\u201d she began, \u201cI am sure I must have hurt him dreadfully. You see, Sir, mothers are such selfish creatures, after all he hasn\u2019t many pleasures, he comes so little to Paris. Oh, dear, if he hadn\u2019t gone already I should have liked to stop him, not to keep him of course, but just to tell him that I\u2019m not vexed with him, that I think he was quite right. Will you excuse me if I go and look over the staircase?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I accompanied her there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert! Robert!\u201d she called. \u201cNo; he\u2019s gone; we are too late.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment I would as gladly have undertaken a mission to make Robert break with his mistress as, a few hours earlier, to make him go and live with her altogether. In one case Saint-Loup would have regarded me as a false friend, in the other his family would have called me his evil genius. Yet I was the same man, at an interval of a few hours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We returned to the drawing-room. Seeing that Saint-Loup was not with us, Mme. de Villeparisis exchanged with M. de Norpois that dubious, derisive and not too pitying glance with which people point out to one another an over-jealous wife or an over-loving mother (spectacles which to outsiders are amusing), as much as to say: \u201cThere now, there\u2019s been trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert went to his mistress, taking with him the splendid ornament which, after what had been said on both sides, he ought not to have given her. But it came to the same thing, for she would not look at it, and even after their reconciliation he could never persuade her to accept it. Certain of Robert\u2019s friends thought that these proofs of disinterestedness which she furnished were deliberately planned to draw him closer to her. And yet she was not greedy about money, except perhaps to be able to spend it without thought. I have seen her bestow recklessly on people whom she believed to be in need the most insensate charity. \u201cAt this moment,\u201d Robert\u2019s friends would say to him, seeking to balance by their malicious words a disinterested action on Rachel\u2019s part, \u201cat this moment she will be in the promenade at the Folies-Berg\u00e8res. She\u2019s an enigma, that girl is, a regular sphinx.\u201d After all, how many women who are not disinterested, since they are kept by men, have we not seen, with a delicacy that flowers from their sordid existence, set with their own hands a thousand little limits to the generosity of their lovers?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert knew of scarcely any of the infidelities of his mistress, and tortured his mind over what were mere nothings compared with the real life of Rachel, a life which began every day only after he had left her. He knew of scarcely any of these infidelities. One could have told him of them without shaking his confidence in Rachel. For it is a charming law of nature which manifests itself in the heart of the most complex social organisms, that we live in perfect ignorance of those we love. On one side of the mirror the lover says to himself: \u201cShe is an angel, she will never yield herself to me, I may as well die \u2014 and yet she does care for me; she cares so much that perhaps \u2014 but no, it can never possibly happen.\u201d And in the exaltation of his desire, in the anguish of waiting, what jewels he flings at the feet of this woman, how he runs to borrow money to save her from inconvenience; meanwhile, on the other side of the screen, through which their conversation will no more carry than that which visitors exchange outside the glass wall of an aquarium, the public are saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t know her? I congratulate you, she has robbed, in fact ruined I don\u2019t know how many men. There isn\u2019t a worse girl in Paris. She\u2019s a common swindler. And cunning isn\u2019t the word!\u201d And perhaps the public are not entirely wrong in their use of the last epithet, for indeed the sceptical man who is not really in love with the woman and whom she merely attracts says to his friends: \u201cNo, no, my dear fellow, she is not in the least a prostitute; I don\u2019t say she hasn\u2019t had an adventure or two in her time, but she\u2019s not a woman one pays, she\u2019d be a damned sight too expensive if she was. With her it\u2019s fifty thousand francs or nothing.\u201d Well, he has spent fifty thousand francs on her, he has had her once, but she (finding, moreover, a willing accomplice in the man himself) has managed to persuade him that he is one of those who have had her for nothing. Such is society, in which every one of us has two aspects, in which the most obvious, the most notorious faults will never be known by a certain other person save embedded in, under the protection of a shell, a smooth cocoon, a delicious curiosity of nature. There were in Paris two thoroughly respectable men to whom Saint-Loup no longer bowed, and could not refer without a tremor in his voice, calling them exploiters of women: this was because they had both been ruined by Rachel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI blame myself for one thing only,\u201d Mme. de Marsantes murmured in my ear, \u201cand that was my telling him that he wasn\u2019t nice to me. He, such an adorable, unique son, there\u2019s no one else like him in the world, the only time I see him, to have told him he wasn\u2019t nice to me, I would far rather he\u2019d beaten me, because I am sure that whatever pleasure he may be having this evening, and he hasn\u2019t many, will be spoiled for him by that unfair word. But, Sir, I mustn\u2019t keep you, since you\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anxiously, Mme. de Marsantes bade me good-bye. These sentiments bore upon Robert; she was sincere. But she ceased to be, to become a great lady once more\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have been so interested, so glad to have this little talk with you. Thank you! Thank you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with a humble air she fastened on me a look of gratitude, of exhilaration, as though my conversation were one of the keenest pleasures that she had experienced in her life. These charming glances went very well with the black flowers on her white skirt; they were those of a great lady who knew her business\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I am in no hurry,\u201d I replied; \u201cbesides, I must wait for M. de Charlus; I am going with him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis overheard these last words. They appeared to vex her. Had the matter in question not been one which could not possibly give rise to such a sentiment, it might have struck me that what seemed to be at that moment alarmed in Mme. de Villeparisis was her modesty. But this hypothesis never even entered my mind. I was delighted with Mme. de Guermantes, with Saint-Loup, with Mme. de Marsantes, with M. de Charlus, with Mme. de Villeparisis; I did not stop to reflect, and I spoke light-heartedly and at random\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re going from here with my nephew Palam\u00e8de?\u201d she asked me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking that it might produce a highly favourable impression on Mme. de Villeparisis if she learned that I was on intimate terms with a nephew whom she esteemed so greatly, \u201cHe has asked me to go home with him,\u201d I answered blithely. \u201cI am so glad. Besides, we are greater friends than you think, and I\u2019ve quite made up my mind that we\u2019re going to be better friends still.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From being vexed, Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to have grown anxious. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for him,\u201d she said to me, with a preoccupied air. \u201cHe is talking to M. de Faffenheim. He\u2019s certain to have forgotten what he said to you. You\u2019d much better go, now, quickly, while his back is turned.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first emotion shewn by Mme. de Villeparisis would have suggested, but for the circumstances, offended modesty. Her insistence, her opposition might well, if one had studied her face alone, have appeared to be dictated by virtue. I was not, myself, in any hurry to join Robert and his mistress. But Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to make such a point of my going that, thinking perhaps that she had some important business to discuss with her nephew, I bade her good-bye. Next to her M. de Guermantes, superb and Olympian, was ponderously seated. One would have said that the notion omnipresent in all his members, of his vast riches gave him a particular high density, as though they had been melted in a crucible into a single human ingot to form this man whose value was so immense. At the moment of my saying good-bye to him he rose politely from his seat, and I could feel the dead weight of thirty millions which his old-fashioned French breeding set in motion, raised, until it stood before me. I seemed to be looking at that statue of Olympian Zeus which Phidias is said to have cast in solid gold. Such was the power that good breeding had over M. de Guermantes over the body of M. de Guermantes at least, for it had not an equal mastery over the ducal mind. M. de Guermantes laughed at his own jokes, but did not unbend to other people\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I went downstairs I heard behind me a voice calling out to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo this is how you wait for me, is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if we go a little way on foot?\u201d he asked dryly, when we were in the courtyard. \u201cWe can walk until I find a cab that suits me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wished to speak to me about something, Sir?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh yes, as a matter of fact there were some things I wished to say to you, but I am not so sure now whether I shall. As far as you are concerned, I am sure that they might be the starting-point which would lead you to inestimable benefits. But I can see also that they would bring into my existence, at an age when one begins to value tranquillity, a great loss of time, great inconvenience. I ask myself whether you are worth all the pains that I should have to take with you, and I have not the pleasure of knowing you well enough to be able to say. Perhaps also to you yourself what I could do for you does not appear sufficiently attractive for me to give, myself so much trouble, for I repeat quite frankly that for me it can only be trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I protested that, in that case, he must not dream of it. This summary end to the discussion did not seem to be to his liking\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat sort of politeness means nothing,\u201d he rebuked me coldly. \u201cThere is nothing so pleasant as to give oneself trouble for a person who is worth one\u2019s while. For the best of us, the study of the arts, a taste for old things, collections, gardens are all mere ersatz, succedanea, alibis. In the heart of our tub, like Diogenes, we cry out for a man. We cultivate begonias, we trim yews, as a last resort, because yews and begonias submit to treatment. But we should like to give our time to a plant of human growth, if we were sure that he was worth the trouble. That is the whole question: you must know something about yourself. Are you worth my trouble or not?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI would not for anything in the world, Sir, be a cause of anxiety to you,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut so far as I am concerned you may be sure that everything which comes to me from you will be a very great pleasure to me. I am deeply touched that you should be so kind as to take notice of me in this way and try to help me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Greatly to my surprise, it was almost with effusion that he thanked me for this speech, slipping his arm through mine with that intermittent familiarity which had already struck me at Balbec, and was in such contrast to the coldness of his tone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith the want of consideration common at your age,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou are liable to say things at times which would open an unbridgeable gulf between us. What you have said just now, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that touches me, and makes me want to do a great deal for you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As he walked arm in arm with me and uttered these words, which, albeit tinged with contempt, were so affectionate, M. de Charlus now fastened his gaze on me with that intense fixity which had struck me the first morning, when I saw him outside the casino at Balbec, and indeed many years before that, through the pink hawthorns, standing beside Mme. Swann, whom I supposed then to be his mistress, in the park at Tansonville; now let it stray around him and examine the cabs which at this time of the day were passing in considerable numbers on the way to their stables, looking so determinedly at them that several stopped, the drivers supposing that he wished to engage them. But M. de Charlus immediately dismissed them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re not what I want,\u201d he explained to me, \u201cit\u2019s all a question of the colour of their lamps, and the direction they\u2019re going in. I hope, Sir,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you will not in any way misinterpret the purely disinterested and charitable nature of the proposal which I am going to make to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was struck by the similarity of his diction to Swann\u2019s, closer now than at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou have enough intelligence, I suppose, not to imagine that it is from want of society, from any fear of solitude and boredom that I have recourse to you. I do not, as a rule, care to talk about myself, but you may possibly have heard \u2014 it was alluded to in a leading article in The Times, which made a considerable impression \u2014 that the Emperor of Austria, who has always honoured me with his friendship, and is good enough to insist on keeping up terms of cousinship with me, declared the other day in an interview which was made public that if the Comte de Chambord had had by his side a man as thoroughly conversant with the undercurrents of European politics as myself he would be King of France to-day. I have often thought, Sir, that there was in me, thanks not to my own humble talents but to circumstances which you may one day have occasion to learn, a sort of secret record of incalculable value, of which I have not felt myself at liberty to make use, personally, but which would be a priceless acquisition to a young man to whom I would hand over in a few months what it has taken me more than thirty years to collect, what I am perhaps alone in possessing. I do not speak of the intellectual enjoyment which you would find in learning certain secrets which a Michelet of our day would give years of his life to know, and in the light of which certain events would assume for him an entirely different aspect. And I do not speak only of events that have already occurred, but of the chain of circumstances.\u201d (This was a favourite expression with M. de Charlus, and often, when he used it, he joined his hands as if in prayer, but with his fingers stiffened, as though to illustrate by their complexity the said circumstances, which he did not specify, and the chain that linked them.) \u201cI could give you an explanation that no one has dreamed of, not only of the past but of the future.\u201d M. de Charlus broke off to question me about Bloch, whom he had heard discussed, though without appearing to be listening, in his aunt\u2019s drawing-room. And with that ironical accent he so skilfully detached what he was saying that he seemed to be thinking of something else altogether and to be speaking mechanically, simply out of politeness. He asked if my friend was young, good looking and so forth. Bloch, if he had heard him would have been more puzzled even than with M. de Norpois, but for very different reasons, to know whether M. de Charlus was for or against Drey, fus. \u201cIt is not a bad idea, if you wish to learn about life,\u201d went on M. de Charlus when he had finished questioning me, \u201cto include among your friends an occasional foreigner.\u201d I replied that Bloch was French. \u201cIndeed,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cI took him to be a Jew.\u201d His assertion of this incompatibility made me suppose that M. de Charlus was more anti-Dreyfusard than anyone I had met. He protested, however, against the charge of treason levelled against Dreyfus. But his protest took this form: \u201cI understand the newspapers to say that Dreyfus has committed a crime against his country \u2014 so I understand, I pay no attention to the newspapers, I read them as I wash my hands, without finding that it is worth my while to take any interest in what I am doing. In any case, the crime is non-existent, your friend\u2019s compatriot would have committed a crime if he had betrayed Judaea, but what has he to do with France?\u201d I pointed out that if there should be a war the Jews would be mobilised just as much as anyone else. \u201cPerhaps so, and I am not sure that it would not be an imprudence. If we bring over Senegalese and Malagasies, I hardly suppose that their hearts will be in the task of defending France, which is only natural. Your Dreyfus might rather be convicted of a breach of the laws of hospitality. But we need not discuss that. Perhaps you could ask your friend to allow me to be present at some great festival in the Temple, at a circumcision, with Jewish chants. He might perhaps take a hall, and give me some biblical entertainment, as the young ladies of Saint-Cyr performed scenes taken from the Psalms by Racine, to amuse Louis XIV. You might even arrange parties to give us a good laugh. For instance a battle between your friend and his father, in which he would smite him as David smote Goliath. That would make quite an amusing farce. He might even, while he was about it, deal some stout blows at his hag (or, as my old nurse would say, his \u2018haggart\u2019) of a mother. That would be an excellent show, and would not be unpleasing to us, eh, my young friend, since we like exotic spectacles, and to thrash that non-European creature would be giving a well-earned punishment to an old camel.\u201d As he poured out this terrible, almost insane language, M. de Charlus squeezed my arm until it ached. I reminded myself of all that his family had told me of his wonderful kindness to this old nurse, whose Moli\u00e8resque vocabulary he had just quoted, and thought to myself that the connexions, hitherto, I felt, little studied, between goodness and wickedness in the same heart, various as they might be, would be an interesting subject for research\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I warned him that, anyhow, Mme. Bloch no longer existed, while as for M. Bloch, I questioned to what extent he would enjoy a sport which might easily result in his being blinded. M. de Charlus seemed annoyed. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis a woman who made a great mistake in dying. As for blinding him, surely the Synagogue is blind, it does not perceive the truth of the Gospel. In any case, think, at this moment, when all these unhappy Jews are trembling before the stupid fury of the Christians, what an honour it would be for him to see a man like myself condescend to be amused by their sports.\u201d At this point I caught sight of M. Bloch senior, who was coming towards us, probably on his way to meet his son. He did not see us but I offered to introduce him to M. de Charlus. I had no conception of the torrent of rage which my words were to let loose. \u201cIntroduce him to me! But you must have singularly little idea of social values! People do not get to know me as easily as that. In the present instance, the awkwardness would be twofold, on account of the youth of the introducer and the unworthiness of the person introduced. At the most, if I am ever permitted to enjoy the Asiatic spectacle which I suggested to you, I might address to the horrible creature a few words indicative of generous feeling. But on condition that he allows himself to be thoroughly thrashed by his son, I might go so far as to express my satisfaction.\u201d As it happened, M. Bloch paid no attention to us. He was occupied in greeting Mme. Sazerat with a series of sweeping bows, which were very favourably received. I was surprised at this, for in the old days at Combray she had been indignant at my parents for having young Bloch in the house, so anti-semitic was she then. But Dreyfusism, like a strong gust of wind, had, a few days before this, wafted M. Bloch to her feet. My father\u2019s friend had found Mme. Sazerat charming and was particularly gratified by the anti-semitism of the lady, which he regarded as a proof of the sincerity of her faith and the soundness of her Dreyfusard opinions, and also as enhancing the value of the call which she had authorised him to pay her. He had not even been offended when she had said to him stolidly: \u201cM. Drumont has the impudence to put the Revisionists in the same bag as the Protestants and the Jews. A delightful promiscuity!\u201d \u201cBernard,\u201d he had said with pride, on reaching home, to M. Nissim Bernard, \u201cyou know, she has that prejudice!\u201d But M. Nissim Bernard had said nothing, only raising his eyes to heaven in an angelic gaze. Saddened by the misfortunes of the Jews, remembering his old friendships with Christians, grown mannered and precious with increasing years, for reasons which the reader will learn in due course, he had now the air of a pre-Raphaelite ghost on to which hair had been incongruously grafted, like threads in the heart of an opal. \u201cAll this Dreyfus business,\u201d went on the Baron, still clasping me by the arm, \u201chas only one drawback. It destroys society (I do not say polite society; society has long ceased to deserve that laudatory epithet) by the influx of Mr. and Mrs. Camels and Camelfies and Camelyards, astonishing creatures whom I find even in the houses of my own cousins, because they belong to the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, or the Anti-Jewish, or some such league, as if a political opinion entitled one to any social qualification.\u201d This frivolity in M. de Charlus brought out his family likeness to the Duchesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I remarked to him on the resemblance. As he appeared to think that I did not know her, I reminded him of the evening at the Opera when he had seemed to be trying to avoid me. He assured me with such insistence that he had never even seen me there that I should have begun to believe him, if presently a trifling incident had not led me to think that M. de Charlus, in his excessive pride perhaps, did not care to be seen with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet us return to yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cand my plans for you. There exists among certain men, Sir, a freemasonry of which I cannot now say more than that it numbers in its ranks four of the reigning sovereigns of Europe Now, the courtiers of one of these are trying to cure him of his fancy. That is a very serious matter, and may bring us to war. Yes, Sir, that is a fact You remember the story of the man who believed that he had the Princess of China shut up in a bottle. It was a form of insanity. He was cured of it, But as soon as he ceased to be mad he became merely stupid. There are maladies which we must not seek to cure because they alone protect us from others that are more serious. A cousin of mine had trouble with his stomach; he could not digest anything. The most learned specialists on the stomach treated him, with no effect. I took him to a certain doctor (another highly interesting man, by the way, of whom I could tell you a great deal). He guessed at once that the trouble was nervousness; he persuaded his patient, ordered him to eat whatever he liked quite boldly and assured him that his digestion would stand it. But my cousin had nephritis also. What the stomach can digest perfectly well the kidneys cease, after a time, to eliminate, and my cousin, instead of living to a good old age with an imaginary disease of the stomach which obliged him to keep to a diet, died at forty with his stomach cured but his kidneys ruined. Given a very considerable advantage over people of your age, for all one knows, you will perhaps become what some eminent man of the past might have been if a good angel had revealed to him, in the midst of a humanity that knew nothing of them, the secrets of steam and electricity. Do not be foolish, do not refuse from discretion. Understand that, if I do you a great service, I expect my reward from you to be no less great. It is many years now since people in society ceased to interest me. I have but one passion left, to seek to redeem the mistakes of my life by conferring the benefit of my knowledge on a soul that is still virgin and capable of being inflamed by virtue. I have had great sorrows, Sir, of which I may tell you perhaps some day; I have lost my wife, who was the loveliest, the noblest, the most perfect creature that one could dream of seeing. I have young relatives who are not \u2014 I do not say worthy, but who are not capable of accepting the moral heritage of which I have been speaking. For all I know, you may be he into whose hands it is to pass, he whose life I shall be able to direct and to raise to so lofty a plane. My own would gain in return. Perhaps in teaching you the great secrets of diplomacy I might recover a taste for them myself, and begin at last to do things of real interest in which you would have an equal share. But before I can tell I must see you often, very often, every day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was thinking of taking advantage of this unexpected kindness on M. de Charlus\u2019s part to ask him whether he could not arrange for me to meet his sister-in-law when, suddenly, I felt my arm violently jerked, as though by an electric shock. It was M. de Charlus who had hurriedly withdrawn his arm from mine. Although as he talked he had allowed his eyes to wander in all directions he had only just caught sight of M. d\u2019Argencourt, who was coming towards us from a side street. On seeing us, M. d\u2019Argencourt appeared worried, cast at me a look of distrust, almost that look intended for a creature of another race than one\u2019s own with which Mme. de Guermantes had quizzed Bloch, and tried to avoid us. But one would have said that M. de Charlus was determined to shew him that he was not at all anxious not to be seen by him, for he called to him, simply to tell him something that was of no importance. And fearing perhaps that M. d\u2019Argencourt had not recognised me, M. de Charlus informed him that I was a great friend of Mme. de Villeparisis, of the Duchesse de Guermantes, of Robert de Saint-Loup, and that he himself, Charlus, was an old friend of my grandmother, and glad to be able to shew her grandson a little of the affection that he felt for her. Nevertheless I observed that M. d\u2019Argencourt, albeit I had barely been introduced to him at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, and M. de Charlus had now spoken to him at great length about my family, was distinctly colder to me than he had been in the afternoon; and for a long time he shewed the same aloofness whenever we met. He watched me now with a curiosity in which there was no sign of friendliness, and seemed even to have to overcome an instinctive repulsion when, on leaving us, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, he held out a hand to me which he at once withdrew\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sorry about that,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cThat fellow Argencourt, well born but ill bred, more than feeble as a diplomat, an impossible husband, always running after women like a person in a play, is one of those men who are incapable of understanding but perfectly capable of destroying the things in life that are really great. I hope that our friendship will be one of them, if it is ever to be formed, and I hope also that you will honour me by keeping it \u2014 as I shall \u2014 well clear of the heels of any of those donkeys who, from idleness or clumsiness or deliberate wickedness trample upon what would seem to have been made to endure. Unfortunately, that is the mould in which most of the men one meets have been cast.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes seems to be very clever. We were talking this afternoon about the possibility of war. It appears that she is specially well informed on that subject.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe is nothing of the sort,\u201d replied M. de Charlus tartly. \u201cWomen, and most men, for that matter, understand nothing of what I was going to tell you. My sister-in-law is a charming woman who imagines that we are still living in the days of Balzac\u2019s novels, when women had an influence on Politics. Going to her house could at present have only a bad effect on you, as for that matter going anywhere. That was one of the very things I was just going to tell you when that fool interrupted me. The first sacrifice that you must make for me \u2014 I shall claim them from you in proportion to the gifts I bestow on you \u2014 is to give up going into society. It distressed me this afternoon to see you at that idiotic tea-party. You may remind me that I Was there myself, but for me it was not a social gathering, it was simply a family visit. Later on, when you have established your position, if it amuses you to step down for a little into that sort of thing, it may perhaps, do no harm. And then, I need not point out how invaluable I can be to you. The \u2018Open Sesame\u2019 to the Guermantes house and any others that it is worth while throwing open the doors of to you, rests with me I shall be the judge, and intend to remain master of the situation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought I would take advantage of what M. de Charlus had said about my call on Mme. de Villeparisis to try to find out what position exactly she occupied in society, but the question took another form on my lips than I had intended, and I asked him instead what the Villeparisis family was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat is absolutely as though you had asked me what the Nobody family was,\u201d replied M. de Charlus. \u201cMy aunt married, for love, a M Thirion, who was extremely rich, for that matter, and whose sisters had married surprisingly well; and from that day onwards he called himself Marquis de Villeparisis. It did no harm to anyone, at the most a little to himself, and very little! What his reason was I cannot tell; I suppose he was actually a \u2018Monsieur de Villeparisis,\u2019 a gentleman born at Villeparisis, which as you know is the name of a little place outside Paris. My aunt tried to make out that there was such a Marquisate in the family, she wanted to put things on a proper footing; I can\u2019t tell you why. When one takes a name to which one has no right it is better not to copy the regular forms.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis being merely Mme. Thirion completed the fall which had begun in my estimation of her when I had seen the composite nature of her party. I felt it to be unfair that a woman whose title and name were of quite recent origin should be able thus to impose upon her contemporaries, with the prospect of similarly imposing upon posterity, by virtue of her friendships with royal personages. Now that she had become once again what I had supposed her to be in my childhood, a person who had nothing aristocratic about her, these distinguished kinsfolk who gathered round her seemed to remain alien to her. She did not cease to be charming to us all. I went occasionally to see her and she sent me little presents from time to time. But I had never any impression that she belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and if I had wanted any information about it she would have been one of the last people to whom I should have applied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt present,\u201d went on M. de Charlus, \u201cby going into society, you will only damage your position, warp your intellect and character. Also, you must be particularly careful in choosing your friends. Keep mistresses, if your family have no objection, that doesn\u2019t concern me, indeed I can only advise it, you young rascal, young rascal who will soon have to start shaving,\u201d he rallied me, passing his fingers over my chin. \u201cBut the choice of your men friends is more important. Eight out of ten young men are little scoundrels, little wretches capable of doing you an injury which you will never be able to repair. Wait, now, my nephew Saint-Loup is quite a suitable companion for you, at a pinch. As far as your future is concerned, he can be of no possible use to you, but for that I am sufficient. And really when all\u2019s said and done, as a person to go about with, at times when you have had enough of me, he does not seem to present any serious drawback that I know of. At any rate he is a man, not one of those effeminate creatures one sees so many of nowadays, who look like little renters, and at any moment may bring their innocent victims to the gallows.\u201d I did not know the meaning of this slang word \u2018renter\u2019; anyone who had known it would have been as greatly surprised by his use of it as myself. People in society always like talking slang, and people against whom certain things may be hinted like to shew that they are not afraid to mention them. A proof of innocence in their eyes. But they have lost their sense of proportion, they are no longer capable of realising the point at which a certain pleasantry will become too technical, too shocking, will be a proof rather of corruption than of simplicity. \u201cHe is not like the rest of them; he has nice manners; he is really serious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could not help smiling at this epithet \u2018serious,\u2019 to which the intonation that M. de Charlus gave to it seemed to impart the sense of \u2018virtuous,\u2019 of \u2018steady,\u2019 as one says of a little shop-girl that she is \u2018serious.\u2019 At this moment a cab passed, zigzagging along the street; a young cabman, who had deserted his box, was driving it from inside, where he lay sprawling upon the cushions, apparently half drunk. M. de Charlus instantly stopped him. The driver began to argue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhich way are you going?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYours.\u201d This surprised me, for M. de Charlus had already refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to get up on the box. D\u2019you mind if I stay down here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; but you must put down the hood. Well, think over my proposal,\u201d said M. de Charlus, preparing to leave me, \u201cI give you a few days to consider my offer; write to me. I repeat, I shall need to see you every day, and to receive from you guarantees of loyalty, of discretion which, for that matter, you do appear, I must say, to furnish. But in the course of my life I have been so often taken in by appearances that I never wish to trust them again. Damn it, it\u2019s the least you can expect that before giving up a treasure I should know into what hands it is going to pass. Very well, bear in mind what I\u2019m offering you; you are like Hercules\u2019 (though, unfortunately for yourself, you do not appear to me to have quite his muscular development) at the parting of the ways. Try not to have to regret all your life not having chosen the way that leads to virtue. Hallo!\u201d he turned to the cabman, \u201chaven\u2019t you put the hood down? I\u2019ll do it myself. I think, too, I\u2019d better drive, seeing the state you appear to be in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He jumped in beside the cabman, took the reins, and the horse trotted off\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for myself, no sooner had I turned in at our gate than I found the pendant to the conversation which I had heard exchanged that afternoon between Bloch and M. de Norpois, but in another form, brief, inverted and cruel. This was a dispute between our butler, who believed in Dreyfus, and the Guermantes\u2019, who was an anti-Dreyfusard. The truths and counter-truths which came in conflict above ground, among the intellectuals of the rival Leagues, the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise and the Droits de l\u2019Homme, were fast spreading downwards into the subsoil of popular opinion. M. Reinach was manipulating, by appeals to sentiment, people whom he had never seen, while for himself the Dreyfus case simply presented itself to his reason as an incontrovertible theory which he proved in the sequel by the most astonishing victory for rational policy (a victory against France, according to some) that the world has ever seen. In two years he replaced a Billot by a Clemenceau Ministry, revolutionised public opinion from top to bottom, took Picquart from his prison to install him, ungrateful, in the Ministry of War. Perhaps this rationalist manipulator of crowds was himself the puppet of his ancestry. When we find that the systems of philosophy which contain the most truths were dictated to their authors, in the last analysis, by reasons of sentiment, how are we to suppose that in a simple affair of politics like the Dreyfus case reasons of this order may not, unknown to the reasoner, have controlled his reason. Bloch believed himself to have been led by a logical sequence to choose Dreyfusism, yet he knew that his nose, skin and hair had been imposed on him by his race. Doubtless the reason enjoys more freedom; yet it obeys certain laws which it has not prescribed for itself. The case of the Guermantes\u2019 butler and our own was peculiar. The waves of the two currents of Dreyfusism and anti-Dreyfusism which now divided France from end to end were, on the whole, silent, but the occasional echoes which they emitted were sincere. When you heard anyone in the middle of a conversation which was being deliberately kept off the Case announce furtively some piece of political news, generally false, but always with a hopefulness of its truth, you could induce from the nature of his predictions where his heart lay. Thus there came into conflict on certain points, on one side a timid apostolate, on the other a righteous indignation. The two butlers whom I heard arguing as I came in furnished an exception to the rule. Ours let it be understood that Dreyfus was guilty, the Guermantes\u2019 butler that he was innocent. This was done not to conceal their personal convictions, but from cunning, and in the keenness of their rivalry. Our butler, being uncertain whether the fresh trial would be ordered, wished beforehand, in the event of failure, to deprive the Duke\u2019s butler of the joy of seeing a just cause vanquished. The Duke\u2019s butler thought that, in the event of a refusal, ours would be more indignant at the detention on the Devil\u2019s Isle of an innocent man. The porter looked on. I had the impression that it was not he who was the cause of dissension in the Guermantes household\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went upstairs, and found my grandmother not so well. For some time past, without knowing exactly what was wrong, she had been complaining of her health. It is in moments of illness that we are compelled to recognise that we live not alone but chained to a creature of a different kingdom, whole worlds apart, who has no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body. Say that we met a brigand by the way; we might yet convince him by an appeal to his personal interest, if not to our own plight. But to ask pity of our body is like discoursing before an octopus, for which our words can have no more meaning than the sound of the tides, and with which we should be appalled to find ourselves condemned to live. My grandmother\u2019s attacks passed, often enough-unnoticed by the attention which she kept always diverted to ourselves. When the pain was severe, in the hope of curing it, she would try in vain to understand what the trouble was. If the morbid phenomena of which her body was the theatre remained obscure and beyond the reach of her mind, they were clear and intelligible to certain creatures belonging to the same natural kingdom as themselves, creatures to which the human mind has learned gradually to have recourse in order to understand what the body is saying to it, as when a foreigner accosts us we try to find some one belonging to his country who will act as interpreter. These can talk to our body, and tell us if its anger is serious or will soon be appeased. Cottard, whom we had called in to see my grandmother, and who had infuriated us by asking with a dry smile, the moment we told him that she was ill: \u201cIll? You\u2019re sure it\u2019s not what they call a diplomatic illness?\u201d He tried to soothe his patient\u2019s restlessness by a milk diet. But incessant bowls of milk soup gave her no relief, because my grandmother sprinkled them liberally with salt (the toxic effects of which were as yet, Widal not having made his discoveries, unknown). For, medicine being a compendium of the successive and contradictory mistakes of medical practioners, when we summon the wisest of them to our aid, the chances are that we may be relying on a scientific truth the error of which will be recognised in a few years\u2019 time. So that to believe in medicine would be the height of folly, if not to believe in it were not greater folly still, for from this mass of errors there have emerged in the course of time many truths. Cottard had told us to take her temperature. A thermometer was fetched. Throughout almost all its length it was clear of mercury. Scarcely could one make out, crouching at the foot of the tube, in its little cell, the silver salamander. It seemed dead. The glass reed was slipped into my grandmother\u2019s mouth. We had no need to leave it there for long; the little sorceress had not been slow in casting her horoscope. We found her motionless, perched half-way up her tower, and declining to move, shewing us with precision the figure that we had asked of her, a figure with which all the most careful examination that my grandmother\u2019s mind could have devoted to herself would have been incapable of furnishing her: 101 degrees. For the first time we felt some anxiety. We shook the thermometer well, to erase the ominous line, as though we were able thus to reduce the patient\u2019s fever simultaneously with the figure shewn on the scale. Alas, it was only too clear that the little sibyl, unreasoning as she was, had not pronounced judgment arbitrarily, for the next day, scarcely had the thermometer been inserted between my grandmother\u2019s lips when almost at once, as though with a single bound, exulting in her certainty and in her intuition of a fact that to us was imperceptible, the little prophetess had come to a halt at the same point, in an implacable immobility, and pointed once again to that figure 101 with the tip of her gleaming wand. Nothing more did she tell us; in vain might we long, seek, pray, she was deaf to our entreaties; it seemed as though this were her final utterance, a warning and a menace. Then, in an attempt to constrain her to modify her response, we had recourse to another creature of the same kingdom, but more potent, which is not content with questioning the body but can command it, a febrifuge of the same order as the modern aspirin, which had not then come into use. We had not shaken the thermometer down below 99.5, and hoped that it would not have to rise from there. We made my grandmother swallow this drug and then replaced the thermometer in her mouth. Like an implacable warder to whom one presents a permit signed by a higher authority whose protecting influence one has sought and who, finding it to be in order, replies: \u201cVery well; I have nothing to say; if it\u2019s like that you may pass,\u201d this time the watcher in the tower dirt not move. But sullenly she seemed to be saying: \u201cWhat use will that be to you? Since you are friends with quinine, she may give me the order not to go up, once, ten times, twenty times. And then she will grow tired of telling me, I know her; get along with you. This won\u2019t last for ever. And then you\u2019ll be a lot better off.\u201d Thereupon my grandmother felt the presence within her of a creature which knew the human body better than herself, the presence of a contemporary of the races that have vanished from the earth, the presence of earth\u2019s first inhabitant \u2014 long anterior to the creation of thinking man \u2014 she felt that aeonial ally who was sounding her, a little roughly even, in the head, the heart, the elbow; he found out the weak places, organised everything for the prehistoric combat which began at once to be fought. In a moment a trampled Python, the fever, was vanquished by the potent chemical substance to which my grandmother, across the series of kingdoms, reaching out beyond all animal and vegetable life, would fain have been able to give thanks. And she remained moved by this glimpse which she had caught, through the mists of so many centuries, of a climate anterior to the creation even of plants. Meanwhile the thermometer, like a Weird Sister momentarily vanquished by some more ancient god, held motionless her silver spindle. Alas! other inferior creatures which man has trained to the chase of the mysterious quarry which he cannot pursue within the pathless forest of himself, reported cruelly to us every day a certain quantity of albumen, not large, but constant enough for it also to appear to bear relation to some persistent malady which we could not detect. Bergotte had shocked that scrupulous instinct in me which made me subordinate my intellect when he spoke to me of Dr. du Boulbon as of a physician who would not bore me, who would discover methods of treatment which, however strange they might appear, would adapt themselves to the singularity of my mind. But ideas transform themselves in us, they overcome the resistance with which we at first meet them, and feed upon rich intellectual reserves which we did not know to have been prepared for them. So, as happens whenever anything we have heard said about some one whom we do not know has had the faculty of awakening in us the idea of great talent, of a sort of genius, in my inmost mind I gave Dr. du Boulbon the benefit of that unlimited confidence which he inspires in us who with an eye more penetrating than other men\u2019s perceives the truth. I knew indeed that he was more of a specialist in nervous diseases, the man to whom Charcot before his death had predicted that he would reign supreme in neurology and psychiatry. \u201cAh! I don\u2019t know about that. It\u2019s quite possible,\u201d put in Fran\u00e7oise, who was in the room and heard Charcot\u2019s name, as she heard du Boulbon\u2019s, for the first time But this in no way prevented her from saying \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Her \u2018possibles,\u2019 her \u2018perhapses,\u2019 her \u2018I don\u2019t knows\u2019 were peculiarly irritating at such a moment. One wanted to say to her: \u201cNaturally you don\u2019t know, since you haven\u2019t the faintest idea of what we are talking about, how can you even say whether it\u2019s possible or not; you know nothing about it. Anyhow, you can\u2019t say now that you don\u2019t know what Charcot said to du Boulbon. You do know because we have just told you, and your \u2018perhapses\u2019 and \u2018possibles\u2019 don\u2019t come in, because it\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In spite of this more special competence in cerebral and nervous matters, as I knew that du Boulbon was a great physician, a superior man, of a profound and inventive intellect, I begged my mother to send for him, and the hope that, by a clear perception of the malady, he might perhaps cure it, carried the day finally over the fear that we had of (if we called in a specialist) alarming my grandmother. What decided my mother was the fact that, encouraged unconsciously by Cottard, my grandmother no longer went out of doors, and scarcely rose from her bed. In vain might she answer us in the words of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9\u2018s letter on Mme. de la Fayette: \u201cEveryone said she was mad not to wish to go out. I said to these persons, so headstrong in their judgment: \u2018Mme. de la Fayette is not mad!\u2019 and I stuck to that. It has taken her death to prove that she was quite right not to go out.\u201d Du Boulbon when he came decided against \u2014 if not Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, whom we did not quote to him \u2014 my grandmother, at any rate. Instead of sounding her chest, fixing on her steadily his wonderful eyes, in which there was perhaps the illusion that he was making a profound scrutiny of his patient, or the desire to give her that illusion, which seemed spontaneous but must be mechanically produced, or else not to let her see that he was thinking of something quite different, or simply to obtain the mastery over her, he began talking about Bergotte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should think so, indeed, he\u2019s magnificent, you are quite right to admire him. But which of his books do you prefer? Indeed! Well, perhaps that is the best after all. In any case it is the best composed of his novels. Claire is quite charming in it; of his male characters which appeals to you most?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I supposed at first that he was making her talk like this about literature because he himself found medicine boring, perhaps also to display his breadth of mind and even, with a more therapeutic aim, to restore confidence to his patient, to shew her that he was not alarmed, to take her mind from the state of her health. But afterwards I realised that, being distinguished particularly as an alienist and by his work on the brain, he had been seeking to ascertain by these questions whether my grandmother\u2019s memory was in good order. As though reluctantly he began to inquire about her past life, fixing a stern and sombre eye on her. Then suddenly, as though catching sight of the truth and determined to reach it at all costs, with a preliminary rubbing of his hands, which he seemed to have some difficulty in wiping dry of the final hesitations which he himself might feel and of all the objections which we might have raised, looking down at my grandmother with a lucid eye, boldly and as though he were at last upon solid ground, punctuating his words in a quiet, impressive tone, every inflexion of which bore the mark of intellect, he began. (His voice, for that matter, throughout this visit remained what it naturally was, caressing. And under his bushy brows his ironical eyes were full of kindness.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou will be quite well, Madame, on the day \u2014 when it comes, and it rests entirely with you whether it comes to-day \u2014 on which you realise that there is nothing wrong with you, and resume your ordinary life. You tell me that you have not been taking your food, not going out?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I have a temperature.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He laid a finger on her wrist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot just now, at any rate. Besides, what an excuse! Don\u2019t you know that we keep out in the open air and overfeed tuberculous patients with temperatures of 102?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I have a little albumen as well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou ought not to know anything about that. You have what I have had occasion to call \u2018mental albumen.\u2019 We have all of us had, when we have not been very well, little albuminous phases which our doctor has done his best to make permanent by calling our attention to them. For one disorder that doctors cure with drugs (as I am told that they do occasionally succeed in doing) they produce a dozen others in healthy subjects by inoculating them with that pathogenic agent a thousand times more virulent than all the microbes in the world, the idea that one is ill. A belief of that sort, which has a disturbing effect on any temperament, acts with special force on neurotic people. Tell them that a shut window is open behind their back, they will begin to sneeze; make them believe that you have put magnesia in their soup, they will be seized with colic; that their coffee is stronger than usual, they will not sleep a wink all night. Do you imagine, Madame, that I needed to do any more than look into your eyes, listen to the way in which you express yourself, look, if I may say so, at this lady, your daughter, and at your grandson, who takes so much after you, to learn what was the matter with you?\u201d \u201cYour grandmother might perhaps go and sit, if the Doctor allows it, in some quiet path in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, near that laurel shrubbery where you used to play when you were little,\u201d said my mother to me, thus indirectly consulting Dr. du Boulbon, her voice for that reason assuming a tone of timid deference which it would not have had if she had been addressing me alone. The Doctor turned to my grandmother and, being apparently as well-read in literature as in science, adjured her as follows: \u201cGo to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Madame, to the laurel shrubbery which your grandson loves. The laurel you will find health-giving. It purifies. After he had exterminated the serpent Python, it was with a bough of laurel in his hand that Apollo made his entry into Delphi. He sought thus to guard himself from the deadly germs of the venomous monster. So you see that the laurel is the most ancient, the most venerable and, I will add \u2014 what is of therapeutic as well as of prophylactic value \u2014 the most beautiful of antiseptics.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In as much as a great part of what doctors know is taught them by the sick, they are easily led to believe that this knowledge which patients exhibit is common to them all, and they pride themselves on taking the patient of the moment by surprise with some remark picked up at a previous bedside. Thus it was with the superior smile of a Parisian who, in conversation with a peasant, might hope to surprise him by using suddenly a word of the local dialect that Dr. du Boulbon said to my grandmother: \u201cProbably a windy night will make you sleep when the strongest soporifics would have no effect.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, Sir, when the wind blows I can never sleep at all.\u201d But doctors are touchy people. \u201cAch!\u201d muttered du Boulbon, knitting his brows, as if some one had trodden on his toe, or as if my grandmother\u2019s sleeplessness on stormy nights were a personal insult to himself. He had not, however, an undue opinion of himself, and since, in his character as a \u2018superior\u2019 person, he felt himself bound not to put any faith in medicine, he quickly recovered his philosophic serenity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother, in her passionate longing for reassurance from Bergotte\u2019S friend, added in support of his verdict that a first cousin of my grandmother, who suffered from a nervous complaint, had lain for seven years cloistered in her bedroom at Combray, without leaving her bed more than once or twice a week\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou see, Madame, I didn\u2019t know that, and yet I could have told you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I am not in the least like her; on the contrary, my doctor complains that he cannot get me to stay in bed,\u201d said my grandmother, whether because she was a little annoyed by the doctor\u2019s theories, or was anxious to submit to him any objections that might be raised to them, in the hope that he would refute these and that, after he had gone, she would no longer find any doubt lurking in her own mind as to the accuracy of his encouraging diagnosis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, naturally, Madame, you cannot have all the forms of \u2014 if you\u2019ll excuse my saying so \u2014 mania at once; you have others, but not that particular one. Yesterday I visited a home for neurasthenics. In the garden, I saw a man standing on a seat, motionless as a fakir, his neck bent in a position which must have been highly uncomfortable. On my asking him what he was doing there, he replied, without turning his head, or moving a muscle: \u2018You see, Doctor, I am extremely rheumatic and catch cold very easily; I have just been taking a lot of exercise, and while I was getting hot, like a fool, my neck was touching my flannels. If I move it away from my flannels now before letting myself cool down, I am certain to get a stiff neck, and possibly bronchitis.\u2019 Which he would, in fact, have done. \u2018You\u2019re a fine specimen of neurasthenia, that\u2019s what you are,\u2019 I told him. And do you know what argument he advanced to prove that I was mistaken? It was this; that while all the other patients in the place had a mania for testing their weight, so much so that the weighing machine had to be padlocked so that they should not spend the whole day on it, he had to be lifted on to it bodily, so little did he care to be weighed. He prided himself on not sharing the mania of the others without thinking that he had also one of his own, and that it was this which saved him from the other. You must not be offended by the comparison, Madame, for the man who dared not turn his neck for fear of catching a chill is the greatest poet of our day. That poor maniac is the most lofty intellect that I know. Submit to being called a neurotic. You belong to that splendid and pitiable family which is the salt of the earth. All the greatest things We know have come to us from neurotics. It is they and they only who have founded religions and created great works of art. Never will the world be conscious of how much it owes to them, nor above all of what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it. We enjoy fine music, beautiful pictures, a thousand exquisite things, but we do not know what they cost those who wrought them in sleeplessness, tears, spasmodic laughter, rashes, asthma, epilepsy a terror of death which is worse than any of these, and which you perhaps have felt, Madame,\u201d he added with a smile at my grandmother, \u201cfor confess now, when I came into the room, you were not feeling very confident You thought that you were ill; dangerously ill, perhaps. Heaven only knows what the disease was of which you thought you had detected the symptoms. And you were not mistaken; they were there. Neurosis has an absolute genius for malingering. There is no illness which it cannot counterfeit perfectly. It will produce life-like imitations of the dilatations of dyspepsia, the sicknesses of pregnancy, the broken rhythm of the cardiac, the feverishness of the consumptive. If it is capable of deceiving the doctor how should it fail to deceive the patient? No, no; you mustn\u2019t think I\u2019m making fun of your sufferings. I should not undertake to heal them unless I understood them thoroughly. And, well, they say there\u2019s no good confession unless it\u2019s mutual. I have told you that without nervous trouble there can be no great artist. What is more,\u201d he added, raising a solemn forefinger, \u201cthere can be no great scientist either. I will go further, and say that, unless he himself is subject to nervous trouble, he is not, I won\u2019t say a good doctor, but I do say the right doctor to treat nervous troubles. In nervous pathology a doctor who doesn\u2019t say too many foolish things is a patient half-cured, just as a critic is a poet who has stopped writing verse and a policeman a burglar who has retired from practice. I, Madame, I do not, like you, fancy myself to be suffering from albuminuria, I have not your nervous fear of food, nor of fresh air, but I can never go to sleep without getting out of bed at least twenty times to see if my door is shut. And in that home where I found the poet yesterday who would not move his neck, I had gone to secure a room, for \u2014 this is between ourselves \u2014 I spend my holidays there looking after myself when I have increased my own trouble by wearing myself out in the attempt to cure other people.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut do you want me to take a cure like that, Sir?\u201d came to a frightened voice from my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is not necessary, Madame. The symptoms which you describe will vanish at my bidding. Besides, you have with you a very efficient person whom I appoint as your doctor from now onwards. That is your trouble itself, the super-activity of your nerves. Even if I knew how to cure you of that, I should take good care not to. All I need do is to control it. I see on your table there one of Bergotte\u2019s books. Cured of your neurosis you would no longer care for it. Well, I might feel it my duty to substitute for the joys that it procures for you a nervous stability which would be quite incapable of giving you those joys. But those joys themselves are a strong remedy, the strongest of all perhaps. No; I have nothing to say against your nervous energy. All I ask is that it should listen to me; I leave you in its charge. It must reverse its engines. The force which it is now using to prevent you from getting up, from taking sufficient food, let it employ in making you eat, in making you read, in making you go out, and in distracting you in every possible way. You needn\u2019t tell me that you are fatigued. Fatigue is the organic realisation of a preconceived idea. Begin by not thinking it. And if ever you have a slight indisposition, which is a thing that may happen to anyone, it will be just as if you hadn\u2019t it, for your nervous energy will have endowed you with what M. de Talleyrand, in an expression full of meaning, called \u2018imaginary health.\u2019 See, it has begun to cure you already, you have been sitting up in bed listening to me without once leaning back on your pillows; your eye is bright, your complexion is good, I have been talking to you for half an hour by the clock and you have never noticed the time. Well, Madame, I shall now bid you good-day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, after seeing Dr. du Boulbon to the door, I returned to the room in which my mother was by herself, the oppression that had been weighing on me for the last few weeks lifted, I felt that my mother was going to break out with a cry of joy and would see my joy, I felt that inability to endure the suspense of the coming moment at which a person is going to be overcome with emotion in our presence, which in another category is a little like the thrill of fear that goes through one when one knows that somebody is going to come in and startle one by a door that is still closed; I tried to speak to Mamma but my voice broke, and, bursting into tears, I stayed for a long time, my head on her shoulder, crying, tasting, accepting, relishing my grief, now that I knew that it had departed from my life, as we like to exalt ourselves by forming virtuous plans which circumstances do not permit us to put into execution. Fran\u00e7oise annoyed me by her refusal to share in our joy. She was quite overcome because there had just been a terrible scene between the lovesick footman and the tale-bearing porter. It had required the Duchess herself, in her unfailing benevolence, to intervene, restore an apparent calm to the household and forgive the footman. For she was a good mistress, and that would have been the ideal \u2018place\u2019 if only she didn\u2019t listen to \u2018stories.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the last few days people had begun to hear of my grandmother\u2019s illness and to inquire for news of her. Saint-Loup had written to me: \u201cI do not wish to take advantage of a time when your dear grandmother is unwell to convey to you what is far more than mere reproaches, on a matter with which she has no concern. But I should not be speaking the truth were I to say to you, even out of politeness, that I shall ever forget the perfidy of your conduct, or that there can ever be any forgiveness for so scoundrelly a betrayal.\u201d But some other friends, supposing that my grandmother was not seriously ill (they may not even have known that she was ill at all), had asked me to meet them next day in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, to go with them from there to pay a call together, ending up with a dinner in the country, the thought of which appealed to me. I had no longer any reason to forego these two pleasures. When my grandmother had been told that it was now imperative, if she was to obey Dr. du Boulbon\u2019s orders, that she should go out as much as possible, she had herself at once suggested the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. It would be easy for me to escort her there; and, while she sat reading, to arrange with my friends where I should meet them later; and I should still be in time, if I made haste, to take the train with them to Ville d\u2019Avray. When the time came, my grandmother did not want to go out; she felt tired. But my mother, acting on du Boulbon\u2019s instructions, had the strength of mind to be firm and to insist on obedience. She was almost in tears at the thought that my grandmother was going to relapse again into her nervous weakness, which she might never be able to shake off. Never again would there be such a fine, warm day for an outing. The sun as it moved through the sky interspersed here and there in the broken solidity of the balcony its unsubstantial muslins, and gave to the freestone ledge a warm epidermis, an indefinite halo of gold. As Fran\u00e7oise had not had time to send a \u2018tube\u2019 to her daughter, she left us immediately after luncheon. She very kindly consented, however, to call first at Jupien\u2019s, to get a stitch put in the cloak which my grandmother was going to wear. Returning at that moment from my morning walk I accompanied her into the shop. \u201cIs it your young master who brings you here,\u201d Jupien asked Fran\u00e7oise, \u201cis it you who are bringing him to see me or is it some good wind and fortune that bring you both?\u201d For all his want of education, Jupien respected the laws of grammar as instinctively as M. de Guermantes, in spite of every effort, broke them. With Fran\u00e7oise gone and the cloak mended, it was time for my grandmother to get ready. Having obstinately refused to let Mamma stay in the room with her, she took, left to herself, an endless time over her dressing, and now that I knew her to be quite well, with that strange indifference which we feel towards our relatives so long as they are alive, which makes us put everyone else before them, I felt it to be very selfish of her to take so long, to risk making me late when she knew that I had an appointment with my friends and was dining at Ville d\u2019Avray. In my impatience I finally went downstairs without waiting for her, after I had twice been told that she was just ready. At last she joined me, without apologising to me, as she generally did, for having kept me waiting, flushed and bothered like a person who has come to a place in a hurry and has forgotten half her belongings, just as I was reaching the half-opened glass door which, without warming them with it in the least, let in the liquid, throbbing, tepid air from the street (as though the sluices of a reservoir had been opened) between the frigid walls of the passage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, if you\u2019re going to meet your friends I ought to have put on another cloak. I look rather poverty-stricken in this one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was startled to see her so flushed, and supposed that having begun by making herself late she had had to hurry over her dressing. When we left the cab at the end of the Avenue Gabriel, in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I saw my grandmother, without a word to me, turn aside and make her way to the little old pavilion with its green trellis, at the door of which I had once waited for Fran\u00e7oise. The same park-keeper who had been standing there then was still talking to Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s \u2018Marquise\u2019 when, following my grandmother who, doubtless because she was feeling sick, had her hand in front of her mouth, I climbed the steps of that little rustic theatre, erected there among the gardens. At the entrance, as in those circus booths where the clown, dressed for the ring and smothered in flour, stands at the door and takes the money himself for the seats, the \u2018Marquise,\u2019 at the receipt of custom, was still there in her place with her huge, uneven face smeared with a coarse plaster and her little bonnet of red flowers and black lace surmounting her auburn wig. But I do not suppose that she recognised me. The park-keeper, abandoning his watch over the greenery, with the colour of which his uniform had been designed to harmonise, was talking to her, on a chair by her side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019re still here?\u201d he was saying. \u201cYou don\u2019t think of retiring?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd what have I to retire for, Sir? Will you kindly tell me where I shall be better off than here, where I should live more at my ease, and with every comfort? And then there\u2019s all the coming and going, plenty of distraction; my little Paris, I call it; my customers keep me in touch with everything that\u2019s going on. Just to give you an example, there\u2019s one of them who went out not more than five minutes ago; he\u2019s a magistrate, in the very highest position there is. Very well, Sir,\u201d she cried with ardour, as though prepared to maintain the truth of this assertion by violence, should the agent of civic authority shew any sign of challenging its accuracy, \u201cfor the last eight years, do you follow me, every day God has made, regularly on the stroke of three he\u2019s been here, always polite, never saying one word louder than another, never making any mess; and he stays half an hour and more to read his papers and do his little jobs. There was one day he didn\u2019t come. I never noticed it at the time, but that evening, all of a sudden I said to myself: \u2018Why, that gentleman never came to-day; perhaps he\u2019s dead!\u2019 And that gave me a regular turn, you know, because, of course, I get quite fond of people when they behave nicely. And so I was very glad when I saw him come in again next day, and I said to him, I did: \u2018I hope there was nothing wrong yesterday, Sir?\u2019 Then he told me that it was his wife that had died, and he\u2019d been so put out, poor gentleman, what with one thing and another, he hadn\u2019t been able to come. He had that really sad look, you know, people have when they\u2019ve been married five-and-twenty years, and then the parting, but he seemed pleased, all the same, to be back here. You could see that all his little habits had been quite upset. I did what I could to make him feel at home. I said to him: \u2018Y\u2019 mustn\u2019t let go of things, Sir. Just come here the same as before, it will be a little distraction for you in your sorrow.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u2018Marquise\u2019 resumed a gentler tone, for she had observed that the guardian of groves and lawns was listening to her complacently and with no thought of contradiction, keeping harmlessly in its scabbard a sword which looked more like a horticultural implement or some symbol of a garden-god\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd besides,\u201d she went on, \u201cI choose my customers, I don\u2019t let everyone into my little parlours, as I call them. And doesn\u2019t the place just look like a parlour with all my flowers? Such friendly customers I have; there\u2019s always some one or other brings me a spray of nice lilac, or jessamine or roses; my favourite flowers, roses are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought that we were perhaps despised by this lady because we never brought any sprays of lilac or fine roses to her bower made me redden, and in the hope of making a bodily escape \u2014 or of being condemned only by default \u2014 from an adverse judgment, I moved towards the exit. But it is not always in this world the people who bring us fine roses to whom we are most friendly, for the \u2018Marquise,\u2019 thinking that I was bored, turned to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like me to open a little place for you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, on my declining:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo? You\u2019re sure you won\u2019t?\u201d she persisted, smiling. \u201cWell, just as you please. You\u2019re welcome to it, but I know quite well, not having to pay for a thing won\u2019t make you want to do it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment a shabbily dressed woman hurried into the place who seemed to be feeling precisely the want in question. But she did not belong to the \u2018Marquise\u2019s\u2019 world, for the latter, with the ferocity of a snob, flung at her:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve nothing disengaged, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWill they be long?\u201d asked the poor lady, reddening beneath the yellow flowers in her hat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Ma\u2019am, if you\u2019ll take my advice, you\u2019ll try somewhere else; you see, there are still these two gentlemen waiting, and I\u2019ve only one closet; the others are out of order.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot much money there,\u201d she explained when the other had gone. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort we want here, either; they\u2019re not clean, don\u2019t treat the place with respect, it would be your humble here that would have to spend the next hour cleaning up after her ladyship. I\u2019m not sorry to lose her penny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally my grandmother emerged, and feeling that she probably would not seek to atone by a lavish gratuity for the indiscretion that she had shewn by remaining so long inside, I beat a retreat, so as not to have to share in the scorn which the \u2018Marquise\u2019 would no doubt heap on her, and began strolling along a path, but slowly, so that my grandmother should not have to hurry to overtake me; as presently she did. I expected her to begin: \u201cI am afraid I\u2019ve kept you waiting; I hope you\u2019ll still be in time for your friends,\u201d but she did not utter a single word, so much so that, feeling a little hurt, I was disinclined to speak first; until looking up at her I noticed that as she walked beside me she kept her face turned the other way. I was afraid that her heart might be troubling her again. I studied her more carefully and was struck by the disjointedness of her gait. Her hat was crooked, her cloak stained; she had the confused and worried look, the flushed, slightly dazed face of a person who has just been knocked down by a carriage or pulled out of a ditch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was afraid you were feeling sick, Grandmamma; are you feeling better now?\u201d I asked her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Probably she thought that it would be impossible for her, without alarming me, not to make some answer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI heard the whole of her conversation with the keeper,\u201d she told me. \u201cCould anything have been more typical of the Guermantes, or the Verdurins and their little circle? Heavens, what fine language she put it all in!\u201d And she quoted, with deliberate application, this sentence from her own special Marquise, Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cAs I listened to them I thought that they were preparing for me the pleasures of a farewell.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such was the speech that she made me, a speech into which she had put all her critical delicacy, her love of quotations, her memory of the classics more thoroughly even than she would naturally have done, and as though to prove that she retained possession of all these faculties. But I guessed rather than heard what she said, so inaudible was the voice in which she muttered her sentences, clenching her teeth more than could be accounted for by the fear of being sick again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome!\u201d I said lightly, so as not to seem to be taking her illness too seriously, \u201csince your heart is bothering you, shall we go home now? I don\u2019t want to trundle a grandmother with indigestion about the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t like to suggest it, because of your friends,\u201d she replied. \u201cPoor boy! But if you don\u2019t mind, I think it would be wiser.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she uttered these words\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome!\u201d I said to her sharply, \u201cyou mustn\u2019t tire yourself talking; if your heart is bad, it\u2019s silly; wait till we get home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She smiled at me sorrowfully and gripped my hand. She had realised that there was no need to hide from me what I had at once guessed, that she had had a slight stroke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We made our way back along the Avenue Gabriel, through the strolling crowd. I left my grandmother to rest on a seat and went in search of a cab. She, in whose heart I always placed myself when I had to form an opinion of the most unimportant person, she was now closed to me, had become part of the world outside, and, more than from any casual passerby, I was obliged to keep from her what I thought of her condition, to say no word of my uneasiness. I could not have spoken of it to her in greater confidence than to a stranger. She had suddenly handed back to me the thoughts, the griefs which, from the days of my infancy, I had entrusted for all time to her keeping. She was not yet dead. I was already alone. And even those allusions which she had made to the Guermantes, to Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, to our conversations about the little clan, assumed an air of being without point or occasion, fantastic, because they sprang from the nullity of this very being who to-morrow possibly would have ceased to exist, for whom they would no longer have any meaning, from that nullity, incapable of conceiving them, which my grandmother would shortly be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Sir, I don\u2019t like to say no, but you have not made an appointment, you have no time fixed. Besides, this is not my day for seeing patients. You surely have a doctor of your own. I cannot interfere with his practice, unless he were to call me in for a consultation. It\u2019s a question of professional etiquette . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as I was signalling to a cabman, I had caught sight of the famous Professor E\u2014 \u2014 almost a friend of my father and grandfather, acquainted at any rate with them both, who lived in the Avenue Gabriel, and, with a sudden inspiration, had stopped him just as he was entering his house, thinking that he would perhaps be the very person to advise my grandmother. But he was evidently in a hurry and, after calling for his letters, seemed anxious to get rid of me, so that my only chance of speaking to him lay in going up with him in the lift, of which he begged me to allow him to work the switches himself, this being a mania with him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I am not asking you to see my grandmother here; you will realise from what I am trying to tell you that she is not in a fit state to come; what I am asking is that you should call at our house in half an hour\u2019s time, when I have taken her home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCall at your house! Really, Sir, you must not expect me to do that. I am dining with the Minister of Commerce. I have a call to pay first. I must change at once, and to make matters worse I have torn my coat and my\u2019 other one has no buttonholes for my. decorations. I beg you, please, to oblige me by not touching the switches. You don\u2019t know how the lift works; one can\u2019t be too careful. Getting that buttonhole made means more delay. Well, as I am a friend of your people, if your grandmother comes here at once I will see her. But I warn you that I shall be able to give her exactly a quarter of an hour, nor a moment more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had started off at once, without even getting out of the lift which Professor E\u2014\u2014-had himself set in motion to take me down again, casting a suspicious glance at me as he did so\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may, indeed, say that the hour of death is uncertain, but when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in a vague and remote expanse of time, it never occurs to us that it can have any connexion with the day that has already dawned, or may signify that death \u2014 or its first assault and partial possession of us, after which it will never leave hold of us again \u2014 may occur this very afternoon, so far from uncertain, this afternoon every hour of which has already been allotted to some occupation. You make a point of taking your drive every day so that in a month\u2019s time you will have had the full benefit of the fresh air; you have hesitated over which cloak you will take, which cabman to call, you are in the cab, the whole day lies before you, short because you have to be at home early, as a friend is coming to see you; you hope that it will be as fine again to-morrow; and you have no suspicion that death, which has been making its way towards you along another plane, shrouded in an impenetrable darkness, has chosen precisely this day of all days to make its appearance, in a few minutes\u2019 time, more or less, at the moment when the carriage has reached the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Perhaps those who are haunted as a rule by the fear of the utter strangeness of death will find something reassuring in this kind of death \u2014 in this kind of first contact with death \u2014 because death thus assumes a known, familiar guise of everyday life. A good luncheon has preceded it, and the same outing that people take who are in perfect health. A drive home in an open carriage comes on top of its first onslaught; ill as my grandmother was, there were, after all, several people who could testify that at six o\u2019clock, as we came home from the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, they had bowed to her as she drove past in an open carriage, in perfect weather. Legrandin, making his way towards the Place de la Concorde, raised his hat to us, stopping to look after us with an air of surprise. I, who was not yet detached from life, asked my grandmother if she had acknowledged his greeting, reminding her of his readiness to take offence. My grandmother, thinking me no doubt very frivolous, raised her hand in the air as though to say: \u201cWhat does it matter? It is not of the least importance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, one might have said that, a few minutes earlier, when I was looking for a cab, my grandmother was resting on a seat in the Avenue Gabriel, and that a little later she had driven past in an open carriage. But would that have been really true? The seat, for instance, to maintain its position at the side of an avenue \u2014 for all that it may be subjected also to certain conditions of equilibrium \u2014 has no need of energy. But in order that a living person may be stable, even when supported by a seat or in a carriage, there is required a tension of forces which we do not ordinarily perceive any more than we perceive (because its action is universal) atmospheric pressure. Possibly if we were to be hollowed out and then left to support the pressure of the air we might feel, in the moment that preceded our extinction, that terrible weight which there was nothing left in us to neutralise. Similarly when the abyss of sickness and death opens within us and we have no longer any resistance to offer to the tumult with which the world and our own body rush upon us, then to endure even the tension of our own muscles, the shudder that freezes us to the marrow, then even to keep ourselves motionless in what we ordinarily regard as nothing but the simple negative position of a lifeless thing requires, if we wish our head to remain erect and our eyes calm, an expense of vital energy and becomes the object of an exhausting struggle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if Legrandin had looked back at us with that astonished air, it was because to him, as to the other people who passed us then, in the cab in which my grandmother was apparently seated she had seemed to be foundering, sliding into the abyss, clinging desperately to the cushions which could barely arrest the downward plunge of her body, her hair in disorder, her eye wild, unable any longer to face the assault of the images which its pupil was not strong enough now to bear. She had appeared to them, although I was still by her side, submerged in that unknown world somewhere in which she had already received the blows, traces of which she still bore when I looked up at her a few minutes earlier in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, her hat, her face, her cloak left in disorder by the hand of the invisible angel with whom she had wrestled. I have thought, since, that this moment of her stroke cannot have altogether surprised my grandmother, that indeed she had perhaps foreseen it a long time back, had lived in expectation of it. She had not known, naturally, when this fatal moment would come, had never been certain, any more than those lovers whom a similar doubt leads alternately to found unreasonable hopes and unjustified suspicions on the fidelity of their mistresses. But it is rarely that these grave maladies, like that which now at last had struck her full in the face, do not take up their abode in the sick man for a long time before killing him, during which time they make haste, like a \u2018sociable\u2019 neighbour or tenant, to introduce themselves to him. A terrible acquaintance, not so much from the sufferings that it causes as from the strange novelty of the definite restriction which it imposes upon life. A woman sees herself dying, in these cases not at the actual moment of death but months, sometimes years before, when death has hideously come to dwell in her. The sufferer makes the acquaintance of the stranger whom she hears coming and going in her brain. She does not know him by sight, it is true, but from the sounds which she hears him regularly make she can form an idea of his habits. Is he a criminal? One morning, she can no longer hear him. He has gone. Ah! If it were only for ever! In the evening he has returned. What are his plans? Her specialist, put to the question, like an adored mistress, replies with avowals that one day are believed, another day fail to convince her. Or rather it is not the mistress\u2019s part but that of the servants one interrogates that the doctor plays. They are only third parties. The person whom we press for an answer, whom we suspect of being about to play us false, is life itself, and although we feel her to be no longer the same we believe in her still or at least remain undecided until the day on which she finally abandons us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I helped my grandmother into Professor E\u2014\u2014\u2018s lift and a moment later he came to us and took us into his consulting room. But there, busy as he was, his bombastic manner changed, such is the force of habit; for his habit was to be friendly, that is to say lively with his patients. Since he knew that my grandmother was a great reader, and was himself one also, he devoted the first few minutes to quoting various favourite passages of poetry appropriate to the glorious summer weather. He had placed her in an armchair and himself with his back to the light so as to have a good view of her. His examination was minute and thorough, even obliging me at one moment to leave the room. He continued it after my return, then, having finished, went on, although the quarter of an hour was almost at an end, repeating various quotations to my grandmother. He even made a few jokes, which were witty enough, though I should have preferred to hear them on some other occasion, but which completely reassured me by the tone of amusement in which he uttered them. I then remembered that M. Falli\u00e8res, the President of the Senate, had, many years earlier, had a false seizure, and that to the consternation of his political rivals he had returned a few days later to his duties and had begun, it was said, his preparations for a more or less remote succession to the Presidency of the Republic. My confidence in my grandmother\u2019s prompt recovery was all the more complete in that, just as I was recalling the example of M. Falli\u00e8res, I was distracted from following up the similarity by a shout of laughter, which served as conclusion to one of the Professor\u2019s jokes. After which he took out his watch, wrinkled his brows petulantly on seeing that he was five minutes late, and while he bade us good-bye rang for his other coat to be brought to him at once. I waited until my grandmother had left the room, closed the door and asked him to tell me the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is not the slightest hope,\u201d he informed me. \u201cIt is a stroke brought on by uraemia. In itself, uraemia is not necessarily fatal, but this case seems to me desperate. I need not tell you that I hope I am mistaken. Anyhow, you have Cottard, you\u2019re in excellent hands. Excuse me,\u201d he broke off as a maid came into the room with his coat over her arm. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m dining with the Minister of Commerce, and I have a call to pay first. Ah! Life is not all a bed of roses, as one is apt to think at your age.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he graciously offered me his hand. I had shut the door behind me, and a footman was shewing us into the hall when we heard a loud shout of rage. The maid had forgotten to cut and hem the buttonhole for the decorations. This would take another ten minutes. The Professor continued to storm while I stood on the landing gazing at a grandmother for whom there was not the slightest hope. Each of us is indeed alone. We started for home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sun was sinking, it burnished an interminable wall along which our cab had to pass before reaching the street in which we lived, a wall against which the shadow cast by the setting sun of horse and carriage stood out in black on a ruddy background, like a funeral car on some Pompeian terra-cotta. At length we arrived at the house. I made the invalid sit at the foot of the staircase in the hall, and went up to warn my mother. I told her that my grandmother had come home feeling slightly unwell, after an attack of giddiness. As soon as I began to speak, my mother\u2019s face was convulsed by the paroxysm of a despair which was yet already so resigned that I realised that for many years she had been holding herself quietly in readiness for an uncalendared but final day. She asked me no question; it seemed that, just as malevolence likes to exaggerate the sufferings of other people, so in her devotion she would not admit that her mother was seriously ill, especially with a disease which might affect the brain. Mamma shuddered, her eyes wept without tears, she ran to give orders for the doctor to be fetched at once; but when Fran\u00e7oise asked who was ill she could not reply, her voice stuck in her throat. She came running downstairs with me struggling to banish from her face the sob that contracted it. My grandmother was waiting below on the sofa in the hall, but, as soon as she heard us coming, drew herself together, stood up, and waved her hand cheerfully at Mamma. I had partially wrapped her head in a white lace shawl, telling her that it was so that she should not catch cold on the stairs. I had hoped that my mother would not notice the change in her face, the distortion of her mouth; my precaution proved unnecessary; my mother went up to my grandmother, kissed her hand as though it were that of her God, raised her up, carried her to the lift with infinite precautions in which there was, with the fear of hurting her by any clumsy movement, the humility of one who felt herself unworthy to touch the most precious thing, to her, in the world, but never once did she raise her eyes, nor look at the sufferer\u2019s face. Perhaps this was in order that my grandmother might not be saddened by the thought that the sight of her could alarm her daughter. Perhaps from fear of a grief so piercing that she dared not face it. Perhaps from reverence, because she did not feel it permissible to herself, without impiety, to remark the trace of any mental weakening on those venerated features. Perhaps to be better able to preserve intact in her memory the image of the true face of my grandmother, radiant with wisdom and goodness. So they went up side by side, my grandmother half hidden by her shawl, my mother turning away her eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile there was one person who never took hers from what could be made out of my grandmother\u2019s altered features, at which her daughter dared not look, a person who fastened on them a gaze wondering, indiscreet and of evil omen: this was Fran\u00e7oise. Not that she was not sincerely attached to my grandmother (indeed she had been disappointed and almost scandalised by the coldness shewn by Mamma, whom she would have liked to see fling herself weeping into her mother\u2019s arms), but she had a certain tendency always to look at the worse side of things, she had retained from her childhood two peculiarities which would seem to be mutually exclusive, but which when combined strengthened one another: the want of restraint common among people of humble origin who make no attempt to conceal the impression, in other words the painful alarm, aroused in them by the sight of a physical change which it would be in better taste to appear not to notice, and the unfeeling coarseness of the peasant who begins by tearing the wings off dragon-flies until she is allowed to wring the necks of chickens, and lacks that modesty which would make her conceal the interest that she feels in the sight of suffering flesh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, thanks to the faultless ministrations of Fran\u00e7oise, my grandmother had been put to bed, she discovered that she could speak much more easily, the little rupture or obstruction of a blood-vessel which had produced the uraemia having apparently been quite slight. And at once she was anxious not to fail Mamma in her hour of need, to assist her in the most cruel moments through which she had yet had to pass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, my child,\u201d she began, taking my mother\u2019s hand in one of her own, and keeping the other in front of her lips, so as to account for the slight difficulty which she still found in uttering certain words. \u201cSo this is all the pity you shew your mother! You look as if you thought that indigestion was quite a pleasant thing!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then for the first time my mother\u2019s eyes gazed passionately into those of my grandmother, not wishing to see the rest of her face, and she replied, beginning the list of those false promises which we swear but are unable to fulfil:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMamma, you will soon be quite well again, your daughter will see to that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And embodying all her dearest love, all her determination that her mother should recover, in a kiss to which she entrusted them, and which she followed with her mind, with her whole being until it flowered upon her lips, she bent down to lay it humbly, reverently upon the precious brow. My grandmother complained of a sort of alluvial deposit of bedclothes which kept gathering all the time in the same place, over her left leg, and from which she could never manage to free herself. But she did not realise that she was herself the cause of this (so that day after day she accused Fran\u00e7oise unjustly of not \u2018doing\u2019 her bed properly). By a convulsive movement she kept flinging to that side the whole flood of those billowing blankets of fine wool, which gathered there like the sand in a bay which is very soon transformed into a beach (unless the inhabitants construct a breakwater) by the successive deposits of the tide\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother and I (whose falsehood was exposed before we spoke by the obnoxious perspicacity of Fran\u00e7oise) would not even admit that my grandmother was seriously ill, as though such an admission might give pleasure to her enemies (not that she had any) and it was more loving to feel that she was not so bad as all that, in short from the same instinctive sentiment which had led me to suppose that Andr\u00e9e was too sorry for Al-bertine to be really fond of her. The same individual phenomena are reproduced in the mass, in great crises. In a war, the man who does not love his country says nothing against it, but regards it as lost, commiserates it, sees everything in the darkest colours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was of infinite value to us owing to her faculty of doing without sleep, of performing the most arduous tasks. And if, when she had gone to bed after several nights spent in the sick-room, we were obliged to call her a quarter of an hour after she had fallen asleep, she was so happy to be able to do the most tiring duties as if they had been the simplest things in the world that, so far from looking cross, her face would light up with a satisfaction tinged with modesty. Only when the time came for mass, or for breakfast, then, had my grandmother been in her death agony, still Fran\u00e7oise would have quietly slipped away so as not to make herself late. She neither could nor would let her place be taken by her young footman. It was true that she had brought from Combray an extremely exalted idea of everyone\u2019s duty towards ourselves; she would not have tolerated that any of our servants should \u2018fail\u2019 us. This doctrine had made her so noble, so imperious, so efficient an instructor that there had never come to our house any servants, however corrupted who had not speedily modified, purified their conception of life so far as to refuse to touch the usual commissions from tradesmen and to come rushing \u2014 however little they might previously have sought to oblige \u2014 to take from my hands and not let me tire myself by carrying the smallest package. But at Combray Fran\u00e7oise had contracted also \u2014 and had brought with her to Paris \u2014 the habit of not being able to put up with any assistance in her work. The sight of anyone coming to help her seemed to her like receiving a deadly insult, and servants had remained for weeks in the house without receiving from her any response to their morning greeting, had even gone off on their holidays without her bidding them good-bye or their guessing her reason, which was simply and solely that they had offered to do a share of her work on some day when she had not been well. And at this moment when my grandmother was so ill Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s duties seemed to her peculiarly her own. She would not allow herself, she, the official incumbent, to be done out of her part in the ritual of these festal days. And so her young footman, sent packing by her, did not know what to do with himself, and not content with having copied the butler\u2019s example and supplied himself with note-paper from my desk had begun as well to borrow volumes of poetry from my bookshelves. He sat reading them for a good half of the day, out of admiration for the poets who had written them, but also so as, during the rest of his time, to begem with quotations the letters which he wrote to his friends in his native village. Naturally he expected these to dazzle them. But as there was little sequence in his ideas he had formed the notion that these poems, picked out at random from my shelves, were matters of common knowledge, to which it was customary to refer. So much so that in writing to these peasants, whose stupefaction he discounted, he interspersed his own reflexions with lines from Lamartine, just as he might have said \u201cWho laughs last, laughs longest!\u201d or merely \u201cHow are you keeping?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To ease her pain my grandmother was given morphine. Unfortunately, if this relieved her in other ways, it increased the quantity of albumen. The blows which we aimed at the wicked ogre who had taken up his abode in my grandmother were always wide of the mark, and it was she, her poor interposed body that had to bear them, without her ever uttering more than a faint groan by way of complaint. And the pain that we caused her found no compensation in a benefit which we were unable to give her. The savage ogre whom we were anxious to exterminate we barely succeeded in touching, and all we did was to enrage him still further, and possibly hasten the moment at which he would devour his luckless captive. On certain days when the discharge of albumen had been excessive Cottard, after some hesitation, stopped the morphine. In this man, so insignificant, so common, there was, in these brief moments in which he deliberated, in which the relative dangers of one and another course of treatment presented themselves alternately to his mind until he arrived at a decision, the same sort of greatness as in a general who, vulgar in all the rest of his life, is a great strategist, and in an hour of peril, after a moment\u2019s reflexion, decides upon what is from the military point of view the wisest course, and gives the order: \u201cAdvance eastwards.\u201d Medically, however little hope there might be of setting any limit to this attack of uraemia, it did not do to tire the kidneys. But, on the other hand, when my grandmother did not have morphine, her pain became unbearable; she perpetually attempted a certain movement which it was difficult for her to perform without groaning. To a great extent, suffering is a sort of need felt by the organism to make itself familiar with a new state, which makes it uneasy, to adapt its sensibility to that state. We can discern this origin of pain in the case of certain inconveniences which are not such for everyone. Into a room filled with a pungent smoke two men of a coarse fibre will come and attend to their business; a third, more highly strung, will betray an incessant discomfort. His nostrils will continue to sniff anxiously the odour he ought, one would say, to try not to notice but will keep on attempting to attach, by a more exact apprehension of it, to his troubled sense of smell. One consequence of which may well be that his intense preoccupation will prevent him from complaining of a toothache. When my grandmother was in pain the sweat trickled over the pink expanse of her brow, glueing to it her white locks, and if she thought that none of us was in the room she would cry out: \u201cOh, it\u2019s dreadful!\u201d but if she caught sight of my mother, at once she employed all her energy in banishing from her face every sign of pain, or \u2014 an alternative stratagem \u2014 repeated the same plaints, accompanying them with explanations which gave a different sense, retrospectively, to those which my mother might have overheard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! My dear, it\u2019s dreadful to have to stay in bed on a beautiful sunny day like this when one wants to be out in the air; I am crying with rage at your orders.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she could not get rid of the look of anguish in her eyes, the sweat on her brow, the convulsive start, checked at once, of her limbs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is nothing wrong. I\u2019m complaining because I\u2019m not lying very comfortably. I feel my hair is untidy, my heart is bad, I knocked myself against the wall.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my mother, at the foot of the bed, riveted to that suffering form, as though, by dint of piercing with her gaze that pain-bedewed brow, that body which hid the evil thing within it, she could have succeeded in reaching that evil thing and carrying it away, my mother said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no, Mamma dear, we won\u2019t let you suffer like that, we will find something to take it away, have patience just for a moment; let me give you a kiss, darling \u2014 no, you\u2019re not to move.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And stooping over the bed, with bended knees, almost kneeling on the ground, as though by an exercise of humility she would have a better chance of making acceptable the impassioned gift of herself, she lowered towards my grandmother her whole life contained in her face as in a ciborium which she extended over her, adorned in relief with dimples and folds so passionate, so sorrowful, so sweet that one knew not whether they had been carved by the chisel of a kiss, a sob or a smile. My grandmother also, tried to lift up her face to Mamma\u2019s. It was so altered that probably\u2019 had she been strong enough to go out, she would have been recognised only by the feather in her hat. Her features, like the clay in a sculptor\u2019s hands seemed to be straining, with an effort which distracted her from everything else, to conform to some particular model which we failed to identify. This business of modelling was now almost finished, and if my grandmother\u2019s face had shrunk in the process it had at the same time hardened. The veins that ran beneath its surface seemed those not of a piece of marble but of some more rugged stone. Constantly thrust forwards by the difficulty that she found in breathing and as constantly forced back on to her pillow by exhaustion, her face, worn, diminished, terribly expressive, seemed like, in a primitive, almost prehistoric carving, the rude, flushed, purplish, desperate face of some savage guardian of a tomb. But the whole task was not yet accomplished. Next, her resistance must be overcome, and that tomb, the entrance to which she had so painfully guarded, with that tense contraction, entered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In one of those moments in which, as the saying goes, one does not know what saint to invoke, as my grandmother was coughing and sneezing a good deal, we took the advice of a relative who assured us that if we sent for the specialist X \u2014\u2014-he would get rid of all that in a couple of days. People say that sort of thing about their own doctors, and their friends believe them just as Fran\u00e7oise always believed the advertisements in the newspapers. The specialist came with his bag packed with all the colds and coughs of his other patients, like Aeolus\u2019s bottle. My grandmother refused point-blank to let herself be examined. And we, out of consideration for the doctor, who had had his trouble for nothing, deferred to the desire that he expressed to inspect each of our noses in turn, albeit there was nothing the matter with any of them. According to him, however, there was; everything, whether headache or colic, heart-disease or diabetes, was a disease of the nose that had been wrongly diagnosed. To each of us he said: \u201cI should like to have another look at that little cornea. Don\u2019t put it off too long. I can soon get rid of it for you with a hot needle.\u201d We were, of course, thinking of something quite different. And yet we asked ourselves: \u201cGet rid of what?\u201d In a word, every one of our noses was diseased; his mistake lay only in his use of the present tense. For by the following day his examination and provisional treatment had taken effect. Each of us had his or her catarrh. And when in the street he ran into my father doubled up with a cough, he smiled to think that an ignorant layman might suppose the attack to be due to his intervention. He had examined us at a moment when we were already ill\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother\u2019s illness gave occasion to various people to manifest an excess or deficiency of sympathy which surprised us quite as much as the sort of chance which led one or another of them to reveal to us connecting links of circumstances, or of friendship for that matter, which we had never suspected. And the signs of interest shewn by the people who called incessantly at the house to inquire revealed to us the gravity of an illness which, until then, we had not sufficiently detached from the countless painful impressions that we received in my grandmother\u2019s room. Summoned by telegram, her sisters declined to leave Combray. They had discovered a musician there who gave them excellent chamber concerts, in listening to which they thought that they could find, better than by the invalid\u2019s bedside, food for thought, a melancholy exaltation the form of which was, to say the least of it, unusual. Mme. Sazerat wrote to Mamma, but in the tone of a person whom the sudden breaking off of a betrothal (the cause of the rupture being her Dreyfusism) has parted from one for ever. Bergotte, on the other hand, came every day and spent several hours with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had always made a habit of going regularly for some time to the same house, where, accordingly, he need not stand on ceremony. But formerly it had been in order that he might talk without being interrupted; now it was so that he might sit for as long as he chose in silence, without being expected to talk. For he was very ill, some people said with albuminuria, like my grandmother. According to another version, he had a tumour. He grew steadily weaker; it was with difficulty that he came up our staircase, with greater difficulty still that he went down it. Even though he held on to the banisters he often stumbled, and he would, I believe, have stayed at home had he not been afraid of losing altogether the habit of going out, the capacity to go out, he, the \u2018man with the little beard\u2019 whom I had seen so alert, not very long since. He was now quite blind and even his speech was frequently obstructed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at the same time, by a directly opposite process, the body of his work, known only to a few literary people at the period when Mme. Swann used to patronise their timid efforts to disseminate it, now grown in stature and strength before the eyes of all, had acquired an extraordinary power of expansion among the general public. The general rule is, no doubt, that only after his death does a writer become famous. But it was while he still lived, and during his slow progress towards a death that he had not yet reached that this writer was able to watch the progress of his works towards Renown. A dead writer can at least be illustrious without any strain on himself. The effulgence of his name is stopped short by the stone upon his grave. In the deafness of the eternal sleep he is not importuned by Glory. But for Bergotte the antithesis was still incomplete. He existed still sufficiently to suffer from the tumult. He was moving still, though with difficulty, while his books, bounding about him, like daughters whom one loves but whose impetuous youthfulness and noisy pleasures tire one, brought day after day, to his very bedside, a crowd of fresh admirers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The visits which he now began to pay us came for me several years too late, for I had no longer the same admiration for him as of old. Which is not in any sense incompatible with the growth of his reputation. A man\u2019s work seldom becomes completely understood and successful before that of another writer, still obscure, has begun in the minds of certain people more difficult to please to substitute a fresh cult for one that has almost ceased to command observance. In the books of Bergotte which I constantly reread, his sentences stood out as clearly before my eyes as my own thoughts the furniture in my room and the carriages in the street. All the details were quite easily seen, not perhaps precisely as one had always seen them but at any rate as one was accustomed to see them now. But a new writer had recently begun to publish work in which the relations between things were so different from those that connected them for me that I could understand hardly anything of what he wrote. He would say, for instance: \u201cThe hose-pipes admired the smart upkeep of the roads\u201d (and so far it was simple, I followed him smoothly along those roads) \u201cwhich started every five minutes from Briand and Claudel.\u201d At that point I ceased to understand, because I had expected the name of a place and was given that of a person instead. Only I felt that it was not the sentence that was badly constructed but I myself that lacked the strength and ability necessary to reach the end. I would start afresh striving tooth and nail to climb to the pinnacle from which I would see things in their novel relations. And each time, after I had got about halfway through the sentence, I would fall back again, as later on, when I joined the Army, in my attempts at the exercise known as the \u2018bridge-ladder.\u2019 I felt nevertheless for the new writer the admiration which an awkward boy who never receives any marks for gymnastics feels when he watches another more nimble. And from then onwards I felt less admiration for Bergotte, whose limpidity began to strike me as insufficient. There was a time at which people recognised things quite easily in pictures when it was Fromentin who had painted them, and could not recognise them at all when it was Renoir\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People of taste and refinement tell us nowadays that Renoir is one of the great painters of the last century. But in so saying they forget the element of Time, and that it took a great deal of time, well into the present century, before Renoir was hailed as a great artist. To succeed thus in gaining recognition, the original painter, the original writer proceeds on the lines adopted by oculists. The course of treatment they give us by their painting or by their prose is not always agreeable to us. When it is at an end the operator says to us: \u201cNow look!\u201d And, lo and behold, the world around us (which was not created once and for all, but is created afresh as often as an original artist is born) appears to us entirely different from the; old world, but perfectly clear. Women pass in the street, different from what they used to be, because they are Renoirs, those Renoir types which we persistently refused to see as women. The carriages, too, are Renoirs, and the water, and the sky: we feel tempted to go for a walk in the forest which reminds us of that other which when we first saw it looked like anything in the world except a forest, like for instance a tapestry of innumerable shades but lacking precisely the shades proper to forests. Such is the new and perishable universe which has just been created. It will last until the next geological catastrophe is precipitated by a new painter or writer of original talent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This writer who had taken Bergotte\u2019s place in my affections wearied me not by the incoherence but by the novelty of associations \u2014 perfectly coherent \u2014 which my mind was not trained to follow. The fact that it was always at the same point that I felt myself relinquish my grasp pointed to a common character in the efforts that I had always to make. Moreover, when once in a thousand times I did succeed in following the writer to the end of his sentence, what I saw there was always of a humour, a truth, a charm similar to those which I had found long ago in reading Bergotte, only more delightful. I reflected that it was not so many years since a similar reconstruction of the world, like that which I was waiting now for his successor to produce, had been wrought for me by Bergotte himself. Until I was led to ask myself whether there was indeed any truth in the distinction which we are always making between art, which is no more advanced now than in Homer\u2019s day, and science with its continuous progress. Perhaps, on the contrary, art was in this respect like science; each new writer seemed to me to have advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor; and how was I to know that in twenty years\u2019 time, when I should be able to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of to-day, another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have consigned Bergotte?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I spoke to the latter of the new writer. He gave me a distaste for him not so much when he said that his art was uncouth, easy and vacuous, as when he told me that he had seen him, and had almost mistaken him (so strong was the likeness) for Bloch. From that moment my friend\u2019s features outlined themselves on the printed pages, and I no longer felt any obligation to make the effort necessary to understand them. If Bergotte had decried him to me it was less, I fancy, out of jealousy for a success that was yet to come than out of ignorance of his work. He read scarcely anything. The bulk of his thought had long since passed from his brain into his books. He had grown thin, as though they had been extracted from him by surgical operations. His reproductive instinct no longer impelled him to any activity, now that he had given an independent existence to almost all his thoughts. He led the vegetative life of a convalescent, of a woman after childbirth; his fine eyes remained motionless, vaguely dazed, like the eyes of a man who lies on the seashore and in a vague daydream sees only each little breaking wave. However, if it was less interesting to talk to him now than I should once have found it, I felt no compunction for that. He was so far a creature of habit that the simplest habits, like the most elaborate, once he had formed them, became indispensable to him for a certain length of time. I do not know what made him come to our house first of all, but after that every day it was simply because he had been there the day before. He would come to the house as he might have gone to a caf\u00e9, so that no one should talk to him, so that he might \u2014 very rarely \u2014 talk himself; one might in short have found in his conduct a sign that he was moved to sympathise with us in our anxiety, or that he enjoyed my company, had one sought to draw any conclusion from such an assiduity in calling. It did not fail to impress my mother, sensitive to everything that might be regarded as an act of homage to her invalid. And every day she reminded me: \u201cSee that you don\u2019t forget to thank him nicely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had also \u2014 a discreet feminine attention like the refreshments that are brought to us in the studio, between sittings, by a painter\u2019s mistress \u2014 a courteous supplement to those which her husband paid us professionally, a visit from Mme. Cottard. She came to offer us her \u2018waiting-woman,\u2019 or, if we preferred the services of a man, she would \u2018scour the country\u2019 for one, and, best of all, on our declining, said that she did hope this was not just a \u2018put-off on our part, a word which in her world signifies a false pretext for not accepting an invitation. She assured us that the Professor, who never referred to his patients when he was at home, was as sad about it as if it had been she herself who was ill. We shall see in due course that even if this had been true it would have been at once a very small and a considerable admission on the part of the most faithless and the most attentive of husbands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offers as helpful and infinitely more touching owing to the form in which they were couched (which was a blend of the highest intelligence, the warmest sympathy, and a rare felicity of expression) were addressed to me by the Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg. I had met him at Balbec where he had come on a visit to one of his aunts, the Princesse de Luxembourg, being himself at that time merely Comte de Nassau. He had married, some months later, the charming daughter of another Luxembourg Princess, extremely rich, because she was the only daughter of a Prince who was the proprietor of an immense flour-mill. Whereupon the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, who had no children of his own and was devoted to his nephew Nassau, had obtained the approval of his Chamber to his declaring the young man his heir. As with all marriages of this nature, the origin of the bride\u2019s fortune was the obstacle as it was also the deciding factor. I remembered this Comte de Nassau as one of the most striking young men I had ever met, already devoured, at that time, by a dark and blazing passion for his betrothed. I was deeply touched by the letters which he wrote me, day after day, during my grandmother\u2019s illness, and Mamma herself, in her emotion, quoted sadly one of her mother\u2019s expressions: \u201cS\u00e9vign\u00e9 would not have put it better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the sixth day Mamma, yielding to my grandmother\u2019s entreaties, left her for a little and pretended to go and lie down. I should have liked (so that my grandmother might go to sleep) Fran\u00e7oise to sit quite still and not disturb her by moving. In spite of my supplications, she got up and left the room; she was genuinely devoted to my grandmother; with her uncanny insight and her natural pessimism she regarded her as doomed. She would therefore have liked to pay her every possible attention. But word had just come that an electrician was in the house, one of the oldest servants of his firm, the head of which was his brother-in-law, highly esteemed throughout the building, where he had worked for many years, and especially by Jupien. This man had been ordered to come before my grandmother\u2019s illness. It seemed to me that he might have been sent away again, or told to wait. But Franchise\u2019s code of manners would not permit of this; it would have been a want of courtesy towards this worthy man; my grandmother\u2019s condition ceased at once to matter. When, after waiting a quarter of an hour, I lost my patience and went to look for her in the kitchen, I found her talking to him on the landing of the back staircase, the door of which stood open, a device which had the advantage, should any of us come on the scene, of letting it be thought that they were just saying goodbye, but had also the drawback of sending a terrible draught through the house. Fran\u00e7oise tore herself from the workman, not without turning to shout down after him various greetings, forgotten in her haste, to his wife and brother-in-law. A typical Combray scruple, not to be found wanting in politeness, which Fran\u00e7oise extended even to foreign politics. People foolishly imagine that the vast dimensions of social phenomena afford them an excellent opportunity to penetrate farther into the human soul; they ought, on the contrary, to realise that it is by plumbing the depths of a single personality that they might have a chance of understanding those phenomena. A thousand times over Fran\u00e7oise told the gardener at Combray that war was the most senseless of crimes, that life was the only thing that mattered. Yet, when the Russo-Japanese war broke out, she was quite ashamed, when she thought of the Tsar, that we had not gone to war also to help the \u2018poor Russians,\u2019 \u201csince,\u201d she reminded us, \u201cwe\u2019re allianced to them.\u201d She felt this abstention to be not quite polite to Nicholas II, who had always \u201csaid such nice things about us\u201d; it was a corollary of the same code which would have prevented her from refusing a glass of brandy from Jupien, knowing that it would \u2018upset\u2019 her digestion, and which brought it about that now, with my grandmother lying at death\u2019s door, the same meanness of which she considered France guilty in remaining neutral with regard to Japan she would have had to admit in herself, had she not gone in person to make her apologies to this good electrician who had been put to so much trouble\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Luckily for ourselves, we were soon rid of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s daughter, who was obliged to be away for some weeks. To the regular stock of advice which people at Combray gave to the family of an invalid: \u201cYou haven\u2019t tried taking him away for a little . . . the change of air, you know . . . pick up an appetite . . . etc?\u201d she had added the almost unique idea, which she had specially created in her own imagination, and repeated accordingly whenever we saw her, without fail, as though hoping by dint of reiteration to force it through the thickness of people\u2019s heads: \u201cShe ought to have taken herself in hand radically from the first.\u201d She did not recommend any one cure rather than another, provided that it were \u2018radical.\u2019 As for Fran\u00e7oise herself, she noticed that we were not giving my grandmother many medicines. Since, according to her, they only destroyed the stomach, she was quite glad of this, but at the same time even more humiliated. She had, in the South of France, some cousins \u2014 relatively well-to-do \u2014 whose daughter, after falling ill just as she was growing up, had died at twenty-three; for several years the father and mother had ruined themselves on drugs, on different doctors, on pilgrimages from one watering-place to another, until her decease. Now all this seemed to Fran\u00e7oise, for the parents in question, a kind of luxury, as though they had owned racehorses, or a Place in the country. They themselves, in the midst of their affliction, derived a certain gratification from the thought of such lavish expenditure. They had now nothing left, least of all their most precious possession, their child, but they did enjoy telling people how they had done as much for her and more than the richest in the land. The ultra-violet rays to the action of which, several times a day for months on end, the poor girl had been subjected, delighted them more than anything. The father, elated in his grief by the glory of it all, was led to speak of his daughter at times as of an operatic star for whose sake he had ruined himself. Fran\u00e7oise was not unmoved by this wealth of scenic effect; that which framed my grandmother\u2019s sickbed seemed to her a trifle meagre, suited rather to an illness on the stage of a small provincial theatre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There came a time when her uraemic trouble affected my grandmother\u2019s eyes. For some days she could not see at all. Her eyes were not at all like those of a blind person, but remained just the same as before. And I gathered that she could see nothing only from the strangeness of a certain smile of welcome which she assumed the moment one opened the door, until one had come up to her and taken her hand, a smile which began too soon and remained stereotyped on her lips, fixed, but always full-faced, and endeavouring to be visible from all points, because she could no longer rely upon her sight to regulate it, to indicate the right moment, the proper direction, to bring it to the point, to make it vary according to the change of position or of facial expression of the person who had come in; because it was left isolated, without the accompanying smile in her eyes which would have distracted a little from it the attention of the visitor, it assumed in its awkwardness an undue importance, giving one the impression of an exaggerated friendliness. Then her sight was completely restored; from her eyes the wandering affliction passed to her ears. For several days my grandmother was deaf. And as she was afraid of being taken by surprise by the sudden entry of some one whom she would not have heard come in, all day long, albeit she was lying with her face to the wall, she kept turning her head sharply towards the door. But the movement of her neck was clumsy, for one cannot adapt oneself in a few days to this transposition of faculties, so as, if not actually to see sounds, to listen with one\u2019s eyes. Finally her pain grew less, but the impediment of her speech increased. We were obliged to ask her to repeat almost everything that she said\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now my grandmother, realising that we could no longer understand her, gave up altogether the attempt to speak and lay perfectly still. When she caught sight of me she gave a sort of convulsive start like a person who suddenly finds himself unable to breathe, but could make no intelligible sound. Then, overcome by her sheer powerlessness, she let her head drop on to the pillows, stretched herself out flat in her bed, her face grave, like a face of marble, her hands motionless on the sheet or occupied in some purely physical action such as that of wiping her fingers with her handkerchief. She made no effort to think. Then came a state of perpetual agitation. She was incessantly trying to get up. But we restrained her so far as we could from doing so, for fear of her discovering how paralysed she was. One day when she had been left alone for a moment I found her standing on the floor in her nightgown trying to open the window\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Balbec, once, when a widow who had jumped into the sea had been rescued against her will, my grandmother had told me (moved perhaps by one of those presentiments which we discern at times in the mystery \u2014 so obscure, for all that \u2014 of the organic life around us, in which nevertheless it seems that our own future is foreshadowed) that she could think of nothing so cruel as to tear a poor wretch from the death that she had deliberately sought and restore her to her living martyrdom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were just in time to catch my grandmother, she put up an almost violent resistance to my mother, then, overpowered, seated forcibly in an armchair, she ceased to wish for death, to regret being alive, her face resumed its impassivity and she began laboriously to pick off the hairs that had been left on her nightgown by a fur cloak which somebody had thrown over her shoulders\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The look in her eyes changed completely; often uneasy, plaintive, haggard, it was no longer the look we knew, it was the sullen expression of a doddering old woman. . . \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By dint of repeatedly asking her whether she would not like her hair done, Fran\u00e7oise managed to persuade herself that the request had come from my grandmother. She armed herself with brushes, combs, eau de Cologne, a wrapper. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt Madame Am\u00e9d\u00e9e,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cif I just comb her; nobody\u2019s ever too ill for a good combing.\u201d In other words, one was never too weak for another person to be able, for her own satisfaction, to comb one. But when I came into the room I saw between the cruel hands of Fran\u00e7oise, as blissfully happy as though she were in the act of restoring my grandmother to health, beneath a thin rain of aged tresses which had not the strength to resist the action of the comb, a head which, incapable of maintaining the position into which it had been forced, was rolling to and fro with a ceaseless swirling motion in which sheer debility alternated with spasms of pain. I felt that the moment at which Fran\u00e7oise would have finished her task was approaching, and I dared not hasten it by suggesting to her: \u201cThat is enough,\u201d for fear of her disobeying me. But I did forcibly intervene when, in order that my grandmother might see whether her hair had been done to her liking, Fran\u00e7oise, with innocent savagery, brought her a glass. I was glad for the moment that I had managed to snatch it from her in time, before my grandmother, whom we had carefully kept without a mirror, could catch even a stray glimpse of a face unlike anything she could have imagined. But, alas, when, a moment later, I leaned over her to kiss that dear forehead which had been so harshly treated, she looked up at me with a puzzled, distrustful, shocked expression: she did not know me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to our doctor, this was a symptom that the congestion of her brain was increasing. It must be relieved in some way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cottard was in two minds. Fran\u00e7oise hoped at first that they were going to apply \u2018clarified cups.\u2019 She looked for the effects of this treatment in my dictionary, but could find no reference to it. Even if she had said \u2018scarified\u2019 instead of \u2018clarified\u2019 she still would not have found any reference to this adjective, since she did not look any more for it under \u2018S\u2019 than under \u2018C\u2019; she did indeed say \u2018clarified\u2019 but she wrote (and consequently assumed that the printed word was) \u2018esclarified.\u2019 Cottard, to her disappointment, gave the preference, though without much hope, to leeches. When, a few hours later, I went into my grandmother\u2019s room, fastened to her neck, her temples, her ears, the tiny black serpents were writhing among her bloodstained locks, as on the head of Medusa. But in her pale and peaceful entirely motionless face I saw wide open, luminous and calm, her own beautiful eyes, as in days gone by (perhaps even more charged with the light of intelligence than they had been before her illness, since, as she could not speak and must not move, it was to her eyes alone that she entrusted her thought, that thought which at one time occupies an immense place in us, offering us undreamed-of treasures, at another time seems reduced to nothing, then may be reborn, as though by spontaneous generation, by the withdrawal of a few drops of blood), her eyes, soft and liquid like two pools of oil in which the rekindled fire that was now burning lighted before the face of the invalid a reconquered universe. Her calm was no longer the wisdom of despair, but that of hope. She realised that she was better, wished to be careful, not to move, and made me the present only of a charming smile so that I should know that she was feeling better, as she gently pressed my hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I knew the disgust that my grandmother felt at the sight of certain animals, let alone being touched by them. I knew that it was in consideration of a higher utility that she was enduring the leeches. And so it infuriated me to hear Fran\u00e7oise repeating to her with that laugh which people use to a baby, to make it crow: \u201cOh, look at the little beasties running about on Madame.\u201d This was, moreover, treating our patient with a want of respect, as though she were in her second childhood. But my grandmother, whose face had assumed the calm fortitude of a stoic, did not seem even to hear her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! No sooner had the leeches been taken off than the congestion returned and grew steadily worse. I was surprised to find that at this stage, when my grandmother was so ill, Fran\u00e7oise was constantly disappearing. The fact was that she had ordered herself a mourning dress, and did not wish to keep her dressmaker waiting. In the lives of most women, everything, even the greatest sorrow, resolves itself into a question of \u2018trying-on.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few days later, when I was in bed and sleeping, my mother came to call me in the early hours of the morning. With that tender consideration which, in great crises, people who are crushed by grief shew even for the slightest discomfort of others:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cForgive me for disturbing your sleep,\u201d she said to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was not asleep,\u201d I answered as I awoke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I said this in good faith. The great modification which the act of awakening effects in us is not so much that of introducing us to the clear life of consciousness, as that of making us lose all memory of that other, rather more diffused light in which our mind has been resting, as in the opaline depths of the sea. The tide of thought, half veiled from our perception, over which we were drifting still a moment ago, kept us in a state of motion perfectly sufficient to enable us to refer to it by the name of wakefulness. But then our actual awakenings produce an interruption of memory. A little later we describe these states as sleep because we no longer remember them. And when shines that bright star which at the moment of waking illuminates behind the sleeper the whole expanse of his sleep, it makes him imagine for a few moments that this was not a sleeping but a waking state; a shooting star, it must be added, which blots out with the fading of its light not only the false existence but the very appearance of our dream, and merely enables him who has awoken to say to himself: \u201cI was asleep.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a voice so gentle that she seemed to be afraid of hurting me, my mother asked whether it would tire me too much to get out of bed, and, stroking my hands, went on:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy poor boy, you have only your Papa and Mamma to help you now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We went into the sickroom. Bent in a semicircle on the bed a creature other than my grandmother, a sort of wild beast which was coated with her hair and couched amid her bedclothes lay panting, groaning, making the blankets heave with its convulsions. The eyelids were closed, and it was because the one nearer me did not shut properly, rather than because it opened at all that it left visible a chink of eye, misty, filmed, reflecting the dimness both of an organic sense of vision and of a hidden, internal pain. All this agitation was not addressed to us, whom she neither saw nor knew. But if this was only a beast that was stirring there, where coulel my grandmother be? Yes, I could recognise the shape of her nose, which bore no relation now to the rest of her face, but to the corner of which a beauty spot still adhered, and the hand that kept thrusting the blankets aside with a gesture which formerly would have meant that those blankets were pressing upon her, but now meant nothing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mamma asked me to go for a little vinegar and water with which to sponge my grandmother\u2019s forehead. It was the only thing that refreshed her, thought Mamma, who saw that she was trying to push back her hair. But now one of the servants was signalling to me from the doorway. The news that my grandmother was in the last throes had spread like wildfire through the house. One of those \u2018extra helps\u2019 whom people engage at exceptional times to relieve the strain on their servants (a practice which gives deathbeds an air of being social functions) had just opened the front door to the Duc de Guermantes, who was now waiting in the hall and had asked for me: I could not escape him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have just, my dear Sir, heard your tragic news. I should like, as a mark of sympathy, to shake hands with your father.\u201d I made the excuse that I could not very well disturb him at the moment. M. de Guermantes was like a caller who turns up just as one is about to start on a journey. But he felt so intensely the importance of the courtesy he was shewing us that it blinded him to all else, and he insisted upon being taken into the drawing-room. As a general rule, he made a point of going resolutely through the formalities with which he had decided to honour anyone, and took little heed that the trunks were packed or the coffin ready\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you sent for Dieulafoy? No? That was a great mistake. And if you had only asked me, I would have got him to come, he never refuses me anything, although he has refused the Duchesse de Chartres before now. You see, I set myself above a Princess of the Blood. However, in the presence of death we are all equal,\u201d he added, not that he meant to suggest that my grandmother was becoming his equal, but probably because he felt that a prolonged discussion of his power over Dieulafoy and his pre-eminence over the Duchesse de Chartres would not be in very good taste\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This advice did not in the least surprise me. I knew that, in the Guermantes set, the name of Dieulafoy was regularly quoted (only with slightly more respect) among those of other tradesmen who were \u2018quite the best\u2019 in their respective lines. And the old Duchesse de Mortemart n\u00e9eGuermantes (I never could understand, by the way, why, the moment one speaks of a Duchess, one almost invariably says: \u201cThe old Duchess of So-and-so\u201d or, alternatively, in a delicate Watteau tone, if she is still young: \u201cThe little Duchess of So-and-so,\u201d) would prescribe almost automatically, with a droop of the eyelid, in serious cases: \u201cDieulafoy, Dieulafoy!\u201d as, if one wanted a place for ices, she would advise: \u2018Poir\u00e9 Blanche,\u2019 or for small pastry \u2018Rebattet, Rebattet.\u2019 But I was not aware that my father had, as a matter of fact, just sent for Dieulafoy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point my mother, who was waiting impatiently for some cylinders of oxygen which would help my grandmother to breathe more easily, came out herself to the hall where she little expected to find M. de Guermantes. I should have liked to conceal him, had that been possible. But convinced in his own mind that nothing was more essential, could be more gratifying to her or more indispensable to the maintenance of his reputation as a perfect gentleman, he seized me violently by the arm and, although I defended myself as against an assault with repeated protestations of \u201cSir, Sir, Sir,\u201d dragged me across to Mamma, saying: \u201cWill you do me the great honour of presenting me to your mother?\u201d letting go a little as he came to the last word. And it was so plain to him that the honour was hers that he could not help smiling at her even while he was composing a grave face. There was nothing for it but to mention his name, the sound of which at once started him bowing and scraping, and he was just going to begin the complete ritual of salutation. He apparently proposed to enter into conversation, but my mother, overwhelmed by her grief, told me to come at once and did not reply to the speeches of M. de Guermantes who, expecting to be received as a visitor and finding himself instead left alone in the hall, would have been obliged to retire had he not at that moment caught sight of Saint-Loup who had arrived in Paris that morning and had come to us in haste to inquire for news. \u201cI say, this is a piece of luck!\u201d cried the Duke joyfully, catching his nephew by the sleeve, which he nearly tore off, regardless of the presence of my mother who was again crossing the hall. Saint-Loup was not sorry, I fancy, despite his genuine sympathy, at having missed seeing me, considering his attitude towards myself. He left the house, carried off by his uncle who \u2014 having had something very important to say to him and having very nearly gone down to Donci\u00e8res on purpose to say it, was beside himself with joy at being able to save himself so much exertion. \u201cUpon my soul, if anybody had told me I had only to cross the courtyard and I should find you here, I should have thought it a huge joke; as your friend M. Bloch would say, it\u2019s a regular farce.\u201d And as he disappeared down the stairs with Robert whom he held by the shoulder: \u201cAll the same,\u201d he went on, \u201cit\u2019s quite clear I must have touched the hangman\u2019s rope or something; I do have the most astounding luck.\u201d Not that the Duc de Guermantes was ill-bred; far from it. But he was one of those men who are incapable of putting themselves in the place of other people, who resemble in that respect undertakers and the majority of doctors, and who, after composing their faces and saying: \u201cThis is a very painful occasion,\u201d after, if need be, embracing you and advising you to rest, cease to regard a deathbed or a funeral as anything but a social gathering of a more or less restricted kind at which, with a joviality that has been checked for a moment only, they scan the room in search of the person whom they can tell about their own little affairs, or ask to introduce them to some one else, or offer a \u2018lift\u2019 in their carriage when it is time to go home. The Duc de Guermantes, while congratulating himself on the \u2018good wind\u2019 that had blown him into the arms of his nephew, was still so surprised at the reception \u2014 natural as it was \u2014 that had been given him by my mother, that he declared later on that she was as disagreeable as my father was civil, that she had \u2018absent fits\u2019 during which she seemed literally not to hear a word you said to her, and that in his opinion she had no self-possession and perhaps even was not quite \u2018all there.\u2019 At the same time he had been quite prepared (according to what I was told) to put this state of mind down, in part at any rate, to the circumstances, and declared that my mother had seemed to him greatly \u2018affected\u2019 by the sad event. But he had still stored up in his limbs all the residue of bows and reverences which he had been prevented from using up, and had so little idea of the real nature of Mamma\u2019s sorrow that he asked me, the day before the funeral, if I was not doing anything to distract her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A half-brother of my grandmother, who was in religion, and whom I had never seen, had telegraphed to Austria, where the head of his Order was, and having as a special privilege obtained leave, arrived that day. Bowed down with grief, he sat by the bedside reading prayers and meditations from a book, without, however, taking his gimlet eyes from the invalid\u2019s face. At one point, when my grandmother was unconscious, the sight of this cleric\u2019s grief began to upset me, and I looked at him tenderly. He appeared surprised by my pity, and then an odd thing happened. He joined his hands in front of his face, like a man absorbed in painful meditation, but, on the assumption that I would then cease to watch him, left, as I observed, a tiny chink between his fingers. And at the moment when my gaze left his face, I saw his sharp eye, which had been making use of its vantage-point behind his hands to observe whether my sympathy were sincere. He was hidden there as in the darkness of a confessional. He saw that I was still looking and at once shut tight the lattice which he had left ajar. I have met him again since then, but never has any reference been made by either of us to that minute. It was tacitly agreed that I had not noticed that he was spying on me. In the priest as in the alienist, there is always an element of the examining magistrate. Besides, what friend is there, however cherished, in whose and our common past there has not been some such episode which we find it convenient to believe that he must have forgotten?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctor gave my grandmother an injection of morphine, and to make her breathing less troublesome ordered cylinders of oxygen. My mother, the doctor, the nursing sister held these in their hands; as soon as one was exhausted another was put in its place. I had left the room for a few minutes. When I returned I found myself face to face with a miracle. Accompanied on a muted instrument by an incessant murmur, my grandmother seemed to be greeting us with a long and blissful chant, which filled the room, rapid and musical. I soon realized that this was scarcely less unconscious, that it was as purely mechanical as the hoarse rattle that I had heard before leaving the room. Perhaps to a slight extent it reflected some improvement brought about by the morphine. Principally it was the result (the air not passing quite in the same way through the bronchial tubes) of a change in the register of her breathing. Released by the twofold action of the oxygen and the morphine, my grandmother\u2019s breath no longer laboured, panted, groaned, but, swift and light, shot like a skater along the delicious stream. Perhaps with her breath, unconscious like that of the wind in the hollow stem of a reed, there were blended in this chant some of those more human sighs which, liberated at the approach of death, make us imagine impressions of suffering or happiness in minds which already have ceased to feel, and these sighs came now to add a more melodious accent, but without changing its rhythm, to that long phrase which rose, mounted still higher, then declined, to start forth afresh, from her unburdened bosom in quest of the oxygen. Then, having risen to so high a pitch, having been sustained with so much vigour, the chant, mingled with a murmur of supplication from the midst of her ecstasy, seemed at times to stop altogether like a spring that has ceased to flow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, in any great sorrow, felt the need but did not possess the art \u2014 as simple as that need was futile \u2014 of giving it expression. Regarding my grandmother\u2019s case as quite hopeless, it was her own personal impressions that she was impelled to communicate to us. And all that she could do was to repeat: \u201cIt makes me feel all queer,\u201d in the same tone in which she would say, when she had taken too large a plateful of cabbage broth: \u201cIt\u2019s like a load on my stomach,\u201d sensations both of which were more natural than she seemed to think. Though so feebly expressed, her grief was nevertheless very great, and was aggravated moreover by her annoyance that her daughter, detained at Combray (to which this young Parisian now referred as \u2018the Cambrousse\u2019 and where she felt herself growing \u2018p\u00e9trousse,\u2019 in other words fossilised), would not, presumably, be able to return in time for the funeral ceremony, which was certain, Fran\u00e7oise felt, to be a superb spectacle. Knowing that we were not inclined to be expansive, she made Jupien promise at all costs to keep every evening in the week free. She knew that he would be engaged elsewhere at the hour of the funeral. She was determined at least to \u2018go over it all\u2019 with him on his return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For several nights now my father, my grandfather and one of our cousins had been sitting up, and never left the house during the day. Their continuous devotion ended by assuming a mask of indifference, and their interminable leisure round the deathbed made them indulge in that small talk which is an inseparable accompaniment of prolonged confinement in a railway carriage. Anyhow this cousin (a nephew of my great-aunt) aroused in me an antipathy as strong as the esteem which he deserved and generally enjoyed. He was always \u2018sent for\u2019 in times of great trouble, and was so assiduous in his attentions to the dying that their mourning families, on the pretext that he was in delicate health, despite his robust appearance, his bass voice and bristling beard, invariably besought him, with the customary euphemisms, not to come to the cemetery. I could tell already that Mamma, who thought of others in the midst of the most crushing grief, would soon be saying to him, in a very different form of words, what he was in the habit of hearing said on all such occasions:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPromise me that you won\u2019t come \u2018to-morrow.\u2019 Please, for \u2018her sake.\u2019 At any rate, you won\u2019t go \u2018all the way.\u2019 It\u2019s what she would have wished.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there was nothing for it; he was always the first to arrive \u2018at the house,\u2019 by reason of which he had been given, among another set, the nickname (unknown to us) of \u2018No flowers by request.\u2019 And before attending everything he had always \u2018attended to everything,\u2019 which entitled him to the formula: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d came in a loud voice from my grandfather, who had grown rather deaf and had failed to catch something which our cousin had just said to my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNothing,\u201d answered the cousin. \u201cI was just saying that I\u2019d heard from Combray this morning. The weather is appalling down there, and here we\u2019ve got too much sun.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYet the barometer is very low,\u201d put in my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did you say the weather was bad?\u201d asked my grandfather\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt Combray.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I\u2019m not surprised; whenever it\u2019s bad here it\u2019s fine at Combray, and vice versa. Good gracious! Talking of Combray, has anyone remembered to tell Legrandin?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, don\u2019t worry about that, it\u2019s been done,\u201d said my cousin, whose cheeks, bronzed by an irrepressible growth of beard, dimpled faintly with the satisfaction of having \u2018remembered\u2019 it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point my father hurried from the room. I supposed that a sudden change, for better or worse, had occurred. It was simply that Dr. Dieulafoy had just arrived. My father went to receive him in the drawing-room, like the actor who is to come next on the stage. We had sent for him not to cure but to certify, in almost a legal capacity. Dr. Dieulafoy might indeed be a great physician, a marvellous professor; to these several parts, in which he excelled, he added a third, in which he remained for forty years without a rival, a part as original as that of the arguer, the scaramouch or the noble father, which consisted in coming to certify an agony or a death. The mere sound of his name foreshadowed the dignity with which he would sustain the part, and when the servant announced: \u201cM. Dieulafoy,\u201d one imagined oneself at a play by Moli\u00e8re. To the dignity of his attitude was added, without being conspicuous, the suppleness of a perfect figure. A face in itself too good-looking was toned down by the convention due to distressing circumstances. In the sable majesty of his frock coat the Professor entered the room, melancholy without affectation, uttered not the least word of condolence, which might have been thought insincere, nor was he guilty of the slightest infringement of the rules of tact. At the foot of a deathbed it was he and not the Duc de Guermantes who was the great gentleman Having examined my grandmother, but not so as to tire her, and with ari excess of reserve which was an act of courtesy to the doctor who was treating the case, he murmured a few words to my father, bowed respectfully to my mother to whom I felt that my father had positively to restrain himself from saying: \u201cProfessor Dieulafoy.\u201d But already our visitor had turned away, not wishing to seem to be soliciting an introduction, and left the room in the most polished manner conceivable, simply taking with him the sealed envelope that was slipped into his hand. He had not appeared to see it, and we ourselves were left wondering for a moment whether we had really given it to him, such a conjurer\u2019s nimbleness had he put into the act of making it vanish without thereby losing anything of the gravity \u2014 which was increased rather \u2014 of the great consultant in his long frock coat with its silken lapels, and his handsome head full of a noble commiseration. The slowness and vivacity of his movements shewed that, even if he had a hundred other visits to pay and patients waiting, he refused to appear hurried. For he was the embodiment of tact, intelligence and kindness. That eminent man is no longer with us. Other physicians, other professors may have rivalled, may indeed have surpassed him. But the \u2018capacity\u2019 in which his knowledge, his physical endowments, his distinguished manners made him triumph exists no longer for want of any successor capable of taking his place. Mamma had not even noticed M. Dieulafoy, everything that was not my grandmother having no existence for her. I remember (and here I anticipate) that at the cemetery, where we saw her, like a supernatural apparition, go up timidly to the grave and seem to be gazing in the wake of a flying form that was already far away, my father having remarked to her: \u201cOld Norpois came to the house and to the church and on here; he gave up a most important committee meeting to come; you ought really to say a word to him, he\u2019ll be so gratified if you do,\u201d my mother, when the Ambassador stood before her and bowed, could do no more than gently incline a face that shewed no tears. A couple of days earlier \u2014 to anticipate once again before returning to where we were just now by the bed on which my grandmother lay dying \u2014 while they were watching by the body, Fran\u00e7oise, who, not disbelieving entirely in ghosts, was terrified by the least sound, had said: \u201cI believe that\u2019s her.\u201d But in place of fear it was an ineffable sweetness that her words aroused in my mother, who would have been so glad that the dead should return, to have her mother with her sometimes still\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return now to those last hours, \u201cYou heard about the telegram her sisters sent us?\u201d my grandfather asked the cousin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, Beethoven, they told me about it, it\u2019s worth framing; still, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy poor wife, who was so fond of them, too,\u201d said my grandfather, wiping away a tear. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t blame them. They\u2019re stark mad, both of them, as I\u2019ve always said. What\u2019s the matter now; aren\u2019t you going on with the oxygen?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother spoke: \u201cOh, but then Mamma will be having more trouble with her breathing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctor reassured her: \u201cOh, no! The effect of the oxygen will last a good while yet; we can begin it again presently.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to me that he would not have said this of a dying woman, that if this good effect were to last it meant that we could still do something to keep her alive. The hiss of the oxygen ceased for a few moments, But the happy plaint of her breathing poured out steadily, light, troubled, unfinished, without end, beginning afresh. Now and then it seemed that all was over, her breath stopped, whether owing to one of those transpositions to another octave that occur in the breathing of a sleeper, or else from a natural interruption, an effect of unconsciousness, the progress of asphyxia, some failure of the heart. The doctor stooped to feel my grandmother\u2019s pulse, but already, as if a tributary were pouring its current into the dried river-bed, a fresh chant broke out from the interrupted measure. And the first was resumed in another pitch with the same inexhaustible force. Who knows whether, without indeed my grandmother\u2019s being conscious of them, a countless throng of happy and tender memories compressed by suffering were not escaping from her now, like those lighter gases which had long been compressed in the cylinders? One would have said that everything thai she had to tell us was pouring out, that it was to us that she was addressing herself with this prolixity, this earnestness, this effusion. At the foot of the bed, convulsed by every gasp of this agony, not weeping but now and then drenched with tears, my mother presented the unreasoning desolation of a leaf which the rain lashes and the wind twirls on its stem. They made me dry my eyes before I went up to kiss my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I thought she couldn\u2019t see anything now?\u201d said my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne can never be sure,\u201d replied the doctor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When my lips touched her face, my grandmother\u2019s hands quivered, a long shudder ran through her whole body, reflex perhaps, perhaps because certain affections have their hyperaesthesia which recognises through the veil of unconsciousness what they barely need senses to enable them to love. Suddenly my grandmother half rose, made a violent effort, as though struggling to resist an attempt on her life. Fran\u00e7oise could not endure this sight and burst out sobbing. Remembering what the doctor had just said I tried to make her leave the room. At that moment my grandmother opened her eyes. I thrust myself hurriedly in front of Fran\u00e7oise to hide her tears, while my parents were speaking to the sufferer. The sound of the oxygen had ceased; the doctor moved away from the bedside. My grandmother was dead\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An hour or two later Fran\u00e7oise was able for the last time, and without causing them any pain, to comb those beautiful tresses which had only begun to turn grey and hitherto had seemed not so old as my grandmother herself. But now on the contrary it was they alone that set the crown of age on a face grown young again, from which had vanished the wrinkles, the contractions, the swellings, the strains, the hollows which in the long course of years had been carved on it by suffering. As at the far-off time when her parents had chosen for her a bridegroom, she had the features delicately traced by purity and submission, the cheeks glowing with a chaste expectation, with a vision of happiness, with an innocent gaiety even which the years had gradually destroyed. Life in withdrawing from her had taken with it the disillusionments of life. A smile seemed to be hovering on my grandmother\u2019s lips. On that funeral couch, death, like a sculptor of the middle ages, had laid her in the form of a young maidenEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1523800",

last night\nI feel your back pressed close to me\nAnd hear your steady breathing as you sleep\n\nThen as the first soft glow of dawn moves silver grey\nLike paint along the wall\nI touch your hand and feel your ring\nAnd know this night is all we'll ever have\n\nSuddenly I look into your sleepy eyes\nYou breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there\nThen I feel your fingers running through my mind\nJumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there\nI know so well, that this is all there is\nAnd when we leave this room it's gone\nMy mind is clear as we walk down\nThe crooked little steps to the front door\n\nA ray of sun that ricoches\nFrom off a rooftop light our stumbling way\nI touch your hand and feel your ring\nAnd know this night is all we'll ever have\n\nSuddenly I look into your sleepy eyes\nYou breathe my name and it just seems to dangle there\nThen I feel your fingers running through my mind\nJumbling up my thoughts to leave them tangled there\n\nSuddenly I look into

4\n\nOur breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman.\n\n\"This is Sir Henry Baskerville,\" said Dr. Mortimer.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said he, \"and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning I should have come on my own account. I understand that you think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give it.\"\n\n\"Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?\"\n\n\"Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this morning.\"\nHe laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, \"Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel,\" was printed in rough characters; the post-mark \"Charing Cross,\" and the date of posting the preceding evening.\n\n\"Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?\" asked Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\n\n\"No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.\"\n\n\"But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?\"\n\n\"No, I had been staying with a friend,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.\"\n\n\"Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.\" Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:\n\nAs you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.\n\nThe word \"moor\" only was printed in ink.\n\n\"Now,\" said Sir Henry Baskerville, \"perhaps you will tell me, Mr. Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs?\"\n\n\"What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?\"\n\n\"No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced that the business is supernatural.\"\n\n\"What business?\" asked Sir Henry sharply. \"It seems to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.\"\n\"You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I promise you that,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"We will confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this very interesting document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?\"\n\"It is here in the corner.\"\n\n\"Might I trouble you for it, the inside page, please, with the leading articles?\" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the columns. \"Capital article this on free trade. Permit me to give you an extract from it.\n\n'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special\ntrade or your own industry will be encouraged by a\nprotective tariff, but it stands to reason that such\nlegislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the\ncountry, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the\ngeneral conditions of life in this island.'\n\n\"What do you think of that, Watson?\" cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. \"Don't you think that is an admirable sentiment?\"\nDr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.\n\n\"I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind,\" said he, \"but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned.\"\n\"On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.\"\n\n\"No, I confess that I see no connection.\"\n\n\"And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that the one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,' 'your,' 'life,' 'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't you see now whence these words have been taken?\"\n\n\"By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!\" cried Sir Henry.\n\n\"If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece.\"\n\"Well, now-so it is!\"\n\n\"Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,\" said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. \"I could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should name which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one of the most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you do it?\"\n\n\"I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an Esquimau?\"\n\n\"Most certainly.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the\u2026\"\n\n\"But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the words in yesterday's issue.\"\n\n\"So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,\" said Sir Henry Baskerville,\n\"someone cut out this message with a scissors\"\n\n\"Nail-scissors,\" said Holmes. \"You can see that it was a very short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over 'keep away.'\"\n\n\"That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste\"\n\n\"Gum,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor' should have been written?\"\n\n\"Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less common.\"\n\n\"Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in this message, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others. 'Life,' for example is quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption and from whom?\"\n\n\"We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,\" said Dr. Mortimer.\n\"Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel.\"\n\"How in the world can you say that?\"\n\n\"If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that could we examine the waste paper baskets of the hotels around Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What's this?\"\n\nHe was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said he, throwing it down. \"It is a blank half-sheet of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since you have been in London?\"\n\n\"Why, no, Mr. Holmes, I think not?\"\n\n\"You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?\"\n\n\"I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,\" said our visitor.\n\"Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?\"\n\n\"We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us before we go into this matter?\"\n\n\"Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.\"\n\n\"I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting.\"\n\nSir Henry smiled. \"I don't know much of British life yet, for I have spent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here.\"\n\n\"You have lost one of your boots?\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" cried Dr. Mortimer, \"it is only mislaid. You will find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?\"\n\n\"Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Holmes, \"however foolish the incident may seem. You have lost one of your boots, you say?\"\n\n\"Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never had them on.\"\n\n\"If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?\"\n\n\"They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put them out.\"\n\n\"Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out at once and bought a pair of boots?\"\n\n\"I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots\u2014gave six dollars for them and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.\"\n\n\"It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will not be long before the missing boot is found.\"\n\n\"And, now, gentlemen,\" said the baronet with decision, \"it seems to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all driving at.\"\n\n\"Your request is a very reasonable one,\" Holmes answered. \"Dr. Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us.\"\n\nThus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.\n\n\"Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,\" said he when the long narrative was finished. \"Of course, I've heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery. It's the pet story of the family, though I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to my uncle's death-well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can't get it clear yet. You don't seem quite to have made up your mind whether it's a case for a policeman or a clergyman.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I suppose that fits into its place.\"\n\n\"It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on upon the moor,\" said Dr. Mortimer.\n\n\"And also,\" said Holmes, \"that someone is not ill-disposed towards you, since they warn you of danger.\"\n\n\"Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall.\"\n\n\"Why should I not go?\"\n\n\"There seems to be danger.\"\n\n\"Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from human beings?\"\n\n\"Well, that is what we have to find out.\"\n\n\"Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer.\" His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this their last representative.\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" said he, \"I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me. It's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look here, Mr. Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch with us at two. I'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me.\"\n\n\"Is that convenient to you, Watson?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?\"\n\n\"I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.\"\n\n\"I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure,\" said his companion.\n\n\"Then we meet again at two o'clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!\"\n\nWe heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to the man of action.\n\n\"Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!\" He rushed into his room in his dressing gown and was back again in a few seconds in a frock coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.\n\n\"Shall I run on and stop them?\"\n\n\"Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.\"\n\nHe quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward again.\n\n\"There's our man, Watson! Come along! We'll have a good look at him, if we can do no more.\"\n\nAt that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab. Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was out of sight.\n\n\"There now!\" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles. \"Was ever such bad luck and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes!\"\n\n\"Who was the man?\"\n\n\"I have not an idea.\"\n\n\"A spy?\"\n\n\"Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember.\"\n\n\"I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none. We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice. His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one obvious disadvantage.\"\n\n\"It puts him in the power of the cabman.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"What a pity we did not get the number!\"\n\n\"My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is our man. But that is no use to us for the moment.\"\n\n\"I fail to see how you could have done more.\"\n\n\"On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed ourselves and lost our man.\"\n\nWe had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in front of us.\n\n\"There is no object in our following them,\" said Holmes. \"The shadow has departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man's face within the cab?\"\n\"I could swear only to the beard.\"\n\n\"And so could I, from which I gather that in all probability it was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!\"\n\nHe turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was warmly greeted by the manager.\n\n\"Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had the good fortune to help you?\"\n\n\"No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my life.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability during the investigation.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he is still with us.\"\n\n\"Could you ring him up?Thank you! And I should be glad to have change of this five-pound note.\"\n\nA lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous detective.\n\"Let me have the Hotel Directory,\" said Holmes. \"Thank you! Now, Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You will visit each of these in turn.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are looking for it. You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of the Times. It is this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page of the Times among it. The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2302240", "artist_names": "Ann Peebles", "full_title": "Part Time Love by\u00a0Ann\u00a0Peebles",

out searching for yourself\nHoping to find time to go to find\n\nAnd it don't matter to me\nIf you take up with someone\nWho's better than me\nCause your happiness is all I want\nFor you to find (peace)\nYour peace of mind\n[Chorus]\nLotta people have an ego hang-up\nCause they want to be the only one\nHow many came before\nIt really doesn't matter\nJust as long as you're the last\nEverybody's moving on\nAnd trying to find out\nWhat's been missing in the past\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd it don't matter to me\nIf your searching brings you\nBack together with me\nCause there'll always be\nAn empty room waiting for you\nAn open heart waiting for you\nTime is on my side\n\n[Refrain]\nCause it don't matter to me\nIt don't matter to me\nIt don't matter to me\nIt don't matter to me\nIt don't matter to me\nIt don't matter to me\nYou might also like[Outro]\nCause there'll always be\nAn empty room waiting for you\nAn open heart waiting for you\nTime is on my side\nCause it don't matter

go\nShe's rockin' to the\u2005sounds of the stere-ere-o\nI'm Shorty B and you know I'm good\nI'm gonna rock shock shock-it in your neighborhood\nI was born on March the 1st, 1964, you see\nI take just what you got to give\n'Cause a-five flights up is where I live\nLittle sis has got my back\nShe's gonna back me up 'cause she's got it like that\nTo the beat everybody\nAnd everybody just a-shock the house\nI said a wise men know, I invented disco\nThat's why I just keep on yellin'\nI invented penicillin\nYou see, I'm listed in the yellow pages all around the world\nI have 13 years experience and I'm still the number one girl\nI said a knick-knack paddywhack\nI said I got it like this and I got it like a-that\nTo the beat everybody\nAnd everybody just a-shock the house\nI said to the beat

head\nWith some more of my rhymes until you drop dead\nYou see my rhymes are so viciously\nThat's why my name is Shorty B\nSaid champagne, Cadillacs, and a lot of money\nI said these are things that you got to have if you want my honey\nAnd it's on to on to on to on\nUntil the beat don't stop 'til the break of dawn\nI said hear the rhythm of this song\nI said the beat goes on and on and on\nIt's

night\nWe're gonna rock you to the broad daylight\nSo clap your hands everybody\nAnd everybody-body clap your hands\nClap your hands everybody\nAnd everybody-body clap your hands\nJust see me\nYou clap your hands, you stomp your feet\nAnd you rock it to the rhythm of the sure shot beat\nSaid one, two, one two\nHey Charly, whatchoo gonna do?\nI will set your soul on fire if you let me take you higher\nThere will be no questions asked\nI'm just here to do my task\nI made the Amazon River one too clever\nI put the moon in outer space\nI took the mask off Batman's face\nI gave King Kong his

number one\nI'm all about makin' people have fun\nMy rhymes are neat and they're never sloppy\nI never bite and I never copy\nMy rhymes are great and they're so divine\nThe people try to rock 'em all the time\nYou don't jerk me first, you don't jerk at all\nAnd you won't have a ball\n'Cause I'm the biggest, I'm the baddest\nAnd you know I'm the best when you mess with me\n'Cause you know I'm Charly\nI'll rock your house, I'll rock it down\n'Cause I'm the rocker of the hottest disco in town\nI'll make you jump, I'll make you pump\nI'll make you want to do the bump\nFor all you homegirls that's listenin' now\nPut your hands together and throw down\nFor all you homeboys that's listenin' too\nYou know exactly what to do\nI said Crown Street crew!\n[Verse 2]\nI said dip, dive, socialize\nClean out your ears and open your eyes\nYou go to the door, ask a donation\nYou hear the greatest sounds in creation\nBackstroke I don't snort no coke\nI don't even shoot no dope\nI might smoke a J and drink some paint thin\nI chew some gum so my breath won't stink\nThen I chill, everybody\nEverybody, rock the party\nAnd you can pop the pills and you can snort the coke\nAnd you can put a sucka nigga in a dope fiend yoke\n'Cause the things you do and the things you say\nWill make a sucka-sucka nigga-nigga run away\nA-like this yo, a-like that yo\nA-check it out yo, to the beat y'all\nI said drip, drop, whip, wop\nWe're on just like a soda pop\nWe're original as you can see\nOur names fit us right to a T\nWe're super bad, we're out of sight\nWe'll make you dance all through the night\nSo if you're ready like this and you're ready like that\nLet me hear you say oh yeah\nOh yeah, oh yeah\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI said a sneaker pimp sneaker pimp on the go\nThere is

[?]\nTo the beat, everybody\nEverybody check me out\nI'm Charly Choch and I know I'm good\nBecause I throws-throws down like a MC should\nWhen I go a-walkin' down the street\nThey say can that little girl rock to the beat?\nAnd then they hand me a mic and say she's alright\nNow I'm rockin' at the parties every night\nShe's from Illinois and you're paranoid and you don't know what to do\nAnd then the dude walks up to and say \"Whatchoo wanna do?\"\nIn your answer, you'll reply, right in front of me\nYou make his body nature rise, like one, two, three\nI am the girl with the golden voice\nI am the people's number one choice\nSo throw your hands in the air\nAnd wave 'em like you just don't care\nIf you're read like Charly to rock this party\nSomebody say oh yeah!\n[Verse 4]\nChildren play

you could give in for a minute\nPut your soul in it\nWe could get it together and forever love\nSo what's the use of running boy\nYou know there ain't no point in running\nYou need somebody, somebody to love you\nCause everybody needs somebody\nEverybody's got the right to love\nYou got the right to say I, need somebody\nI need you, he needs me\nCome together, talk to me, oh yeah\nYou can have all the things that you desire\nBut without love you just can't survive\nCause you need love to warm your heart at night\nWhen you're all alone and no comfort's in sight\nYou need somebody\nEverybody

crowded out by pride\nAnd it's just not right\nHurting people go ignored\nLike th\u0435y're all to blame\nWe lump th\u0435m in together\nNobody feels the shame\nWhen we can see but we don't\nI call it

get back to the land\nAnd set my soul free\"\n[Chorus]\nWe are stardust, we are golden\nWe are billion-year-old carbon\nAnd we've got to get ourselves\nBack to the garden\n\n[Vere 2]\nWell, then can I walk beside you?\nI have come to lose the smog\nAnd I feel myself a cog\nIn somethin' turning\nAnd maybe it's the time of year\nYes, and maybe it's the time of man\nAnd I don't know who I am\nBut life is for learning\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are stardust, we are golden\nWe are billion-year-old carbon\nAnd we got to get ourselves\nBack to the garden\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are stardust, we are

was a song\nAnd a celebration\nAnd I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes\nRiding shotgun in the sky\nTurning into butterflies\nAbove our nation\n\n[Chorus]\nWe are stardust, we are golden\nWe are

afternoon not long ago, Dick Copaken sat in a booth at Daniel, one of those hushed, exclusive restaurants on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side where the waiters glide spectrally from table to table. He was wearing a starched button-down shirt and a blue blazer. Every strand of his thinning hair was in place, and he spoke calmly and slowly, his large pink Charlie Brown head bobbing along evenly as he did. Copaken spent many years as a partner at the white-shoe Washington, D.C., firm Covington & Burling, and he has a lawyer\u2019s gravitas. One of his best friends calls him, admiringly, \u201crelentless.\u201d He likes to tell stories. Yet he is not, strictly, a storyteller, because storytellers are people who know when to leave things out, and Copaken never leaves anything out: each detail is adduced, considered, and laid on the table\u2014and then adjusted and readjusted so that the corners of the new fact are flush with the corners of the fact that preceded it. This is especially true when Copaken is talking about things that he really cares about, such as questions of international law or his grandchildren or, most of all, the movies.\n\nDick Copaken loves the movies. His friend Richard Light, a statistician at Harvard, remembers summer vacations on Cape Cod with the Copakens, when Copaken would take his children and the Light children to the movies every day. \u201cFourteen nights out of fourteen,\u201d Light said. \u201cDick would say at seven o\u2019clock, \u2018Hey, who\u2019s up for the movies?\u2019 And, all by himself, he would take the six kids to the movies. The kids had the time of their lives. And Dick would come back and give, with a completely straight face, a rigorous analysis of how each movie was put together, and the direction and the special effects and the animation.\u201d This is a man who has seen two or three movies a week for the past fifty years, who has filed hundreds of plots and characters and scenes away in his mind, and at Daniel he was talking about a movie that touched him as much as any he\u2019d ever seen.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s heard of it,\u201d he said, and he clearly regarded this fact as a minor tragedy. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018Dear Frankie.\u2019 I watched it on a Virgin Atlantic flight because it was the only movie they had that I hadn\u2019t already seen. I had very low expectations. But I was blown away.\u201d He began, in his lawyer-like manner, to lay out the plot. It takes place in Scotland. A woman has fled an abusive relationship with her infant son and is living in a port town. The boy, now nine, is deaf, and misses the father he has never known. His mother has told him that his father is a sailor on a ship that rarely comes to shore, and has suggested that he write his father letters. These she intercepts, and replies to, writing as if she were the father. One day, the boy finds out that what he thinks is his father\u2019s ship is coming to shore. The mother has to find a man to stand in for the father. She does. The two fall in love. Unexpectedly, the real father re\u00ebmerges. He\u2019s dying, and demands to see his son. The mother panics. Then the little boy reveals his secret: he knew about his mother\u2019s ruse all along.\n\u201cI was in tears over this movie,\u201d Copaken said. \u201cYou know, sometimes when you see a movie in the air you\u2019re in such an out-of-body mood that things get exaggerated. So when I got home I sat down and saw it another time. I was bawling again, even though I knew what was coming.\u201d Copaken shook his head, and then looked away. His cheeks were flushed. His voice was suddenly thick. There he was, a buttoned-down corporate lawyer, in a hushed restaurant where there is practically a sign on the wall forbidding displays of human emotion\u2014and he was crying, a third time. \u201cThat absolutely hits me,\u201d he said, his face still turned away. \u201cHe knew all along what the mother was doing.\u201d He stopped to collect himself. \u201cI can\u2019t even retell the damn story without getting emotional.\u201d\n\nHe tried to explain why he was crying. There was the little boy, first of all. He was just about the same age as Copaken\u2019s grandson Jacob. So maybe that was part of it. Perhaps, as well, he was reacting to the idea of an absent parent. His own parents, Albert and Silvia, ran a modest community-law practice in Kansas City, and would shut down their office whenever Copaken or his brother had any kind of school activity or performance. In the Copaken world, it was an iron law that parents had to be present. He told a story about representing the Marshall Islands in negotiations with the U.S. government during the Cold War. A missile-testing range on the island was considered to be strategically critical. The case was enormously complex\u2014involving something like fifty federal agencies and five countries\u2014and, just as the negotiations were scheduled to begin, Copaken learned of a conflict: his eldest daughter was performing the lead role in a sixth-grade production of \u201cThe Wiz.\u201d \u201cI made an instant decision,\u201d Copaken said. He told the President of the Marshall Islands that his daughter had to come first. Half an hour passed. \u201cI get a frantic call from the State Department, very high levels: \u2018Dick, I got a call from the President of the Marshall Islands. What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I told him. He said, \u2018Dick, are you putting in jeopardy the national security of the United States for a sixth-grade production?\u2019 \u201d In the end, the negotiations were suspended while Copaken flew home from Hawaii. \u201cThe point is,\u201d Copaken said, \u201cthat absence at crucial moments has been a worry to me, and maybe this movie just grabbed at that issue.\u201d\n\nHe stopped, seemingly dissatisfied. Was that really why he\u2019d cried? Hollywood is awash in stories of bad fathers and abandoned children, and Copaken doesn\u2019t cry in fancy restaurants every time he thinks of one of them. When he tried to remember the last time he cried at the movies, he was stumped. So he must have been responding to something else, too\u2014some detail, some unconscious emotional trigger in the combination of the mother and the boy and the Scottish seaside town and the ship and the hired surrogate and the dying father. To say that he cried at \u201cDear Frankie\u201d because of that lonely fatherless boy was as inadequate as saying that people cried at the death of Princess Diana because she was a beautiful princess. Surely it mattered as well that she was killed in the company of her lover, a man distrusted by the Royal Family. \u201dt this \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d? And surely it mattered that she died in a tunnel, and that the tunnel was in Paris, and that she was chased by motorbikes, and that she was blond and her lover was dark\u2014because each one of those additional narrative details has complicated emotional associations, and it is the subtle combination of all these associations that makes us laugh or choke up when we remember a certain movie, every single time, even when we\u2019re sitting in a fancy restaurant.\n\nOf course, the optimal combination of all those elements is a mystery. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to make a really memorable movie, and why we reward so richly the few people who can. But suppose you really, really loved the movies, and suppose you were a relentless type, and suppose you used all of the skills you\u2019d learned during the course of your career at the highest rungs of the law to put together an international team of story experts. Do you think you could figure it out?\n\n2.\n\nThe most famous dictum about Hollywood belongs to the screenwriter William Goldman. \u201cNobody knows anything,\u201d Goldman wrote in \u201cAdventures in the Screen Trade\u201d a couple of decades ago. \u201cNot one person in the entire motion picture field knows for a certainty what\u2019s going to work. Every time out it\u2019s a guess.\u201d One of the highest-grossing movies in history, \u201c\u201dRaiders of the Lost Ark,\u201d was offered to every studio in Hollywood, Goldman writes, and every one of them turned it down except Paramount: \u201cWhy did Paramount say yes? Because nobody knows anything. And why did all the other studios say no? Because nobody knows anything. And why did Universal, the mightiest studio of all, pass on Star Wars? . . . Because nobody, nobody\u2014not now, not ever\u2014knows the least goddamn thing about what is or isn\u2019t going to work at the box office.\u201d\n\nWhat Goldman was saying was a version of something that has long been argued about art: that there is no way of getting beyond one\u2019s own impressions to arrive at some larger, objective truth. There are no rules to art, only the infinite variety of subjective experience. \u201cBeauty is no quality in things themselves,\u201d the eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher David Hume wrote. \u201cIt exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.\u201d Hume might as well have said that nobody knows anything.\n\nBut Hume had a Scottish counterpart, Lord Kames, and Lord Kames was equally convinced that traits like beauty, sublimity, and grandeur were indeed reducible to a rational system of rules and precepts. He devised principles of congruity, propriety, and perspicuity: an elevated subject, for instance, must be expressed in elevated language; sound and signification should be in concordance; a woman was most attractive when in distress; depicted misfortunes must never occur by chance. He genuinely thought that the superiority of Virgil\u2019s hexameters to Horace\u2019s could be demonstrated with Euclidean precision, and for every Hume, it seems, there has always been a Kames\u2014someone arguing that if nobody knows anything it is only because nobody\u2019s looking hard enough.\n\nIn a small New York loft, just below Union Square, for example, there is a tech startup called Platinum Blue that consults for companies in the music business. Record executives have tended to be Humean: though they can tell you how they feel when they listen to a song, they don\u2019t believe anyone can know with confidence whether a song is going to be a hit, and, historically, fewer than twenty per cent of the songs picked as hits by music executives have fulfilled those expectations. Platinum Blue thinks it can do better. It has a proprietary computer program that uses \u201cspectral deconvolution software\u201d to measure the mathematical relationships among all of a song\u2019s structural components: melody, harmony, beat, tempo, rhythm, octave, pitch, chord progression, cadence, sonic brilliance, frequency, and so on. On the basis of that analysis, the firm believes it can predict whether a song is likely to become a hit with eighty-per-cent accuracy. Platinum Blue is staunchly Kamesian, and, if you have a field dominated by those who say there are no rules, it is almost inevitable that someone will come along and say that there are. The head of Platinum Blue is a man named Mike McCready, and the service he is providing for the music business is an exact model of what Dick Copaken would like to do for the movie business.\n\nMcCready is in his thirties, baldish and laconic, with rectangular hipster glasses. His offices are in a large, open room, with a row of windows looking east, across the rooftops of downtown Manhattan. In the middle of the room is a conference table, and one morning recently McCready sat down and opened his laptop to demonstrate the Platinum Blue technology. On his screen was a cluster of thousands of white dots, resembling a cloud. This was a \u201cmap\u201d of the songs his group had run through its software: each dot represented a single song, and each song was positioned in the cloud according to its particular mathematical signature. \u201cYou could have one piano sonata by Beethoven at this end and another one here,\u201d McCready said, pointing at the opposite end, \u201cas long as they have completely different chord progressions and completely different melodic structures.\u201d\n\nMcCready then hit a button on his computer, which had the effect of eliminating all the songs that had not made the Billboard Top 30 in the past five years. The screen went from an undifferentiated cloud to sixty discrete clusters. This is what the universe of hit songs from the past five years looks like structurally; hits come out of a small, predictable, and highly conserved set of mathematical patterns. \u201cWe take a new CD far in advance of its release date,\u201d McCready said. \u201cWe analyze all twelve tracks. Then we overlay them on top of the already existing hit clusters, and what we can tell a record company is which of those songs conform to the mathematical pattern of past hits. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that they will be hits. But what we are saying is that, almost certainly, songs that fall outside these clusters will not be \u2014regardless of how much they sound and feel like hit songs, and regardless of how positive your call-out research or focus-group research is.\u201d Four years ago, when McCready was working with a similar version of the program at a firm in Barcelona, he ran thirty just-released albums, chosen at random, through his system. One stood out. The computer said that nine of the fourteen songs on the album had clear hit potential\u2014which was unheard of. Nobody in his group knew much about the artist or had even listened to the record before, but the numbers said the album was going to be big, and McCready and his crew were of the belief that numbers do not lie. \u201cRight around that time, a local newspaper came by and asked us what we were doing,\u201d McCready said. \u201cWe explained the hit-prediction thing, and that we were really turned on to a record by this artist called Norah Jones.\u201d The record was \u201cCome Away with Me.\u201d It went on to sell twenty million copies and win eight Grammy awards.\n\n3.\n\nThe strength of McCready\u2019s analysis is its precision. This past spring, for instance, he analyzed \u201cCrazy,\u201d by Gnarls Barkley. The computer calculated, first of all, the song\u2019s Hit Grade\u2014that is, how close it was to the center of any of those sixty hit clusters. Its Hit Grade was 755, on a scale where anything above 700 is exceptional. The computer also found that \u201cCrazy\u201d belonged to the same hit cluster as Dido\u2019s \u201cThank You,\u201d James Blunt\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Beautiful,\u201d and Ashanti\u2019s \u201cBaby,\u201d as well as older hits like \u201cLet Me Be There,\u201d by Olivia Newton-John, and \u201cOne Sweet Day,\u201d by Mariah Carey, so that listeners who liked any of those songs would probably like \u201cCrazy,\u201d too. Finally, the computer gave \u201cCrazy\u201d a Periodicity Grade\u2014which refers to the fact that, at any given time, only twelve to fifteen hit clusters are \u201cactive,\u201d because from month to month the particular mathematical patterns that excite music listeners will shift around. \u201cCrazy\u201d \u2018s periodicity score was 658\u2014which suggested a very good fit with current tastes. The data said, in other words, that \u201cCrazy\u201d was almost certainly going to be huge\u2014and, sure enough, it was.\nIf \u201cCrazy\u201d hadn\u2019t scored so high, though, the Platinum Blue people would have given the song\u2019s producers broad suggestions for fixing it. McCready said, \u201cWe can tell a producer, \u2018These are the elements that seem to be pushing your song into the hit cluster. These are the variables that are pulling your song away from the hit cluster. The problem seems to be in your bass line.\u2019 And the producer will make a bunch of mixes, where they do something different with the bass lines\u2014increase the decibel level, or muddy it up. Then they come back to us. And we say, \u2018Whatever you were doing with mix No. 3, do a little bit more of that and you\u2019ll be back inside the hit cluster.\u2019\u201d\n\nMcCready stressed that his system didn\u2019t take the art out of hit-making. Someone still had to figure out what to do with mix No. 3, and it was entirely possible that whatever needed to be done to put the song in the hit cluster wouldn\u2019t work, because it would make the song sound wrong\u2014and in order to be a hit a song had to sound right. Still, for the first time you wouldn\u2019t be guessing about what needed to be done. You would know. And what you needed to know in order to fix the song was much simpler than anyone would have thought. McCready didn\u2019t care about who the artist was, or the cleverness of the lyrics. He didn\u2019t even have a way of feeding lyrics into his computer. He cared only about a song\u2019s underlying mathematical structure. \u201cIf you go back to the popular melodies written by Beethoven and Mozart three hundred years ago,\u201d he went on, \u201cthey conform to the same mathematical patterns that we are looking at today. What sounded like a beautiful melody to them sounds like a beautiful melody to us. What has changed is simply that we have come up with new styles and new instruments. Our brains are wired in a way\u2014we assume\u2014that keeps us coming back, again and again, to the same answers, the same pleasure centers.\u201d He had sales data and Top 30 lists and deconvolution software, and it seemed to him that if you put them together you had an objective way of measuring something like beauty. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve figured out how the brain works regarding musical taste,\u201d McCready said.\n\nIt requires a very particular kind of person, of course, to see the world as a code waiting to be broken. Hume once called Kames \u201cthe most arrogant man in the world,\u201d and to take this side of the argument you have to be. Kames was also a brilliant lawyer, and no doubt that matters as well, because to be a good lawyer is to be invested with a reverence for rules. (Hume defied his family\u2019s efforts to make him a lawyer.) And to think like Kames you probably have to be an outsider. Kames was born Henry Home, to a farming family, and grew up in the sparsely populated cropping-and-fishing county of Berwickshire; he became Lord Kames late in life, after he was elevated to the bench. (Hume was born and reared in Edinburgh.) His early published work was about law and its history, but he soon wandered into morality, religion, anthropology, soil chemistry, plant nutrition, and the physical sciences, and once asked his friend Benjamin Franklin to explain the movement of smoke in chimneys. Those who believe in the power of broad patterns and rules, rather than the authority of individuals or institutions, are not intimidated by the boundaries and hierarchies of knowledge. They don\u2019t defer to the superior expertise of insiders; they set up shop in a small loft somewhere downtown and take on the whole music industry at once. The difference between Hume and Kames is, finally, a difference in kind, not degree. You\u2019re either a Kamesian or you\u2019re not. And if you were to create an archetypal Kamesian\u2014to combine lawyerliness, outsiderness, and supreme self-confidence in one dapper, Charlie Brown-headed combination? You\u2019d end up with Dick Copaken.\n\n\u201cI remember when I was a sophomore in high school and I went into the bathroom once to wash my hands,\u201d Copaken said. \u201cI noticed the bubbles on the sink, and it fascinated me the way these bubbles would form and move around and float and reform, and I sat there totally transfixed. My father called me, and I didn\u2019t hear him. Finally, he comes in. \u2018Son. What the . . . are you all right?\u2019 I said, \u2018Bubbles, Dad, look what they do.\u2019 He said, \u2018Son, if you\u2019re going to waste your time, waste it on something that may have some future consequence.\u2019 Well, I kind of rose to the challenge. That summer, I bicycled a couple of miles to a library in Kansas City and I spent every day reading every book and article I could find on bubbles.\u201d\n\nBubbles looked completely random, but young Copaken wasn\u2019t convinced. He built a bubble-making device involving an aerator from a fish tank, and at school he pleaded with the math department to teach him the quadratic equations he needed to show why the bubbles formed the way they did. Then he devised an experiment, and ended up with a bronze medal at the International Science Fair. His interest in bubbles was genuine, but the truth is that almost anything could have caught Copaken\u2019s eye: pop songs, movies, the movement of chimney smoke. What drew him was not so much solving this particular problem as the general principle that problems were solvable\u2014that he, little Dick Copaken from Kansas City, could climb on his bicycle and ride to the library and figure out something that his father thought wasn\u2019t worth figuring out.\n\nCopaken has written a memoir of his experience defending the tiny Puerto Rican islands of Culebra and Vieques against the U.S. Navy, which had been using their beaches for target practice. It is a riveting story. Copaken takes on the vast Navy bureaucracy, armed only with arcane provisions of environmental law. He investigates the nesting grounds of the endangered hawksbill turtle, and the mating habits of a tiny yet extremely loud tree frog known as the coqui, and at one point he transports four frozen whale heads from the Bahamas to Harvard Medical School. Copaken wins. The Navy loses.\n\nThe memoir reads like a David-and-Goliath story. It isn\u2019t. David changed the rules on Goliath. He brought a slingshot to a sword fight. People like Copaken, though, don\u2019t change the rules; they believe in rules. Copaken would have agreed to sword-on-sword combat. But then he would have asked the referee for a stay, deposed Goliath and his team at great length, and papered him with brief after brief until he conceded that his weapon did not qualify as a sword under \u00a748(B)(6)(e) of the Samaria Convention of 321 B.C. (The Philistines would have settled.) And whereas David knew that he couldn\u2019t win a conventional fight with Goliath, the conviction that sustained Copaken\u2019s long battle with the Navy was, to the contrary, that so long as the battle remained conventional\u2014so long as it followed the familiar pathways of the law and of due process\u2014he really could win. Dick Copaken didn\u2019t think he was an underdog at all. If you believe in rules, Goliath is just another Philistine, and the Navy is just another plaintiff. As for the ineffable mystery of the Hollywood blockbuster? Well, Mr. Goldman, you may not know anything. But I do.\n\n4.\n\nDick Copaken has a friend named Nick Meaney. They met on a case years ago. Meaney has thick dark hair. He is younger and much taller than Copaken, and seems to regard his friend with affectionate amusement. Meaney\u2019s background is in risk management, and for years he\u2019d been wanting to bring the principles of that world to the movie business. In 2003, Meaney and Copaken were driving through the English countryside to Durham when Meaney told Copaken about a friend of his from college. The friend and his business partner were students of popular narrative: the sort who write essays for obscure journals serving the small band of people who think deeply about, say, the evolution of the pilot episode in transnational TV crime dramas. And, for some time, they had been developing a system for evaluating the commercial potential of stories. The two men, Meaney told Copaken, had broken down the elements of screenplay narrative into multiple categories, and then drawn on their encyclopedic knowledge of television and film to assign scripts a score in each of those categories\u2014creating a giant screenplay report card. The system was extraordinarily elaborate. It was under constant refinement. It was also top secret. Henceforth, Copaken and Meaney would refer to the two men publicly only as \u201cMr. Pink\u201d and \u201cMr. Brown,\u201d an homage to \u201cReservoir Dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe guy had a big wall, and he started putting up little Post-its covering everything you can think of,\u201d Copaken said. It was unclear whether he was talking about Mr. Pink or Mr. Brown or possibly some Obi-Wan Kenobi figure from whom Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown first learned their trade. \u201cYou know, the star wears a blue shirt. The star doesn\u2019t zip up his pants. Whatever. So he put all these factors up and began moving them around as the scripts were either successful or unsuccessful, and he began grouping them and eventually this evolved to a kind of ad-hoc analytical system. He had no theory as to what would work, he just wanted to know what did work.\u201d\n\nCopaken and Meaney also shared a fascination with a powerful kind of computerized learning system called an artificial neural network. Neural networks are used for data mining\u2014to look for patterns in very large amounts of data. In recent years, they have become a critical tool in many industries, and what Copaken and Meaney realized, when they thought about Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown, was that it might now be possible to bring neural networks to Hollywood. They could treat screenplays as mathematical propositions, using Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown\u2019s categories and scores as the motion-picture equivalents of melody, harmony, beat, tempo, rhythm, octave, pitch, chord progression, cadence, sonic brilliance, and frequency.\n\nCopaken and Meaney brought in a former colleague of Meaney\u2019s named Sean Verity, and the three of them signed up Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown. They called their company Epagogix\u2014a reference to Aristotle\u2019s discussion of epagogic, or inductive, learning\u2014and they started with a \u201ctraining set\u201d of screenplays that Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown had graded. Copaken and Meaney won\u2019t disclose how many scripts were in the training set. But let\u2019s say it was two hundred. Those scores\u2014along with the U.S. box-office receipts for each of the films made from those screenplays\u2014were fed into a neural network built by a computer scientist of Meaney\u2019s acquaintance. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you his name,\u201d Meaney said, \u201cbut he\u2019s English to his bootstraps.\u201d Mr. Bootstraps then went to work, trying to use Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown\u2019s scoring data to predict the box-office receipts of every movie in the training set. He started with the first film and had the neural network make a guess: maybe it said that the hero\u2019s moral crisis in act one, which rated a 7 on the 10-point moral-crisis scale, was worth $7 million, and having a gorgeous red-headed eighteen-year-old female lead whose characterization came in at 6.5 was worth $3 million and a 9-point bonding moment between the male lead and a four-year-old boy in act three was worth $2 million, and so on, putting a dollar figure on every grade on Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown\u2019s report card until the system came up with a prediction. Then it compared its guess with how that movie actually did. Was it close? Of course not. The neural network then went back and tried again. If it had guessed $20 million and the movie actually made $110 million, it would reweight the movie\u2019s Pink/Brown scores and run the numbers a second time. And then it would take the formula that worked best on Movie One and apply it to Movie Two, and tweak that until it had a formula that worked on Movies One and Two, and take that formula to Movie Three, and then to four and five, and on through all two hundred movies, whereupon it would go back through all the movies again, through hundreds of thousands of iterations, until it had worked out a formula that did the best possible job of predicting the financial success of every one of the movies in its database.\n\nThat formula, the theory goes, can then be applied to new scripts. If you were developing a $75-million buddy picture for Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell, Epagogix says, it can tell you, based on past experience, what that script\u2019s particular combination of narrative elements can be expected to make at the box office. If the formula says it\u2019s a $50-million script, you pull the plug. \u201cWe shoot turkeys,\u201d Meaney said. He had seen Mr. Bootstraps and the neural network in action: \u201cIt can sometimes go on for hours. If you look at the computer, you see lots of flashing numbers in a gigantic grid. It\u2019s like \u2018The Matrix.\u2019 There are a lot of computations. The guy is there, the whole time, looking at it. It eventually stops flashing, and it tells us what it thinks the American box-office will be. A number comes out.\u201d\nThe way the neural network thinks is not that different from the way a Hollywood executive thinks: if you pitch a movie to a studio, the executive uses an ad-hoc algorithm\u2014perfected through years of trial and error\u2014to put a value on all the components in the story. Neural networks, though, can handle problems that have a great many variables, and they never play favorites\u2014which means (at least in theory) that as long as you can give the neural network the same range of information that a human decision-maker has, it ought to come out ahead. That\u2019s what the University of Arizona computer scientist Hsinchun Chen demonstrated ten years ago, when he built a neural network to predict winners at the dog track. Chen used the ten variables that greyhound experts told him they used in making their bets\u2014like fastest time and winning percentage and results for the past seven races\u2014and trained his system with the results of two hundred races. Then he went to the greyhound track in Tucson and challenged three dog-racing handicappers to a contest. Everyone picked winners in a hundred races, at a modest two dollars a bet. The experts lost $71.40, $61.20, and $70.20, respectively. Chen won $124.80. It wasn\u2019t close, and one of the main reasons was the special interest the neural network showed in something called \u201crace grade\u201d: greyhounds are moved up and down through a number of divisions, according to their ability, and dogs have a big edge when they\u2019ve just been bumped down a level and a big handicap when they\u2019ve just been bumped up. \u201cThe experts know race grade exists, but they don\u2019t weight it sufficiently,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThey are all looking at win percentage, place percentage, or thinking about the dogs\u2019 times.\u201d\n\nCopaken and Meaney figured that Hollywood\u2019s experts also had biases and skipped over things that really mattered. If a neural network won at the track, why not Hollywood? \u201cOne of the most powerful aspects of what we do is the ruthless objectivity of our system,\u201d Copaken said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t care about maintaining relationships with stars or agents or getting invited to someone\u2019s party. It doesn\u2019t care about climbing the corporate ladder. It has one master and one master only: how do you get to bigger box-office? Nobody else in Hollywood is like that.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Copaken approached Josh Berger, a senior executive at Warner Bros. in Europe. Meaney was opposed to the idea: in his mind, it was too early. \u201cI just screamed at Dick,\u201d he said. But Copaken was adamant. He had Mr. Bootstraps, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Brown run sixteen television pilots through the neural network, and try to predict the size of each show\u2019s eventual audience. \u201cI told Josh, \u2018Stick this in a drawer, and I\u2019ll come back at the end of the season and we can check to see how we did,\u2019 \u201d Copaken said. In January of 2004, Copaken tabulated the results. In six cases, Epagogix guessed the number of American homes that would tune in to a show to within .06 per cent. In thirteen of the sixteen cases, its predictions were within two per cent. Berger was floored. \u201cIt was incredible,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was like someone saying to you, \u2018We\u2019re going to show you how to count cards in Vegas.\u2019 It had that sort of quality.\u201d\n\nCopaken then approached another Hollywood studio. He was given nine unreleased movies to analyze. Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Bootstraps worked only from the script\u2014without reference to the stars or the director or the marketing budget or the producer. On three of the films\u2014two of which were low-budget\u2014the Epagogix estimates were way off. On the remaining six\u2014including two of the studio\u2019s biggest-budget productions\u2014they correctly identified whether the film would make or lose money. On one film, the studio thought it had a picture that would make a good deal more than $100 million. Epagogix said $49 million. The movie made less than $40 million. On another, a big-budget picture, the team\u2019s estimate came within $1.2 million of the final gross. On a number of films, they were surprisingly close. \u201cThey were basically within a few million,\u201d a senior executive at the studio said. \u201cIt was shocking. It was kind of weird.\u201d Had the studio used Epagogix on those nine scripts before filming started, it could have saved tens of millions of dollars. \u201cI was impressed by a couple of things,\u201d another executive at the same studio said. \u201cI was impressed by the things they thought mattered to a movie. They weren\u2019t the things that we typically give credit to. They cared about the venue, and whether it was a love story, and very specific things about the plot that they were convinced determined the outcome more than anything else. It felt very objective. And they could care less about whether the lead was Tom Cruise or Tom Jones.\u201d\n\nThe Epagogix team knocked on other doors that weren\u2019t quite so welcoming. This was the problem with being a Kamesian. Your belief in a rule-bound universe was what gave you, an outsider, a claim to real expertise. But you were still an outsider. You were still Dick Copaken, the blue-blazered corporate lawyer who majored in bubbles as a little boy in Kansas City, and a couple of guys from the risk-management business, and three men called Pink, Brown, and Bootstraps\u2014and none of you had ever made a movie in your life. And what were you saying? That stars didn\u2019t matter, that the director didn\u2019t matter, and that all that mattered was story\u2014and, by the way, that you understood story the way the people on the inside, people who had spent a lifetime in the motion-picture business, didn\u2019t. \u201cThey called, and they said they had a way of predicting box-office success or failure, which is everyone\u2019s fantasy,\u201d one former studio chief recalled. \u201cI said to them, \u2018I hope you\u2019re right.\u2019 \u201d The executive seemed to think of the Epagogix team as a small band of Martians who had somehow slipped their U.F.O. past security. \u201cIn reality, there are so many circumstances that can affect a movie\u2019s success,\u201d the executive went on. \u201cMaybe the actor or actress has an external problem. Or this great actor, for whatever reason, just fails. You have to fire a director. Or September 11th or some other thing happens. There are many people who have come forward saying they have a way of predicting box-office success, but so far nobody has been able to do it. I think we know something. We just don\u2019t know enough. I still believe in something called that magical thing\u2014talent, the unexpected. The movie god has to shine on you.\u201d You were either a Kamesian or you weren\u2019t, and this person wasn\u2019t: \u201cMy first reaction to those guys? Bullshit.\u201d\n\n5.\n\nA few months ago, Dick Copaken agreed to lift the cloud of unknowing surrounding Epagogix, at least in part. He laid down three conditions: the meeting was to be in London, Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown would continue to be known only as Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown, and no mention was to be made of the team\u2019s current projects. After much discussion, an agreement was reached. Epagogix would analyze the 2005 movie \u201cThe Interpreter,\u201d which was directed by Sydney Pollack and starred Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman. \u201cThe Interpreter\u201d had a complicated history, having gone through countless revisions, and there was a feeling that it could have done much better at the box office. If ever there was an ideal case study for the alleged wizardry of Epagogix, this was it.\n\nThe first draft of the movie was written by Charles Randolph, a philosophy professor turned screenwriter. It opened in the fictional African country of Matobo. Two men in a Land Rover pull up to a soccer stadium. A group of children lead them to a room inside the building. On the ground is a row of corpses.\n\nCut to the United Nations, where we meet Silvia Broome, a young woman who works as an interpreter. She goes to the U.N. Security Service and relates a terrifying story. The previous night, while working late in the interpreter\u2019s booth, she overheard two people plotting the assassination of Matobo\u2019s murderous dictator, Edmund Zuwanie, who is coming to New York to address the General Assembly. She says that the plotters saw her, and that her life may be in danger. The officer assigned to her case, Tobin Keller, is skeptical, particularly when he learns that she, too, is from Matobo, and that her parents were killed in the country\u2019s civil war. But after Broome suffers a series of threatening incidents Keller starts to believe her. His job is to protect Zuwanie, but he now feels moved to act as Broome\u2019s bodyguard as well. A quiet, slightly ambiguous romantic attraction begins to develop between them. Zuwanie\u2019s visit draws closer. Broome\u2019s job is to be his interpreter. On the day of the speech, Broome ends up in the greenroom with Zuwanie. Keller suddenly realizes the truth: that she has made up the whole story as a way of bringing Zuwanie to justice. He rushes to the greenroom. Broome, it seems, has poisoned Zuwanie and is withholding the antidote unless he goes onstage and confesses to the murder of his countrymen. He does. Broome escapes. A doctor takes a look at the poison. It\u2019s harmless. The doctor turns to the dictator, who has just been tricked into writing his own prison sentence: \u201cYou were never in danger, Mr. Zuwanie.\u201d\n\nRandolph says that the film he was thinking of while he was writing \u201cThe Interpreter\u201d was Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s classic \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d He wanted to make a spare, stark movie about an isolated figure. \u201cShe\u2019s a terrorist,\u201d Randolph said of Silvia Broome. \u201cShe comes to this country to do a very specific task, and when that task is done she\u2019s gone again. I wanted to write about this idea of a noble terrorist, who tried to achieve her ends with a character assassination, not a real assassination.\u201d Randolph realized that most moviegoers\u2014and most Hollywood executives\u2014prefer characters who have psychological motivations. But he wasn\u2019t trying to make \u201cDie Hard.\u201d \u201cLook, I\u2019m the son of a preacher,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that ideology motivates people.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, Sydney Pollack signed on to direct the project. He loved the idea of an interpreter at the United Nations and the conceit of an overheard conversation. But he wanted to make a commercial movie, and parts of the script didn\u2019t feel right to him. He didn\u2019t like the twist at the end, for instance. \u201cI felt like I had been tricked, because in fact there was no threat,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cAs much as I liked the original script, I felt like an audience would somehow, at the end, feel cheated.\u201d Pollack also felt that audiences would want much more from Silvia Broome\u2019s relationship with Tobin Keller. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to do a movie without a love story in it,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, the heart of it is always the man and the woman and who they are and what they are going through.\u201d Pollack brought Randolph back for rewrites. He then hired Scott Frank and Steven Zaillian, two of the most highly sought-after screenwriters in Hollywood\u2014and after several months the story was turned inside out. Now Broome didn\u2019t tell the story of overhearing that conversation. It actually happened. She wasn\u2019t a terrorist anymore. She was a victim. She \u201dt an isolated figure. She was given a social life. She wasn\u2019t manipulating Keller. Their relationship was more prominent. A series of new characters\u2014political allies and opponents of Zuwanie\u2019s\u2014were added, as was a scene in Brooklyn where a bus explodes, almost killing Broome. \u201cI remember when I came on \u2018Minority Report,\u2019 and started over,\u201d said Frank, who wrote many of the new scenes for \u201cThe Interpreter.\u201d \u201cThere weren\u2019t many characters. When I finished, there were two mysteries and a hundred characters. I have diarrhea of the plot. This movie cried out for that. There are never enough suspects and red herrings.\u201d\n\nThe lingering problem, though, was the ending. If Broome wasn\u2019t after Zuwanie, who was? \u201cWe struggled,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cIt was a long process, to the point where we almost gave up.\u201d In the end, Zuwanie was made the engineer of the plot: he fakes the attempt on his life in order to justify his attacks on his enemies back home. Zuwanie hires a man to shoot him, and then another of Zuwanie\u2019s men shoots the assassin before he can do the job\u2014and in the chaos Broome ends up with a gun in her hand, training it on Zuwanie. \u201cThe end was the hardest part,\u201d Frank said. \u201cAll these balls were in the air. But I couldn\u2019t find a satisfying way to resolve it. We had to put a gun in the hand of a pacifist. I couldn\u2019t quite sew it up in the right way. Sydney kept saying, \u2018You\u2019re so close.\u2019 But I kept saying, \u2018Yeah, but I don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m writing.\u2019 I wonder if I did a disservice to \u2018The Interpreter.\u2019 I don\u2019t know that I made it better. I may have just made it different.\u201d\n\nThis, then, was the question for Epagogix: If Pollack\u2019s goal was to make \u201cThe Interpreter\u201d a more commercial movie, how well did he succeed? And could he have done better?\n\n6.\n\nThe debriefing took place in central London, behind the glass walls of the private dining room of a Mayfair restaurant. The waiters came in waves, murmuring their announcements of the latest arrival from the kitchen. The table was round. Copaken, dapper as always in his navy blazer, sat next to Sean Verity, followed by Meaney, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Pink. Mr. Brown was very tall, and seemed to have a northern English accent. Mr. Pink was slender and graying, and had an air of authority about him. His academic training was in biochemistry. He said he thought that, in the highly emotional business of Hollywood, having a scientific background was quite useful. There was no sign of Mr. Bootstraps.\n\nMr. Pink began by explaining the origins of their system. \u201cThere were certain historical events that allowed us to go back and test how appealing one film was against another,\u201d he said. \u201cThe very simple one is that in the English market, in the sixties on Sunday night, religious programming aired on the major networks. Nobody watched it. And, as soon as that finished, movies came on. There were no lead-ins, and only two competing channels. Plus, across the country you had a situation where the commercial sector was playing a whole variety of movies against the standard, the BBC. It might be a John Wayne movie in Yorkshire, and a musical in Somerset, and the BBC would be the same movie everywhere. So you had a control. It was very pure and very simple. That was a unique opportunity to try and make some guesstimates as to why movies were doing what they were doing.\u201d\n\nBrown nodded. \u201cWe built a body of evidence until we had something systematic,\u201d he said.\n\nPink estimated that they had analyzed thousands of movies. \u201cThe thing is that not everything comes to you as a script. For a long period, we worked for a broadcaster who used to send us a couple of paragraphs. We made our predictions based on that much. Having the script is actually too much information sometimes. You\u2019re trying to replicate what the audience is doing. They\u2019re trying to make a choice between three movies, and all they have at that point is whatever they\u2019ve seen in TV Guide or on any trailer they\u2019ve seen. We have to take a piece here and a piece here. Take a couple of reference points. When I look at a story, there are certain things I\u2019m looking for\u2014certain themes, and characters you immediately focus on.\u201d He thought for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s not to deny that it matters whether the lead character wears a hat,\u201d he added, in a way that suggested he and Mr. Brown had actually thought long and hard about leads and hats.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a pattern,\u201d he went on. \u201cThere are certain stories that come back, time and time again, and that always work. You know, whenever we go into a market\u2014and we work in fifty markets\u2014the initial thing people say is \u2018What do you know about our market?\u2019 The assumption is that, say, Japan is different from us\u2014that there has to be something else going on there. But, basically, they\u2019re just like us. It\u2019s the consistency of these reappearing things that I find amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiblical stories are a classic case,\u201d Mr. Brown put in. \u201cThere is something about what they\u2019re telling and the message that\u2019s coming out that seems to be so universal. With Mel Gibson\u2019s \u2018The Passion,\u2019 people always say, \u2018Who could have predicted that?\u2019 And the answer is, we could have.\u201d\n\nThey had looked at \u201cThe Interpreter\u201d scripts a few weeks earlier. The process typically takes them a day. They read, they graded, and then they compared notes, because Mr. Pink was the sort who went for \u201cYojimbo\u201d and Mr. Brown\u2019s favorite movie was \u201cAlien\u201d (the first one), so they didn\u2019t always agree. Mr. Brown couldn\u2019t remember a single script he\u2019d read where he thought there wasn\u2019t room for improvement, and Mr. Pink, when asked the same question, could come up with just one: \u201cLethal Weapon.\u201d \u201cA friend of mine gave me the shooting script before it came out, and I remember reading it and thinking, It\u2019s all there. It was all on the page.\u201d Once Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown had scored \u201cThe Interpreter,\u201d they gave their analyses to Mr. Bootstraps, who did fifteen runs through the neural network: the original Randolph script, the shooting script, and certain variants of the plot that Epagogix devised. Mr. Bootstraps then passed his results to Copaken, who wrote them up. The Epagogix reports are always written by Copaken, and they are models of lawyerly thoroughness. This one ran to thirty-eight pages. He had finished the final draft the night before, very late. He looked fresh as a daisy.\n\nMr. Pink started with the original script. \u201cMy pure reaction? I found it very difficult to read. I got confused. I had to reread bits. We do this a lot. If a project takes more than an hour to read, then there\u2019s something going on that I\u2019m not terribly keen on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel to me like a mass-appeal movie,\u201d Mr. Brown added. \u201cIt seemed more niche.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Bootstraps ran Randolph\u2019s original draft through the neural network, the computer called it a $33-million movie\u2014an \u201cintelligent\u201d thriller, in the same commercial range as \u201cThe Constant Gardener\u201d or \u201cOut of Sight.\u201d According to the formula, the final shooting script was a $69-million picture (an estimate that came within $4 million of the actual box-office). Mr. Brown wasn\u2019t surprised. The shooting script, he said, \u201cfelt more like an American movie, where the first one seemed European in style.\u201d\n\nEveryone agreed, though, that Pollack could have done much better. There was, first of all, the matter of the United Nations. \u201cThey had a unique opportunity to get inside the building,\u201d Mr. Pink said. \u201cBut I came away thinking that it could have been set in any boxy office tower in Manhattan. An opportunity was missed. That\u2019s when we get irritated\u2014when there are opportunities that could very easily be turned into something that would actually have had an impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cLocale is an extra character,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cBut in this case it\u2019s a very bland character that didn\u2019t really help.\u201d\n\nIn the Epagogix secret formula, it seemed, locale matters a great deal. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a big difference between city and countryside,\u201d Mr. Pink said. \u201cIt can have a huge effect on a movie\u2019s ability to draw in viewers. And writers just do not take advantage of it. We have a certain set of values that we attach to certain places.\u201d\n\nMr. Pink and Mr. Brown ticked off the movies and television shows that they thought understood the importance of locale: \u201cCrimson Tide,\u201d \u201cLawrence of Arabia,\u201d \u201cLost,\u201d \u201cSurvivor,\u201d \u201cCastaway,\u201d \u201cDeliverance.\u201d Mr. Pink said, \u201cThe desert island is something that we have always recognized as a pungent backdrop, but it\u2019s not used that often. In the same way, prisons can be a powerful environment, because they are so well defined.\u201d The U.N. could have been like that, but it wasn\u2019t. Then there was the problem of starting, as both scripts did, in Africa\u2014and not just Africa but a fictional country in Africa. The whole team found that crazy. \u201cAudiences are pretty parochial, by and large,\u201d Mr. Pink said. \u201cIf you start off by telling them, \u2018We\u2019re going to begin this movie in Africa,\u2019 you\u2019re going to lose them. They\u2019ve bought their tickets. But when they come out they\u2019re going to say, \u2018It was all right. But it was Africa.\u2019 \u201d The whole thing seemed to leave Mr. Pink quite distressed. He looked at Mr. Brown beseechingly.\n\nMr. Brown changed the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how often quite little things, quite small aspects, can spoil everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember seeing the trailer for \u2018V for Vendetta\u2019 and deciding against it right there, for one very simple reason: there was a ridiculous mask on the main character. If you can\u2019t see the face of the character, you can\u2019t tell what that person is thinking. You can\u2019t tell who they are. With \u2018Spider-Man\u2019 and \u2018Superman,\u2019 though, you do see the face, so you respond to them.\u201d\n\nThe team once gave a studio a script analysis in which almost everything they suggested was, in Hollywood terms, small. They wanted the lead to jump off the page a little more. They wanted the lead to have a young sidekick\u2014a relatively minor character\u2014to connect with a younger demographic, and they wanted the city where the film was set to be much more of a presence. The neural network put the potential value of better characterization at an extra $2.46 million in U.S. box-office revenue; the value of locale adjustment at $4.92 million; the value of a sidekick at $12.3 million\u2014and the value of all three together (given the resulting synergies) at $24.6 million. That\u2019s another $25 million for a few weeks of rewrites and maybe a day or two of extra filming. Mr. Bootstraps, incidentally, ran the numbers and concluded that the script would make $47 million if the suggested changes were not made. The changes were not made. The movie made $50 million.\n\nMr. Pink and Mr. Brown went on to discuss the second \u201cInterpreter\u201d screenplay, the shooting script. They thought the ending was implausible. Charles Randolph had originally suggested that the Tobin Keller character be black, not white, in order to create the frisson of bringing together a white African and a black American. Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown independently came to the same conclusion. Apparently, the neural network ran the numbers on movies that paired black and white leads\u2014\u201dLethal Weapon,\u201d \u201cThe Crying Game,\u201d \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d \u201cMen in Black,\u201d \u201cDie Another Day,\u201d \u201cThe Pelican Brief\u201d\u2014and found that the black-white combination could increase box-office revenue. The computer did the same kind of analysis on Scott Frank\u2019s \u201cdiarrhea of the plot,\u201d and found that there were too many villains. And if Silvia Broome was going to be in danger, Mr. Bootstraps made clear, she really had to be in danger.\n\n\u201cOur feeling\u2014and Dick, you may have to jump in here\u2014is that the notion of a woman in peril is a very powerful narrative element,\u201d Mr. Pink said. He glanced apprehensively at Copaken, evidently concerned that what he was about to say might fall in the sensitive category of the proprietary. \u201cHow powerful?\u201d He chose his words carefully. \u201cWell above average. And the problem is that we lack a sense of how much danger she is in, so an opportunity is missed. There were times when you were thinking, Is this something she has created herself? Is someone actually after her? You are confused. There is an element of doubt, and that ambiguity makes it possible to doubt the danger of the situation.\u201d Of course, all that ambiguity was there because in the Randolph script she was making it all up, and we were supposed to doubt the danger of the situation. But Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown believed that, once you decided you weren\u2019t going to make a European-style niche movie, you had to abandon ambiguity altogether.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to make the peril real,\u201d Mr. Pink said.\n\nThe Epagogix revise of \u201cThe Interpreter\u201d starts with an upbeat Silvia Broome walking into the United Nations, flirting with the security guard. The two men plotting the assassination later see her and chase her through the labyrinthine cor-ridors of what could only be the U.N. building. The ambiguous threats to Broome\u2019s life are now explicit. At one point in the Epagogix version, a villain pushes Broome\u2019s Vespa off one of Manhattan\u2019s iconic East River bridges. She hangs on to her motorbike for dear life, as it swings precariously over the edge of the parapet. Tobin Keller, in a police helicopter, swoops into view: \u201cAs she clings to Tobin\u2019s muscular body while the two of them are hoisted up into the hovering helicopter, we sense that she is feeling more than relief.\u201d In the Epagogix ending, Broome stabs one of Zuwanie\u2019s security men with a knife. Zuwanie storms off the stage, holds a press conference, and is shot dead by a friend of Broome\u2019s brother. Broome cradles the dying man in her arms. He \u201d dies peacefully,\u201d with \u201d a smile on his blood-spattered face.\u201d Then she gets appointed Matobo\u2019s U.N. ambassador. She turns to Keller. \u201c\u2018This time,\u2019 she notes with a wry smile . . . \u2018you will have to protect me.\u2019 \u201d Bootstraps\u2019s verdict was that this version would result in a U.S. box-office of $111 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Mr. Pink said. \u201cThis past weekend, \u2018The Bodyguard\u2019 was on TV. Remember that piece of\u201d\u2014he winced\u2014\u201dentertainment? Which is about a bodyguard and a woman. The final scene is that they are right back together. It is very clearly and deliberately sown. That is the commercial way, if you want more bodies in the seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to either consummate it or allow for the possibility of that,\u201d Copaken agreed.\n\nThey were thinking now of what would happen if they abandoned all fealty to the original, and simply pushed the movie\u2019s premise as far as they could possibly go.\n\nMr. Pink went on, \u201cIf Dick had said, \u2018You can take this project wherever you want,\u2019 we probably would have ended up with something a lot closer to \u2018The Bodyguard\u2019\u2014where you have a much more romantic film, a much more powerful focus to the two characters\u2014without all the political stuff going on in the background. You go for the emotions on a very basic level. What would be the upper limit on that? You know, the upper limit of anything these days is probably still \u2018Titanic.\u2019 I\u2019m not saying we could do six hundred million dollars. But it could be two hundred million.\u201d\n\n7.\n\nIt was clear that the whole conversation was beginning to make Mr. Pink uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t like \u201cThe Bodyguard.\u201d Even the title made him wince. He was the sort who liked \u201cYojimbo,\u201d after all. The question went around the room: What would you do with \u201cThe Interpreter\u201d? Sean Verity wanted to juice up the action-adventure elements and push it to the $150- to $160-million range. Meaney wanted to do without expensive stars: he didn\u2019t think they were worth the money. Copaken wanted more violence, and he also favored making Keller black. But he didn\u2019t want to go all the way to \u201cThe Bodyguard,\u201d either. This was a man who loved \u201cDear Frankie\u201d as much as any film he\u2019d seen in recent memory, and \u201cDear Frankie\u201d had a domestic box-office gross of $1.3 million. If you followed the rules of Epagogix, there wouldn\u2019t be any movies like \u201cDear Frankie.\u201d The neural network had one master, the market, and answered one question: how do you get to bigger box-office? But once a movie had made you vulnerable\u2014once you couldn\u2019t even retell the damn story without getting emotional\u2014you couldn\u2019t be content with just one master anymore.\n\nThat was the thing about the formula: it didn\u2019t make the task of filmmaking easier. It made it harder. So long as nobody knows anything, you\u2019ve got license to do whatever you want. You can start a movie in Africa. You can have male and female leads not go off together\u2014all in the name of making something new. Once you came to think that you knew something, though, you had to decide just how much money you were willing to risk for your vision. Did the Epagogix team know what the answer to that question was? Of course not. That question required imagination, and they weren\u2019t in the imagination business. They were technicians with tools: computer programs and analytical systems and proprietary software that calculated mathematical relationships among a laundry list of structural variables. At Platinum Blue, Mike McCready could tell you that the bass line was pushing your song out of the center of hit cluster 31. But he couldn\u2019t tell you exactly how to fix the bass line, and he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the redone version would still sound like a hit, and you didn\u2019t see him releasing his own album of computer-validated pop music. A Kamesian had only to read Lord Kames to appreciate the distinction. The most arrogant man in the world was a terrible writer: clunky, dense, prolix. He knew the rules of art. But that didn\u2019t make him an artist.\n\nMr. Brown spoke last. \u201cI don\u2019t think it needs to be a big-budget picture,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we do what we can with the original script to make it a strong story, with an ending that is memorable, and then do a slow release. A low-budget picture. One that builds through word of mouth\u2014something like that.\u201d He was confident that he had the means to turn a $69-million script into a $111-million movie, and then again into a $150- to $200-million blockbuster. But it had been a long afternoon, and part of him had a stubborn attachment to \u201cThe Interpreter\u201d in something like its original form. Mr. Bootstraps might have disagreed. But Mr. Bootstraps was nowhere to be seen.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1164180", "artist_names": "Tom Jones", "full_title": "Love Me Tonight by\u00a0Tom\u00a0Jones", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/6cea9a912b9cb199e064b4291f3a221c.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6cea9a912b9cb199e064b4291f3a221c.587x587x1.jpg", "id": 1164180, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429676609, "path": "/Tom-jones-love-me-tonight-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Tom-jones-love-me-tonight-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1969, "month": 9, "day": 5}, "release_date_for_display": "September 5, 1969", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 5, 1969", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/6cea9a912b9cb199e064b4291f3a221c.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6cea9a912b9cb199e064b4291f3a221c.587x587x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Love Me Tonight", "title_with_featured": "Love Me Tonight", "updated_by_human_at": 1633244209, "url": "https://genius.com/Tom-jones-love-me-tonight-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/11195", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/20895530f2bd2a27a1b423e385aee66d.361x140x1.png", "id": 11195, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3eadd026cb04927c99aa4de2d44139fd.479x600x1.jpg", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Tom Jones", "slug": "Tom-jones", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Tom-jones"}, "artist": "Tom Jones", "lyrics": "Love Me Tonight LyricsI know that it's late and I really must leave you alone\nBut you're too good to hold that I feel such a long way from home\nYes I know that our love is too new, but I promise it's going to be true\nPlease let me stay and don't you send me away, oh no, no\n\nAaaah\nTell me baby that you need me, say you'll never leave me\nLove me tonight\n\nHold me now my heart is aching, untill the dawn is breaking\nLove me tonight\nSomething is burning inside, something that can't be denied\nI can't let you out of my sight, darling\nLove me tonight\n\nLet me love you, baby\nLet me love you, baby\nBaby, love me tonight\n\nI' ve waited so long for the girl of my dreams to appear\nAnd now I can hardly believe that you really are here\nHere in my arms you belong, how can this feeling be wrong\nDarling be kind for I' m out of my mind over you\n\nAaaahh\nTell me baby, that you need me, say you'll never leave me\nLove me tonight\n\nBaby now the pain is stronger, I can't wait a moment longer\nLove me tonight\n\nSomething is burning inside, something that can't be denied\nI can't let you out of my sight darling\nLove me tonight\n\nLet me love you, baby\nLet me love you, baby\nBaby, love me tonight\nLove me to-ni-i-i-i-i-i-ight!!You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/187785", "artist_names": "Richard F.

Burton", "lyrics": "Arabian Nights,Vol. 2 (Chap. 3) LyricsTale of King Omar Bin Al-Nu'uman and His Sons Sharrkan and Zau Al-Makan\n\nAnd What Befel Them of Things Seld-Seen and Peregrine.[FN#138]\n\nThe King asked her, \"And what was their story?\" and she answered: It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was in the City of Safety, Baghdad, before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marw\u00e1n,[FN#139] a King, Omar bin al-Nu'um\u00e1n highs, who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the Chosro\u00ebs of Persia and the Kaysars of Eastern Rome; for none could warm himself at his fire;[FN#140] nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray; and, when he was angered, there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame. He had made himself King over all quarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sind and Sin,[FN#141] the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains of Al-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China. Moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and Diy\u00e1r Bakr, or Mesopotamia, and over Sud\u00e1n, the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, Sayh\u00fan and Jayh\u00fan,[FN#142] Nile and Euphrates. He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler of the Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan,[FN#143] who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself. This Prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old, and Allah subjected His servants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess in battle. Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legally married, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save Sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. For he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year;[FN#144] and on this wise he abode for a length of time. Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. Presently, by decree of the Decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim, the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, \"Haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!\" Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. But when the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, \"Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:\" so quoth he to himself, \"If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:\" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. Such was the case with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by name Sofiyah or Sophia,[FN#145] whom the King of Roum and Lord of C\u00e6sarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, \"O King! I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing\"[FN#146]\u2014a speech which much pleased the King. During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool.[FN#147] Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. In due time Sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. So they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carried the news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. But, after the two had departed, quoth Sophia to the midwives, \"Wait with me awhile, for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb.\" Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy.[FN#148] The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al-Mak\u00e1n and his sister Nuzhat al-Zam\u00e1n.[FN#149] They answered \"Hearing and obedience,\" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. Moreover the people of Baghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of his son, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. After this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. And when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. One day, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, \"O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord of Constantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest.\" He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. They kissed the ground before him and said, \"O King glorious and strong! O lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afr\u00edd\u00fan,[FN#150] Lord of Ionia land[FN#151] and of the Nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander,[FN#152] whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail.[FN#153] When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of the Arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King, Afridun. The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. When our King heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,\u2014whereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth[FN#154] against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia[FN#155] in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway. So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and of Khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance.\" Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. When the King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his Wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. Herewith rose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan[FN#156] highs, who kissed the ground before Omar and said, \"O King, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. Moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money.\" The King pleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, \"Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle.\" Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do. Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-\u00e0-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, \"Ye have delay of three days.\" They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. When the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city;[FN#157] and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money.[FN#158] Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, \"I hear and I obey;\" and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. After this, the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. So the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady.[FN#159] As for Sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country. So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets[FN#160] which was dense with growth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, Eastern and Western. He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" But as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, \"Now by the crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle[FN#161]!\" He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,\n\n\"Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    course through plain and wood:\nNo work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    gifts, Giver of all good!\"\nAnd as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon.[FN#162] Through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,\n\n\"The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    debonnair:\nDouble its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   fair:\nVirgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ensnare;\nAnd like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    their hair:\nShooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  compare;\nOverpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire.\"\n\nSharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and temple locks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essence and attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,\n\n\"She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * And her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    straight slender stature enshamed the lance:\nShe burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * Where all manner of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    beauties have habitance:\nAnd the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * Whence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    issues a dawn tide of happiest chance.\"\n\nThen Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, \"Come ye on, that I may wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and the dawn break!\" So each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and the beldam said as in wrath, \"O strumpet, cost thou glory in grounding these girls? Behold I am an old woman, yet have I thrown them forty times! So what hast thou to boast of? But if thou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels!\" The young lady smiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, and she jumped up and asked, \"O my lady Zat al-Dawahi,[FN#163] by the truth of the Messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, or dost thou jest with me?\"; and she answered, \"Yea,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-seventh Night,\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the young lady asked Zat al-Dawahi, \"By the truth of the Messiah, wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?\", and she answered, \"Yea, I will wrestle with thee in very deed\" (Sharrkan looking on the while), the damsel cried, \"Rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do.\" When the old woman heard this, she raged with exceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog.[FN#164] Then she sprang to her feet, whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, \"Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked, Mistress whore!\"[FN#165] So she loosed her petticoat trousers and, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body; then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or a spotted snake. With this she inclined towards the damsel and said, \"Do thou as I have done.\" All this time, Sharrkan was gazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance. So the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash of Yamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples, as it were a bed of Nu'uman's anemones; and breasts like double pomegranates. Then the old woman leant towards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while Sharrkan raised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle might beat the beldam. Presently the young woman get beneath the old woman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground with both; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in so doing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine; furthermore she let fly two great farts[FN#166] one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of Heaven. Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground. Then he arose and, baring his brand looked right and left, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back, and said to himself, \"He lied not who named thee Lady of Calamities! Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others.\" So he drew near them to hear what should pass between them. Then the young lady went up to the old one and, throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying, \"O my lady Zat al- Dawahi, I intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thou triedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to Allah for safety!\" She returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned, with the fair damsel standing amongst them. Quoth Sharrkan to himself, \"Every luck hath its cause. Sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me.\" So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled[FN#167] him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandished shouting the while his war cry, \"Allah is All mighty[FN#168]!\" When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firm stand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, the normal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the farther side,[FN#169] where she turned and cried out with a loud voice, \"Who art thou, O thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? Whence camest thou and whither art thou going? Speak sooth, for truth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies come of villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, did we shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue four thousand knights.[FN#170] So tell me what thou wantest; and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will do so.\" When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, \"I am a stranger of the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them.\" Quoth she, \"I would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, by Allah, they shall never be thy spoil. Have I not told thee that to lie is villein vile?\" Quoth he, \"The wise man is he who taketh warning by others.\" Thereupon quoth she, \"By the truth of the Messiah, did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands, I would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might, but I take pity upon the stranger. So, if thou seek booty, I require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, I and thou. If thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty; but if I throw thee, thou shalt become under my command. Swear this to me, for I fear thy treachery: indeed it hath become a common saw, 'Where Perfidy is innate there Trust is a weakly mate.' Now an thou wilt swear I will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee.\" Answered Sharrkan (and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul, \"Truly she knoweth not that I am a champion of champions\"); \"Swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and I will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest, 'Draw near that I wrestle with thee.' If thou throw me, I have money where withal to ransom myself; and if I throw thee, 'twill be booty and booty enough for me!\" Rejoined the damsel, \"I am content herewith!\" and Sharrkan was astounded at her words and said, \"And by the truth of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and keep!) I too am content on the other part!\" Then said she, \"Swear to me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of Al- Islam.\" Sharrkan replied, \"By Allah! were a Kazi to swear me, even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis,[FN#171] he would not impose upon me such an oath as this!\" Then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in the sea of thought, saying in himself, \"Praise be to Him who fashioned her from dirty water!\"[FN#172] Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling, and said to her, \"Cross the stream to me;\" but she replied, \"It is not for me to come over to thee: if thou wilt, pass thou over here to me.\" \"I cannot do that,\" quoth he, and quoth she, \"O boy, I will come across to thee.\" So she tucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side of the stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms.[FN#173] But he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the Hand of Power had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann, which had been fostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. Then she called out to him, \"O Moslem, come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning,\" and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with its whiteness; and Sharrkan was dazzled by it. Then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like, and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms. Presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the roaring gale. So she lifted him up and, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lost mastery over his senses. Then she asked him, \"O Moslem! the slaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself?\"; and he answered, \"O my lady, thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; for our prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) prohibited the slaying of women and children, old men and monks!\" \"As it was thus revealed to your Prophet,\" she replied, \"it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy; so rise. I give thee thy life, for generosity is never lost upon the generous.\" Then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; and she said to him, \"Be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth the land of Roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist Kings against Kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?\" \"'Twas not for lack of strength in me,\" he answered; \"nor didst thou throw me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so if thou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy.\" She laughed and said, \"I grant thee thy request: but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, and it were only right I should loose them, for haply this next wrestling bout will be long.\" Then she went to the slave girls and, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of Greece, \"Get ye to some safe place, till I foil this Moslem's lust and longing for you.\" So they went away, whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two. Then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when he felt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxing ware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground. He fell on his back,[FN#174] and then she said to him, \"Rise: I give thee thy life a second time. I spared thee in the first count because of thy Prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women; and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but I charge thee, if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al-Nu'uman to succour the King of Constantinople, a stronger than thou, send him hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shifts and trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thigh Lite,[FN#175] the jostle and the leg-lock.\" \"By Allah, O my lady,\" quoth Sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed against her), \"had I been Master al-Safd\u00ed, Master Mohammed Kim\u00e1l or Ibn al-Sadd\u00ed,[FN#176] as they were in their prime, I had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest; for O my mistress, by Allah, thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by the blandishments of thy back parts; for we men of Mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight. But now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me, and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three: moreover I have regained my presence of mind.\" When she heard his words she said to him, \"Hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling, O vanquished one? However come on, an thou wilt; but know that this must be the last round.\" Then she bent forward and challenged him and Sharrkan did likewise, setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw: so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him, \"O Moslem, thou art now on thy mettle.\" \"Yes,\" he replied, \"thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round, after which each of us will wend a different way.\" She laughed and he laughed too;[FN#177] then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares, which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back. She laughed at him and said, \"Art thou an eater of bran? Thou are like a Badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the Father of Winds[FN#178] that droppeth before a puff of air. Fie upon thee, O thou poor thing!\" adding, \"Get thee back to the Moslem army and send us other than thyself, for thou fairest of thews; and proclaim for us, among the Arabs and Persians, the Turks and Daylamites,[FN#179] whoso hath might in him, let him come to us.\" Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to Sharrkan, laughing, \"Parting with thee is right grievous to me, O my lord; but get thee to thy mates before dawn, lest the Knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points. Thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman, so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and Knights?\" Sharrkan was confounded and called to her (as she turned from him making towards the convent), \"O my lady, wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger, the broken hearted slave of love?\" So she turned to him laughing and said, \"What is thy want? I will grant thee thy prayer.\" \"Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy,\" replied he, \"and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality; I who have become one of thy servitors!\" \"None baulk kindliness save the base,\" she rejoined, \"honour us in Allah's name, on my head and eyes be it! Mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me, for now thou art my guest.\" At this Sharrkan was glad and, hastening back to his horse, mounted and walked him abreast of her, and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge[FN#180] built of beams of the white poplar, hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks. When Sharrkan looked, he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts; and, as she came up to them, she said to one in the Greek tongue, \"Arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent.\" So she went up to Sharrkan and led him over, much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw, and saying to himself, \"O would that the Wazir Dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours.\" Then he turned to the young lady and said to her, \"O marvel of loveliness, now I have two claims upon thee; first the claim of good fellowship, and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality. I am now under thy commandance and thy guidance; so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of Al-Islam; where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who I am.\" When she heard this she was angered and said to him, \"By the truth of the Messiah, thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit; but now I see what mischief there is in thy heart, and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent. How should I do as thou sayest, when I wot that if I came to that King of yours, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, I should never get free from him? For truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls, Lord of Baghdad and of Khorasan though he be, who hath built for himself twelve pavilions, in number as the months of the year, and in each a concubine after the number of the days; and if I come to him he would not prove shy of me, for your folk believe I am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ, 'Or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves.'[FN#181] So how canst thou speak thus to me? As for thy saying, 'Thou shalt look upon the braves of the Moslems,' by the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest that which is not true, for I saw your army when it reached our land, these two days ago; and I did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of Kings, but I beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together. And as to thy words, 'Thou shalt know who I am,' I did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself; and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me, even wert thou Sharrkan, Omar bin al- Nu'uman's son, the prowess name in these days!\" \"Knowest thou Sharrkan?\" asked he; and she answered Yes! and I know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen; also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the King of Constantinople.\" \"O my lady,\" said Sharrkan, \"I adjure thee by thy religion, tell me the cause of all this, that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth, and with whom the fault lies.\" \"Now by the virtue of thy faith,\" she replied, \"did I not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that I am of the daughters of Roum, I would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader, the Wazir Dandan and vanquish their champion Sharrkan.[FN#182] Nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby, for I have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the Arabs. But I have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee, more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling; and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women. Nor, indeed, had Sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him, 'Clear this stream,' could he have done it; and I only long and lust that the Messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent, that I might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes.\"- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Nazarene damsel said to Sharrkan (and he listening impatiently enow), \"Verily if Sharrkan fell into my hands, I would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes,\" pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load; but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating,\n\n\"An faulty of one fault the Beauty prove, * Her charms a thousand advocates shall move.\"\n\nSo she went up and Sharrkan after her; and, when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other, like rollers in the rolling sea, he extemporised these couplets:- -\n\n\"For her sins is a pleader that brow, * And all hearts its fair\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pleading must bow:\nWhen I saw it I cried, \"To night * The moon at its fullest doth\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    show;\nTho' Balkis' own Ifrit[FN#183] try a bout, * Spite his force she\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    would deal him a throw.\"\n\nThe two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway. This she opened and ushered Sharrkan into a long vestibule, vaulted with ten connected arches, from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire. The handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume, and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems,[FN#184] and went on before her (Sharrkan still following), till they reached the inner convent. There the Moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around, one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold. The monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work, and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold, whence the water ran like molten silver; whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for Kings. Then said the damsel, \"Ascend, O my lord, this throne.\" So he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time. Sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him, \"She hath gone to her dormitory; but we will serve thee even as she ordered.\" So they set before him viands of rare varieties, and he ate his sufficiency, when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver, and he washed his hands. Then his thoughts reverted to his army, knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions: so he was troubled about his case, repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared; when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated,\n\n\"I am not lost to prudence, but indeed * Here I'm bewildered,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    what shall be my rede?\nWould any aid me in mine ails of love, * By my own might and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sleight would I be free'd:\nBut ah! my heart is lost and passion-shent: * To none save Allah\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  can I trust my need!\"\nWhen he ended his verse behold, there came up to him a rare show and a fair, more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady, who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her. She was clad in brocades befitting Kings; her breasts were like twin pomegranates, a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips; and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal[FN#185] supporting a silvern shaft. When Sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight; and he forgot army and Wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems. Handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train, as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead. He sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness, and cried aloud, \"Beware and beware of that zone rarely fair!\" and broke out into these couplets,\n\n\"With heavy back parts, high breasts delicate, * And lissome form\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   that sways with swimming gait\nShe deftly hides love longing in her breast; * But I may never\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   hide its ban and bate\nWhile hosts of followers her steps precede,[FN#186] * Like pearls\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    now necklaced and now separate.\"\n\nShe gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him, when she came up to him and said, \"In very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee, O Sharrkan! How sped thy night, O hero, after we went away and left thee?\"; adding, \"Verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful, especially in great Kings! and thou art Crown Prince Sharrkan, son and heir of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition, nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth; for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite. And as thou art pierced by the shaft of Fate, be resignation thine and abide content to wait.\" When he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth, saying, \"I am Sharrkan, bin Omar bin al-Nu'uman, whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place; so whatso thou willest, do it in my case!\" She hung her head groundwards a long while, then turned to him and said, \"Be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear;[FN#187] for thou art the guest of my hospitality, and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee; wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard. Have no fear for, by the truth of the Messiah, if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee, till life had left my body for thy sake: indeed thou art now under the charge of the Messiah and of me.\" Hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him, till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him, she would have done so during the past night. Presently she bespoke in the Grecian tongue one of her slave girls, who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food; but Sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself, \"Haply she hath put somewhat in this meat.\" She knew what was in his thought; so she turned to him and said, \"By the truth of the Messiah, the case is not on such wise, nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest! Had my mind been set on slaying thee, I had slain thee ere now.\" Then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful; where upon Sharrkan came forward and ate too. She was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied. They washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour, wines of all colours and kinds and a wine-service with vessels of gold, silver and crystal. She filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him, even as she had done with the food: then she crowned a second and handed it to him. He drank and she said to him, \"O Moslem, see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life!\" And she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink, till he took leave of his wits,- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Forty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply Sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits, for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her. Presently she said to the slave girl, \"O Marjanah[FN#188]! bring us some instruments of music!\" \"To hear is to obey,\" said the hand maid and going out, returned in the twinkling of an eye with a Damascus lute,[FN#189] a Persian harp, a Tartar pipe, and an Egyptian dulcimer. The young lady took the lute and, after tuning each several string, began in gentle undersong to sing, softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than Tasmin[FN#190] spring, with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following,\n\n\"Allah assain those eyne! What streams of blood they shed! * How\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped.\nI love all lovers who to lovers show them cure; * 'Twere wrong to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   rue the love in wrong head born and bred:\nHaply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens! * Heaven help\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  the hapless heart by force of thee misled!\nThou doomest me to death who art my king, and I * Ransom with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  life the deemster who would doom me dead.\"\n\nThereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument, played and recited couplets in the Roumi tongue; then their mistress sang also and seeing Sharrkan in ecstasies asked him, \"O Moslem, dost thou understand what I say?\"; and he answered, \"Nay, my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips.\" She laughed and continued, \"If I sing to thee in Arabic what wouldst thou do?\" \"I should no longer,\" quoth he, \"be master of my senses.\" Then she took an instrument and, changing the measure, began singing these verses,\n\n\"The smack of parting's myrrh to me, * How, then, bear patience'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    alo\u00eb?\nI'm girt by ills in trinity * Severance, distance,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     cruelty!\nMy freedom stole that fairest she, * And parting irks me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bitterly.\"\n\nWhen she ended her verse, she looked at Sharrkan and found him lost to existence, and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens.[FN#191] Then he revived and, remembering the songs, again inclined to mirth and merriment; and the twain returned to their wine and wassail, and continued their playing and toying, their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing. Then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when Sharrkan asked after her they answered, \"She is gone to her sleeping chamber,\" whereto he rejoined, \"Under Allah's ward and His good guard!\" As soon as it was morning, a handmaid came to him and said to him, \"My mistress biddeth thee to her.\" So he rose and followed her and, as he drew near her lodging, the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting, and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels. Thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall, at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks, and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams. About the saloon were figures carved in human form, and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within, so that the beholder would fancy they spoke.[FN#192] Here sat the young lady, looking at the figures; but when she saw Sharrkan, she sprang to her feet and, taking him by the hand, made him sit down by her side, and asked him how he had passed the night. He blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him, \"Knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love?\"; and he answered \"Yes! I wot somewhat in verse on that matter.\" \"Let me hear it,\" quoth she, so he began quoting,\n\n\"Pleasure and health, good cheer, good appetite * To Azzah,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   freest with our name and fame!\nBy Allah! would I near her off she flies * At tangent, granting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   less the more I claim:\nI dote on Azzah, but when clear I off * My rivals, clears me too\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   that dearest dame;\nLike wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud * Which, ere\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    siesta done, thin air became.\"\n\nWhen she heard this she said, \"Verily Al-Kuthayyir[FN#193] was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste, and he was superlative in his praise of Azzah when he sang\" (and she began to recite),\n\n\"Did Azzah deal behest to Sun o' noon, * The judge had judged her\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     beauty's bestest boon;\nAnd girls who come to me and carp at her, * God make their rosy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   cheeks her sandal-shoon!\n\nAnd indeed,\" quoth she, \"'twas said that Azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness.\" Then she asked Sharrkan saying, \"O Prince, cost thou know aught of Jamil's[FN#194] verses to Buthaynah? if so repeat to us somewhat of them;\" and he answered, \"Yes, I know them better than any;\" whereupon he began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Jamil, in Holy war go fight!\" to me they say: * What war save\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    fight for fair ones would I e'er essay?\nTo me their every word and work are mere delight, * And martyrs\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   crepe I all they slay in fight and fray:\nAn ask I, 'O Buthaynah! what's this love, I pray, * Which eats\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    my heart?' quoth she ' 'Twill stay for ever and aye!'\nAnd when I cry, 'Of wits return some small display * For daily\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    use,' quoth she, 'Far, far 'tis fled away!\nThou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy * While I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     no goal espy save thee and thee alway.'\"\n\n\"Thou hast spoken right well,\" said she, \"O King's son, and Jamil also spoke excellently well. But what would Buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich,\n\n'Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy?'\"\n\n\"O my lady,\" quoth Sharrkan, \"she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me, and even that will not satisfy thee.\" She laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till Day put out her light and Night came in darkness dight. Then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept, while Sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned. As soon as he awoke, the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment, as wont; and, kissing the ground between his hands, said to him, \"Bismillah! in Allah's name be so kind as to come[FN#195]: our mistress biddeth thee to her presence!\" So he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him, playing on tabrets and other instruments of music, till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall, decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts, passing all description. Sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting,\n\n\"He plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry, * And her breast-\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   pearls that bedded in gold mine lie.\nPure water on silvern bars is her brow, * And her cheeks show\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     roses with rubies vie:\nMeseems in her eyne that the violet's hue * Lies purpling set in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the Ithmid's[FN#196] dye.\"\nWhen the lady saw Sharrkan, she stood up to him in honour and,\ntaking his hand, seated him by her side and asked, \"O son of King\nOmar bin al-Nu'uman, hast thou any cunning in the game of chess?\"\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"but do not thou with me as said the poet,\n'I speak and longing love upties me and unties me; * Till with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     her honey dew of inner lip she plies me:\nI brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me * With\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    white and black,[FN#197] but black cum white ne'er satisfies\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     me:\n'Twas as if King for Castle I were fain to place me * Till wilful\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me:\nAnd if I seek to read intent in eyes that eye me * Oh man! that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     glance askance with hint of wish defies me.'\"\n\nThen she brought the chessboard and played with him; but Sharrkan, instead of looking at her moves, kept gazing at her fair mouth, and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant[FN#198] instead of knight. She laughed and said to him, \"If thy play be after this fashion, thou knowest naught of the game.\" \"This is only our first,\" replied he, \"judge not by this bout.\" When she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her; but she beat him a second time, a third, a fourth and a fifth. So she turned to him and said, \"Thou art beaten in everything;\" and he replied, \"O my lady, how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten?\" Then she bade bring food, and they ate and washed their hands; after which the wine was set before them and they drank. Presently, she took the dulcimer, for her hand was cunning in smiting it, and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets,\n\n\"Twixt the close tied and open wide no medium Fortune knoweth, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     showeth.\nThen drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     find her * Anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     forth goeth.\"\n\nThey ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first. When darkness set in, the lady betook her to her dormitory, leaving him alone with the hand maids; so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn, when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom. Seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up; and they carried him to their mistress, who came to meet him and, taking him by the hand, seated him by her side. Then she asked him how he had passed his night, whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged; and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised,\n\n\"Ne'er incline thee to part * Which embitters the heart\nE'en the sun when he sets * Shall in pallor depart.\"\n\nWhile they were solacing themselves after this fashion, behold, there arose a great and sudden clamour, and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in, holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands, and cried aloud in the Grecian tongue \"Thou hast fallen into our hands, O Sharrkan, so make thee sure of death!\" When he heard this, he said to himself, \"By Allah, she hath entrapped me and held me in play, till her men should come. These are the Knights with whom she threatened me; but 'tis I who have thrown myself into this strait.\" Then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her, but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale; and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd, \"Who are ye?\" \"O most gracious Princess and peerless onion pearl,\" answered the leading Knight, \"dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side?\" \"Not I,\" she replied, \"who may he be?\" Quoth the Patrician, \"This is of towns the highwayman! This is he who rideth in the horseman's van! This is Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman! This is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place! The news of him reached King Hardub, thy father, by report of the ancient dame Zat al- Dawahi; and thy sire, our sovereign, hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the Greeks by taking captive this ominous lion.\" When she heard this, she looked at the Knight and asked him, \"What be thy name?\" and he answered, \"I am M\u00e1s\u00farah, son of thy slave Maus\u00farah bin K\u00e1shardah, Knight of Knights.\" \"And how?\" quoth she, \"durst thou enter my presence without leave?\" Quoth he, \"O my lady, when I came to the gate, none forbade me, neither chamberlain nor porter, but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont; although, when others come, they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them. But this is not a time for long talking, when the King is expecting our return with this Prince, the scorpion sting[FN#199] of the Islamitic host, that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came, without the bane of battling with them.\" \"These words be ill words,\" rejoined the Princess, \"and Dame Zat al-Dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and I made him my guest. So even were we assured that this be Sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt, I say it would ill befit mine honour that I should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection. So make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men; but return to the King, my father, and kiss the ground before him, and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the Lady Zat al-Dawahi.\" \"O Abr\u00edzah,\" replied Masurah, the Knight, \"I cannot return to the King's majesty without his debtor and enemy.\" Quoth she (and indeed she had waxed very wroth). \"Out on thee! Return to him with my answer, and no blame shall befal thee!\" Quoth Masurah, \"I will not return without him.\" Thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed, \"Exceed not in talk and vain words; for verily this man had not come in to us, were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders; and if I said to him, 'Thou art Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,' he would answer, 'Yes.' But 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him; for if you do so, he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place. Behold, here he is by my side, and I will bring him before you sword and targe in hand.\" \"Albeit I were safe from thy wrath,\" answered Masurah the Knight, \"I am not safe from that of thy father, and when I see him, I shall sign to the Knights to take him captive, and we will carry him to the King bound and in abject sort.\" When she heard this, she said, \"The matter shall not pass thus, for 'twould be blazoning mere folly. This man is but one and ye are an hundred Knights: so if you would attack him come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant amongst you.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fiftieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the Knight, \"This man is but one, and ye are an hundred: so if ye would attack him, come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant.\" Quoth Masurah, the Knight, \"By the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest sooth, and none but I shall sally out against him first.\" Quoth she, \"Wait till I go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make. If he consent, 'tis well; but if he refuse, ye shall on no wise come to him, for I and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom.\" So she went to Sharrkan and told him the news, whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the Emirs; but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad, till the report reached the King, against her wish and intent. So he again began reproaching himself and said, \"How came I to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the Greeks?\" But hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her, \"Indeed their onset, one after one, would be overburdensome to them. Will they not come out against me, ten by ten?\" \"That would be villainy,\" said she; \"Let one have at one.\" When he heard this, he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear; and Masurah, the Knight, also sprang up and bore down upon him. Sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut[FN#200] which clove him to the middle, and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels. When the lady beheld that swashingblow, Sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness. So she turned to the Knights and said, \"Take wreak for your chief!\" Thereupon out came the slain man's brother, a fierce and furious Knight, and rushed upon Sharrkan, who delayed not, but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals. Then cried the Princess, \"O ye servants of the Messiah, avenge your comrade!\" So they ceased not charging down upon him, one after one; and Sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade, till he had slain fifty Knights, the lady looking on the while. And Allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors, so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello, but fell upon him in a body; and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock, and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled,[FN#201] till he had driven sense and soul out of them. Then the Princess called aloud to her damsels, saying, \"Who is left in the convent?\"; and they replied, \"None but the gate keepers;\" whereupon she went up to Sharrkan and took him to her bosom, he doing the same, and they returned to the palace, after he had made an end of the melee. Now there remained a few of the Knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery, and when the Princess saw this she rose from Sharrkan's side and left him for a while, but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine Indian scymitar. And she said, \"Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not be a niggard of myself for my guest; nor will I abandon him though for this I abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the Greeks.\" Then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the Knights, and other twenty had taken to flight.[FN#202] When she saw what work he had made with them she said to him, \"Allah bless thee, O Sharrkan! The Cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee.\" Then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets,\n\n\"How oft in the mellay I've cleft the array, * And given their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     bravest to lions a prey:\nAsk of me and of them when I proved me prow * O'er creation, on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     days of the foray and fray:\nWhen I left in the onslaught their lions to lie * On the sands of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     the low lands[FN#203] in fieriest day.\"\n\nWhen he ended his verse, the Princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand; then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her, \"O lady mine, wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand?\" \"To guard thee against these caitiffs,\"[FN#204] she replied. Then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them, \"How came ye to admit the King's Knights into my dwelling without leave of me?\"; and they answered, \"O Princess, it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the King's messengers, and especially for the chief of his Knights.\" Quoth she, \"I think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest;\" and bade Sharrkan smite their necks. He did so and she cried to the rest of her servants, \"Of a truth, they deserved even more than that!\" Then turning to Sharrkan, she said to him, \"Now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed, thou shalt be made acquainted with my history. Know, then, that I am the daughter of King Hardub of Roum; my name is Abrizah and the ancient dame, yclept Zat al-Dawahi, is my grandmother by the sword side. She it certainly is who told my father of thee, and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me, more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that I have separated myself from the Nazarenes and have become no better than I should be with the Moslems. Wherefore it were wiser that I leave this dwelling while Zat al-Dawahi is on my track; but I require of thee the like kindness and courtesy I have shown thee, for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account. So do not thou neglect to do aught that I shall say to thee, remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee.\" Hearing her words, Sharrkan joyed greatly; his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight, and he said, \"By Allah, none shall come at thee, while life is in my bosom! But hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people?\" \"Even so,\" she answered; and Sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth. Then said she, \"Now is my heart at ease; but there remaineth one other condition for thee.\" \"What is it?\" asked he and she answered, \"It is that thou return with thy host to thine own country.\" Quoth he, \"O lady mine, my father, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, sent me to wage war upon thy sire, on account of the treasure he plundered from the King of Constantinople, and amongst the rest three great jewels, noted givers of good fortune.\" Quoth she, \"Cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes: I will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the King of Constantinople. Know that we have a yearly festival, highs the Convent Feast, whereat Kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate; thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families, and the visitors abide there seven days. I was wont to be one of them; but, when there befel enmity between us, my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years. One year, it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron, as was their custom, came a daughter of the King of Constantinople, a beautiful girl called Sophia. They tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways;[FN#205] but Sophia said, 'I will not return to Constantinople save by water.' So they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite; and making sail they put out to sea; but as they were voyaging behold, a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till, as Fate and Fortune would have it, she fell in with a Nazarene craft from the Camphor Island[FN#206] carrying a crew of five hundred armed Franks, who had been cruising about a long time. When they sighted the sails of the ship, wherein Sophia and her women were, they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her, then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her. Then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and, splitting their sails, drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast. Thereupon we sallied forth and, looking on them as spoil driven to us by Fate,[FN#207] boarded and took them; and, slaying the men, made prize of the wreck, wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens, amongst whom was the King's daughter, Sophia. After the capture we carried the Princess and her women to my father, not knowing her to be a daughter of King Afridun of Constantinople; and he chose out for himself ten including her; and divided the rest among his dependents. Presently he set apart five damsels, amongst whom was the King s daughter, and sent them to thy father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, together with other gifts, such as broadcloth[FN#208] and woollen stuffs and Grecian silks. Thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls Sophia, daughter of King Afridun; nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year, when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat, rebuking him with menaces and saying to him: Two years ago, you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of Frankish pirates in which was my daughter, Sophia, attended by her maidens numbering some threescore. Yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise; nor could I make the matter public, lest reproach befal me amongst the Kings, by reason of my daughter's honour. So I concealed my case till this year, when I wrote to certain Frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the Kings of the Isles. They replied, 'By Allah we carried her not forth of thy realm; but we have heard that King Hardub rescued her from certain pirates. And they told me the whole tale.' Then he added in the writing which he writ to my father: 'Except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter, you will, the instant my letter reacheth you, send my daughter back to me. But if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment, I will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices.'[FN#209] When my father read this letter and understood the contents,[FN#210] it vexed him and he regretted not having known that Sophia, King Afridun's daughter, was among the captured damsels, that he might have sent her back to her sire; and he was perplexed about the case because, after so long a time, he could not send to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and demand her back from him, especially as he had lately heard that Heaven had granted him boon of babe by this Sophia. So when we pondered that truth, we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity; and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to King Afridun, making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to King Omar bin al Nu'uman, who had gotten the blessing of issue by her. When my father's reply reached King Afridun he rose up and sat down,[FN#211] and roared and foamed at the mouth crying:\u2014'What! shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to Kings, and they lie with her without marriage contract? By the Messiah and the true Faith,' said he, 'I will not desist till I have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame; and indeed I will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me!' So he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares, when he sent an embassy to thy father, King Omar, to tell him that which thou hast heard: accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to King Afridun, whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot. As for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid, there was not one soothfast word in that matter, for they were with Sophia, his daughter; and my father took them from her, when he got possession of her and of her maidens, and gave them to me in free gift, and they are now with me. So go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into, and shut in by, the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the Franks and the country of the Greeks; for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior, they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the Day of retribution and retaliation. I know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them, because thou didst order a three days' rest; withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do.\" When Sharrkan heard her words, he was absent awhile in thought; then he kissed Princess Abrizah's hand and said, \"Praise be to Allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me! But 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and I know not what will become of thee after my departure.\" \"Go now to thine army,\" she replied, \"and turn them back, while ye are yet near your own country. If the envoys be still with them, lay hands on them and keep them, that the case may be made manifest to you; and, after three days, I will be with you all and we will enter Baghdad together.\" As he turned to depart she said, \"Forget not the compact which is between me and thee,\" then she rose to bid[FN#212] him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire, so she took leave of him and, throwing her arms round his neck, wept with exceeding weeping, and repeated these verses,\n\n\"I bade adieu, my right hand wiped my tears away, * The while my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     left hand held her in a close embrace:\n'Fearest thou naught,' quoth she, 'of shame?' I answered 'Nay, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace.'\"\n\nThen Sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent. They brought his steed, so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow. As soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert, and he bared his brand and rode cautiously, but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold, it was the Wazir Dandan and two of his Emirs. When they saw him and knew him, they dismounted and saluting him, asked the reason of his absence; whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and Princess Abrizah from first to last. The Wazir returned thanks to Almighty Allah for his safety and said,[FN#213] \"Let us at once leave these lands; for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the King of our approach, and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners.\" So Sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount, which they did and, setting out at once, they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay. The Ambassadors meanwhile had reported Sharrkan's approach to their King, who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him. But Sharrkan, escorted by the Wazir Dandan and the two Emirs, had no sooner sighted the army, than he raised the cry \"March! March!\" They took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day, nor did they cease faring for five days; at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley, where they rested awhile. Then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country. Here, deeming themselves safe, they halted to rest; and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts. They tarried there two days after which, as all would be making for their homes, Sharrkan put the Wazir Dandan in command, bidding him lead the host back to Baghdad. But he himself remained behind with an hundred riders, till the rest of the army had made one day's march: then he called \"To horse!\" and mounted with his hundred men. They rode on two parasangs'[FN#214] space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo! there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust. So they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted, discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers, lion faced and in mail coats cased. As soon as they drew within earshot of Sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them, saying, \"By the virtue of John and Mary, we have won to our wish! We have been following you by forced marches, night and day, till we forewent you to this place. So dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves, that we may grant you your lives.\" When Sharrkan heard this, his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'How is it, O. Nazarene dogs, ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land? And doth not this suffice you, but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech? Do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country?\" Then he shouted to his hundred horsemen, \"Up and at these hounds, for they even you in number!\" So saying, he bared his sabre and bore down on them, he and his, but the Franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks, and wight dashed against wight, and knight dashed upon knight, and hot waxed the fight, and sore was the affright, and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight; and they stinted not to charge and to smite, right hand meeting right, nor to hack and hew with blades bright white, till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight. Then they drew apart and Sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only, who showed hurts but not death hurts. Said he to them, \"By Allah, my life long have I waded in the clashing sea of fight and I have met many a gallant sprite, but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant Knights!\" \"Know, O King,\" said they, that there is among them a Frankish cavalier who is their leader and, indeed, he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust: but, by Allah, he spares us great and small; for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him. By Allah, had he willed he had killed us all.\" Sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the Knight had done and such high report of him, so he said, \"When the morn shall morrow, we will draw out and defy them, for we are an hundred to their hundred; and we will seek aid against them from the Lord of the Heavens.\" So they rested that night in such intent; whilst the Franks gathered round their Captain and said, \"Verily this day we did not win our will of these;\" and he replied, \"At early dawn when the morrow shall morn, we will draw out and challenge them, one after one.\" They also rested in that mind, and both camps kept guard until Almighty Allah sent the light of day dawn. Thereupon King Sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain, where they found the Franks ranged in line of battle; and Sharrkan said to his followers, \"Our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir; so up and at them and lay on load.\" Then came forth an Herald of the Franks and cried out, saying, \"Let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day, save by the duello, a champion of yours against a champion of ours.\" Whereupon one of Sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying, \"Ho! who is for smiting? Let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling!\" Hardly had he made an end of his vaunt, when there sallied forth to him a Frankish cavalier, armed cap-\u00e0-pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff, riding on a grey white steed,[FN#215] and he had no hair on his cheeks. He urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust, but it was not long before the Frank foined the Moslem with the lance point; and, toppling him from his steed, took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen. His folk rejoiced in their comrade and, forbidding him to go out again to the field, sent forth another, to whom sallied out another Moslem, brother to the captive, and offered him battle. The two fell to, either against other, and fought for a little while, till the Frank bore down upon the Moslem and, falsing him with a feint, tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner. After this fashion the Moslems ceased not dashing forwards, one after one, and the Franks to unhorse them and take them captive, till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted. Now they had captured of the Moslems twenty cavaliers, and when Sharrken saw this, it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them, \"What is this thing that hath befallen us? To- morrow, I myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band. If he persist, we will punish him with death, and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him.\" They righted on this wise till Allah Almighty caused the morn to dawn, when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain; and Sharrkan was going forth to the plain, but behold, more than one half of the Franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted, till they reached the midst of the battle plain. Sharrken looked at that horseman and lo! he was their chief. He was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt; his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks. He hent in hand an Indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow, like a dirham; and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when, signing to the Moslems, he cried out in fluent Arab speech \"Ho, Sharrkan! Ho, son of Omar bin al- Nu'uman! Ho, thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries! up and out to battle bout, and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field! Thou art Prince of thy people and I am Prince of mine; and whoso overcometh his adversary, him let the other's men obey and come under his sway.\" Hardly had he ended his speech, when out came Sharrkan with a heart full of fury, and urging his steed into the midst of the field, closed like a raging lion with the Frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors. Then they fell to foining and hewing, and they stinted not of onset and offset, and give and take, as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing; nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened. Then they drew apart and each returned to his own party; but as soon as Sharrkan foregathered with his comrades, he said, \"Never looked I on the like of this cavalier: he hath one quality I have not yet seen in any and this it is that, when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow, he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance-heel! In very deed I know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me; but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men.\" Then he went to his rest for the night and, when morning dawned, the Frank came forth and rode down to the mid field, where Sharrkan met him; and they fell to fighting and to wheeling, left and right; and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might, till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light. Then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp, where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello; and at last the Frank said to his men, \"Tomorrow shall decide the matter!\" So they both passed that night restfully till dawn; and, as soon as it was day, they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done. Then the Frank bethought him of a ruse; first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein, so that he stumbled and fell with his rider; thereupon Sharrkan threw himself on the foe, and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged, when the Frank cried out to him, \"O Sharrkan, champions are not wont to do thus! This is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman.\"[FN#216] When Sharrkan heard this, he raised his eyes to the Frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him, recognized in him Princess Abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent; whereupon he cast brand from hand and, kissing the earth before her, asked her, \"What moved thee to a deed like this?\"; and she answered, \"I desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting. These that are with me are my handmaids, and they are all clean maids; yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain; and had not my steed stumbled with me, thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat.\" Sharrkan smiled at her speech and said, \"Praise be to Allah for safety and for my reunion with thee, O Queen of the age!\" Then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of Sharrkan's troop and dismount. They did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and Sharrkan who said to them, \"It is the like of you that Kings keep in store for the need hour.\" Then he signed to his comrades to salute the Princess; so all alighted and kissed the earth before her, for they knew the story. After this, the whole two hundred took horse, and fared on night and day for six days' space, till they drew near to Baghdad, when they halted and Sharrkan bade Abrizah and her handmaids doff the Frankish garb that was on them,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan bade Princess Abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of Greece; and thus did they. Then he despatched a company of his companions to Baghdad to acquaint his father Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by Princess Abrizah, daughter of King Hardub, Lord of Graecia-land. They halted forthright in the place they had reached, and Sharrkan also halted and all righted there; and when Almighty Allah made morning dawn, Sharrkan and his company and Abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city; when lo! on the way they met the Wazir Dandan, who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour Abrizah and Sharrkan, by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al- Nu'uman. When the two drew near, they turned towards them and kissed ground before them; then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace. Sharrkan walked in to his father, who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case. So he told him all that Abrizah had told him, and what had passed between them and said, \"She hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us; and indeed,\" he said to his father, \"the King of Constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief, because of his daughter Sophia, for that the King of Greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee; and he (the Grecian King) not knowing her to be daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople; and, had he known that, he would not have bestowed her upon thee, but he would have restored her to her parent. And of a verity,\" he continued, \"we were saved from these perils only by the Lady Abrizah, and never saw we a more valiant than she.\" And he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting. When King Omar heard the story of Sharrkan, Abrizah was exalted in his eyes, and he longed to see her and question her. Thereupon Sharrkan went out to her and said, \"The King calleth for thee;\" she replied, \"I hear and I obey;\" and he took her and brought her in to his father, who was seated on his throne and who, having dismissed his high officers, was attended only by his eunuchs. The Princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands, saluted him in choice terms. He was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son Sharrkan and bade her be seated. So she sat down and unveiled her face;[FN#217] and, when the King saw her beauty, his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour, appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels, and assigning them solde and allowances. Then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid, and she answered, \"Here be they with me, O King of the age!\" So saying, she rose and going to her lodging, unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold. She opened the casket and taking out those three jewels, kissed them and gave them to the King. Then she went away bearing his heart with her. After her going the King sent for his son Sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three, and when he enquired of the other two replied, \"O my son! I mean to give one to thy brother Zau al-Makan, and the other to thy sister Nuzhat al- Zaman.\" But when Sharrkan heard that he had a brother (for to that time he knew only of his sister) he turned to his sire and said to him, \"O King, hast thou a son other than myself?\" He answered, \"Yes, and he is now six years old;\" adding that his name was Zau al- Makan and that he and Nuzhat al-Zaman were twins, born at a birth. This news was grievous to Sharrkan, but he kept his secret and said, \"The bless- ing of Allah Most High be upon them!\", and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes. Quoth the King, \"How do I see thee change thy manner when hearing of this, considering that after me thou becomes\" heir of the kingdom. Of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the Emirs and Grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee; and this one of the three jewels is thine.\" Sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away, knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath, and stayed not walking till he had entered Abrizah's palace. As he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire. Then she sat down and seated him by her side; but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him, whereupon he told her that Allah had blessed his father with two children by Sophia, a boy and a girl, and that he had named the boy Zau al-Makan and the girl Nuzhat al-Zaman; adding, \"He hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine, so I left it behind; I knew naught of Zau al-Makan's birth till this day, and the twain are now six years old. So when I learnt this, wrath possessed me; and I tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee. But now I fear lest my father take thee to wife, for he loveth thee and I saw in him signs of desire for thee: so what wilt thou say, if he wish this?\" Quoth she, \"Know, O Sharrkan, that thy father hath no dominion over me, nor can he have me without my consent; and if he prevail over me by force, I will take my own life. As for the three jewels, it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and I had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price; but now I desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee, if thou have accepted it.\" \"Hearkening and obedience,\" replied Sharrkan, and gave it to her. Then said she, \"Fear nothing,\" and talked with him awhile and continued, \"I fear lest my father hear that I am with you and sit not patiently under my loss, but do his endeavours to find me; and to that end he may ally himself with King Afridun, on account of his daughter Sophia, and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil.\" When Sharrken heard these words, he said to her, \"O my lady, if it please thee to sojourn with us, take no thought of them; though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea.\" \" 'Tis well,\" rejoined she; \"if ye entreat me fair, I will tarry with you, and if ye deal evilly by me, I will depart from you.\" Then she bade her slave maidens bring food; so they set the tables, and Sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house, disturbed and perturbed. Such was his case; but regarding the affairs of his father, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, after dismissing his son Sharrkan he arose and, taking the other two jewels, betook himself to the Lady Sophia, who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated. Presently, his two children, Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman, came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck, at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands. Then went they to their mother, who joyed in their joy and wished the King long life; so he asked her, \"Why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, that I might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank?\" \"O King,\" answered Sophia, \"and what could I desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee, overwhelmed as I am with thy favours and thy benefits? And, furthermore, Allah hath blessed me with two children by thee, a son and a daughter.\" Her reply pleased the King and after leaving her, he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace. Moreover, he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service; and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment. And presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his Court where he distributed justice among the lieges. So far concerning him and Sophia and her children; but in the matter of Abrizah the King was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day; and every night, he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her, but she gave him no answer, only saying, \"O King of the age! I have no desire for men at this present.\" When he saw her withdraw from him, his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until, when weary of this, he summoned his Wazir Dandan and, opening his very heart to him, told him of his love for Princess Abrizah, daughter of Hardub, and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die, for that he could get no grace of her. The Wazir, hearing these words, said to the King, \"As soon as it is dark night, take thou a piece of Bhang the measure of a miskal, about an ounce, and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her. When the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near, fill her a last cup and dropping therein the Bhang, give it to her to drink, and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her. Then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her; and such is my advice.\"[FN#218] \"Thy rede is aright,\" quoth the King, and seeking his treasury, he took thence a piece of concentrated Bhang, if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year. This he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by, when he betook himself to the palace of Princess Abrizah, who seeing him stood up to receive him; but he bade her sit down. So she sat down, and he sat by her, and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail, whereupon she furnished the carousing table[FN#219] and placed it before him. Then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking. So they fell to tippling and the King ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head; and seeing this he took out the bit of Bhang from his pocket and, holding it between his fingers, filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off. Then filling a second he said, \"To thy companionship!\"; and dropped the drug into her cup, she knowing naught of it. She took it and drank it off; then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber. He waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses, when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back: and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs. When the King saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet, shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and Satan seduced him and he could not master himself, but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head. Then he rose off her and went to one of her women, by name Marj\u00e1nah, and said, \"Go in to thy lady and speak with her.\" So she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible, with the blood running down to the calves of her legs, whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night. As soon as Almighty Allah brought the dawn, the handmaid Marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it, where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of Bhang like a bolus.[FN#220] Then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to Marjanah, \"Tell me what hath befallen me.\" So she told her what had passed and how she had found her, lying on her back, with the blood running down, wherefore she knew that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her. At this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy, saying to her damsels, \"Deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that I am ill, till I see what Allah will do with me.\" Presently the news of her sickness came to the King; so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries. Some months she thus passed in solitude, during which time the King's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched, so that he abstained from her. Now she had conceived by him, and when the months of child breeding had gone by, her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled, and the world was straitened upon her, so she said to her handmaid Marjanah, \"Know that it is not the folk who have wronged me, but I who sinned against my own self[FN#221] in that I left my father and mother and country. Indeed, I abhor life, for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me. I used, when I mounted my steed, to have the mastery of him, but now I am unable to ride. If I be brought to bed among them I shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame; and if I return to my father, with what face shall I meet him or with what face shall I have recourse to him? How well quoth the poet,\n\n'Say, what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor cup companion, nor a cup, nor place to house his head?'\"\n\nMarjanah answered her, \"It is thine to command; I will obey;\" and Abrizah said, \"I desire at once to leave this place secretly, so that none shall know of me but thou; and return to my father and my mother, for when flesh stinketh, there is naught for it but its own folk and Allah shall do with me e'en as He will.\" \"O Princess,\" Marjanah replied, \"what thou wouldest do is well.\" Then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the King went out to chase and hunt, and his son Sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile. Then said she to Marjanah, \"I wish to set out this night, but how shall I do against my destiny? For already I feel the pangs of labour and child birth, and if I abide other four or five days, I shall be brought to bed here, and I shall be unable to travel to my country. But this is what was written on my forehead.\" Then she considered awhile, and said to Marjanah, \"Look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way, for I have no strength to bear arms.\" \"By Allah, O my lady,\" replied Marjanah, \"I know none but a black slave called Al- Ghazb\u00e1n,[FN#222] who is one of the slaves of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman; he is a valiant wight, and he keepeth guard at our palace gate. The King appointed him to attend us, and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours; so, lookye, I will go out and speak with him of this matter, and promise him some monies and tell him that, if he have a mind to tarry with us, I will marry him to whom he will. He told me before to day that he had been a highwayman; so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land.\" She rejoined, \"Call him that I may talk with him;\" whereupon Marjanah fared forth and said to the slave, 'O Ghazban, Allah prosper thee, so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee!\" Then she took him by the hand and brought him to the Princess, whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him, her heart took fright at him. \"How ever,\" she said to herself, \"of a truth, Need giveth the law;\" and she approached to speak with him, yet her heart started away from him. Presently she said, \"O Ghazban, say me, wilt thou help me against the perfidies of Fortune and conceal my secret if I discover it to thee?\" When the slave saw her, his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply; \"O my mistress, whatsoever thou biddest me do, I will not depart therefrom.\" Quoth she, \"I would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the King's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt, and go with us to our own country; where, if thou desire to abide with us, I will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens, or, if thou prefer return to thine own land, we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires\" after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee.\" When Al Ghazban, heard this, he rejoiced with great joy and replied, \"O my lady, I will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses.\" Then he went away gladsome and saying to himself, \"I shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me, I will kill them both and take their riches.\" But he kept this his intent to himself, and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses, one of which he rode, and Princess Abrizah made Marjanah mount the second she mounting the third, albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish. And the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains, till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country; when the travail pangs came upon Abrizah and she could no longer resist; so she said to Al-Ghazban, \"Set me down, for the pains of labour are upon me;\" and cried to Marjanah, \"Do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me.\" Then Marjanah dismounted from her horse, and Al-Ghazban did in like sort, and they made fast the bridles and helped the Princess to dismount, for she was aswoon from excess of anguish. When Al-Ghazban saw her on the ground, Satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face, said \"O my lady, vouchsafe me thy favours.\" Hearing these words she turned to him and said, \"It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the black slave Al Ghazban, \"It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!\" And she was wroth with him and cried, \"Woe to thee! what words are these thou sayest? Out on thee, and talk not thus in my presence and know that I will never consent to what thou sayest, though I drink the cup of death. Wait till I have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth, and then, if thou be able thereto, do with me as thou wilt; but, an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly I will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this.\" And she began reciting extempore,[FN#223]\n\n\"O spare me, thou Ghazban, indeed enow for me * Are heavy strokes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    of time, mischance and misery!\nWhoredom my Lord forfends to all humanity; * Quoth He, 'Who\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   breaks my bidding Hell for home shall see!'\nAnd if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way * Against th'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Almighty's choicest gift, my chastity,\nUpon my tribesmen I with might and main will call * And gather\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  all, however far or near they be;\nAnd with Yam\u00e1ni blade were I in pieces hewn, * Ne'er shall he\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sight my face who makes for villeiny,\nThe face of free born come of noble folk and brave; * What then\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    can be to me the seed of whoreson slave?\"\n\nWhen Ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly; his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey[FN#224]; his nostrils swelled, his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled. And he repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Ho thou, Abrizah, mercy! leave me not for I * Of thy love and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yam\u00e1ni[FN#225] glance the victim lie\nMy heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty, * My body wasted and my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  patience done to die:\nFrom glances ravishing all hearts with witchery * Reason far\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   flies, the while desire to thee draws nigh;\nThough at thy call should armies fill the face of earth * E'en\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   now I'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy!\"\n\nWhen Abrizah heard these words, she wept with sore weeping and said to him, \"Woe to thee, O Ghazban! How dareth the like of thee to address me such demand, O base born and obscene bred? Dost thou deem all folk are alike?\" When the vile slave heard this from her, he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder: and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death. Then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains. Such was the case with Al-Ghazban; but as regards Abrizah, she gave birth to a son, like the moon, and Marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side; and lo and behold! the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dying.[FN#226] When Marjanah saw this, she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed, saying, \"Alas, my mistress! Alas, the pity of it! Thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave, after all thy knightly prowess!\" And she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon;[FN#227] but, after awhile, it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host. Now this was the army of King Hardub, Princess Abrizah's father, and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to Baghdad, and that they were with King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, he had come forth, leading those with him, to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the King. When he had gone a single day's march from his capital, he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them, intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter. Now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and Marjanah and the slave Al- Ghazban; and he made for them to push inquiry. Seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself; so he killed Abrizah and fled for his life. When they came up, King Hardub saw his daughter lying dead and Marjanah weeping over her, and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground. All the riders of his company, the Emirs and Waxirs, took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the King a great pavilion, domed and circular, without which stood the grandees of the realm. When Marjanah saw her master, she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled; and, when he came to himself, he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said, \"Of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and she informed him how Sharrkan's father had dealt with the Princess. When King Hardub heard this, the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping. Then he called for a litter and, therein laying his dead daughter, returned to Caesarea and carried her into the palace, where he went in to his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, and said to that Lady of Calamities, \"Shall the Moslems deal thus with my girl? Verily King Omar bin al-Nu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force, and after this, one of his black slaves slew her. By the truth of the Messiah, I will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame; else will I kill myself with mine own hand!\" And he wept passing sore. Quoth his mother, \"None other than Marjanah killed thy daughter, for she hated her in secret;\" and she continued to her son, \"Fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter, for, by the truth of the Messiah, I will not turn back from King Omar bin al-Nu'uman till I have slain him and his sons; and of a very truth I will do with him a deed, passing the power of Sage and Knight, whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place: but needs must thou do my bidding in all I shall direct, for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire.\" \"By the virtue of the Messiah,\" replied he, \"I will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say.\" Then quoth she, \"Bring me a number of hand maids, high bosomed virgins, and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before Kings, and the art of conversation and making verses; and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge. And the sages must be Moslems, that they may teach them the language and traditions of the Arabs, together with the history of the Caliphs and the ancient annals of the Kings of Al-Islam; and if we persevere in this for four years' space, we shall gain our case. So possess thy soul in patience and wait; for one of the Arabs saith, 'If we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye.' When we have taught the girls these things, we shall be able to work our will with our foe, for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines, whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter, she that hath found mercy.[FN#228] As soon as I have made an end of their education, as described to thee, I will take them and set out with them in person.\" When King Hardub heard his mother's words, he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head; and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him Moslem sages. They obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought. When these came into presence, he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels. Then he committed the handmaidens to their hands\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-third Night.\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of King Hardub, he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands, enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge, philosophy and polite accomplishments; and they set themselves to do his bidding. Such was the case with King Hardub; but as for King Omar bin al Nu'uman, when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace, he sought Princess Abrizah but found her not, nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her. This was grievous to him and he said, \"How could the lady leave the palace unknown of any? Had my kingdom been at stake in this case, it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it! I will never again go to sport and hunt till I have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them!\" And he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of Princess Abrizah. Hereupon behold, his son Sharrkan returned from his journey; and the father told him what had happened, and informed him how the lady had fled, whilst he was chasing and hunting, whereat he grieved with exceeding grief. Then King Omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them, appointing for them stipends. When Sharrkan saw this, he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter: so one day his father said to him, \"Why do I see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face?\" \"O my father,\" replied Sharrkan, \"every time I see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them, jealousy seizeth on me, and I fear lest it grow on me till I slay them and thou slay me in return. And this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion. But now I crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest, that I may abide there the remnant of my life, for as the sayer of bywords saith, 'Absence from my friend is better and fitter for me'; and, 'Whatso eye doth not perceive, that garreth not heart to grieve.'\" And he bowed his head towards the ground. When King Omar bin al-Nu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down, he soothed his heart and said to him, \"O my son, I grant thee this and I have not in my reign a greater than the Castle of Damascus, and the government of it is thine from this time.\" Thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write Sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of Damascus of Syria. And when they had written it, he equipped him and sent with him the Wazir Dandan, and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations; and took leave of him, and the grandees and officers of state did likewise, and he set out with his host. When he arrived at Damascus, the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state; whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession, and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank, and the others to the left. Thus far concerning Sharrkan; but as regards his father, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, soon after the departure of his son, the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him, \"O our lord, thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony.\" The King rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men, seeing Zau al- Makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship. The Prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers, loving the poor, the Olema and the Koran students, so that all the people of Baghdad loved him, men and women. One day, the procession of the Mahmil[FN#229] of Ir\u00e1k passed round Baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to Meccah and visitation of the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!). When Zau al-Makan the Mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim,[FN#230] so he went in to his sire and said, \"I come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage.\" But his father forbade him saying, \"Wait till next year and I will go and thou too.\" When the Prince saw that the matter was postponed, he betook himself to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, whom he found standing at prayer. As soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her, \"I am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah at Meccah and to visit the tomb of the Prophet, upon whom be peace! I asked my father's leave, but he forbade me that, so I mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge.\" \"Allah upon thee,\" exclaimed she, \"take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and keep!\" And he answered, \"As soon as it is dark night, do thou come forth from this place, without telling any.\" Accordingly,When it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit; and she ceased not walking to the palace gate, where she found Zau al-Makan with camels ready for marching. So he mounted and mounted her; and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the Iraki[FN#231] pilgrim-party, and they ceased not marching and Allah wrote safety for them, till they entered Meccah the Holy and stood upon Araf\u00e1t and performed the pilgrimage rites. Then they made a visitation to the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and assain!) and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land. But Zau al-Makan said to his sister, \"O my sister, it is in my mind to visit the Holy House,[FN#232] Jerusalem, and Abraham the Friend of Allah[FN#233] (on whom be peace!).\" \"I also desire so to do,\" replied she. So they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of Jerusalem palmers. That very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill, and was grievously ill but presently recovered, after which the brother also sickened. She tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at Jerusalem, but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker. They alighted at a Khan and there hired a lodging; but Zau al- Makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him, till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious. At this, his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the decree of Allah!\" They sojourned in that place awhile, his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself, till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left. Then she sent a servant of the Khan to the bazar with some of her clothes, and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother; then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had, piece by piece, till nothing was left but an old rug. Whereupon she wept and exclaimed, \"Verily is Allah the Orderer of the past and the future!\" Presently her brother said to her, \"O my sister, I feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat.\" \"By Allah! O my brother,\" replied she, \"I have no face to beg; but tomorrow I will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living.\" Then she bethought herself awhile and said, \"Of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state, but I must despite myself!\" He rejoined, \"Allah forbid! Thou wilt be put to shame; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah!\" And he wept and she wept too. Then she said, \"O my brother, we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year, but none hath yet knocked at our door. Shall we then die of hunger? I know no resource but that I go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive, till thou recover from thy sickness, when we will travel back to our native land.\" She sat weeping awhile and he wept too, propped upon his elbow. Then Nuzhat al-Zaman arose and, veiling her head with a bit of camlet,[FN#234] which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them; she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him, weeping and knowing not whither she should wend. And she stinted not going and her brother Zau al-Makan awaiting her return till the supper time; but she came not, and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not; and this endured till two days went by. He was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her, and hunger was sore upon him. At last he left the chamber and, calling the servant of the caravanserai, said, \"I wish thee to bear me to the bazar.\" So he carried him to the market street and laid him down there; and the people of Jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition. He signed to them begging for somewhat to eat; so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar, and bought food and fed him therewith; after which they carried him to a shop, where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head. When night fell, all the folk went away, sore concerned for him and, in the middle of the night, he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him, so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him. Then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams, and hiring a camel, said to the driver, \"Carry this sick man to Damascus and leave him in the hospital; haply he may be cured and recover health.\" \"On my head be it!\" replied the camel man; but he said to himself, \"How shall I take this sick man to Damascus, and he nigh upon death?\" So he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night, when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a Hammam and went his way. When morning dawned the Stoker[FN#235] of the bath came to his work and, finding Zau al-Makan cast on his back, exclaimed, \"Why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here?\" So saying, he gave him a kick and he moved; whereupon quoth the Fireman, \"Some one of you who hath eaten a bit of Hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be!\" Then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness; so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land. And he cried, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! verily, I have sinned against this youth, for indeed the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) enjoineth honour to the stranger, more especially when the stranger is sick.\" Then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him. So she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head, then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face. Meanwhile, the Stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar, and sprinkled Zau al-Makan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet. Then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him. With this, Zau al-Makan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him; and he sat up and leant against the pillow. Hereat the Fireman rejoiced and exclaimed, \"Praise be to Allah for the welfare of this youth! O Allah, I beseech Thee by Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fireman exclaimed, \"O Allah, I beseech Thee of Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make this young man's life the work of my hands!\" And he ceased not to nurse him for three days, giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water; and doing him all manner of service and kindness, till health began to return to his body and Zau al-Makan opened his eyes. Presently came in the Fireman and, seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment, said to him, \"What is now thy state, O my son?\" \"Praise be to Allah,\" replied Zau al-Makan, \"I am well and like to recover, if such be the will of Allah Almighty at this time.\" The Stoker praised the Lord of All for this and, wending fast to the market, bought ten chickens, which he carried to his wife and said, \"Kill two of these for him every day, one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day.\" So she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled, and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth. When he had done eating, she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow, whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet, and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer. Then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it; after which she cut it up and, bringing it to Zau al-Makan, said, \"Eat, O my son!\" While he was eating; behold, her husband entered and seeing her feeding him, sat down at his head and said to him, \"How is it with thee now, O my son?\" \"Thanks be to Allah for recovery!\" he replied: \"may the Almighty requite thee thy kindness to me.\" At this the Fireman rejoiced and going out, bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it. Now the Stoker used to work at the Hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams, whereof he spent every day, for Zau al-Makan, one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water,[FN#236] and another dirham for fowls; and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month, till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole. Thereupon the Fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him, \"O my son, wilt thou go with me to the bath?\"; whereto he answered, \"Yes!\" So the Stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy, and he mounted Zau al-Makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath. Then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnace-room and went forth to the market and bought Iote leaves and lupin-flour,[FN#237] with which he returned to the bath and said to Zau al-Makan, \"O my master, in Allah's name, walk in and I will wash thy body.\" So they entered the inner room of the bath, and the Fireman took to rubbing Zau al-Makan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal, when there came to them a bathman, whom the bath keeper had sent to Zau al-Makan; and he, seeing the Stoker washing and rubbing him, said, \"This is doing injury to the keeper's rights.\" Replied the Fireman, \"The master overwhelmeth us with his favours!\" Then the bathman proceeded to shave Zau al-Makan's head, after which he and the Stoker washed themselves and returned to the house, where he clad Zau al-Makan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own; and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck. Meanwhile the Fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens; so, as soon as Zau al-Makan entered and seated himself on the carpet, the husband arose and, dissolving sugar in willow flower water, made him drink of it. Then he brought the food tray and, cutting up the chickens, fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied; when he washed his hands and praised Allah for recovery, and said to the Fireman, \"Thou art he whom the Almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure!\" \"Leave this talk,\" replied the other, \"and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art. Thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding.\" \"Tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me,\" said Zau al-Makan; \"and after I will tell thee my story.\" Rejoined the Fireman, \"As for that, I found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house, as I went to my work near the morning, and knew not who had thrown thee there. So I carried thee home with me; and this is all my tale.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"Glory to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! Indeed, O my brother, thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it, and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage.\" And he added, \"But where am I now?\" \"Thou art in the city of Jerusalem,\" replied the Stoker; where upon Zau al-Makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept. Then he discovered his secret to the Fireman and told him his story and began repeating,\n\n\"In love they bore me further than my force would go, * And for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    them made me suffer resurrection throe:\nOh, have compassion, cruel! on this soul of mine * Which, since\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ye fared, is pitied by each envious foe;\nNor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance * My case to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    lighten, easing this excess of woe:\nQuoth I 'Heart, bear this loss in patience!' Patience cried *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Take heed! no patience in such plight I'm wont to show.' \"\n\nThen he redoubled his weeping, and the Fireman said to him, \"Weep not, but rather praise Allah for safety and recovery.\" Asked Zau al-Makan, \"How far is it hence to Damascus?\" Answered the other, \"Six days' journey.\" Then quoth Zau al-Makan, \"Wilt thou send me thither?\" \"O my lord,\" quoth the Stoker, \"how can I allow thee to go alone, and thou a youth and a stranger to boot? If thou would journey to Damascus, I am one who will go with thee; and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me, I will take up my abode there; for it is no light matter to part with thee.\" Then said he to his wife, \"Wilt thou travel with me to Damascus of Syria or wilt thou abide here, whilst I lead this my lord thither and return to thee? For he is bent upon going to Damascus of Syria and, by Allah, it is hard to me to part with him, and I fear for him from highway men.\" Replied she, \"I will go with you both;\" and he rejoined, \"Praised be Allah for accord, and we have said the last word!\" Then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gear,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fire man and his wife agreed with Zau al-Makan to travel with him Damascus wards. Then the Stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for Zau al-Makan; and they set out, and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached Damascus. And they arrived there towards eventide; when the Fireman went forth and, as was his wont, bought some meat and drink. They had dwelt but five days in Damascus, when his wife sickened and, after a short illness, was translated to the mercy of Almighty Allah. Her death was a heavy matter to Zau al-Makan, for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously; and the Fireman grieved for her with excessive grief. Presently the Prince turned to the Stoker and finding him mourning, said to him, \"Grieve not, for at this gate we must all go in.\" Replied he, \"Allah make weal thy lot, O my son! Surely He will compensate us with His favours and cause our mourning to cease. What sayst thou, O my son, about our walking abroad to view Damascus and cheer thy spirits?\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"Thy will is mine.\" So the Fireman arose and placed his hand in that of Zau al- Makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the Viceroy of Damascus, where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs, and horses ready saddled and Bactrian dromedaries, while Mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro. Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"I wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs!\" So he asked one of the eunuchs, \"Whither this dispatching?'' and he answered, \"These are presents sent by the Emir of Damascus to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with the tribute of Syria.\" Now when Zau al-Makan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears, and he began repeating,\n\n\"Oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne, * Ye whose sight\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     in my spirit shall ever dwell!\nYour charms are gone, but this heart of me * Hath no sweet, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     no pleasures its sour dispel;\nIf Allah's grace make us meet again, * In long drawn love-tale my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     love I'll tell.\"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verse, he wept and the Fireman said to him, \"O my son, we hardly believed that thy health had returned;[FN#238] so take heart and do not weep, for I fear a relapse for thee.\" And he ceased not comforting and cheering him, whilst Zau al-Makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family; and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,\n\n\"Get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And know how surely Death descends thy life lot to waylay:\nAll thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine; * All\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   thy worldly life is vexing, of thy soul in vain display:\nSay is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest, * Where\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   at night he 'nakhs'[FN#239] his camels and moves off at dawn\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   of day?\"\n\nAnd he continued to weep and wail over his separation; whilst the Fireman also bewept the loss of his wife, yet ceased not to comfort Zau al-Makan till morning dawned. When the sun rose, he said to him, \"Meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land?\" \"Yes,\" replied Zau al-Makan, \"and I can no longer tarry here; so I will commend thee to Allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them, little by little, till I come to my mother land.\" Said the Stoker, \"And I with thee; for of a truth I cannot bear to part with thee. I have done thee kindly service and I mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel.\" At this, Zau al-Makan rejoiced and said, \"Allah abundantly requite thee for me!\" and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together. The Fireman at once went forth and bought another ass, selling the camel; and laid in his provaunt and said to Zau al-Makan, \"This is for thee to ride by the way; and, when thou art weary of riding, thou canst dismount and walk.\" Said Zau al-Makan, \"May Allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee! for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother.\" Then he waited till it was dark night, when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey. This much befel Zau al-Makan and the Fireman; but as regards what happened to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, when she left her brother in the Khan where they abode and, wrapped in the old camlet, went out to seek service with some one, that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for, she fared on, weeping and knowing not whither to go, whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land. So she implored Allah Almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying,\n\n\"Dark falls the night and Passion comes sore pains to gar me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dree, * And pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   tormentry,\nAnd cease not separation flames my vitals to consume, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacy\nAnd longing breeds me restlessness; desire for ever fires, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  tears to all proclaim what I would keep in secrecy\nNo cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure, * That I may\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    quit this sickly state, may cure my malady:\nThe love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel, * The\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   lover from its hell of fire must bear Hell's agony![FN#240]\nO thou who blamest me for all befel me, 'tis enough, * Patient I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   bear what ever wrote the Reed of Doom for me:\nBy Love I swear I'll never be consoled, no, never more; * I swear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     the oath of Love's own slaves who know no perjury:\nO Night, to chroniclers of Love the news of me declare; * That\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear!\"\n\nThen she walked on, weeping and turning right and left as she went, when behold, there espied her an old Badawi[FN#241] who had come into the town from the desert with wild Arabs other five. The old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely, but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet, and, marvelling at her beauty, he said to himself, \"This charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition, and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger, I needs must have her.\" So he followed her, little by little, till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane, and called out to her, asking her case, and said, \"Tell me, O my little daughter! art thou a free woman or a slave?\" When she heard this, she said to him, \"By thy life, do not add to my sorrows!\" Quoth he, \"Allah hath blessed me with six daughters, of whom five died and only one is left me, the youngest of all; and I came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger; that I might take thee and carry thee to her, to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters. If thou have no kith and kin, I will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children.\" Nuzhat al-Zaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself, \"Haply I may trust myself to this old man.\" Then she said to him, \"O nuncle, I am a maiden of the Arabs and a stranger and I have a sick brother; but I will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition, which is, that I may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother. If thou strike this bargain I will fare with thee, for I am a stranger and I was high in honour among my tribe, and I awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject. I came with my brother from the land of Al-Hijaz and I fearless he know not where I am.\" When the Badawi heard this, he said to himself, \"By Allah, I have got my desire!\" Then he turned to her and replied, \"There shall none be dearer to me than thou; I wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall. Or, if thou wilt, bring him over to dwell with us.\" And the Badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her, till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him. Then he walked on before her and, when she followed him, he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions, ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels. Now this Badawi was a base born churl, a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief, a rogue in grain, past master of plots and chicane. He had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when, by the decree of the Decreer, he fell in with this unhappy one. And he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of Jerusalem and, when outside, he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries. So the Badawi mounted a camel, having seated Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him and they rode on all night. Then she knew that the Badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her; and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long, while they journeyed on making for the mountains, in fear any should see them. Now when it was near dawn, they dismounted from their dromedaries and the Badawi came up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said to her, \"O city strumpet, what is this weeping? By Allah, an thou hold not thy peace, I will beat thee to death, O thou town filth!\" When she heard this she loathed life and longed for death; so she turned to him and said, \"O accursed old man, O gray beard of hell, how have I trusted thee and thou hast played me false, and now thou wouldst torture me?\" When he heard her reply he cried out, \"O lazy baggage, dost thou dare to bandy words with me?\" And he stood up to her and beat her with a whip, saying, \"An thou hold not thy peace, I will kill thee!\" So she was silent awhile, then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly. Next day, she turned to the Badawi and said to him, \"How couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains, and what is thy design with me?\" When he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her, \"O lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent! wilt thou bandy words with me?\" and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint. Then she bowed down over his feet and kissed[FN#242] them; and he left beating her and began reviling her and said, \"By the rights of my bonnet,[FN#243] if I see or hear thee weeping, I will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte, O thou city filth!\" So she was silent and made him no reply, for the beating pained her; but sat down with her arms round her knees and, bowing her head upon her collar, began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour; and the beating she had endured; and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition, and how they were both strangers in a far country, which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating,\n\n\"Time hath for his wont to upraise and debase, * Nor is lasting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   condition for human race:\nIn this world each thing hath appointed turn; * Nor may man\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    transgress his determined place:\nHow long these perils and woes? Ah woe * For a life, all woeful\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    in parlous case!\nAllah bless not the days which have laid me low * I' the world,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    with disgrace after so much grace!\nMy wish is baffled, my hopes cast down, * And distance forbids me\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     to greet his face:\nO thou who passeth that dear one's door, * Say for me, these\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     tears shall flow evermore!\"\n\nWhen she had finished her verses, the Badawi came up to her and, taking compassion on her, bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears. Then he gave her a barley scone and said, \"I love not one who answereth at times when I am in wrath: so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and I will sell thee to a good man like myself, who will do well with thee, even as I have done.\" \"Yes; whatso thou doest is right,\" answered she; and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her, she ate very little of that barley bread. In the middle of the night the Badawi gave orders for departure,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Badawi gave the barley scone to Nuzhat al-Zaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself, she replied, \"Whatso thou doest is right!\" and, about midnight when hunger burned her,[FN#244] she ate a very little of that barley bread and the Badawi ordered his party to set out; so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him. Then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days, till they entered the city of Damascus and alighted at the Sultan's Khan, hard by the Viceroy's Gate. Now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling, and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes. So the Badawi came up to her and said, \"O thou city filth, by the right of my bonnet, if thou leave not this weeping, I will sell thee to none but a Jew!\" Then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber, and walked off to the bazar, and he went round to, the merchants who dealt in slave girls, and began to parley with them, saying, \"I have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill, and I sent him to my people about Jerusalem, that they might tend him till he is cured. As for her I want to sell her, but after the dog her brother fell sick, the separation from him was grievous to her, and since then she doth nothing but weep, and now I wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say, 'Thy brother is with me in Jerusalem ill'; and I will be easy with him about her price.\" Then one of the merchants came up to him and asked, \"How old is she?\" He answered \"She is a virgin, just come to marriageable age, and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness. But from the day I sent her brother to Jerusalem, her heart hath been yearning for him, so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened.\" Now when the merchant heard this, he set forth with the Badawi and said, \"O Shaykh[FN#245] of the Arabs, I will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness; and I will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept, I will give thee ready money, and if thou accept not I will return her to thee.\" Quoth the Badawi, \"An thou wilt, take her up to the Sultan Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and condition me any conditions thou likest, for when thou hast brought her before King Sharrkan, haply she will please him, and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot.\" Rejoined the merchant, \"It happens that I have just now something to ask from him, and it is this that he write me an order upon the office, exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. So if he take the girl, I will weigh[FN#246] thee out her price at once.\" \"I agree with thee to this condition,\" answered the Badawi. So they returned together to the place where Nuzhat al-Zaman was and the wild Arab stood at the chamber door and called out, saying, \"O N\u00e1jiyah[FN#247]!\" which was the name wherewith he had named her. When she heard him, she wept and made no answer. Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, \"There she sitteth; go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as I enjoined thee.\" So the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable, especially as she knew the Arabic tongue; and he said to the Badawi, \"If she be even as thou saddest, I shall get of the Sultan what I will for her.\" Then he bespake her, \"Peace be on thee, my little maid! How art thou?\" She turned to him and replied, \"This also was registered in the Book of Destiny.\" Then she looked at him and, seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face, she said to herself, \"I believe this one cometh to buy me;\" and she continued, \"If I hold aloof from him, I shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating. In any case, this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a Badawi. May be he cometh only to hear me talk; so I will give him a fair answer.\" All this while her eyes were fixed on the ground; then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice, \"And upon thee be peace, O my lord, and Allah's mercy and His benediction![FN#248] This is what is commanded of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and preserve! As for thine enquiry how I am, if thou wouldst know my case, it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe.\" And she held her peace. When the merchant heard what she said, his fancy took wings for delight in her and, turning to the Badawi, he asked him, \"What is her price, for indeed she is noble?\" Thereupon the Badawi waxed angry and answered, \"Thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk! Why dost thou say that she is noble,[FN#249] while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk? I will not sell her to thee!\" When the merchant heard this, he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him, \"Calm thyself, for I will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest.\" \"And how much wilt thou give me for her?\" enquired the Badawi. Replied the merchant, \"Name thy price for her: none should name the son save his sire.\" Rejoined the Badawi, \"None shall name it but thou thyself.\" Quoth the merchant to himself, \"This wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head. By Allah, I cannot tell her price, for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks; and, if she can read and write, it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser. But this Badawi does not know her worth.\" Then he turned and said to him, \"O Shaykh of the Arabs, I will give thee in ready money, clear of the tax and the Sultan's dues, two hundred gold pieces.\" Now when the Badawi heard this, he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant, saying, \"Get up and go thy ways! By Allah, wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth, I would not sell it to thee. And now I will not sell her, but will keep her by me, to pasture the camels and grind my grist.\" And he cried out to her, saying, \"Come here, thou stinkard! I will not sell thee.\" Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, \"I used to think thee a man of judgment; but, by the right of my bonnet, if thou begone not from me, I will let thee hear what shall not please thee!\" Quoth the merchant to himself, \"Of a truth this Badawi is mad and knoweth not her value, and I will say no more to him about her price at the present time; for by Allah, were he a man of sense, he would not say, 'By the rights of my bonnet!' By the Almighty, she is worth the kingdom of the Chosro\u00ebs and I have not her price by me, but if he ask even more, I will give him what he will, though it be all my goods.\" Then he turned and said to him, \"O Shaykh of the Arabs, take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee?\" Cried the Badawi, \"And what hath the baggage to do with clothes? By Allah, this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her.\" \"With thy leave,\" said the merchant, \"I will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying.\"[FN#250] Replied the other, \"Up and do what thou wilt and Allah keep thy youth! Examine her outside and inside and, if thou wilt, strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked.\" Quoth the trader, \"Allah forfend! I will look at naught save her face.\"[FN#251] Then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness,\u2014And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant went up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness, so he sat by her side and asked her, \"O my mistress, what is thy name?\" She answered, \"Doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day?\" Thereupon the merchant enquired, \"Hast thou then two names: to day's and yesterday's?\" \"Yes,\" replied she, \"my name in the past was Nuzhat al-Zaman, the Delight of the Age; but my name at this present is Ghussat[FN#252] al-Zaman, the Despight of the Age.\" When the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her, \"Hast thou not a sick brother?\" \"Ay by Allah, O my lord, I have,\" quoth she, \"but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in Jerusalem.\" The merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself, \"Verily, the Badawi spake the truth of her.\" Then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him; and she thought of all that had happened to her with the Badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land; and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped; and she began reciting,\n\n\"Allah, where'er thou be, His aid impart * To thee, who distant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dwellest in my heart!\nAllah be near thee how so far thou fare; * Ward off all shifts of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Time, all dangers thwart!\nMine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight, * And start my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    tears-ah me, how fast they start!\nWould Heaven I kenned what quarter or what land * Homes thee, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   in what house and tribe thou art\nA fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose, * While drink I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     tear drops for my sole desert?\nAn thou 'joy slumber in those hours, when I * Peel 'twixt my side\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   and couch coals' burning smart?\nAll things were easy save to part from thee, * For my sad heart\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   this grief is hard to dree.\"\n\nWhen the merchant heard her verses, he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks; but she let down her veil over her face, saying, \"Heaven forbid, O my lord!''[FN#253] Then the Badawi, who was sitting at a little distance watching them, saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks; and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her: so he rose and running to her, dealt her, with a camel's halter he had in his hand, such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face. Her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open, and the blood streamed down her cheeks; whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly. The merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself, \"There is no help for it but that I buy this damsel, though at her weight in gold, and free her from this tyrant.\" And he began to revile the Badawi whilst Nazhat al- Zaman lay in sensible. When she came to herself, she wiped away the tears and blood from her face; and she bound up her head: then, raising her glance to heaven, she besought her Lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating,\n\n\"And pity one who erst in honour throve, * And now is fallen into\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     sore disgrace.\nShe weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears, * And asks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'What cure can meet this fatal case?'\"\n\nWhen she had ended her verse, she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone, \"By the Almighty, do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not Allah the Most High! If I pass this night in his place, I shall kill myself with my own hand: save me from him, so Allah save thee from Gehenna-fire.\" Then quoth the merchant to the Badawi, \"O Shaykh of the Arabs, this slave is none of thine affair; so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt.\" \"Take her,\" quoth the Badawi, \"and pay me down her price, or I will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung.\"[FN#254] Said the merchant, \"I will give thee fifty thousand diners for her.\" \"Allah will open!\"[FN#255] replied the Badawi. \"Seventy thousand,\" said the merchant. \"Allah will open!\" repeated the Badawi: \"this is not the capital spent upon her, for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces.\" The merchant rejoined, \"Thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley; but I will say thee one word, wherewith if thou be not satisfied, I will set the Viceroy of Damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force.\" The Badawi continued, \"Say on!\" \"An hundred thousand,\" quoth the merchant. \"I have sold her to thee at that price,\" answered the Badawi; \"I shall be able to buy salt with her.\" The merchant laughed and, going to his lodgings, brought the money and put it into the hand of the Badawi, who took it and made off, saying to himself, \"Needs must I go to Jerusalem where, haply, I shall happen on her brother, and I will bring him here and sell him also.\" So he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at Jerusalem, where he went to the Khan and asked for Zau al-Makan, but could not find him. Such was the case with him; but for what regards the merchant and Nazhat al-Zaman, when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the trader saved Nuzhat al-Zaman from the Badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment, he went down with her to the bazar, where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag, which he set before her, saying, \"All is for thee and I ask nothing of thee in return but that, when I lead thee to the Sultan, Viceroy of Damascus, thou acquaint him with the price I paid for thee, albeit it was little compared with thy value: and, if seeing thee he buy thee of me, thou tell him how I have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent, and a written recommendation wherewith I can repair to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad, to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which I traffic.\" When she heard his words, she wept and sobbed, and the merchant said to her, \"O my lady, I observe that, every time I mention Baghdad, thine eyes are tearful: is there any one there whom thou lovest? If it be a trader or the like, tell me; for I know all the merchants and so forth there and, if thou wouldst send him a message, I will bear it for thee.\" Replied she, \"By Allah, I have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like! I know none there but King Omar bin Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad.\" When the merchant heard her words, he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself, \"By Allah, I have won my wish!\" Then he said to her, \"Hast thou been shown to him in time past?\" She answered, \"No, but I was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and I have high honour with him; so if thou wouldst have the King grant thee thy desire, give me ink case and paper and I will write thee a letter; and when thou reachest the city of Baghdad, do thou deliver it into the hand of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and say to him, 'Thy handmaid, Nuzhat al-Zaman, would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer, and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place, and she sendeth thee her salams.' And, if he ask further of her, say that I am now with the Viceroy at Damascus.\" The merchant wondered at her eloquence, and his affection for her increased and he said to her I cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money. Tell me, dost thou know the Koran by heart?\" \"Yes,\" answered she; \"and I am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of Galen, the physician, on the canons of Hippocrates; and I have commented him and I have read the Tazkirah and have commented the Burh\u00e1n; and I have studied the Simples of Ibn Bayt\u00e1r, and I have something to say of the canon of Meccah, by Avicenna. I can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities, and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy I have read the books of the Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed[FN#256] school and the Traditions of the Prophet and syntax; and I can argue with the Olema and discourse of all manner learning. Moreover I am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs, and I know thoroughly the Spiritual Sciences[FN#257] and the times appointed for religious duties and I understand all these branches of knowledge.\" Then quoth she to the merchant, \"Bring me ink case and paper, that I write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to Baghdad and enable thee to do without passports.\" Now when the merchant heard this, he cried out \"Brava! Brava![FN#258] Then O happy he in whose palace thou shalt! Thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour. She took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses,\n\n\"I see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown; * Say, did\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone?\nWhat makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart? * Hath\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    every lover strength such memories to own?\nHow sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Tis gone and ere I taste its sweets afar 'tis flown:\nI pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news * From thee,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    to lover wightwi' love so woe begone\nComplains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn, * For parting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pangs can break not only heart but stone.\"\n\nAnd when she had ended writing the verses she continued, \"These words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her; in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight. She tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness; she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes: verily, sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length. No helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses,\n\n'No ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light, * But\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might:\nNo lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart * To meet his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     mate, but breeds in me redoubled blight\nI bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me, * Ah me, how Love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     can part man's mortal frame and sprite!' \"\nThen her eyes welled over with tears, and she wrote also these two couplets,\n\n\"Love smote my frame so sore on parting day, * That severance\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     severed sleep and eyes for aye.\nI waxt so lean that I am still a man, * But for my speaking, thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     wouldst never say.\"\n\nThen she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet, \"This cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land, the sorrowful hearted woman Nuzhat al-Zaman.\" In fine, she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant, who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed, \"Glory to Him who fashioned thee!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Fifty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant; and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed, \"Glory to Him who fashioned thee!\" Then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day, and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food, wherewith he fed her; after which he carried her to the Hammam and said to the bath woman, \"As soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head, dress her and send and let me know of it.\" And she replied \"Hearing is obeying.\" Meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath; and when the tire woman had done washing her, she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench. Then she sent to tell the merchant, and Nuzhat al-Zaman went forth to the outer room, where she found the tray spread with food and fruit. So she ate and the tire woman with her, and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath. Then she slept till the morning, and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her. When he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her, presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners, a suit of Turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems. Moreover, he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein, worth a thousand diners, and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel. Now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents, and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby, and each ball a bezel of balass: the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams, so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money. When she had put these on, the merchant bade her adorn herself, and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty; then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her. But when folk saw her, all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed, \"Blessed be Allah, the most excellent Creator! O lucky the man in whose house the hall be!\" And the trader ceased not walking (and she behind him) till they entered the palace of Sultan Sharrkan; when he sought an audience and, kissing the earth between his hands, said, \"O auspicious King, I have brought thee a rare gift, unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities.\" Quoth the King, \"Let me see it.\" So the merchant went out and brought her, she following him till he made her stand before King Sharrkan. When he beheld her, blood yearned to blood, though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her, having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called Nuzhat al- Zaman and a brother Zau al-Makan, he having been jealous of them, because of the succession. And such was the cause of his knowing little about them. Then, having placed her before the presence, the merchant said, \"O King of the age, besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness, she is also versed in all learning, sacred and profane, including the art of government and the abstract sciences.\" Quoth the King to the trader, \"Take her price, according as thou boughtest her, and go thy ways.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" replied the merchant; \"but first write me a patent, exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise.\" Said the King, \"I will do this, but first tell me what price thou paidest for her.\" Said the merchant, \"I bought her for an hundred thousand diners, and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand.\" When the Sultan heard these words, he declared, \"I will give thee a higher price than this for her;\" and, calling his treasurer, said to him, \"Pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats; so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit.\" Thereupon the Sultan summoned the four Kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said, \"I call you to witness that I free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her.\" So the Kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage, when the Sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present; and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse. Then, after paying him his monies, Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent, exempting him from toll, tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him, and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixtieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate, after paying him his monies; and they wrote a perpetual patent, exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him; and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour. Then all about him retired, and none remained save the Kazis and the merchant, whereupon said he to the judges, \"I wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader, that we ascertain the truth of his assertions.\" They answered, \"There is no evil in that!\"; and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her; and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet, when they learned that she was become the King's wife. Then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness. Presently the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs heard that King Sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping, and versed in all branches of knowledge, that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars, and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four Kazis to make trial of her, how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them. So they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was Nuzhat al- Zaman. When they came in to her, they found the eunuchs standing before her; and, as soon as she saw the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of the realm coming to call upon her, she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy, her handmaidens standing behind her, and she received them saying, \"Ye be welcome!\" The while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts; and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations, as if she had been brought up with them; so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another, \"This damsel is none other than a Queen, the daughter of a King.\" Then they sat down, magnifying her worth and said to her, \"O our lady, this our city is illumined by thee, and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence. The kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace, and we all are thy handmaids; so, by Allah, do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty.\" And she thanked them for this. All this while the curtains were let down between Nuzhat al-Zaman and the women with her, on the one side, and King Sharrkan and the four Kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other. Presently King Sharrkan called to her and said, \"O Queen, the glory of thine age, this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished; and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge, even to astrology: so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned, and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects.\" She replied, saying: \"O King, to hear is to obey.[FN#259] The first subjects whereof I will treat are the art of government and the duties of Kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law, and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners. Know then, O King, that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life, for none attaineth to religion save through this world, because it is the best road to futurity. Now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people, and men's doings are divided into four divisions, government, commerce, husbandry and craftsmanship. Now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment; for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world, which world is the road to futurity; since Allah Almighty hath made the world for His servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal; and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to Allah, and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust. If folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity, all cause of contention would be cut off; but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires, and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions; so they have need of the Sultan, that he do justice between them and order their affairs; and, if the King restrain not his folk from one another, the strong will drive the weak to the wall. Hence Ardeshir[FN#260] saith, 'Religion and Kingship be twins'; religion is a hidden treasure and the King is its keeper; and the Divine Ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a Sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule. For know, O King, that according to the measure of the Sultan's good morals, even so will be the time; as saith the Apostle of Allah (on whom be peace and salvation!), 'There be two classes who, if they be good, the people will be good; and if they be bad, the people will be bad, even the Olema and the Emirs.' And it is said by a certain sage, 'There be three kinds of Kings, the King of the Faith, the King who protecteth things to which reverence is due, and the King of his own lusts.' The King of the Faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith, and it behoveth he be the most faithful,[FN#261] for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the Faith; and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to Divine Ordinance; but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented, because of submission to the decrees of Destiny. As for the King who protecteth things to be reverenced, he upholdeth the things of the Faith and of the World and compelleth his folk to follow the Divine Law and to preserve the rights of humanity; and it fitteth him to unite Pen and Sword; for whoso declineth from what Pen hath written his feet slip and the King shall rectify his error with the sharp Sword and dispread his justice over all mankind. As for the King of his own lusts, he hath no religion but the following his desire and, as he feareth not the wrath of his Lord who set him on the throne, so his Kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition. And sages say, 'The King hath need of many people, but the people have need of but one King' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures, that he reduce their discord to concord, that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all. And know, O King, that Ardeshir, styled Jamr Shad\u00edd, or the Live Coal, third of the Kings of Persia, conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and, for this purpose, get for himself four seal rings, one for each division. The first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written, Alterna lives. The second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies, and on it was written, Building up. The third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written, Plenty. The fourth was the seal of the oppressed, and on it was written, Justice. And these usages remained valid in Persia until the revelation of Al-Islam. Chosro\u00ebs also wrote his son, who was with the army, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee.'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-first night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Chosro\u00ebs wrote his son, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee; nor be thou niggardly with them, or they will murmur against thee. Give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly; open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress.' There is a legend that a desert Arab came once to the Caliph Al- Mans\u00far[FN#262] and said, 'Starve thy dog and he shall follow thee.' When the Caliph heard his words, he was enraged with the Arab, but Abu 'l-Abb\u00e1s of T\u00fas said to him, 'I fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone, the dog would follow him and leave thee alone.' Thereupon the Caliph Al-Mansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild Arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present. And know, O King, that Abd al-Malik bin Marw\u00e1n wrote to his brother Abd al-Az\u00edz, when he despatched him to Egypt, as follows, 'Pay heed to thy Secretaries and thy Chamberlains, for the Secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the Chamberlains with matters of official ceremony, whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee.' Omar bin Al-Khatt\u00e1b[FN#263] (whom Allah accept!) when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions; the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts, the second that he should not wear fine clothes, the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period. It is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding, and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence, and there is no prudence like piety; that there is no means of drawing near to God like good morals, no measure like good breeding, no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the Divine favour; that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law, no science like that of meditation, no worship like obeying the Divine commends, no faith like modesty, no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge. So guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth; and think of death and doom ere it ariseth. Saith Ali (whose face Allah honour!), 'Beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them: consult them not in aught;[FN#264] but grudge not complaisance to them, lest they greed for intrigue.' And eke quoth he, 'Whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed'; and there be rules for this which we will mention, if it be Allah's will. And Omar (whom Allah accept!) saith, 'There are three kinds of women, firstly the true believing, Heaven fearing, love full and fruit full, who helpeth her mate against fate, not helping fate against her mate; secondly, she who loveth her children but no more and, lastly, she who is a shackle Allah setteth on the neck of whom He will.' Men be also three: the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement; the wiser who, when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue, seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice; and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight. Justice is indispensable in all things; even slave girls have need of justice; and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind, for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty, their order would fall to pieces.[FN#265] In short, for the rest, the Prince of noble qualities is Beneficence cum Benevolence; and how excellent is the saying of the poet,\n\nBy open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command; * Go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee.'\n\nAnd quoth another,\n\n'In ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect, * And\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul:\nWhoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     word, * On glory's course must ever be the first to gain the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     goal.'\"\n\nAnd Nazhat al-Zaman discoursed upon the policy of Kings till the bystanders said, \"Never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel! Haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this.\" When she heard their words and understood them she said, \"As for the chapter of good breeding, it is wide of comprehension, being a compend of things perfect. Now it so happened that one day there came to the Caliph Mu'\u00e1wiyah[FN#266] one of his companions, who mentioned the people of Irak and the goodness of their wit; and the Caliph's wife Mays\u00fan, mother of Yez\u00edd, heard his words. So, when he was gone, she said to the Caliph, 'O Prince of the Faithful, I would thou let some of the people of Irak come in and talk to thee, that I may hear their discourse.' Therewith Mu'awiyah said to his attendants, 'See who is at the door?' And they answered, 'The Banu Tamim.' 'Let them come in,' said he. So they came in and with them Al-Ahn\u00e1f son of Kays.[FN#267] Then quoth Mu'awiyah, 'Enter, O Abu Bahr,' and drew a curtain between himself and Maysun, that she might hear what they said without being seen herself; then he said to Al-Ahnaf, 'O Son of the Sea, draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me.' Quoth Al-Ahnaf, 'Part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes[FN#268] and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues, and make the Ghusl or complete ablution on Friday, as an expiation for all between the Fridays.'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahnaf bin Kays replied to Al-Mu'awiyah's[FN#269] question, 'And ever use the toothstick, because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete Friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two Fridays.' Quoth Mu'awiyah, 'What is thy counsel to thyself?' 'To set my feet firmly on the ground, to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes!' 'How dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe?' 'I lower mine eyes modestly and I salute first; I avoid what concerneth me not and I spare my words!' 'And how when thou goest in to thine equals?' 'I give ear to them when they speak and I do not assail them when they err!' 'When thou goest in to thy chiefs?' 'I salute without making any sign and await the reply: if they bid me draw near, I draw near, and if they draw off from me I withdraw!' 'How dost thou with thy wife?' Quoth Ahnaf, 'Excuse me from answering this, O Commander of the Faithful!'; but Mu'awiyah cried, 'I conjure thee inform me.' He said, 'I entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure, for woman was created of a crooked rib.'[FN#270] 'And how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her?' 'I bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire; then, should it be as thou knowest,[FN#271] I throw her on her back. If the seed abide in her womb I say, 'O Allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel, but fashion it into the best of fashions!'[FN#272] Then I rise from her to ablution and first I pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly, I praise Allah for the joy He hath given me.' Said Mu'awiyah, 'Thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements?' Said Ahnaf, 'I would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of Allah and do even handed justice between them.' Thereupon Ahnaf rose to his feet and left the Caliph's presence, and when he had gone Maysun said, 'Were there but this man in Irak, he would suffice to it.' Then continued Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"And all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding, and know O King, that Muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khatt\u00e1b,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, \"Know, O King, that Mu'aykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattab; and it so befel him that he saw Omar's son and gave him a dirham out of the treasury. Thereupon, quoth Mu'aykib, 'I returned to my own house, and while I was sitting there behold, a messenger came to me from Omar and I was afraid and went to him, and when I came into his presence, in his hand was the dirham I had given his son. He said to me, 'Woe to thee Mu'aykib! I have found somewhat concerning thy soul.' I asked 'And what is that?'; and he answered, 'It is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to the followers of Mohammed (on whom be peace and salvation!) in the matter of this dirham, and thou wilt have to account for it on Resurrection Day.'[FN#273] And Omar also wrote a letter to Ab\u00fa M\u00fas\u00e1 al-Ash\u00e1ri[FN#274] as follows, 'When these presents reach thee, give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest.' And he did so. Now when Othman succeeded to the Caliphate, he wrote a like letter to Abu Musa, who did his bidding and sent him the tribute accordingly, and with it came Ziy\u00e1d.[FN#275] And when Ziyad laid the tribute before Othman, the Caliph's son came in and took a dirham, whereupon Ziyad shed tears. Othman asked 'Why weepest thou?'; and Ziyad answered, 'I once brought Omar bin al-Khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham, where upon Omar bade snatch it from his hand. Now thy son hath taken of the tribute, yet I have seen none say aught to him or snatch the money from him.' Then Othman[FN#276] cried, 'And where wilt thou find the like of Omar?' Again Zayd bin Aslam relates of his father that he said, 'I went out one night with Omar till we approached a blazing fire. Quoth Omar, 'O Aslam, I think these must be travellers who are suffering from the cold. Come, let us join them.' So we walked on till we came to them and behold! we found a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by her side were two children, both a wailing. Said Omar, 'Peace be with you, O folk of light (for it was repugnant to him to say 'folk of fire'),[FN#277] what aileth you?' Said she, 'The cold and the night trouble us.' He asked, 'What aileth these little people that they weep?'; and she answered, 'They are hungry.' He enquired, 'And what is in this cauldron?'; and she replied, 'It is what I quiet them withal, and Allah will question Omar bin al- Khattab of them, on the Day of Doom.' He said, 'And what should Omar know of their case?' 'Why then,' rejoined she, 'should he manage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them?' Thereupon Omar turned to me (continned Aslam) and cried, 'Come with us!' So we set off running till we reached the pay department of his treasury, where he took out a sack containing flour and a pot holding fat and said to me, 'Load these on my back!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I will carry them for thee.' He rejoined, 'Wilt thou bear my load for me on the Day of Resurrection?' So I put the things on his back, and we set off, running, till we threw down the sack hard by her. Then he took out some of the flour and put it in the cauldron; and, saying to the woman, 'Leave it to me,' he began blowing the fire under the cauldron. Now he was a long bearded man[FN#278] and I saw the smoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flour was cooked, when he took some of the fat and threw it in and said to the woman, 'Bed them while I cool it for them.' So they fell to eating till they had eaten their fill, and he left the rest with her. Then he turned to me and said, 'O Aslam, I see it was indeed hunger made them weep; and I am glad I did not go away ere I found out the cause of the light I saw.'\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, \"It is related that Omar passed by a flock of sheep, kept by a Mameluke, and asked him to sell him a sheep. He answered, 'They are not mine.' 'Thou art the man I sought,' said Omar, and bought him and freed him; whereupon the slave exclaimed, 'O Allah, as thou hast bestowed on me the lesser emancipation; so vouchsafe me the greater!'[FN#279] It is also said that Omar bin al- Khattab was wont to give his servants sweet milk and himself eat coarse fare, and to clothe them softly and himself wear rough garments. He rendered unto all men their due, and exceeded in his giving to them. He once gave a man four thousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand, wherefore it was said to him, 'Why dost thou not increase to thy son as thou increasest to this man?' He answered, 'This man's father stood firm at the battle day of Ohod.'[FN#280] Al-Hasan relates that Omar once came back from foray with much money, and that Hafsah[FN#281] approached him and said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, the due of kinship!' 'O Hafsah!' replied he, 'verily Allah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship, but not with the monies of the True Believers. Indeed, thou pleasest\" thy family, but thou angerest thy father.' And she went away trailing her skirts.[FN#282] The son of Omar said, 'I implored the Lord to show me my father one year after his death, till at last I saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him, 'How is it with thee, O my father?' He answered, 'But for my Lord's mercy thy father surely had perished.' Then said Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"Hear, O auspicious King, the second division of the first chapter of the instances of the followers of the Apostle and other holy men. Saith Al Hasan al-Basr\u00ed,[FN#283] Not a soul of the sons of Adam goeth forth of the world without regretting three things,- failure to enjoy what he hath amassed, failure to compass what he hoped, failure to provide himself with sufficient viaticum for that hereto he goeth.[FN#284] It was said of Sufyan,[FN#285] 'Can a man be a religious and yet possess wealth?' He replied, 'Yes, so he be patient when grieved and be thankful when he hath received.' Abdullah bin Shadd\u00e1d, being about to die, sent for his son Mohammed and admonished him, saying, 'O my son, I see the Summoner of Death summoning me, and so I charge thee to fear Allah both in public and private, to praise Allah and to be soothfastin thy speech, for such praise bringeth increase of prosperity, and piety in itself is the best of provision for the next world; even as saith one of the poets,\n\n'I see not happiness lies in gathering gold; * The man most pious\nis man happiest:\nIn truth the fear of God is best of stores, * And God shall make\nthe pious choicely blest.'\nThen quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"Let the King also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter.\" He asked her 'What be they?'; and she answered, \"When Omar bin Abd al-Az\u00edz[FN# 286] succeeded to the Caliphate, he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold, put it into the public treasury. So the Banu Umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister, F\u00e1timah, daughter of Marwan, and she sent to him saying, 'I must needs speak to thee.' So she came to him by night and, when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down, he said to her, 'O aunt, it is for thee to speak first, since thou hast some thing to ask: tell me then what thou wouldst with me.' Replied she, 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is thine to speak first, for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others.' Then said Omar, 'Of a verity Allah Almighty sent Mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him, and commissioned him as His Apostle and took him to Himself,'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued thus, \"Said Omar, 'Verily Allah commissioned as His Apostle Mohammed (upon whom be the benediction of Allah and His salvation!), for a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him and took him to Himself, leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink. After him Abu Bakr[FN#287] the Truth teller became Caliph and he left the river as it was, doing what was pleasing to Allah. Then arose Omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like. But when Othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream, and Mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets; and without ceasing in like manner, Yezid and the Banu Marw\u00e1n such as Abd al-Malik and Wal\u00edd and Sulaym\u00e1n[FN#288] drew away water from the stream, and the main course dried up, till rule devolved upon me, and now I am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition.' When Fatimah heard this, she said, 'I came wishing only to speak and confer with thee, but if this be thy word, I have nothing to say to thee.' Then she returned to the Ommiades and said to them, 'Now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with Omar bin al-Khattab.'[FN#289] And it is also said that when Omar was about to die, he gathered his children round him, and Maslamah[FN#290] bin Abd al-Malik said to him, 'O Prince of the Faithful, how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector? None can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury; and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee.' Omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied, 'O Maslamah, I have defended them from this sin all the days of my life, and shall I make them miserable after my death? Of a truth my sons are like other men, either obedient to Almighty Allah who will prosper them, or disobedient and I will not help them in their disobedience. Know, O Maslamah, that I was present, even as thou, when such an one of the sons of Marwanwas buried, and I fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of Allah, to whom belong Honour and Glory! This terrified me and made me tremble, and I vowed to Allah, that if ever I came to power, I would not do such deeds as the dead man had done. I have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and I hope to die in the mercy of my Lord.' Quoth Maslamah, 'A certain man died and I was present at his burial, and when all was over I fell asleep and I saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream, walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes. He came up to me and said: 'O Maslamah, it is for the like of this that rulers should rule.' Many are the instances of this kind, and quoth one of the men of authority, 'I used to milk the ewes in the Caliphate of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz, and one day I met a shepherd, among whose sheep I saw a wolf or wolves. I thought them to be dogs, for I had never before seen wolves; so I asked, 'What dost thou with these dogs?' 'They are not dogs, but wolves,' answered the shepherd. Quoth I, 'Can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them?' Quoth he, 'When the head is whole, the body is whole.'[FN#291] Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and, after praising and glorifying Allah Almighty, said three words as follows, 'O folk, make clean your inmost hearts, that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren, and abstain ye from the things of the world. Know that between us and Adam there is no one man alive among the dead. Dead are Abd al- Malik and those who forewent him, and Omar also shall die and those who forewent him.' Asked Maslamah, 'O Commander of the Faithful, an we set a pillow behind thee, wilt thou lean on it a little while?' But Omar answered, 'I fear lest it be a fault about my neck on Resurrection Day.' Then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint; whereupon Fatimah cried out, saying, 'Ho, Maryam! Ho, Muzahim![FN#292] Ho, such an one! Look to this man!' And she began to pour water on him weeping, till he revived from his swoon; and, seeing her in tears said to her, 'What causeth thee to weep, O Fatimah?' She replied, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before Almighty Allah, of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us. This is what made me weep.' Answered he, 'Enough, O Fatimah, for indeed thou exceedest.' Then he would have risen, but fell down and Fatimah strained him to her and said, 'Thou art to me as my father and my mother, O Commander of the Faithful! We cannot speak to thee, all of us.' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, \"Here endeth the second section of the first chapter.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman said to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, \"Here endeth the second section of the first chapter. And it so happened that Omar bin Abd al-Aziz wrote to the people of the festival at Meccah as follows, 'I call Allah to witness, in the Holy Month, in the Holy City and on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage,[FN#293] that I am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you, in that I have neither commanded this nor purposed it, neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me, nor have I compassed any knowledge thereof; and I trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man, for I shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress. And if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the Holy Book and the Traditions of the Apostle do authorise, obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness.' He said also (Allah accept of him!), 'I do not wish to be relieved from death, because it is the supreme thing for which the True Believer is rewarded.' Quoth one of authority, 'I went to the Prince of the Faithful, Omarbin Abd al-Aziz, who was then Caliph, and saw before him twelve dirhams, which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury. So I said to him, 'O Commander of the Faithful, thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live. An thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house, it were well.' 'Draw near to me,' answered he: so I drew near to him and he said, 'Now as for thy saying, 'Thou beggarest thy children; provide for them and for the poor of thy household,' it is without reason; for Allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house, and He will be their guardian. Verily, they are like other men; he who feareth Allah, right soon will Allah provide for him a happy issue, and he that is addicted to sins, I will not up hold him in his sin against Allah.' Then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve, and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them, 'Your Father is between two things; either ye will be well to do, and your parent will enter the fire, or ye will be poor and your parent will enter Paradise; and your father's entry into Paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do.[FN#294] So arise and go, Allah be your helper, for to Him I commit your affairs!' Kh\u00e1lid bin Safw\u00e1n[FN#295] said, 'Y\u00fasuf bin Omar[FN#296] accompanied me to Hish\u00e1m bin Abd al-Malik,[FN#297] and as I met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants. He alighted and a tent was pitched for him. When the people had taken their seats, I came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him; and, waiting till my eyes met his eyes, bespoke him thus, 'May Allah fulfil His bounty to thee, O Commander of the Faithful, I have an admonition for thee, which hath come down to us from the history of the Kings preceding thee!' At this, he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me, 'Bring what thou hast, O son of Safwan!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, one of the Kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time, to this very country and said to his companions, 'Saw ye ever any state like mine and say me, hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me?' Now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to Truth; upholders of the Right and wayfarers in its highway, and he said to him, 'O King, thou askest of a grave matter. Wilt thou give me leave to answer?' 'Yes,' replied the King, and the other said, 'Dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting?' 'It is temporary,' replied the King. 'How then,' rejoined the man, 'do I see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned?' Quoth the King, 'Whither shall I flee and what must I seek for me?' 'That thou abide in thy kingship,' replied the other, 'or else robe thee in rags[FN#298] and apply thyself to obey Almighty Allah thy Lord until thine appointed hour. I will come to thee again at daybreak.' Khalid bin Safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold, the King had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite, for the stress of his exhortation. When Hish\u00e1m bin Abd al-Malik heard this, he wept till his beard was wet, and, bidding his rich apparel be put off, shut himself up in his palace. Then the grandees and dependents came to Khalid and said, 'What is this thou hast done with the Commander of the Faithful? Thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life!' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, addressing herself to Sharrkan, \"How many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter! Of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, speaking to Sharrkan, \"Know, O King, that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but, with length of days, O King of the age, all will be well.\" There said the Kazis, \"O King, of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world, and of our age the unique pearl! Never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives.\" And they called down blessings on the King and went away. Then Sharrkan turned to his attendants and said, \"Begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds.\" So they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands, and he commanded the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride. Hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls; and the subjects ate till they were satisfied. Moreover, Sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of Damascus and they were present, together with every slave girl of the King and of the notables who knew how to sing. And they went up to the palace in one body. When the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles, right and left, from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace; and the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees marched past before King Sharrkan, whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her, but found she needed no adornment. Meantime King Sharrkan went to the Hammam and coming out, sat down on his seat of estate, whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses: after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights. Then Sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead;[FN#299] and she at once conceived by him and, when she announced it, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception. On the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne, and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy. Then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, saying that he had bought him a damsel, who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge. Moreover he wrote, \"There is no help but that I send her to Baghdad to visit my brother Zau al-Makan and my sister Nuzhat al-Zaman. I have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me.\" And he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the Wazir Dandan and all the Emirs. Then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month, after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence. Sharrkan took it and read as follows, \"After the usual Bismillah, this is from the afflicted distracted man, from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, to his son Sharrkan. Know that, since thy departure from me, the place is become contracted upon me, so that no longer I have power of patience nor can I keep my secret: and the cause thereof is as follows. It chanced that when I went forth to hunt and course Zau al-Makan sought my leave to fare Hijaz wards, but I, fearing for him the shifts of fortune, forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after. My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-eighth night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman wrote in his letter, \"My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month, and when I returned I found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth. When I knew this, the wide world narrowed on me, O my son! but I awaited the return of the caravan, hoping that haply they would come back with it. Accordingly, when the palmers appeared I asked concerning the twain, but they could give me no news of them; so I donned mourning for them, being heavy at heart, and in sleep I have no part and I am drowned in the tears of my eyes.\" Then he wrote in verse,\n\n\"That pair in image quits me not one single hour, * Whom in my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     heart's most honourable place I keep:\nSans hope of their return I would not live one hour, * Without my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dreams of them I ne'er would stretch me in sleep.\"\n\nThe letter went on, \"And after the usual salutations to thee and thine, I command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us.\" When Sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister. Then he took the missive and went in with it to Nuzhat al-Zaman who knew not that he was her brother, nor he that she was his sister, albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery. Allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter, whereupon she sent for Sharrkan and seeing him she said to him, \"This is thy daughter: name her as thou wilt.\" Quoth he, \"It is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth.[FN#300]\" Then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw, hung about its neck, a jewel, which he knew at once for one of those which Princess Abrizah had brought from the land of the Greeks. Now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well, his senses fled and wrath seized on him; his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at Nuzhat al- Zaman and said to her, \"Whence hadst thou this jewel, O slave girl?\" When she heard this from Sharrkan she replied, \"I am thy lady, and the lady of all in thy palace! Art thou not ashamed to say to me Slave girl? I am a Queen, daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman.\" Hearing this, he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Sixty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards, for he knew that she was his sister by the same father. Then he lost his senses; and, when he revived, he abode in amazement, but did not discover his identity to her and asked, O my lady, say, art thou in sooth the daughter of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman?\" \"Yes,\" answered she; and he continued, \"Tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave.\" So she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end, how she had left her brother sick in the Sanctified City, Jerusalem, and how the Badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader. When Sharrkan heard this, he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself, \"How can I have my sister to wife? By Allah, needs must I marry her to one of my chamberlains; and, if the thing get wind, I will declare that I divorced her before consummation and married her to my Chief Chamberlain.\" Then he raised his head and sighing said, \"O Nuzhat al-Zaman, thou art my very sister and I cry: 'I take refuge with Allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen,' for I am Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman.\" She looked at him and knew he spoke the truth; and, becoming as one demented, she wept and buffeted her face, exclaiming, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! Verily have we fallen into mortal sin![FN#301] What shall I do and what shall I say to my father and my mother when they ask me, Whence hadst thou thy daughter?\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"It were meetest that I marry thee to my Chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house, that none may know thou be my sister. This hath befallen us from Almighty Allah for a purpose of his own, and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this Chamberlain, ere any know.\" Then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him, \"What wilt thou call the girl?\" \"Call her Kuzia Fak\u00e1n,\"[FN#302] answered he. Then he gave the mother in marriage to the Chief Chamberlain, and transferred her to his house with the child, which they reared on the laps of the slave girls, and fed with milk and dosed with powders. Now all this occurred whilst the brother, Zau al-Makan, still tarried with the Fireman at Damascus. One day there came to King Sharrkan a courier from his father, with a letter which he took and read and found therein, \"After the Bismillah know, O beloved King, that I am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children: sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me. I send thee this letter that, as soon as thou receivest it, thou make ready the monies and the tribute, and send them to us, together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife; for I long to see her and hear her discourse; more especially because there hath come to us from Roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins, endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know; and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend; for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments. As soon as I saw them I loved them, and I wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand; for none of the Kings owneth the like of them; so I asked the old woman their price and she answered, 'I will not sell them but for the tribute of Damascus.' And I, by Allah, did not hold this price exorbitant, indeed it is but little, for each one of them is worth the whole valuation. So I agreed to that and took them into my palace, and they remain in my possession. Wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country; and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors; and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of Baghdad.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar son of Al-Nu'uman said in his letter, \"And send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of Baghdad.\" As soon as Sharrkan knew the contents, he went in to his brother in law and said to him, \"Bring the damsel to whom I married thee;\" and when she came he showed her the letter and said, \"O my sister! what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter?\" Replied she, \"Seek advice from thyself!\" and presently added (for she yearned after her people and her native land), \"Send me together with my husband the Chamberlain, to Baghdad, that I may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the Badawi who sold me to the merchant, and that I also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the Chamberlain, after setting me free.\" \"Be it so,\" replied Sharrkan. Then Sharrkan took his daughter, Kuzia Fakan, and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs, and he made ready the tribute in haste, bidding the Chamberlain travel with the Princess and the treasure to Baghdad. He also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife. And the Chamberlain replied, \"To hear is to obey.\" Moreover Sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the Chamberlain; then he bade farewell to his sister, after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold; and she and her husband set out for Baghdad the same night. Now it so happened that Zau al-Makan and his friend the Fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were, to see the spectacle, and they beheld camels and Bukhti[FN#303] dromedaries and b\u00e2t-mules and torches and lanterns alight; and Zau al-Makan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of Damascus going to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of the City of Baghdad. He then asked, \"Who be the leader of the caravan?\" and they answered, \"The Head Chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science.\" Thereupon Zau al-Makan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land, and he said to the Stoker, \"I will join this caravan and, little by little, will journey homewards.\" Quoth the Fireman, \"I would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the Holy City to Damascus, then how shall I be sure of thy safety when thou farest for Baghdad? But I will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object.\" \"With joy and good will,\" answered Zau al-Makan. Then the Fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt; and, when all was prepared, he awaited the passage of the caravan. And presently the Chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him. Then Zau al-Ma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion, \"Do thou mount with me.\" But he replied, \"Not so: I will be thy servant.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"There is no help for it but thou ride awhile.\" \"'Tis well,\" quoth the Stoker; \"I will ride when I grow tired.\" Then said Zau al-Makan, \"O my brother, soon shalt thou see how I will deal with thee, when I come to my own folk.\" So they fared on till the sun rose and,When it was the hour of the noonday sleep[FN#304] the Chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels. Then he gave the signal for departure and, after five days, they came to the city of Ham\u00e1h,[FN#305] where they set down and made a three days' halt;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they halted in the city of Hamah three days; they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city. Here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province Diy\u00e1r Bakr. Here blew on them the breezes of Baghdad, and Zau al-Makan bethought him of his father and mother and native land, and how he was returning to his sire without his sister: so he wept and sighed and complained, and his regrets grew on him, and he began improvising these couplets,\n\n\"Sweetheart! How long must I await by so long suffering teed? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide:\nAh me! in very sooth our meeting time was short enow: * Would\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Heaven shorter prove to me the present parting-tide!\nNow trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    How wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste I hide:\nWhen say they 'Comfort take for loss of love' I but reply * 'By\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Allah, till the Day of Doom no comfort shall betide!' \"\n\nThereupon said to him the Fireman, \"Leave this weeping and wailing, for we are near the Chamberlain's tent.\" Quoth Zau al- Makan, \"Needs must I recite somewhat of verse; haply it may quench the fire of my heart.\" \"Allah upon thee,\" cried the other, \"cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country; then do what thou wilt, and I will be with thee wherever thou art.\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"By Allah! I cannot forbear from this!\" Then he turned his face towards Baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place, and Nuzhat al-Zaman could not sleep that night, but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept. And while she was in tears, he heard Zau al-Makan weeping and improvising the following distichs,\n\n'Al-Yaman's[FN#306] leven-gleam I see, * And sore despair\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    despaireth me\nFor friend who erst abode wi' me * Crowning my cup with gladdest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   gree:\nIt minds me o' one who jilted me * To mourn my bitter liberty.\nSay sooth, thou fair sheet lightning! shall * We meet once more\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   in joy and glee?\nO blamer! spare to me thy blame * My Lord hath sent this dule to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dree,\nOf friend who left me, fain to flee; * Of Time that breeds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    calamity:\nAll bliss hath fled the heart of me * Since Fortune proved mine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    enemy.\nHe[FN#307] brimmed a bowl of merest pine, * And made me drain the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dregs, did he:\nI see me, sweetheart, dead and gone * Ere I again shall gaze on\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   thee.\nTime! prithee bring our childhood back, * Restore our happy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    infancy,\nWhen joy and safety 'joyed we * From shafts that now they shoot\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    at me!\nWho aids the hapless stranger wight, * That nights in fright and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    misery,\nThat wastes his days in lonely grief, * For 'Time's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Delight'[FN#308] no more must be?\nDoomed us despite our will to bear * The hands of base bores cark\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and care.\"\n\nWhen he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit. This is how it fared with him; but as regards Nuzhat al- Zaman, when she heard that voice in the night, her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the Chief Eunuch, who said to her, \"What is thy will?\" Quoth she, \"Arise and bring me him who recited verses but now.\" Replied he, \"Of a truth I did not hear him\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat Al-Zaman heard her brother reciting, she called the Chief Eunuch and said to him, \"Go, fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry!\" Replied he, \"Of a truth I heard him not and I wot him not and folks are all sleeping.\" But she said, \"Whomsoever thou seest awake, he is the reciter.\" So he went, yet found none on wake save the Stoker; for Zau al-Makan was still insensible, and when his companion saw the Eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him. Then said the Eunuch, \"Art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him?\" The Stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter; and, being afraid, he replied, \"By Allah, 'twas not I!\" Rejoined the Eunuch, \"Who then was the reciter?: point him out to me. Thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake.\" The Fireman feared for Zau al- Makan and said in himself, \"Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt\"; so he answered, \"By Allah, I know not who it was.\" Said the Eunuch, \"By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou! So needs must thou know him.\" \"By Allah,\" replied the Fireman, \"I tell thee the truth!: some passer by, some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake; Allah requite him!\" Quoth the Eunuch, \"If thou happen upon him, point him out to me and I will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady's litter[FN#309] or do thou take him with thine own hand.\" Said the Fireman, \"Go thou back and I will bring him to thee.\" So the Eunuch left him and went his ways; and, going in to his mistress, told her all this and said to her, \"None knoweth who it was; it must have been some passer by, some wayfarer.\" And she was silent. Meanwhile, Zau al-Makan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle Heavens; the breath of the dawn breeze[FN#310] breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness; so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses, when the Fire man asked him, \"What wilt thou do?\" Answered Zau al-Makan, \"I have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry, that I may quench therewith the fire of my heart.\" Quoth the other, \"Thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint, and how I escaped death only by beguiling the Eunuch.\" \"Tell me what happened,\" quoth Zau al-Makan. Replied the Stoker, \"Whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an Eunuch, with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand, who took to looking in all the people's faces, as they lay asleep, and asked me who it was recited the verses, finding none awake but myself. I told him in reply it was some passerby, some wayfarer; so he went away and Allah delivered me from him; else had he killed me. But first he said to me, 'If thou hear him again, bring him to us.'\" When Zau al-Makan heard this he wept and said, \"Who is it would forbid me to recite? I will surely recite, befal me what may; for I am near mine own land and care for none.\" Rejoined the Fireman, \"Thy design is naught save to lose thy life;\" and Zau al-Makan retorted, \"Needs must I recite verses.\" \"Verily,\" said the Stoker, \"needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place, albeit;I had intended not to leave thee, till I had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father. Thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and I have never harmed thee in aught. What ails thee, then, that thou must needs recite verses, seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep, for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue?\" But Zau al-Makan answered, \"I will not be turned away from my purpose.\"[FN#311] Then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  * Cry thou for an answer, belike reply to thee shall be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sped:\nIf the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch * Wi'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   repine; and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed:\nIf the snake of the sand dunes hiss, I shall marvel not at all!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * Let him bite so I bite those beauteous lips of the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   luscious red:\nO Eden, my soul hath fled in despite of the maid I love: * Had I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   lost hope of Heaven my heart in despair were dead.\"\nAnd he also improvised the two following distichs,\n\n\"We were and were the days enthralled to all our wills, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site:\nWho shall restore the home of the beloved, where showed * Light\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    of the Place for aye conjoined with Time's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Delight?''[FN#312]\n\nAnd as he ceased his verses, he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the Fireman rose and covered him. When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard the first improvisation, she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home; then she wept and cried at the Eunuch and said to him, \"Woe to thee! He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by. By Allah, an thou fetch him not to me, I will assuredly rouse the Chamberlain on thee, and he shall beat thee and cast thee out. But take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently, and do him no hurt. If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is. Return quickly and linger not.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman sent the Eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said, \"Beware how thou come back to me and report, I could not find him.\" So the Eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents, but found none awake, all being asleep for weariness, till he came to the Stoker and saw him sitting up, with his head uncovered. So he drew near and seizing him by the hand, said to him, \"It was thou didst recite the verses!\" The Fireman was afeard for his life and replied, \"No, by Allah, O chief of the people, it was not I!\" But the Eunuch said, \"I will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses, for I dread returning to my lady without him.\" Now when the Fireman heard these words he feared for Zau al-Makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the Eunuch, \"By Allah, it was not I, and I know him not. I only heard some passer by, some wayfarer, recite verses: so do not thou commit sin on me, for I am a stranger and come from the Holy City of Jerusalem; and Abraham, the friend of Allah, be with you all.\" \"Rise up and fare with me,\" rejoined the Eunuch, \"and tell my lady this with thine own mouth, for I have seen none awake save thyself.\" Quoth the Stoker, \"Hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where I now am, and dost thou not know my station? Thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him. So go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry, whether he be near or far, it will be I or some one I know, and thou shalt not learn of him but by me.\" Then he kissed the Eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away; but the Castrato fetched a round and, returning secretly, came and stood behind the Fireman, fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings. As soon as he was gone, the Stoker arose and aroused Zau al-Makan and said to him, \"Come, sit up, that I may tell thee what hath happened.\" So Zau al-Makan sat up, and his companion told him what had passed, and he answered, \"Let me alone; I will take no heed of this and I care for none, for I am mine own country.\"[FN#313] Quoth the Stoker, \"Why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil? If thou fear no one, I fear for thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land. Indeed, I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned. Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her? Belike, she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home, and this is the second time she hath sent the Eunuch to look for thee.\" However Zau al-Makan paid no heed to the Fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets,\n\n\"I fly the carper's injury,* Whose carping sorely vexeth me:\nHe chides and taunts me, wotting not * He burns me but more\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    grievously.\nThe blamer cries 'He is consoled!' * I say, 'My own dear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    land[FN#314] to see:'\nThey ask, 'Why be that land so dear?' * I say, 'It taught me in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    love to be:'\nThey ask, 'What raised its dignity?' * I say, 'What made my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    ignomy:'\nWhate'er the bitter cup I drain, * Far be fro' me that land to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     flee:\nNor will I bow to those who blame, * And for such love would deal\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     me shame.\n\nHardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion, when the Eunuch (who had heard him from his hiding place at his head) came up to him; whereupon the Fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them. Then said the Eunuch to Zau al-Makan, \"Peace be with thee, O my lord!\" \"And on thee be peace,\" replied Zau al-Makan, \"and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!\" \"O my lord,\" continued the Eunuch\u2014-And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Eunuch said to Zau al-Makan, \"O my lord, I have sought thee these several times this night, for my mistress biddeth thee to her.\" Quoth Zau al- Makan, \"And who be this bitch that seeketh for me? Allah curse her and curse her husband with her!\"[FN#315] And he began to revile the Eunuch, who could make him no answer, because his mistress had charged him to do Zau al-Makan no hurt, nor bring him save of his own especial free will; and, if he would not accompany him, to give him the thousand diners. So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, \"O my lord, take this purse and go with me. We will do thee no upright, O my son, nor wrong thee in aught; but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress, to receive her answer and return in weal and safety: and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news.\" When Zau al- Makan heard this, he arose and went with the Eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk, stepping over them; whilst the Fireman followed after them from afar, and kept his eye upon him and said to himself, \"Alas the pity of his youth! Tomorrow they will hang him.\" And he ceased not following them till he approached their station,[FN#316] without any observing him. Then he stood still and said, \"How base it will be of him, if he say it was I who bade him recite the verses!\" This was the case of the Stoker; but as regards what befel Zau al-Makan, he ceased not walking with the Eunuch till he reached his station and the Castrato went in to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said, \"O my lady, I have brought thee him whom thou soughtest, and he is a youth, fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding.\" When she heard this, her heart fluttered and she cried, \"Let him recite some verses, that I may hear him near hand, and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land.\" Then the Eunuch went out to Zau al-Makan and said to him, \"Recite what verses thou knowest, for my lady is here hard by, listening to thee, and after I will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition.\" Replied he, \"With love and gladness but, an thou ask my name, it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste. I have a story, the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown, and behold, I am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself; one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind, being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought.\" When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard this, she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing, and said to the Eunuch, \"Ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father.\" The Castrato asked as she bade him, and Zau al-Makan replied, \"Yes, I have parted from every one I loved: but the dearest of all to me was my sister, from whom Fate hath separated me.\" When Nuzhat al- Zaman heard this, she exclaimed, \"Allah Almighty reunite him with what he loveth!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat al-Zaman heard his words she said, \"Allah reunite him with what he loveth!\" Then quoth she to the Eunuch, \"Tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country.\" The Eunuch did so, and Zau al-Makan sighed heavily and began repeating these couplets,[FN#317]\n\n\"Is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest? * The house\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    that hometh Hinda be forever blest'\nHer love all levels; man can reck of naught beside; * Naught or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   before or after can for man have zest\n'Tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris * That day\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   when Hinda's footstep on its face is prest:\nHail to the beauty of our camp, the pride of folk, * The dearling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   who en' Slaves all hearts by her behest:\nAllah on 'Time's Delight' send large dropped clouds that teem *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   With genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast.\"\nAnd also these,\n\n\"I vow to Allah if at home I sight * My sister Nuzhat al-Zamani\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   highs\nI'll pass the days in joyance and delight * Mid bashful minions,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     maidens soft and white:\nTo sound of harps in various modes they smite * Draining the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bowl, while eyes rain lively light\n'Neath half closed lids, a sipping lips red bright * By stream\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    bank flowing through my garden site.\"\n\nWhen he had finished his verse, Nuzhat al-Zaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him. As soon as her eyes fell on his face, she knew him for certain and cried out, \"O my brother! O Zau al-Makan!\" He also looked at her and knew her and cried out, \"O my sister! O Nuzhat al-Zaman!\" Then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit. When the Eunuch saw this case, he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them, waited till they should recover. After a while they came to themselves, and Nuzhat al-Zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy: oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her, and she repeated these verses,\n\n\"Time sware my life should fare in woeful waste; * Forsworn art\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Time, expiate thy sin in haste![FN#318]\nComes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid; * To him who brings\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   good news, rise, gird thy waist\nI spurned old world tales of Eden bliss; * Till came I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Kausar[FN#319] on those lips\n\nWhen Zau al-Makan heard this, he pressed his sister to his breast; tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these couplets,[FN#320]\n\n\"Long I lamented that we fell apart, * While tears repentant\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    railed from these eyne;\nAnd sware, if Time unite us twain once more, * 'Severance' shall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    never sound from tongue of mine:\nJoy hath so overwhelmed me that excess * Of pleasure from mine\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    eyes draws gouts of brine:\nTears, O mine eyes, have now become your wont * Ye weep for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    pleasure and you weep for pine!\"\n\nThey sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him, \"Come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee, and I will tell thee what happened to me.\" So they entered and Zau al-Maken said, \"Do thou begin thy tale.\" Accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the Khan and what had happened to her with the Badawi; how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother Sharrkan and had sold her to him; how he had freed her at the time of buying; how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the King, their sire, had sent and asked for her from Sharrkan. Then quoth she, \"Praised be Allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that, even as we left our father together, so together shall we return to him!\" And she added, \"Of a truth my brother Sharrkan gave me in marriage to this Chamberlain that he might carry me to my father. And this is what befel me from first to last; so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since I left thee.\" Thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end; and how Allah vouchsafed to send the Fireman to him, and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day. She praised the Stoker for this and Zau al-Makan added, \"Of a truth, O my sister, this Fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son, for that he fasted and gave me to eat, and he walked whilst he made me ride; and I owe my life to him.\" Said she, \"Allah willing, we will requite him for all this, according to our power.\" Then she called the Eunuch, who came and kissed Zau al- Makan's hand, and she said, \"Take thy reward for glad tidings, O face of good omen! It was thy hand reunited me with my brother; so the purse I gave thee and all in it are thine. But now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me.\" The Castrato rejoiced and, going in to the Chamberlain, him to his mistress. Accordingly, he came in to his wife and finding Zau al-Makan with her, asked who he was. So she told him all that had befallen them both, first and last, and added, \"Know, O Chamberlain, that thou hast married no slave girl; far from it, thou hast taken to wife the daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman for I am Nuzhat al- Zaman, and this is my brother, Zau al-Makan.\" When the Chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth, and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become King Omar bin al-Nu'uman's son in law, so he said to himself, \" 'Twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province.\"[FN#321] Then he went up to Zau al-Makan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister, and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride. Thereupon said Nuzhat al-Zaman, \"We are now near our country and I would be left alone with my brother, that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach Baghdad; for we have been parted a long, long time.\" \"Be it as thou biddest,\" replied the Chamberlain, and, going forth from them, sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats, together with three suits of the costliest for Zau al-Makan. Then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and Nuzhat al-Zaman said to him, \"Bid the Eunuch bring me the Fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening, and let him be forbidden to leave us.\" The Chamberlain called the Castrato and charged him to do accordingly; so he replied, \"I hear and I obey;\" and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the Stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan, girthing his ass and preparing for flight. The tears were running adown his cheeks, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan; and he was saying to himself, \"Indeed, I warned him for the love of Allah, but he would not listen to me; Oh would I knew what is become of him!\" Ere he had done speaking the Eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him The Fireman turned and seeing the Eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself, saying, \"Oh would I knew what is become of him!\"; ere he had done speaking the Castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried, \"Verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices I have done him! I believe he hath denounced me to the Eunuch (hence these pages et about me) and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime.\" Then the effeminated one cried at him, saying, \"Who was it recited the verses? O liar! why didst thou say, 'I never repeated these couplets, nor do I know who repeated them;' when it was thy companion? But now I will not leave thee between this place and Baghdad, and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee.\" Quoth the Fireman, \"What I feared hath befallen me.\" And he repeated this couplet,\n\n\"'Twas as I feared the coming ills discerning: * But unto Allah we are all returning.\"\n\nThen the Eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, \"Take him off the ass.\" So they carried him along with the caravan, surrounded by the pages, as the white contains the black of the eye; and the Castrato said to them, \"If a hair of him be lost, you will be lost with it.\" And he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him. But when the Stoker saw himself beset by the pages, he despaired of his life and turning to the Eunuch, said to him, \"O Chief, I am neither this youth's brother nor am I akin to him, nor is he sib to me; but I was a Fireman in a Hammam and found him cast out, in his sickness, on the dung heap.\" Then the caravan fared on and the Stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things, whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing, but said to him, \"Thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses, thou and this youth: but fear nothing for thy self;\" and kept laughing at him the while to himself. Whenever the caravan halted, they served him with food, and he and the Castrato ate from one dish.[FN#322] Then the Eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and, after drinking himself, gave it to the Fireman, who drank; but all the while his tears never dried, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood. So they both travelled on with the caravan, whilst the Chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter, in attendance on Zau al-Makan and his sister, and now gave an eye to the Fireman; and Nuzhat al-Zaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence; and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from Baghdad. Here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed; and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts, behold, there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night.[FN#323] Thereupon the Chamberlain cried out to them, \"Stay, and your loading delay!\"; then, mounting with his Mamelukes, rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud. When they drew near, suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea, with flags and standards, drums and kettledrums, horsemen and footmen. The Chamberlain marvelled at this; and when the troops saw him, there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers, who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them, five for one; whereupon said he to them, \"What is the matter and what are these troops, that ye do this with us?\" Asked they, \"Who art thou; and whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?\" and he answered, \"I am the Chamberlain of the Emir of Damascus, King Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and I bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad.\" When the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept, saying, \"In very sooth King Omar is dead and he died not but of poison. So fare ye forwards; no harm shall befal you till you join his Grand Wazir, Dandan.\" Now when the Chamberlain heard this, he wept sore and exclaimed, \"Oh for our disappointment in this our journey!\" Then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the Wazir Dandan, who granted an interview and called a halt and, causing his pavilion to be pitched, sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the Chamberlain. Then he bade him be seated and questioned him; and he replied that he was Chamberlain to the Emir of Damascus and was bound to King Omar with presents and the tribute of Syria. The Wazir, hearing the mention of King Omar's name, wept and said, \"King Omar is dead by poison, and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him, until they were like to slay one another on this account; but the notables and grandees and the four Kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them. So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over his father's realm. And amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet, Zau Al-Makan, for, quoth they, his name be Light of the Place, and he hath a sister Nuzhat al-Zaman highs, the Delight of the Time; but they set out five years ago for Al-Hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them.\" When the Chamberlain heard this, he knew; that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures; and he grieved with sore grief for the death of King Omar, albeit he joyed with exceeding joy, especially at the arrival of Zau al-Makan, for that he would now become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan's Chamberlain heard of the death of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman he mourned, but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother Zau al-Makan who would become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead. So he turned to the Wazir Dandan and said to him, \"Verily your tale is a wonder of wonders! Know, O Chief Wazir, that here, where you have encountered me, Allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions, for that His Almighty Will restoreth to you Zau al-Makan and his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman; whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can.\" When the Minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said, \"O Chamberlain, tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence.\" So he repeated to him the whole story and told him that Nuzhat al-Zaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of Zau al-Makan from first to last. As soon as he had ended his tale, the Wazir sent for the Emirs and Wazirs and Chief Officers and acquainted them with the matter; whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance. Then they gathered in a body and went in to the Chamberlain and did their service to him, kissing the ground between his hands; and the Wazir Dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour. After this, the Chamberlain held on that day a Divan council; and he and the Wazir sat upon a throne, whilst all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State took their places before them, according to their several ranks.[FN#324] Then they melted sugar in rose water and drank, after which the Emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely, till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them. So the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting, rode onwards, preceded by the standards of war. When the grandees had finished their conference, they took horse and rejoined the host; and the Chamberlain approached the Wazir Dandan and said, \"I deem it well to ride on before you, and precede you, that I may get ready a place for the Sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as Sultan over the head of his brother Sharrkan.\" \"Aright thou reckest,\" answered the Wazir Then the Chamberlain rose up in haste and Dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents, which he conjured him to accept. In similar guise did all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State, bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him, \"Haply thou wilt mention our case to Sultan Zau al-Makan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities.\"[FN#325] The Chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march, whereupon the Wazir Dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city. And they did his bidding. Then the Chamberlain mounted and rode forward, full of joy and saying to himself, \"How blessed is this gurney!\", and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes, she and her brother Zau al-Makan. They made all haste over their wayfare, till they reached a place distant a day's journey from Baghdad, where the Chamberlain called a halt for rest, and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the Sultan Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, while he rode forward with his Mamelukes and, alighting at a distance from Nuzhat al-Zaman's litter, commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence. They did so and she gave permission; whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother; and told them of the death of their father; and of Zau al-Makan, how the heads of the people had made him King over them in the stead of his sire; and he gave them joy of the kingdom. They both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed; but the Chamberlain answered, \"The news rests with the Wazir Dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host; and it only remaineth for thee, O King, to do what they counsel, since they have unanimously chosen thee Sultan; for if thou do not this, they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another Sultan. Haply he will kill thee, or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both.\" Zau al-Makan bowed his head awhile and then said, \"I accept this position;\" for indeed there was no refusing; and he was certified that the Chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way. Then he added, \"O my uncle, how shall I do with my brother Sharrkan?\" \"O my son,\" replied the Chamberlain, \"thy brother will be Sultan of Damascus and thou Sultan of Baghdad; so take heart of grace and get ready thy case.\" Zau al-Makan accepted this and the Chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger[FN#326] of state, which the Wazir Dandan had brought with him; then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion, wherein the Sultan might sit to receive the Emirs and Grandees. Moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs. They did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round. After awhile, the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of Baghdad and Khorasan, a conquering host like the full tide sea.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their Sultan, they planted a splendid Sh\u00e1hmiy\u00e1nah[FN#327] befitting Kings. And as they ended their labours behold, a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host; and presently it appeared that this was the army of Baghdad and Khorasan preceded by the Wazir Dandan. And in it all rejoiced at the accession of the \"Light of the Place.\" Now Zau al-Makan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state: so the Chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the Mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot, to do him service, and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion, where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs, whilst the Chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the Shahmiyanah, with drawn swords in their hands. Presently, up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the Chamberlain went in to Zau al-Makan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them, ten by ten. The Chamberlain acquainted them with the King's commands, to which they replied, \"We hear and we obey;\" and all drew up before the pavilion entrance. Then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of Sultan Zau al-Makan, whom when they saw, they were awed; but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good. So they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked Allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew. Then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers; and they ceased not to enter, ten by ten, till none was left but the Wazir Dandan. Lastly the Minister went in and kissed the ground before Zau al-Makan, who rose to meet him, saying, \"Welcome, O Wazir and sire sans peer! Verily, thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear, and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the Subtle of Lere.\" Then bade he the Chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto. So they came and ate and drank. Moreover the Sultan commanded his Wazir Dandan call a ten days' halt of the army, that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain. The Wazir obeyed the commands of the Sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said, \"This needs must be!\" He then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days. They did as he bade them and, moreover, he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the King for service during the space of three days. Then the Wazir went to the Sultan and reported all to him, and Zau al-Makan waited until nightfall, when he went in to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman and asked her, \"Dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not?\" \"I have no knowledge of the cause,\" she answered, and drew a silken curtain before herself, whilst Zau al-Makan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the Wazir to the presence and, when he came, said to him, \"I desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman!\" \"Know then, O King,\" replied Dandan, \"that King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, when he returned to Baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city, enquired for thee and thy sister, but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the Pilgrimage; whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered, and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year, seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings. Now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight, lo! there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied by five damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, to crown their perfections of comeliness, they could read the Koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples. Then that old woman sought audience of the King, and he bade admit her; whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands. I was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him. And when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King, that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection. They read the Koran\u2014and the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races. They stand here between thy hands to do thee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised. 'Thy father, who hath found mercy;[FN#328] looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him; so he said to them, Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!'\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said unto King Zau al-Makan, \"Thy father, who hath found mercy, glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them, 'Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!' Thereupon one of them came forward and, kissing the ground before him, spake as follows[FN#329] 'Know, O King, that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies, and observe the Divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins; and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who, if he stray therefrom, falleth into perdition; for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour. And know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting, and the right way thereto is the service of Allah. Wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people: and swerve not from this canon, for the mightier men are in dignity, the more their need of prudence and foresight; and indeed Monarchs need this more than the many, for the general cast themselves into affairs, without taking thought to the issue thereof. Be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of Allah, and know that, if an enemy dispute with thee, thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him; but as for thy friend, there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing. Choose, therefore, thy friend for thyself, after thou hast proved him. If he be of the brotherhood of futurity,[FN#330] let him be zealous in observing the externals of the Holy Law and versed in its inner meaning, as far as may be; and if he be of the brotherhood of the world, let him be free born, sincere, neither a fool nor a perverse, for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him, and a liar cannot be a true friend. Indeed the word, Sidd\u00edk[FN#331] ('friend') deriveth from Sidk ('truth') that welleth up from the bottom of the heart; and how can this be the case, when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue? And know, that the observance of the Law profiteth him who practiseth it: so love thy brother, if he be of this quality and do not cast him off, even if thou see in him that which irketh thee, for a friend is not I like a wife, whom one can divorce and re-marry: nay, his heart is like glass: once broken, it may not be mended. And Allah bless him who saith,\n\n'Ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart; * 'Tis hard to win\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     thee back the heart offended:\nFor hearts indeed, whence love is alien made, * Like broken glass\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     may nevermore be mended.'\n\nThe maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say, 'The best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel; the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence, and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men. It is also said, 'It behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking Allah especially for two favours, health and reason.' Again it is said, 'Whoso honoureth himself, his lust is a light matter to him, and he who maketh much of his small troubles, Allah afflicteth him with the greater; he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend. He who thinketh well of thee, do thou fulfill his thought of thee. He who exceedeth in contention sinneth, and he who against upright standeth not on ward, is not safe from the sword. Now will I tell thee somewhat of the duties of Kazis and judges. Know, O King, that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive, and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level, to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice. Furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant; and mediation is admissible between Moslems, except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful.[FN#332] If thou shalt have done aught during the day, of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved, thou (O Kazi) shouldst revert to the right, for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong. Then (O judge) thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors, withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to Allah (be He extolled and exalted!). And require thou proof of the complainant, and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it; and if not, put the defendant to his oath; for this is the ordinance of Allah. Receive thou the testimony of competent Moslem witnesses, one against other, for Almighty Allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals, He Himself taking charge of the inner and secret things. It behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet, whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger,[FN#333] and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of Allah Almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself, Allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people.' Quoth al-Zuhri,[FN#334] 'There are three things for which, if they be found in a Kazi, he should be deposed; namely, if he honour the base, if he love praise and if he fear dismissal. And Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once deposed a Kazi, who asked him, 'Why hast thou dismissed me? It hath reached me,' answered Omar, 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition.' It is said also that Iskandar[FN#335] said to his Kazi, 'I have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness; so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding.' To his Cook he said, 'Thou art the Sultan of my body; so look thou tender it as thine own self.' To his Secretary he said, 'Thou art the controller of my wit: so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me.'\" Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eightieth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, \"Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and, kissing the ground seven times before the King thy father, spake as follows, 'The sage Lukm\u00e1n[FN#336] said to his son, 'There be three who are known only in three several cases; the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath, the brave only in battle, and thy friend in time of need.' It is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised, and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed. Quoth Allah Almighty,[FN#337] 'Assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape reckoning of punishment: indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty.' And he said[FN#338] (on whom be salvation and salutation!), 'Works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth.' He said also, 'In the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound, and which being unsound the whole is unsound.' And this is the heart. Now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man, since it is that which ordereth his whole affair: If covetise stir in it, desire destroyeth him, and if affliction master it, anguish slayeth him; if anger rage in it, danger is hard upon him; if it be blest with contentment, he is safe from discontent; if fear surprise it, he is full of mourning; and if calamity overtake it, affliction betideth him. If a man gain the use of wealth, peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his Lord; if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe, or if disquietude waste his heart, weakness causeth him to fall. Thus, in any case, nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of Allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next. It was asked of a certain sage, 'Who is the most ill conditioned of men?'; and he answered, 'The man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high, so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth; and how excellently saith the poet,\n\nFreest am I of all mankind fro' meddling wight * Who, seeing\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    others err, self error ne'er can sight:\nRiches and talents are but loans to creature lent, * Each wears\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite:\nIf by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make, * Thou shalt go\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    wrong and if the door be right, go right!'\n\nContinued the maiden, 'As for anecdotes of devotees, quoth Hisham bin Bashar, 'I asked Omar bin Ubayd, What is true piety?'; and he answered, 'The Apostle of Allah (to whom be salutation and salvation!) hath explained it when he sayeth, The pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away; who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead.' And it is related that Abu Zarr[FN#339] used to say, Want is dearer to me than wealth, and unheal is dearer to me than health.' Quoth one of the listeners, 'May Allah have mercy on Abu Zarr!'. For my part, I say, 'Whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of Almighty Allah should be content with that condition which Allah hath chosen for him.' Quoth one of the Companions of the Prophet, 'Ibn Abi Aufa[FN#340] once prayed with us the dawn prayer. When he had done, he recited, 'O Thou Enwrapped!'[FN#341] till he came to where Allah saith, 'When there shall be a trumping on the trumpet,' and fell down dead. It is said that Sabit al-Banani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes. They brought him a man to medicine him who said to him, 'I will cure thee, provided thou obey my bidding' Asked Sabit, 'In what matter?' Quoth the leach, 'In that thou leave weeping!' 'What is the worth of mine eyes?', rejoined Sabit, 'if they do not weep?' Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, 'Exhort thou me!'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, \"Thus spake the second hand maid to the King who hath found mercy, Omar bin al-Nu'uman. 'Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, Exhort thou me!' 'I exhort thee,' replied he, 'to be a self ruler, an abstainer in this world, and in the next a greedy slave.' 'How so?' asked the other and Mohammed answered, 'The abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come.' And quoth Ghaus bin Abdillah, 'There were two brothers among the sons of Israel, one of whom said to the other, 'What be the most perilous[FN#342] thing thou hast done?' Replied the brother, 'I once came upon a nest of young birds; so I took out one and threw it back into the nest; but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it. This is the most perilous thing I ever did; now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' He rejoined, 'When I arise for prayer I am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward.' Now their father heard these words and exclaimed, 'O Allah, an say they sooth take them to Thyself!' It was declared by one of the wise men, 'Verily, these were of the most virtuous of children.' Quoth Sa'\u00edd bin Jubayr,[FN#343] 'I was once in company with Fuzalah bin 'Ubaydand said to him, 'Exhort thou me!, Replied he, 'Bear in mind these two necessaries, Shun syntheism[FN#344] and harm not any of Allah's creatures.' And he repeated these two couplets,\n\n'Be as thou wilt, for Allah still is bounteous Lord, * And care\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban\nTo two things only never draw thee nigh, nor give * Partner to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Allah trouble to thy brother man.'\nAnd how well saith the poet,\n\n'An thou of pious works a store neglect * And after death meet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     one who did collect,\nThou shalt repent thou diddest not as he, * Nor madest ready as\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     he did elect.'\n\nThen the third damsel came forward, after the second had with drawn, and said, 'Of a truth, the chapter of piety is exceeding wide; but I will mention what occurreth to me thereof, concerning the pious of old. Quoth a certain holy man, 'I congratulate myself in death, though I am not assured of rest therein, save that I know death interveneth between a man and his works; so I hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works.' And Ita'a al Salami, when he had made an end of an exhortation, was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore; and as they asked him why he did this he answered, 'I desire to enter upon a grave matter, and it is the standing up before Almighty Allah to do in accordance with my exhortation.' In similar guise Zayn al-Abid\u00edn,[FN#345] son of Al-Husayn, was wont to tremble when he rose to pray. Being asked the cause of this, he replied, 'Know ye not before whom I stand and whom I address?' It is said that there lived near Sufy\u00e1n al-Thauri[FN#346] a blind man who, when the month of Ramazan came, went out with the folk to pray,[FN#347] but remained silent and hung back. Said Sufyan, 'On the Day of Resurrection he shall come with the people of the Koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows.' Quoth Sufyan, 'Were the soul established in the heart as befitteth, it would fly away for joy and pining for Paradise, and for grief and fear of hell-fire.' It is related also of Sufyan Al-Thauri that he said, 'To look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin.' Then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth, who said, 'Here am I to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me. It is related that Bishr Barefoot[FN#348] said, 'I once heard Kh\u00e1lid say, 'Beware of secret polytheism.' I asked, 'What may secret polytheism be?'; and he answered, 'When one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity[FN#349] come upon him.' And one of the sages said, 'Doing works of weal expiateth what is ill.' Quoth Ibrahim,[FN#350] 'I supplicated Bishr Barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries; but he said, 'O my son, this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one; of every hundred five, even as the legal alms upon money.' Said Ibrahim, 'I thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while I was praying behold, Bishr was also praying: so I stood behind him[FN#351] making the prayer bow till the Mu'ezzin called his call. Then rose a man of tattered appearance and said, O folk, beware of a truth which bringeth unweal, for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal,[FN#352] and in time of need no choice we heed: speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good. Presently I saw Bishr drop a danik,[FN#353] so I picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which I gave him. Quoth he, 'I will not take it.' Quoth I, 'It is perfectly lawful change'; but he rejoined 'I cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world.' It is related also that Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal\"[FN#354]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to bespeak Zau al-Makan on this wise, \"And quoth the maiden to thy father, 'Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal and said to him, 'O Imam of the Faith, we are a family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day; and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of Baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light. Is this forbidden to us?' Asked Ahmad:'Who are thou?' 'I am the sister of Bishr Barefoot,' answered she. Rejoined the Iman, 'O household of Bishr, I shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts.' Quoth one of the sages, 'When Allah willeth well to His servant He openeth upon him the gate of action.' M\u00e1lik bin Din\u00e1r,[FN#355] when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired, was wont to say, 'O soul, take patience, for I will not accord to thee what thou desirest.' He said also (Allah accept him!), 'The salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it and its damnation in submission to it.' Quoth Mans\u00far bin Amm\u00e1r,[FN#356] 'I made a pilgrimage and was faring Meccahwards by way of Cufa, and the night was overcast, when I heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying, 'O Allah, I swear by Thy Greatness and Thy Glory, I meant not through my disobedience to transgress against Thee; for indeed I am not ignorant of Thee; but my fault is one Thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning;[FN#357] so do Thou pardon my transgression, for indeed I disobeyed Thee of my ignorance!' When he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse, 'O true believers, save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones.'[FN#358] Then I heard a fall, but not knowing what it was I passed on. When the morning morrowed, as we went our way, behold, we fell in with a funeral train, followed by an old woman whose strength had left her. I asked her of the dead, and she answered, 'This is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the Book of Allah Almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he fell dead.' Therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said, 'I here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time. Maslamah bin Din\u00e1r used to say, 'By making sound the secret thoughts, sins great and small are covered'; and, 'when the servant of Allah is resolved to leave sinning, victory cometh to him.' Also quoth he, 'Every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to Allah is a calamity, for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future.' It was asked of Ab\u00fa H\u00e1zim,[FN#359] 'Who is the most prosperous of men?'; and he answered, 'Whoso spendeth his life in submission to Allah.' The other enquired, 'And who is the most foolish of mankind?' 'Whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others,' replied Abu Hazim. It is reported of Moses[FN#360] (on whom be peace!) that when he came to the waters of Midian he exclaimed, 'O Lord, verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me.'[FN#361] And he asked of his Lord and not of his folk. There came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first. When the twain returned, they informed their father Shu'ayb (on whom be peace!) who said, 'Haply, he is hungry,' adding to one of them, 'Go back to him and bid him hither.' Now when she came to Moses, she veiled her face and said, 'My father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us.' Moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her. Now she was a woman large in the back parts, and the wind blowing upon her garment[FN#362] covered the hinder cheeks to Moses; which when Moses saw, he lowered his eyes and said to her, 'Get thee behind while I walk in front.' So she followed him till he entered the house of Shu'ayb where supper was ready.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, \"Now, quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire, 'When Moses (on whom be peace!) entered the home of Shu'ayb where supper was ready, Shu'ayb said to him, 'O Moses, I desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two.' But Moses answered, 'I am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world[FN#363] for what is on earth of gold and silver.' Then quoth Shu'ayb, 'O youth! nevertheless thou art my guest, and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him.' So Moses sat down and ate. Then Shu'ayb hired Moses for eight pilgrimages, that is to say, eight years, and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters, and Moses' service to him was to stand for her dowry. As saith the Holy Writ of him, 'Verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages: and if thou fulfil ten years, it is in thine own breast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee.'[FN#364] A certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days, 'Thou hast made me desolate, for that I have not seen thee this long while.' Quoth the other, 'I have been distracted from thee by Ibn Shih\u00e1b: dost thou know him?' Quoth his friend, 'Yes, he hath been my neighbour these thirty years, but I have never spoken to him.' He replied, 'Verily thou forgettest Allah in forgetting\u2014thy neighbour! If thou lovedst Allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour. Knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour,[FN#365] even as the right of kith and kin?' Said Huzayfah, 'We entered Meccah with Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm bin Adham, and Shak\u00edk al-Balkh\u00ed was also making a pilgrimage that year. Now we met whilst circumambulating the Ka'abah and Ibrahim said to Shakik, 'What is your fashion in your country?' Replied Shakik, 'When we are blest with our daily bread we eat, and when we hunger we take patience.' 'This wise,' said Ibrahim, 'do the dogs of Balkh; but we, when blest with plenty, do honour to Allah and when an hungered we thank Him.' And Shakik seated himself before Ibrahim and said to him, 'Thou art my master.' Also said Mohammed bin Imr\u00e1n, 'A man once asked of H\u00e1tim the Deaf[FN#366] 'What maketh thee to trust in Allah?' 'Two things,' answered he, 'I know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread, so my heart is at rest as to that; and I know that I was not created without the knowledge of Allah, and am abashed before Him.' Then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and, kissing the ground before thy father nine times, said, 'Thou hast heard, O King, what these all have spoken on the subject of piety; and I will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times. It is said that the Imam al-Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed departed the night into three portions, the first for study, the second for sleep and the third for prayer. The Imam Ab\u00fa Han\u00edfah[FN#367] was wont also to pass half the night in prayer. One\n\nday a man pointed him out to another, as he walked by and remarked, 'Yonder man watcheth the whole night.' When he heard this Abu Hanifah said, 'I was abashed before Allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me'; so after this he used to watch the whole night. And one of the Sages hath said,\n\n'Who seeketh for pearl in the Deep dives deep; * Who on high would hie robs his night of sleep.'\n\nAl-Rab\u00ed a relates that Al-Shafi'i used to recite the whole Koran seventy times during the month of Ramazan, and that in his daily prayers. Quoth Al-Shafi'i (Allah accept him!), 'During ten years I never ate my fill of barley bread, for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray.'[FN#368] It is reported of Abdullah bin Mohammed al-Sakr\u00e1 that he said, 'I was once talking with Omar and he observed to me, 'Never saw I a more God fearing or eloquent man than Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafi'i.' It so happened I went out one day with Al-H\u00e1ris bin Lab\u00edb al-Saff\u00e1r, who was a disciple of Al-Muzani[FN#369] and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the Almighty, 'This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose, nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves.'[FN#370] I saw Al-Shafi'i's colour change; his skin shuddered with horripilation, he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit When he revived he said, 'I take refuge with Allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent! O Allah, before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves, O Allah, of Thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins, adorn me with the curtain of Thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings, by the magnanimity of Thy Being!' Then I rose and went away. Quoth one of the pious, 'When I entered Baghdad, Al-Shafi'i was there. So I sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer; and behold, there passed me one who said, 'O youth, make thy Wuzu-ablution well and Allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next.' I turned and lo! there was a man behind whom came a company of people. So I hastened to finish my ablution and followed him. Presently, he turned and asked me, 'Say, dost thou want aught?' 'Yes,' answered I, 'I desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which Allah Almighty hath taught thee.' He said, 'Know then that whoso believeth in Allah shall be saved, and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction, and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world, his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death. Shall I tell thee any more?' I replied, 'Assuredly;' and he continued, 'Be thou of the world that is, heedless; and of the world to come, greediest. Be truthful in all thy dealings, and thou shalt be saved with the Salvationists.' Then he went on and I asked about him and was told that he was the Imam Al-Shafi'i. Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, 'I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine, on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, \"The old woman bespake thy sire, saying, 'The Imam Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.' He also said, 'I never disputed with any one, but I would that Almighty Allah should give him the knowledge of the Truth and aid him to dispread it: nor did I ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the Truth, and I reck not whether Allah manifest it by my tongue or by His.' He said also (whom Allah accept!), 'If thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore, then bethink thee Whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest.' It was told to Abu Han\u00edfah that the Commander of the Faithful, Ab\u00fa Ja'afar al-Mans\u00far, had appointed him Kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams; but he would not accept of this; and, when the day came on which the money was to be paid him, he prayed the dawn prayer, then covered his head with his robe\u2014and spoke not. When the Caliph's messenger came with the money, he went in to the Imam and accosted him, but he would not speak to him. So the messenger said, 'Verily this money is lawfully thine.' 'I know that it is lawfully mine,' replied he: 'but I abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart.'[FN#371] Asked the other, 'If thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them?' Answered Abu Hanifah, 'Can I look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet?' Another of Al-Shafi'i's sayings (Allah accept him!) is,\n\n'Oh soul of me, an thou accept my rede, * Thou shalt be wealthy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   and of grace entire:\nCast off ambitious hopes and vain desires, * How many a death was\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    done by vain desire!'\n\nAmong the sayings of Sufy\u00e1n al-Thaur\u00ed, with which he admonished Ali bin al-Hasan al-Salami was, 'Be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride. Be not indebted save to Him who is merciful to His debtors; and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world. Be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of Allah and in beseeching of Allah peace for what remaineth of thy life. Counsel every True Believer, when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith; and beware of betraying a Believer, for whoso betrayeth a Believer, betrayeth Allah and His Apostle. Avoid dissensions and litigation; and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt:[FN#372] so shalt thou be at peace. Enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence: so shalt thou be loved of Allah. Adorn thine inner man and Allah shall adorn thine outer man. Accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the Moslems. Draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee: so shalt thou be the friend of the Prophets. Let thine affairs, both public and private, be in Allah's charge, and fear Him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards Resurrection and Judgement stead between the hands of the Lord of Dread; and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped, either for Heavens eterne or to the Hell fires that burn.' Thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels. Now when thy father, who hath found mercy, heard their discourse, he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time; and, seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore, he showed them all favour. Moreover, he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour, and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged Princess Abrizah, daughter of the King of Greece, to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed. They abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them; and, whenever the King visited them, he found her absorbed in prayer, watching by night and fasting by day; whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me, 'O Wazir, verily this old woman is of the pious, and awe of her is strong in my heart.' Now on the eleventh day, the King visited her, that he might pay her the price of the damsels; but she said to him, 'O King, know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men; indeed I seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels, be it little or much.' Now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her, 'O my lady and what is their price?'; whereto she answered, 'I will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast, watching by night a whole month, and abstaining by day, all for the love of Allah Almighty; and, if thou do this, they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please.' So the King wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation; she was magnified in his eyes and he said, 'Allah make this pious woman to profit us!' Then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated, and she said to him, 'I will help thee with the prayers I pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water.' They brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells, and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof. Lastly she covered it with a cloth and, sealing it with her signet ring, gave it to thy sire, saying, 'When thou hast fasted the first ten days, break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet, for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith. As for me, tomorrow I will go forth to my brethren, the Invisible[FN#373] Controuls, for I yearn after them, and I will return to thee when the first ten days are past. Thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace, then locked the door and put the key in his pocket. Next day the King fasted and the old woman went her ways.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan thus continued to Zau al-Makan, \"Now when came the day for the Sultan's fast, the old woman went her ways. And after he had accomplished the ten days thereof, on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach. Within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned, bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf, like no leaf of known tree. She went in to thy sire and saluted him; and, when he saw her, he rose to her saying, 'Welcome, O pious lady!' 'O King,' quoth she, 'the Invisible Controuls salute thee, for I told them of thee, and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their Halw\u00e1,[FN#374] which is of the sweetmeats of the other world. Do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day.' The King rejoiced at this with great joy, and exclaimed, 'Praised be Allah, who hath given me brethren of the Invisible World!' Thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands; and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour. She went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said, 'Know, O King, that I told the Invisible Controuls of the love which is between me and thee, and informed them how I had left the maidens with thee, and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a King like thee; for they were wont, when they saw them, to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted. So I would fain carry them to the Invisible Controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour, and peradventure, they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth, that thou, after completing thy fast, mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee, to the extent of thy desires.' When thy sire heard her words, he thanked her for them and said, 'Except that I fear to cross thee, I would not accept the treasure or aught else; but when wilt thou set out with them?' Replied she, 'On the seven and twentieth night; and I will bring them back to thee at the head of the month, by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity; and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal. By Allah, each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom!' He said, 'I know it, O pious lady!' Then quoth the old woman, 'There is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee, that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the Invisible Controuls.' Quoth he, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blessed with two children, a girl and a boy; but they were lost; years ago. Take her with thee that she may get the blessing'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, \"Quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blest with two children, a girl and a boy, but they were lost years ago; so take her with thee, haply she may get the benediction and, belike, the Invisible Controuls will sue Allah for her that her two children may be restored to her.' 'Thou hast said well,' replied she; 'for that indeed was her grievousest want.' Thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him, 'O my son, I am going to the Invisible Controuls; so bring me Sophia.' Accordingly, he summoned her and she came forthright, and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels. Then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup, presented it to the Sultan saying, 'On the thirtieth day, do thou repair to the Hammam and when thou comest out, enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup. Then sleep, and thou shalt attain what thou seekest, and peace be with thee'! Thereat the King was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands. Quoth she, 'I commend thee to Allah's care;' whereat quoth he, 'And when shall I see thee again, O pious lady? In very sooth I love not to part with thee.' Then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the Queen; whilst the King fasted after her departure other three days, till the month ended, when he arose and went to the Hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace, commanding that none should go in to him. There, after making fast the door, he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep; and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day, but he did not come out and we said, 'Perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day; wherefore he sleepeth.' So we waited till next day; but still he did not come forth. Then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter. But nothing came of that; so at last we lifted up the door;[FN#375] and, going in, found him dead, with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken.[FN#376] When we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us, and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed, 'Whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets, and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of Kings and who debaucheth them; and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that Sharrkan, when he came to our country, seduced our Queen Abrizah; nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you. Then he[FN#377] sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her, and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts. This be no kingly deed, and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited. So do ye suspect none of having killed him, for no one slew him but the cunning witch, whose name is Zat al-Dawahi. And behold, I have taken the King's wife, Sophia, and have carried her to her father, Afridun King of Constantinople. Moreover, there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you, and ye shall be cut off even to the last man, nor shall a living soul be spared by Death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath, save he who Cross and Belt[FN#378] worshippeth.' When we read this paper, we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us: whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught. And the troops fell out as to whom they should make Sultan; some would have thee, and others would have thy brother Sharrkan; and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month, at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother Sharrkan: so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee. And such is the manner of the death of Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman!\" Now when the Wazir Dandan had made an end of his story, Zau al- Makan and his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman wept; and the Chamberlain, who wept also, said to Zau al-Makan, \"O King, weeping will avail thee naught; nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty; for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead.\" Thereupon Zau al-Makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion, and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him. And the Chamberlain sat by his side and all the armour-bearers[FN#379] behind him, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the rest of the Emirs and Grandees stood each in his individual stead. Then quoth King Zau al-Makan to the Minister Dandan, \"Inform me concerning my sire's treasures;\" and he replied, \"I hear and I obey;\" and gave him to know of the late King's hoards and monies, and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels, and acquainted him with other precious things. So Zau al-Makan opened his hand to the army, and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the Wazir Dandan, saying, \"Thou continues\" in office. Whereupon Dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life. Then he bestowed dresses on the Emirs, after which he said to the Chamberlain, \"Bring out before me the tribute of Damascus that is with thee.\" So he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zau al- Makan ordered the Chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of Damascus; and, when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, he took them and parted them all amongst the troops, till nothing was left. And the Emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life, saying, \"Never saw we a King, who gave the like of these gifts.\" Then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching. So they marched for three days, till, on the fourth day, they drew near to Baghdad. When they entered the city, they found it decorated, and Zau al-Makan, the Sultan, went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne, whilst the Emirs of the army and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain of Damascus stood between his hands. Then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother Sharrkan, acquainting him with all that had passed, from first to last, and he concluded, \"As soon as thou hast read this letter, make ready thine affair and join us with thine army, that we may turn to Holy War upon the Infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour.\" Then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the Minister Dandan, \"None shall carry this letter but thou; and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him, 'If thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom, it is thine, and thy brother shall be Viceroy for thee in Damascus; for to this effect am I instructed by him.'\" So the Wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march. Then Zau al-Makan bade set apart a magnificent house for the Fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that Fireman.[FN#380] Presently Zau al-Makan went out chasing and hunting and, as he was returning to Baghdad, one of the Emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades. One of the damsels pleased him: so he went in unto her and knew her that night, and she conceived by him forthright. After a while, the Wazir Dandan returned from his journey, bringing him news of his brother Sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him, and said, \"It were fitting thou go forth to meet him.\" Zau al- Makan replied, \"I hear and I consent;\" and riding forth with his Grandees a day's journey from Baghdad, he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother. Next morning appeared King Sharrkan amid the army of Syria, a horseman of might, a lion fierce in fight, a prow and doughty knight. As the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high, Zau al-Makan and those with him pushed forward to meet Sharrkan and his men; and when Zau al-Makan saw his brother, he desired to dismount, but Sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise, and himself footed it, and walked a few paces towards him.[FN#381] As soon as he reached Zau al-Makan, the new Sultan threw himself upon him, and Sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other. Then they mounted and rode onward, they and their troops, till they reached Baghdad, where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night, and when next morning came, Zau al- Makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts, and proclaimed a Holy War and a Razzia.[FN#382] They then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom, and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good; till in so doing a full month had sped, and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body. Then Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, \"O my brother, tell me thy history.\" So he told him all that had befallen him from first to last, including the benevolent dealing of the Fireman with him. Asked Sharrkan, 'Hast thou requited his kindness?\"; and he answered, \"O my brother! I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan asked his brother Zau al-Makan, \"Hast thou requited the Fireman for his kindness?\"; and he answered, \"O my brother, I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid and find time so to do.\" Therewith Sharrkan was certified that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had told him the whole truth; but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the Chamberlain. She sent him back her greeting, calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter Kuzia-Fakan, to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety. Where upon she praised Almighty Allah and gave him thanks. Then Sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure; and Zau al-Makan said, \"O my brother, as soon as the army is complete and the Arabs have come in from all parts, we will march forth.\" So he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife, who was now five months gone with child; and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians, to whom he appointed stipends and allowances. Then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of Syria, and as soon as the Arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions; and, as he fared forth, he was followed by the warriors and the united host. Now the name of the General of the Daylam army was Rustam and that of the General of the army of the Turks[FN#383] Bahram. And Zau al- Makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother Sharrkan, and on his left the Chamberlain his brother-in-law. So the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array, till the whole army was in motion. They ceased not to fare on for the space of a month, and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days (for the host was great); and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the Greeks. Then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to Constantinople. But when King Afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to Zat al-Dawahi, the same who had contrived the stratagem, and had travelled to Baghdad and had slain King Omar bin Al-Nu'uman; and who after carrying off her slaves and Queen Sophia, had returned with them all to her native land. Now when she had been restored to her son, the King of Greece, and felt herself safe, she said to King Hardub, \"Cool thine eyes; for I have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter Abrizah, and have killed Omar bin al-Nu'uman and have brought back Sophia. So now let us go to the King of Constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened, that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces; and I will fare with thee to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, for I opine that the Moslems will not await our attack.\" Said Hardub, \"Tarry thou till they draw near our country, that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power.\" Accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war, and, when the news of the Moslems' advance reached them, they were prepared for defence; and Zat al Dawahi had preceded them. Now when she and her son arrived at Constantinople, the King of Kings, Afridun, hearing of the approach of Hardub, King of the Greeks, came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit. So Hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, how she had slain the Moslem King and recovered from him Queen Sophia, and had said, \"The Moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us, wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them.\" Now King Afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the Moslem King. So the Nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the Greeks was complete, besides which there joined themselves to him Franks from all their lands, French, Germans[FN#384] and Ragusans,[FN#385] with men of Zara,[FN#386] Venetians, Genoese, and all the hosts of the Yellow Faces[FN#387]; and, when the gathering was at its full, earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude. Then Afridun, the Great King, ordered a march; so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days. They fared on till they reached the Wady highs Al-Nu'uman, a broad sided vale hard by the Salt Sea, where they halted three days; and on the fourth they were about to set out again, when news came that the army of Al-Islam on them press, and the defenders of the faith of Mohammed, of Men the Best. So they halted in it other three days, and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land; nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift, and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades. Presently there appeared beneath it the banners Islamitan and the ensigns Mahometan; the horsemen urged forward, like the letting loose of seas that surged, clad in mail, as they were mackerel-back clouds which the moon enveil; whereupon the two hosts clashed, like two torrents on each other dashed. Eyes fell upon eyes; and the first to seek combat singular was the Wazir Dandan, he and the army of Syria, numbering thirty thousand bridles, and with him were the General of the Turks, and the General of Daylam, Rustam and Bahram, amid twenty thousand horse, behind whom came the men from the shores of the Salt Sea, clad in iron mail, as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast. Then the Nazarene host called out on Jesus and Mary, and the defiled[FN#388] Cross and they heaped themselves upon the Wazir Dandan and those with him of the Syrian host. Now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman Zat al-Dawahi; for, before his departure, King Afridun had gone in to her and asked her, \"How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue?; it is thou hast caused this great distress to us;\" and she had answered, \"O great King and mighty Cohen![FN#389] I will teach thee a trick would baffle Iblis himself, though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Eighty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman, for that the King before his departure had gone to her and asked, \"How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue? it is thou hast caused this great distress to us!\" And she had answered, \"O great King and mighty Cohen, I will teach thee a trick would baffle the Devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts. It is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships, and sailing over the sea to the Mountain of Smoke; and there let them land and stir not till {he standards of Al-Islam come upon thee, when do thou up and at them. Then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the Moslems and take them in rear, whilst we confront them from the landward. So not one of them shall escape, and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us.\" Now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to King Afridun, and he replied, \"Right is the recking thou reckest, O Princess of wits and recourse of Kings and Cohens warring for their blood wit!\" So when the army of Al-Islam came upon them in chat valley, before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents. Then hurried up the army of Baghdad and Khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse, with Zau al-Makan in the front of war. When the host of the Infidels that lay by the sea saw them, they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks; and when Zau al- Makan espied this he cried out to his men, \"Turn back to the Infidels, O People of the Chosen Apostle, and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the Compassionating, the Compassionate!\" So they turned and fought with the Christians. Then Sharrkan marched up with another corps of the Moslem host, some hundred thousand men, whilst the Infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men. When the Moslems were united, their hearts were strengthened and they cried out, saying, \"Verily Allah hath pro mised us victory, and to the Infidels hath assigned defeat.\" And they clashed together with sword and spear. Now Sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe, fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow; nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword, shouting \"Allaho Akbar!\" (Allah is Most Great) till he drove back the host to the coast. Then failed the force of the foe and Allah gave victory to the faith of Al-Islam, and folk fought folk, drunken without strong drink till they slew of the Infidels in this affair forty and five thousand, while of the Moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell. Moreover, the Lion of the Faith, King Sharrkan, and his brother, Zau al-Makan, slept not that night, but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come. Thus far concerning the Moslem; but as regards King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople and Sovran of Roum, and Zat Al-Dawahi, they assembled the Emirs of the host and said to them, \"Verily, we had worked our will and solaced our hearts, but our over confidence in our numbers, and that only, defeated us.\" Then quoth to them the ancient one, the Lady of Calamities, \"In very sooth nought shall profit you, except ye draw you nigh unto the Messiah and put your trust in the True Belief, for, by the virtue of the Messiah, the whole strength of the Moslem host lieth in that Satan, King Sharrkan.\" \"Tomorrow,\" said King Afridun, \"I have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier, L\u00fak\u00e1 bin Shaml\u00fat; for if King Sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed, our man will slay him and will slay the other Moslem Knights, till not one is left. And I purpose this night to sacre you all with the Holy Incense.\" When the Emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him. Now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the Chief Patriarch, the denier, the defiler of the Truth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the Greeks used to send it to all the countries of the Christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris. Hearing of it Kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal; and the Chief Priests and the great Kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic; and the Patriarchs used to mix their own skite[FN#390] with it, for that the skite of the Chief Patriarch could not suffice for ten countries.[FN#391] So, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen, and King Afridun,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and King Afridun summoned his chief Knights and Nobles and invested them with dresses of honour; and, drawing the sign of the cross on their brows, incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the Chief Patriarch, the Cohen, the Heresiarch. This incensing done, he called for Luka bin Shamlut, surnamed the Sword of the Messiah; and, after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the Holy Merde, caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest. Now there was no stouter champion in the land of Roum than this accursed Luka, nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir; but he was foul of favour, for his face was as the face of an ass, his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness, and he was branded with the mark of the Infidels on face.[FN#392] After this he came up to King Afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him; and the King said to him, \"I desire thou go out against Sharrkan, King of Damascus, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and deliver us from this affliction.\" Quoth Luka, \"Hearkening and obedience;\" and the King made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from Heaven being near hand. Then Luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse; he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels, and he bore a trident spear, as he were Iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign. Then he rode forward, he and his horde of Infidels, even as though they were driving to the Fire, preceded by a herald, crying aloud in the Arabic tongue and saying, \"Ho, sect of Mohammed (upon whom be salutation and salvation!), let none of you come out but your champion Sharrkan, the Sword of Al-Islam, Lord of Damascus in Sh\u00e1m[FN#393]!\" Nor had he made an end of speaking, when arose a tumult in the plain; all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the Day of Complain. Then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound, and lo! it was King Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. For when his brother, Zau al-Makan, saw that accursed one push out on the plain, and heard the pursuivant, he turned to Sharrkan and said to him, \"Of a surety they seek for thee.\" Said he, \"Should it so be, 'twere most pleasing to me.\" So when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain, \"Let none of you come out against me save Sharrkan,\" they knew this cursed Luka to be champion of the land of Roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of Moslems. Now he was one of the greatest of villains, a wretch who caused hearts to pain; and the DayIamites, Turks and Kurds dreaded his might and main. Presently Sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim, mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim; and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake, and recited these couplets,\n\n\"I have a sorrel steed, whose pride is fain to bear the rein, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     main:\nI have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point, * Upon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     whose shaft the dam of Death her throny seat hath ta'en:\nI have a trenchant glaive of Hind; and, when I bare its face * Of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     scabbard\" veil, from out its brow the rays of levee rain.\"\n\nLuka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse; but he smote his forehead with his hand, in honour of the Cross drawn thereon and kissed it; then he couched his throw spear and ran at Sharrkan. But first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight; and, catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers, hurled it at Sharrkan. It flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for Sharrkan; but, as the spear flew near him, he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight. Then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken, and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view. As it descended, he caught it again with the other hand, in less than the twinkling of an eye, and cried out from his heart core, saying, \"By the truth of Him who created the sevenfold skies, I will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise!\" Then threw he the throw spear at Luka, who thought to do as Sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight; but Sharrkan prevented him, and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead, in the very centre of the sign of the Cross, and Allah hurried his soul to the Fire and Dwelling place dire.[FN#394] But when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and they cried, \"Alas!\" and \"Woe worth the day!\" and called for aid upon the Abbots of the monasteries,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and cried, \"Alas!\" and \"Woe worth the day!\" and called upon the Abbots of the monasteries and cried, \"Where be the crosses?\" So the Religious offered up prayers and the Christians all drew together against Sharrkan; and, brandishing their scymitars and lances, rushed forward to the attack. Then army met army and breasts fell under hoof, whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legs;[FN#395] nor did the herald of-war cease calling to fight, till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight. So the two hosts drew apart, whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave, for that with so much cut and thrust they strave; and the place was choked with the slain; fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell. Then Sharrkan joined his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the Chamberlain and the Wazir Dandan, and said to them, \"Verily Allah hath opened a door for the Infidels to fall, praised be the Lord of the Worlds one and all!\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"Let us never cease to praise Allah, for that He hath dispelled trouble from the Arab and the Ajam. Indeed the folk, generation after generation, shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed Luka, the falsifier of the Evangel;[FN#396] of thy catching the throng spear in mid-flight, and how the enemy of Allah among men thou didst smite; and thy fame shall endure until the end of time.\" Then said Sharrkan, \"Harkye, O grand Chamberlain and doughty Capitayne!\" and he answered, \"Adsum!\"[FN#397] Quoth Sharrkan, \"Take with thee the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand horse, and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea, and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore, and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe. Then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the Infidels disembarking from their ships; and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them; and, whenso ye see our troops falling back, as if defeated, and all the Infidels following them, as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents, do ye still lie in wait for them: but as soon as ye see the standard with the words, There is no god but the God, and Mohammed is God's Apostle (on whom be salutation and salvation!), then up with the green banner, and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout, 'Alla ho Akbar! Allah is most Great!' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea.\" He replied, \"To hear is to obey!\"; and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth. Now the Chamberlain took with himself the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand men even as Sharrkan had commanded. As soon as dawned the morn, the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear. Then the Christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the Ecclesiasts[FN#398] cried out and all heads were bared, and those in the ships hoisted the Cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side, and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray, whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white; and all joined fight and the grind mill of Death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground: heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew. Scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain; gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain; steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore; the host of Al-Islam called out, saying, \"On the Prince of Mankind be blessings and peace, and to the Compassionate glory and praise, which ne'er shall cease, for His boons which aye increase;\" and the host of the Infidels shouted, \"Glory to the Cross and the Belt and the vine press juice, and the wine presser and the Priests and the Monks and the Festival of Palms and the Metropolitan!\" Now Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy, while the Infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout, and made ready to foin and hew. Then the meiny of the Moslems raised their voices, reciting the first verses of the Chapter of the Cow,[FN#399] whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds, and the heralds of the Greeks cried out, \"Ho, servants of the Messiah! Ho, people of the True Faith! Ho, followers of the Primate![FN#400] Verily Divine grace upon you opes; for see, the hosts of Al Islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope! So turn ye not to them your backs, but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them, else are ye outcasts from the Messiah, Mary's son, who spoke even when a cradled one!\"[FN#401] Now Afridun, King of Constantinople, deemed that the Infidels were victorious, knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the Moslems, and sent to King Hardub of Roum congratulations on success, adding, \"Availed us naught but the Holy Merde of the Arch Patriarch, whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the Cross near and far; and I swear, by the Miracles of the Messiah; and by thy daughter Abrizah, the Nazarene, the Mariolater; and by the Waters of Baptism, that I will not leave upon the earth a single defender of Al- Islam! And to the bitter end will I carry out this plan.\" So the messenger betook himself with the address to King Hardub, whilst the Infidels called to one another saying, \"Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Infidels called to one another, saying, \"Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!\" while Hardub King of Greece cried aloud, \"Ho, to our revenge for Abrizah!\" Thereupon King Zau al-Makan shouted \"Ho, servants of the Requiting King!: smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear!\" So the Moslems returned to the Infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar, whilst their herald cried aloud, \"Up, and at the foes of the Faith, all ye who love the Prophet Elect, with hope of salvation on the Day of Fear, to win favour of the Bountiful, the Forgiving One; for verily the Garden of Paradise is under the shadow of swords!\" And behold, Sharrkan and his men charged down upon the Infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks; when lo! a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of Unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the Deniers, cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks, so that the Faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew. He was girt with two swords, his glances and his brand, and he was armed with two lances, one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape; and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors, even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Laud not long hair,[FN#402] except it be dispread * In two fold\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    locks, on day of fight and fray,\nO'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh, * From\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     many a whis kered knight to win the day.\"\nAnd as singeth another,\n\n\"I say to him, what while he slings his sword, * 'For sword shall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     serve those looks that sword like show!'\nSays he, 'My sabre looks for those I love, * My sword for those\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     who sweets of love unknow!'\"\n\nWhen Sharrkan saw him, he said to him, \"I conjure thee by the Koran and the attributes of the Compassionate One, O Champion of the Champions! tell me who thou art: for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the Requiting King, whom one thing distracteth not from other thing; in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling.\" Then cried the Cavalier to him saying, \"Thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday: how quickly thou hast forgotten me!\" Thereupon he withdrew his mouth veil,[FN#403] so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed, and lo! it was none other than Zau al-Makan. Then Sharrkan rejoiced in his brother, save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting; and this for two reasons, the first, his tender age and exposure to the evil eye, and the second, that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings. So he said to him, \"O King! thou riskest thy life, so join thy steed to mine; in very sooth I fear for thee from the foe; and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons, that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"I desire to even thee in fray and I will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay.\" Then the host of Al-Islam, heaping itself upon the Infidels, girt them on all sides, warred on them a right Holy War, and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre. But King Afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the Greek, and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight, making for the ships, when lo! there came out upon them from the seacoast another host, led by the Minister Dandan, the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust, and to lay load on them with cut and thrust. Nor less came forth the Emir Bahram, Lord of the Provinces of Sham, amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm; and the host of Al-Islam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm. Then a body of the Moslems turned against those who in the ships remained, and perdition on them rained, till they threw themselves into the main, and they slew of them many slain, more than a hundred thousand noblemen, nor was one of their champions, great or small, saved from bale and bane. Moreover, they took their ships, with all the money and treasure and cargo, save a score of keel, and the Moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years; nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears.[FN#404] Now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses, besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic, whereat the Moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that Allah had given them victory and protection. Such was the case with them; but as regards the fugitive Infidels they soon reached Constantinople, whither the tidings preceded them that King Afridun had prevailed over the Moslems; so quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, \"I know that my son Hardub, King of Roum, is no runagate and that he feareth not the Islamitic hosts, but will restore the whole world to the Nazarene faith.\" Then she bade the Great King, Afridun, give command that the city be decorated, and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of Destiny. Now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings, behold, the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them, and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the King of C\u00e6sarea. So King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, met them on the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen them from the Moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and they informed him concerning Luka son of Shamlut, how calamity had betided him and how Death had shot him with his shaft. Thereat the horrors of Doomday rose upon King Afridun,[FN#405] and he knew that there was no making straight their crook. Then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing; the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening, and sighs and cries were heard from all sides. And when King Hardub of Greece met King Afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the Moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit, and said to him, \"Look not to see any of the army, save those who have already reached thee.\" When King Afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit, with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, he exclaimed, \"Surely the Messiah was wroth with them that he caused the Moslems to prevail over them!\" Then came the Arch Patriarch sadly to the King who said to him, \"O our father, annihilation hath overtaken our army and the Messiah hath punished us!\" Replied the Patriarch, \"Grieve not nor feel concerned, for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the Messiah, and all have been punished for his offence; but now we will read prayers for you in the churches, that the Mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you.\" After which the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, came to Afridun and said to him, \"O King, verily the Moslem hosts are many, and we shall never overcome them save by wile: wherefore I purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of Al-Islam, haply I may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion, even as I slew his father. If my stratagem succeed in his case, not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land, for all are strong only because of him; but I desire to have some Christian dwellers of Syria, such as go out every month and year to sell their goods, that they may help me (for this they can do) in carrying out my plan.\" Replied the King, \"Be it so whenever thou wilt.\" So she bade fetch an hundred men, natives of Najr\u00e1n,[FN#406] in Sham, and the King asked them, \"Have ye not heard what hath befallen the Christians with the Moslems?\" \"Yes,\" answered they; and he rejoined, \"Know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the Messiah and purposeth to go forth with you, disguised as Monotheists and Mohammedans, to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the Moslem from us: say, then, are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the Anointed and I will give you a quintal of gold?[FN#407] He of you who escapeth shall have the money, and him of you who dieth will the Messiah reward.\" \"O King,\" replied they, \"we will devote our lives to the Messiah, and we will be thy sacrifice.\" Thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted. She waited till the decoction was cold, then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith. Moreover, she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary, and afterwards went in to King Afridun, who knew her not, nor did any of his companions know her, till she discovered herself to them: and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning; and her son rejoiced and said, \"May the Messiah never fail thee!\" Thereupon she took with her the Syrian Christians, and set out for the army of Baghdad.\u2014 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Afridun heard these words, he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, fear fluttered the scrotum[FN#408] below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi. Now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches, past mistress in sorcery and deception; wanton and wily, deboshed and deceptious; with foul breath, red eyelids, yellow cheeks, dull brown face, eyes bleared, mangy body, hair grizzled, back humped, skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran. But she had studied the scriptures of Al-Islam and had made the Pilgrimage to the Holy House of Meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the Mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the Koran; and she had professed Judaism in the Holy City of Jerusalem[FN#409] for two years' space, that she might master the magic of men and demons; so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests, wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief. Now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son, King Hardub of Greece, was on account of the slave virgins at his court: for she was given to tribadism[FN#410] and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad: so if any damsel pleased her, she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffron[FN#411] till she fainted away for excess of volupty. Whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her; but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy; and so she abode for a length of time. This was known to Marjanah and Rayh\u00e1nah and Utrijah, the handmaids of Abrizah, and their Princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her, because of the rank smell from her armpits, the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion, and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre. She was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions; but Abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the Omnipotent, the Omniscient; for, by Allah, right well quoth the poet,\n\n\"Ho thou who grovellest low before the great * Nor over fording\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     lesser men dost blench\nWho gildest dross by dirham gathering, * No otter scent disguises\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     carrion stench!\n\nAnd now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working. Presently she departed, taking the chief Nazarenes with their hosts, and turned towards the army of the Moslems. Whereupon King Hardub went in to King Afridun and said to him, \"O King, we have no need of the Chief Patriarch nor of his prayers, but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the Moslem hosts; for these are marching with all their power, they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides.\" When King Afridun heard this, terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters, without stay or delay, to all the nations of the Nazarenes, saying, \"It behoveth none of the Messiahites or Cross knights to hold back, especially the folk of the strongholds and forts: but let them all come to us, foot and horse, women and children, for the Moslem hosts already tread our soil. So haste! haste ye! ere what we fear to us here appear.\" Thus much concerning them; but regarding the work of the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi; when she went forth from the city with her suite, she clad them in the clothing of Moslem merchants, having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of Antioch, such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth. And she had taken a letter from King Afridun to the following effect: \"These be merchantmen from the land of Sham who have been with us: so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance, nor take tax and tithe of them, till they reach their homes and safe places, for by merchants a country flourisheth, and these are no men of war nor of ill faith.\" Then quoth the accursed Zat al-Dawahi to those with her, \"Verily I wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the Moslem.\" Replied they, \"O Queen, command us whatso thou wilt; we are at thy disposal and may the Messiah never disappoint thy dealings!\" Then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead, till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion, so that it shone with prodigious sheen. Now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed, and she bound her legs tightly round with cords[FN#412] just above her feet, till she drew near the Moslem camp, when she unwound them, leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles. Then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating, and set her in a chest and, quoth she, \"Cry abroad the Refrain of Unity,[FN#413] nor fear from it aught of damage!\" Replied they, \"How can we beat thee, who be our sovereign lady, Zat al-Dawahi, mother of the King we glory in?\" Then said she, \"We blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes, and in need evil becometh good deed. When ye have set me in the chest, take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the Moslem camp, and fear ye no blame. And if any of the Moslems hinder you, give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their King, Zau al-Makan, and implore his protection saying, 'We were in the land of the Infidels and they took nothing from us, but wrote us a passport, that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance.' If he ask you, 'What profit had ye of your property in the land of Roum?' answer him, 'We profited in the deliverance of a pious man, who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years, crying out for help yet none helped him. Nay, the Infidels tortured him night and day. We knew not this; but, after we had tarried in Constantinople for some time, having sold our goods and bought others in their stead, we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land. We spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke, we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it, behold, it moved and said, 'O Moslems, is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the Lord of the three Worlds?'[FN#414] 'How so?' asked we; and the figure answered, 'Know that Allah hath made me speak to you, to the intent that your faith be fortified, and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the Infidels and repair to the Moslem host; for with them wones the Sword of the Com passionate One, of our Age the Champion, King Sharrkan, by whom He shall conquer Constantinople town and destroy the sect of the Nazarene. And when ye shall have journeyed three days, you will find an hermitage known as the Hermitage of the ascetic Matruhina[FN#415] and containing a cell; visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will, for therein is a Religious from the Holy City, Jerusalem, by name Abdullah, and he is one of the devoutest of mankind, endowed with the power of working saintly miracles[FN#416] such as dispel doubts and obscurity. Certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time. By his deliverance you will please the Lord of Faithful Men, for such release is better than fighting for the Faith.'\" Now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, \"As soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan, say him further, 'Hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, \"Now as soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan say him further, 'Hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and Allah's servants of purest qualities; so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage, and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling, as is the wont of merchants. As soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light, we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon, and we heard the holy man, after chanting some verses of the Koran, repeat the following couplets,\n\n'My heart disheartened is, my breast is strait, * And sinks my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    soul in sea of bale and bate\nUnless escape be near I soon shall die; * And Death were better\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     than this doleful strait:\nO Lightning an thou light my home and folk, * An their still\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     brighter charms thy shine abate,\nSay, what my path to meet them, being barred * By wars, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     barricado'd succour's gate?'\n\n\"When once ye have brought me into the Moslem camp, and I mix with them you shall see,\" the old woman continued, \"how I will make shift to beguile them and slay them all, even to the last man.\" The Nazarenes hearing whet she said, kissed her hands and set her in the chest, after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands, for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this; then they all made for the Moslem host as hath erst been said. Such was the case with the damned hag, Zat al-Dawahi and her companions; but as regards the Mohammeden army, they indeed, after Allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards, all sat down to converse with one another and Zau al-Makan said to his brother Sharrkan, \"Verily, Allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves; wherefore continue, O Sharrkan, to obey my commandment, in submission to Allah (be He exalted and extolled!), for I mean to slay ten Kings in blood revenge for my sire, to cut the throat of fifty thousand Greeks and to enter Constantinople.\" Replied Sharrkan, \"My life be thy ransom against death! Needs must I follow out the Holy War, though I wone many a year in their country. But I have, O my brother, in Damascus a daughter, named Kuzia Fakan, whom I love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age.' Said Zau al-Makan, \"And I also have left my wife with child and near her time, nor do I know what Allah will vouchsafe me by her. But promise me, O my brother, that if Allah bless me with a son, thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him, and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon.\" \"With love and good will, replied Sharrkan; and, stretching out his hand to his brother, he said, If she bring thee a son, I will give him my daughter Kuzia Fakan, to wife.\" At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy. And the Wazir Dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them, \"Know, O ye Kings, that Allah hath given us the victory, for that we have devoted our lives to Him (be He exalted and ex tolled!); and we have left our homes and households; and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him, so haply Allah shall enable us to win our wishes, and we shall destroy our enemies, branch and root. If it please you, do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea, whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight.\" And the Minister Dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said,\n\n\"To slay my foes is chiefest bliss I wist, * And on the courser's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    back be borne a list;\nComes promising tryst a messenger from friend * Full oft, when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    comes the friend withouten tryst.\"\nAnd these words of another,\n\n\"War for my mother (an I live) I'll take; * Spear for my brother;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   scymitar for sire\nWith every shag haired brave who meets his death * Smiling, till\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   won from Doom his dear desire!\"\n\nAnd when the Wazir ended his verses, he said, \"Praise be to Him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold!\" Then Zau al-Makan commanded the army to depart; and they fared on forcing their marches for Constantinople, till they came to a wide and spacious champaign, full of all things fair and fain, with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain. Now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them, when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were Paradise; for it had donned its adornments and decked itself.[FN#417] Gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew, and combined with the nectar of Tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze. Mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty, even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Behold this lovely garden! 'tis as though * Spring o'er its\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   frame her greeny cloak had spread.\nLooking with fleshly eyne, thou shalt but sight * A lake whose\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    waters balance in their bed,\nBut look with spirit eyes and lo! shalt see * Glory in every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   leaf o'erwaves thy head.\"\n\nAnd as another saith,\n\n\"The stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed, * Whose down[FN#418]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  is creeping shade of tamarisk stems\nRound legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings * Silvern, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   blossoms are the diadems.\"\n\nWhen Zau al-Makan saw this champaign, with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling, he called to his brother Sharrkan and said, \"O my brother, verily in Damascus is naught the like of this place. We will not march from it save after three days, that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of Al-Islam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed Infidels.\" So they halted therein and while camping behold, they heard a noise of voices from afar, and Zau al-Makan asked the cause thereof, and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the Land of Syria had halted there to rest and that the Moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the Infidels. After a while up came the merchants, crying out and appealing to the King for aidance. When Zau al- Makan saw this, he bade them be brought before him and, when in presence they said to him, \"O King, we have been in the country of the Infidels and they plundered us of nothing: why then do our brothers the Moslems despoil our goods, and we in their own land? Of a truth when we saw your troops, we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us.\" Thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the King of Constantinople, and Sharrkan read it and said, \"We will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you; but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the Infidels.\" Replied they, \"O our Lord, in very sooth Allah despatched us thither that we might win what Gh\u00e1zi[FN#419] never won the like of, not even thou in all thy razzias.\" Asked Sharrkan, \"What was it ye won?\" \"O King,\" answered they, \"we will not tell thee save in private; for if this matter be noised among the folk, haply it may come to the ears of some,[FN#420] and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all Moslems who resort to the land of the Greeks.\" Now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned Zat al- Dawahi. So Zau al-Makan and his brother brought them to a private place, where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee, and wept till they made the two Kings weep.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Nazarenes who wore merchants' weed, when brought to a private place by Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan, laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two Kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch Zat al-Dawahi. Thereupon Sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of Almighty Allah. So quoth he to them, \"Did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage?\" Quoth they, \"We delivered him and slew the hermit, fearing for our lives; after which we made haste to fly for dread of death; but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price.\" Then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman, as she were a cassia pod[FN#421] for excess of blackness and leanness, and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles. When Zau al-Makan and the bystanders saw her, they took her for a man of the best of Allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities, more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face. So Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan wept sore; then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet, sobbing aloud: but she signed to them and said, \"Cease this weeping and hear my words. Hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding, and she said, \"Know ye both that I was content to accept what my Lord did unto me, for I kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from Him (be He exalted and extolled!); and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation, for him there is no coming to the delights of Paradise. I had indeed supplicated Him that I might return to my native land, not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me, but that I might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the Faith who, being slain in fray, live again without suffering death.\"[FN#422] Then she repeated the following couplets,\n\n\"Our Fort is Tor,[FN#423] and flames the fire of fight: * Moses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    art thou and this is time for aid:\nCast down thy rod, 'twill swallow all they wrought, * Nor dread\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    for men their ropes be vipers made.[FN#424]\nFor Chapters read on fight day lines of foes, * And on their\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    necks 'grave versets[FN#425] wi' thy blade!\"\n\nWhen the old woman had ended her verse, her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light, and Sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her: but she refused it, saying, \"I have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years; and how should I break it at such a time when my Lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the Infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire? I will wait till sun down.\" So when it was nightfall, Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan came and served her with food and said, \"Eat, O ascetic!\" But she said, \"This is no time for eating; it is the time for worshipping the Requiting King.\" Then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent; and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights, sitting not but at the time of the Sal\u00e1m or salutation[FN#426] ending with several prayers. When Zau al- Makan saw her on this wise, firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to Sharrkan, \"Cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this Religious, and appoint a body servant to wait upon him.\" On the fourth day she called for food; so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight; but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt. Then she again turned to her fast and, as the night came, she rose anew to pray; when Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, \"Verily, this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing, and, were it not for this Holy War, I would join myself to him and worship Allah in his service, till I came before His presence. And now I desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour.\" Quoth Zau al-Makan, \"And I also: tomorrow we sally forth to fight against Constantinople, and we shall find no time like the present.\" Said the Wazir Dandan, \"And I no less desire to see this ascetic; haply he will pray for me that I find death in this Holy War and come to the presence of my Lord, for I am aweary of the world.\" So as soon as night had darkened, they repaired to the tent of that witch, Zat al-Dawahi; and, seeing her standing to pray, they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her; but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past, when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation. Then she turned to them and after wishing them long life, asked them \"Wherefore come ye?\", whereto they answered, \"O thou holy man! diddest thou not hear us weep around thee?\" She rejoined, \"To him who standeth in the presence of Allah, remaineth no existence in time, either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him.\" Quoth they, \"We would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night, for that will profit us more than the possession of Constantinople.\" Now when she heard their words she said, \"By Allah, were ye not the Emirs of the Moslems, I would not relate to you aught of this at any time; for I complain not but to Allah alone. However, to you I will relate the circumstances of my captivity. Know, then, that I was in the saintly City of Jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men, and did not magnify myself among them, for that Allah (be He exalted and extolled!) had endowed me with humility and abnegation, till I chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water. Then entered into me pride; whence I know not, and I said to myself, 'Who like me can walk the water?' And my heart from that time hardened and Allah afflicted me with the love of travel. So I journeyed to Roum land and visited every part for a whole year, and left no place but therein I worshiped Allah. When I came to this spot,[FN#427] I clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage, inhabited by a monk called Matrubina, who, when he sighted me, came out and kissed my hands and feet and said, 'Verily, I have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the Greeks, and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of Al-Islam.' Then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage, and brought me to a dark room; and, when I entered it unawares, he locked the door on me and left me there forty days, without meat or drink; for it was his intent to kill me by delay. It chanced one day, that a Knight called Dakian\u00fas[FN#428] came to the hermitage, accompanied by ten squires and his daughter Tam\u00e1sil, a girl whose beauty was incom parable. When they entered that hermitage, the monk Matruhina told them of me, and the Knight said, 'Bring him out, for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat.' So they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche, praying and reciting the Koran and glorifying Allah and humbling myself before the Almighty. When they saw me in this state Matrohina exclaimed, 'This man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers!'; and hearing his words, they all came in on me, Dakianus and his company withal, and they beat me with a grievous beating, till I desired death and reproached myself, saying, 'This is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which Allah hath vouchsafed to him, beyond his own competence! And thou, O my soul, verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee. Dost thou not know that pride angereth the Lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the Fire?' Then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground. Every three days, they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water; and every month or two the Knight came to the hermitage. Now his daughter Tamasil had grown up, for she was nine years old when I first saw her, and fifteen years passed over me in captivity, so that she had reached her four and twentieth year. There is not in our land nor in the land of the Greeks a fairer than she, and her father feared lest the King take her from him; for she had vowed herself to the Messiah and rode with Dakianus in the habit of a cavalier, so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness, no one who saw her knew her for a woman. And her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage, every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein; and I saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities, none may keep count of them save Almighty Allah. Now ye are worthier of these riches than those Infidels; so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the Moslems and especially on fighters in the Holy War. When these merchants came to Constantinople and sold their merchandise, that image which is on the wall spoke to them, by grace of a marvel which Allah granted to me; so they made for that hermitage and slew Matruhina, after torturing him with most grievous torments, and dragging him by the beard, till he showed them the place where I was; when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death. Now tomorrow night Tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit, and her father and his squires will come after her, as he feareth for her; so, if ye would witness these things, take me with you and I will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the Knight Dakianus which be in that mountain; for I saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom, and I heard a damsel of their company sing to them in Arabic and well-away! that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the Koran. If, then, ye will; enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of Dakianus and his daughter; and take her, for she is fit only for the King of the Age, Sharrkan, or King Zau al-Makan.\" Thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the Wazir Dandan, who put scant faith in her story, for her words took no hold on his reason, and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his face.[FN#429] Yet he was confounded at her discourse, but he feared to speak with her for awe of the King. Then quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, \"Verily, I fear lest the Knight come and, seeing these troops encamped in the meadow, be afraid to enter the hermitage.\" So Zau al-Makan ordered the army to march upon Constantinople and said, \"I have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain, where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage.\" Then he sent at once for the Chief Chamberlain whom they brought into the presence; and he summoned likewise the leaders of the Turks and Daylamites and said, \"As soon as it is dawn, do ye set forth for Constantinople; and thou, O Chamberlain, shalt take my place in council and contrivance, while thou, O Rustam, shalt be my brother's deputy in battle. But let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you.\" Then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders, and he and Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan set out for the hermitage, and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasure.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed Zat al-Dawahi, and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure. Now as soon as dawned the morn, the Chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure, and they set out thinking that the two Kings and the Wazir were with them; knowing not that the three had made for the monastery. Such was the case with the host, but as regards the two Kings and the Minister, they tarried in their place till the end of that day. Now the Infidels who were with Zat al-Dawahi took their departure privily, after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march. So she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile. And when it was dark night, she arose and went in to Zau al-Makan and his companions and said to them, \"Come, let us set out for the mountain, and take with you a few men at arms.\" They obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain, whilst the rest rode on before Zat al-Dawahi, who gained new strength for excess of joy, so that Zau al-Makan said, \"Glory be to Him who sustaineth this holy man, whose like we never saw!\" Now the witch had written a letter to the King of Constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird,[FN#430] acquainting him with what had passed and ending, \"I wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the Greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution, lest the host of Al-Islam get sight of them; and, when they reach the hermitage, let them ambush themselves there, till I come to them with the Moslem King and his brother, for I shall inveigle them and will bring them thither, together with the Wazir and an hundred horse and no more, that I may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage. I am resolved to slay the Monk Matruhina, since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life. If my plot work well, not one of the Moslems shall return to his own country; no, not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight; and Matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the Nazarene faith and the servants of the Cross, and praise be to the Messiah, first and last.\" When this letter reached Constantinople, the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to King Afridun, who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and, after reaching the tower, to hide therein. Thus far concerning them; but as regards King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan and the escort, when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the Monk Matruhina, who came out to see who and what they were; whereupon quoth that pious man Zat al-Dawahi, \"Slay this damned fellow.\"[FN#431] So they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death. Then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos, and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them; and after gathering the whole together, they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith. As for Tamasil, she came not, she or her father, for fear of the Moslems; so Zau al-Makan tarried there, awaiting her all that day and the next and a third, till Sharrkan said to him, \"By Allah, I am troubled anent the army of Al-Islam, for I know not what is become of them.\" His brother replied, \"And I also am concerned for them: we have come by this great treasure and I do not believe that Tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage, after that befel which hath befallen the host of the Christians. It behoveth us, then, to content ourselves with what Allah hath given us and depart; so haply He will help us conquer Constantinople.\" Accordingly they came down from the mountain, while Zat al-Dawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit; and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile, where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse. As soon as these saw the Moslems they encircled them from all sides, couching lance and baring the white sabre blade; and the Infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless Faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring. When Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan looked upon this host, they saw that it was a numerous army and said, \"Who can have given these troops information of us?\" Replied Sharrkan, \"O my brother, this be no time for talk; this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts) so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts, for this strait is like a street with two gates; though, by the virtue of the Lord of Arabs and Ajams, were not the place so narrow I would bring them to naught, even though they were an hundred thousand men!\" Said Zau al-Makan, \"Had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse;\" and the Wazir Dandan continued, \"If we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows; but Allah will succour us against them. I know this defile and its straitness, and I know there be many places of refuge in it; for I have been here on razzia with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, what while we besieged Constantinople. We abode in this place, and here is water colder than snow. So come, let us push out of this defile ere the Infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top, whence they will hurl down rocks upon us, and we powerless to come at them.\" So they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows; but the pious man, Zat al-Dawahi, looked at them and said, \"What is it ye fear, ye who have vowed yourselves to the Lord, and to working His will? By Allah, I abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years, yet never gainsaid the Almighty in aught he did with me! Fight ye in Allah's way; so whoever of you is slain Paradise shall be his abode, and whoso slayeth, his striving shall be to his honour.\" When they heard from the ascetic these words, their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the Infidels charged down from all sides, whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them. The Moslems fought for the service of Allah a right good fight, and wrought upon His foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance; whilst Zau al-Makan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight, five by five and ten by ten, till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting. Now while so doing, he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them, and all who feared fled to her for shelter; but she was also signing the Infidels to slay Sharrkan. So troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die; but each troop that charged, he charged and drove back; and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs; for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory, and he said in himself, \"Verily on this holy men Allah looketh with eyes of His favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the Infidels with the purity of his pious intent: for I see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me, but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight.\" So they battled the rest of the day and, when night fell, the Moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone: and that day were slain of them five and forty. And when they were gathered together, they sought the devotee, but could find no trace of him; and this was grievous to them and they said, \"Belike, he hath died a martyr.\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"I saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of Holy Writ.\" Now while they were talking, behold, the accursed old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, stood before them, hending in hand the head of the Chief Captain of the ten thousand horse, a noble knight, a champion fierce in fight and a Satan for blight. One of the Turks had slain him with an arrow, and Allah hurried his soul to the fire; and when the Infidels saw what that Moslem had done with their leader, they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords, and Allah hurried his soul to Heaven. Then the accursed old woman cut off that Knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan. Now when Sharrkan sew her, he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed, \"Praised be Allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee, O holy man and devout champion of the Religion!\" Replied she, O my son, I have sought martyrdom this day, and have thrown my life away amid the Infidel array, but they feared me with dismay. When ye dispersed, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight their leader, albeit he was a match for a thousand horse, and I smote him till I severed head from trunk. Not one of the Infidels could near me; so I brought his head to you,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damned witch, Zat al-Dawahi, took the head of the Knight, the leader of the twenty thousand Infidels, she brought it and threw it down before Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan, saying, \"When I saw your condition, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight and smote him with the sword till I severed head from trunk. And none could near me, so I brought his head to you, that you may be strengthened in Holy War and work out with your swords the will of the Lord of the Faithful. And now I purpose leaving you to strive against the Infidels, whilst I go to your army, though they be at the gates of Constantinople, and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these Unfaithfuls.\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"How wilt thou pass to them, O thou holy man, seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the Miscreants?\" Quoth the accursed hag, \"Allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight me;[FN#432] nor, if any saw me, would he dare to attack me at that time, for I shall be as one non existing, absorbed in Allah, and He will fend off from me His foes.\" \"Thou sayest sooth, O holy man,\" rejoined Sharrkan, \"for indeed I have been witness of that; so, if thou can pass out at the first of the night, 'twill be best for us.\" Replied she, \"I will set out at this very hour and, if thou desire, thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee. Furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him, but none else; for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain.\" Sharrkan said, \"As for me I will not leave my comrades; but, if my brother will, there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait; for he is the stronghold of the Moslems and the sword of the Lord of the three Worlds; and if it be his pleasure, let him take with him the Wazir Dandan, or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs.\" So after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said, \"Give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the Infidels, if they be asleep or awake.\" Quoth they, \"We will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to Allah.\" \"If I do your bidding,\" replied she, \"blame me not but blame yourselves; for it is my rede that you await me till I bring you tidings of the case.\" Then said Sharrkan, \"Go to them and delay not from us, for we shall be awaiting thee.\" Thereupon she fared forth and Sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said, \"Were not this holy man a miracle worker, he had never slain yonder furious knight. This is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power; and of a truth the pride of the Infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier, for he was violent, an evil devil and a stubborn.\" Now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee, behold, the accursed Zat al-Dawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the Unbelievers; wherefor they thanked her (not knowing that all this was wile and guile) and the damned hag asked, \"Where be the King of the Age, Zau al-Makan, and the Minister Dandan?\" Answered he, \"Here am I!\" Take with thee thy Wazir,\" said she, \"and follow after me, that we may fare forth to Constantinople.\" Now she had acquainted the Infidels with the cheat she had put upon the Moslems, and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said, Our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their King in return for the Knight's death; because we had no stouter rider than he;\" and they added (bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the Moslems), \"When thou bringest him to us, we will bear him to King Afridun.\" Then she went out and went out with her Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan, and she walked on before the two saying, \"Fare forth with the blessing of Almighty Allah!\" So they did her bidding, for the shaft of Pate and Fortune of man's lot had shot them, and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the Grecian camp, till they came to the defile, the narrow pass aforesaid, whilst the Infidel enemy watched them, but did them no hindrance; for the infernal old woman had enjoined this. Now when Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan saw that the Infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight, the Wazir exclaimed, \"By Allah, this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles! and doubtless he be of the elect.\" Rejoined Zau al-Makan, \"By Allah, I think the Infidels be naught but blind, for we see them and they see us not.\" And while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers, behold, the Infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them, saying, \"Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him too?\" And the Wazir Dandan replied, \"See you not yon other man that is before us? ' Replied the Unbelievers, \"By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks, and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!\" Then Zau Al-Makan said, \"By Allah, this is a chastisement decreed to us by Almighty Allah!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Unfaithful had seized upon King Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan, they said to the two, \"Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him also?\" And the Wazir Dandan replied, \"See you not yon other man who be with us?\" They rejoined, \"By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!\" Then the Infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night, whilst Zat al-Dawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight. So they fell to lamenting and saying to each other, \"Verily, the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this, and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us.\" So far concerning Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan; but as regards King Sharrkan, he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades, and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer, he and his men made ready to do battle with the Infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good. Then they sallied out till they were hard upon the Unbelievers and, when these saw them from afar, they cried out to them, saying, \"O Moslems, we have taken captives your Sultan and your Wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs; and except ye leave off fighting us, we will slay you to the last man; but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our King, who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught, and we will do you no harm in aught. If ye accept, it will be well for you; but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death. So we have told you sooth, and this is our last word to you.\" Now when Sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the Wazir Dandan, he was weighed down with woe and wept; his force failed him and, making sure of death, he said to himself, \"Would I knew the cause of their capture! Did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him, or what was the matter?\" Then they sprang up to battle with the Unbelievers and slew great numbers of them. The brave was known that day from craven men, and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain; for the Infidels flocked up on them, as flies flock to drink, from hill and from plain; but Sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die, nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory, till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore. And when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place; and the Moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them: few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on Allah and the scymitar. Now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest Emirs, and they had killed thousands of the Infidels, footmen and fighters on horse. When Sharrkan saw this, the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades \"What shall we do?\"; whereto all answered, \"That which Almighty Allah willeth shall befal us.\" On the morning of the second day, Sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop, \"If ye go forth to fight, not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water; so I deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern, to hinder any from entering. Haply the holy man may have reached the Moslem host, and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the Infidels, for belike the Unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him.\" They said, This were the better course to take, and of its expediency no doubt we make.\" So the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls; and every one of the Infidels who sought to enter in, they slew. Thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults, till day was done and night came on dusky and dun;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the army of the Moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe, and every one of the Infidels attempted to charge them, him they slew; and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun, by which time King Sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left. Then quoth the Infidels to one another, \"When shall these battle days have an end? We are weary of warring the Moslems.\" And quoth one of them, \"Up and at them, for there remain of them but five and twenty men! If we cannot prevail on them to fight, let us light a fire upon them;[FN#433] and if they submit themselves and yield to us, we will take them prisoners; but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire, so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire. May the Messiah on their fathers have no grace, and may the sojourn of the Nazarenes be for them no abiding place!\" So they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it. Thereupon Sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners. And while they were in this condition, lo! the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter, \"It is not for any save for King Afridun to kill them, that he may gratify his wrath; therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow, when we will journey with them to Constantinople and deliver them to our King, who shall deal with them as he please.\" Said they, \"This is the right course;\" and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them. Then, as soon as it was black night, the Infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival; and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs. Now Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan, were in confinement and so also were his companion knights; whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him, \"O my brother, how win free?\" \"By Allah,\" replied Zau al Makan, \"I know not; for here we be like birds in cage.\" Then Sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself, till his pinion bonds brass asunder; whereupon being free he arose and went up to the Captain of the guard, and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters, freed Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the rest of his men. Then he turned to the two and said, \"I desire to slay three of these Infidels and take and don their dress, we three; so that we shall be guised as Greeks and we will pass through them, with out their knowing us, and fare forth to our own force.\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"This is no safe counsel for if we kill them, I fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us. 'Twere the surer way to pass out of the defile.\" So they agreed upon this and set out; and, when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind, they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping: and Sharrkan said to his brother, \"Better we take each one of us a steed.\" There were five and twenty horsemen, so they took five and twenty horses, whilst Allah sent sleep upon the Infidels for a purpose He knew and the Faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach. Meanwhile Sharrkan set to gathering from the Infidels as many weapons, swords, and spears, as were wanted. And while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the Infidels supposed that anyone could release Zau al-Makan and his brother and their men; or that their prisoners had power to escape. Now when all the captives were safe from the Unfaithful, Sharrkan came up with his comrades, and found them awaiting his arrival, on coals of flame, expecting him in anxious grame, so he turned to them and said, \"Feel no fear since Allah protecteth us. I have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose.\" \"What is it?\" asked they and he answered, \"I desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice, 'Allaho Akbar!' and ye add, 'The army of Al Islam is upon you! Allaho Akbar!' This wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk, but they will think that the Moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them; so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep, and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn.\" Replied Zau al-Makan, \"This plan is not good; we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word; for if we cry out 'Allaho Akbar,' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape.\" Rejoined Sharrkan, \"By Allah, though they should awake tis no matter, and I long that ye fall in with my plan, for naught save good can come of it!\" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted, \"Allaho Akbar!\" And hills and trees and rocks reworded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. But when the Kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one another,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundredth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan spake thus, \"I long that ye fall in with this my plan, for naught save good can come of it.\" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted, \"Allaho Akbar!\"; and hills and trees and rocks re worded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. The Infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said, \"The foe is upon us, by the truth of the Messiah!\" Then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save Almighty Allah. As soon as it was dawn, they sought for the captives, but found no trace of them, and their captains said, \"They who did this were the prisoners in our possession; up, then, and after them in all haste till ye overtake them, when we will make them quaff the cup of requital; and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you.\" So they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them. Now when Zau al-Makan saw this, he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother, \"What I feared would come, is come upon us, and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the Faith.\" But Sharrkan preferred to hold his peace. Then Zau al- Makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest, shouting, \"Allaho Akbar!\" and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the Lord of Faithful Men; and while they were in this case, behold, they heard many voices voicing, \"There is no god but the God! God is most great! Salutation and salvation upon the Apostle, the Bringer of glad Tidings, the Bearer of bad Tidings!''[FN#434] So they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of Moslems who believed in one God, pushing towards them, whereat their hearts were heartened and Sharrkan charged upon the Infidels crying out, \"There is no god but the God! God is most great! he and those with him, so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the Unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the Moslems followed them with lunge and blow; and Zau al-Makan and his comrades of the Moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the Infidel foe, and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight. Thereupon the Moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations, and, when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen, they saw Bahram, the captain of the Daylamites, and Rustam, the captain of the Turks, advancing to join them, with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim. As soon as they saw Zau al-Makan, the riders dismounted and saluted him, and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them, \"Rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the Moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of Unbelievers!\" Then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after Resurrection Day. Now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this. When the Emir Bahram and the Emir Rustam and the Chief Chamberlain, with the Moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight of Constantinople they saw that the Nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts, and had set all their defenders in order of defence, as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of Al-Islam and the banners Mohammedan, and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the Moslems, with their standards and ensigns of the Faith of Unity under the dust clouds and lo! they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain, and the voices of the Moslems chanting the Koran and glorifying the Compassionate One, struck their ears. Now the Infidels knew of the approach of this host through Zat al-Dawahi with her craft and whoredom,[FN#435] calumny and contrivance. And the armies of Al-Islam drew near, as it were the swollen sea, for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children. Then quoth the General of the Turks to the General of the Daylamites, \"O Emir, of a truth, we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls. Look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows. Indeed yon Infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a Sultan. In very sooth, we run danger from these enemies, whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold, especially in the absence of King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the illustrious Wazir Dandan. If they know of this, they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man; not one of us safety shall see. So it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the Turks, and march them to the hermitage of Matruhina and the meadow of Mal\u00fakhin\u00e1 in quest of our brothers and comrades. If thou act by my advice, it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance, in case they be hard pressed by the Infidels; and if thou act not, blame will not attach to me. But, an ye go, it behoveth that ye return quickly, for ill suspicion is part of prudence.\" The Emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel; so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned. So much for the cause of their coming; but as regards the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, as soon as she had delivered Sultan Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan into the hands of the Infidels, the foul whore mounted a swift steed, saying to the Faithless, \"I design to rejoin the Moslem army which is at Constantinople and contrive for their destruction; for I will inform them that their chiefs are dead, and when they hear that from me, their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered. Then will I go to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, and to my son Hardub, King of Roum, and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the Moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive.\" So she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night; and, when day dawned, appeared the armies of Bahram and Rustam advancing towards her. So she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself, \"Haply the Moslem hosts be returning, routed, from the assault of Constantinople.\" However, as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversed,[FN#436] and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men, but fearing for their King and comrades. When she was assured of this, she hastened towards them, running at speed, like a devil of ill rede, till reaching them she cried out, \"Haste ye! haste ye! O soldiers of the Compassionate One, hasten to the Holy War against the hosts of Satan!\" When Bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her, \"O friend of Allah what is behind thee?\" Answered she, \"Question not of sad case and sore condition; for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of Matruhina, and designed to win their way Constantinople wards, thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the Infidels.\" And the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror, adding, \"The most of them are dead, and there are but five and twenty men left.\" Said Bahram, \"O holy man! when didst thou leave them?\" \"But this night,\"[FN#437] replied she. He cried, \"Glory be to Allah! to Him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug, so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a mid-rib of palm-tree! But thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by His directions.\"[FN#438] Then he mounted his horse, and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies, and he said, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us, for our Sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him.\" Then they cut across the country, wide and side, night and day, and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan shouting. \"There is no god but the God! Allaho Akbar! and Salutation and Salvation upon the Congratulator, the Comminator.\"[FN#439] Whereupon he and his drove at the Unbelievers and whelmed them, as the rain torrent whelms the waste; and cried out their war cries, till fear get hold of the prowess Knights and the mountains were cloven in affright. And when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen, the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant, and each recognised other as hath been said before. Then they kissed the ground before the King and before his brother Sharrkan, who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave. Now thereat they marvelled and said to one another, \"Hasten we back to Constantinople, for we left our companions there, and our hearts are with them.\" So they hurried departure, commending themselves to the Subtle, the All-wise, and Zau al-Makan exhorted the Moslems to steadfast- ness and versified in the following couplets,[FN#440]\n\n\"Be praises mine to all praiseworthy Thee, * O Lord, who stinted\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    not mine aid to be!\nThough was I lost abroad, Thou west to me * Strongest support\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    which vouchsafed victory:\nThou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts, * And slungest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    con quering sword of valiancy:\nThou mad'st me blest beneath Thy kingly shade, * Engraced with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    generous boons dealt fain and free:\nThou savedst *from every fear I feared, by aid * Of my Wazir, the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Age's noblest he!\nGarred us Thy grace in fight to throw the Greek, * Who yet came\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     back dight in War's cramoisie:\nThen made I feint to fly from out the fight; * But like grim lion\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   turning made them flee,\nAnd left on valley sole my foemen, drunk * Not with old\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wine[FN#441] but Death-cup's revelry:\nThen came the Saintly Hermit, and he showed * His marvels wrought\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    for town and wold to see;\nWhen slew they hero-wights who woke to dwell * In Eden bowers\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   wherein sweet rill-lets well.\"\n\nBut, when Zau al-Makan had made an end of versifying, his brother Sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and First Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan congratulated his brother, Zau al-Makan, on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army. Such was their case; but as regards the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, after she had foregathered with the hosts of Rustam and Bahram, she returned to the coppice, where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed, till she drew near the Moslem army that beleaguered Constantinople, when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the Chief Chamberlain. And when he saw her, he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said, \"Welcome O pious recluse!\" Then he questioned her of what had befallen, and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies, saying, \"In sooth I fear for the Emir Rustam, and the Emir Bahram, for that I met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the King and his companions. Now there are but twenty thousand horse and the Unbelievers outnumber them; so I would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour, lest they be slain to the last man.\" And she cried to them, \"Haste! Haste!\" When the Chamberlain and the Moslems heard these words, their spirits fell and they wept; but Zat al-Dawahi said to them, \"Ask aidance of Allah and bear patiently this triburation; for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of Mohammed; and Paradise with its palaces is laid out by Allah for those who die martyrs; and needs must all die, but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the Faith.\" The Chamberlain, hearing this speech of the accursed old woman, called for the Emir Bahram's brother, a knight by name Tarkash; and, choosing out for him ten thousand horse, riders famed for force, bade him set out at once. So he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night, till he neared the Moslems. When daylight dawned, Sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of Al-Islam and said, \"If these troops which are coming upon us be Moslem men our victory is assured by them; but, if these be Nazarenes, there is no gainsaying Destiny's decrees.\" Then he turned to his brother, Zau al- Makan, and said, Never fear, for with my life I will ransom thee from death. If these be Mohammedan troops, then were it an increase of heavenly favours; but, if they be our foes, there is no help save that we fight them. Yet do I long to meet the Holy Man ere I die, so I may beg him to pray that I die not save by death of martyrdom.\" Whilst the twain were thus speaking, behold, there appeared the banners inscribed with the words, \"There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God;\" and Sharrkan cried out, \"How is it with the Moslems?\" \"All are sound and safe,\" replied they, \"and we came not but out of concern for you.\" Then the Chief of the army dismounted and, kissing ground before Sharrkan, asked, \"O my lord, how be the Sultan and the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and my brother Bahram; are they all in safety?\" He answered, \"All well; but who brought thee tidings of us?\" Quoth Tarkash; \"It was the Holy Man who told us that he had met my brother Bahram and Rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the Infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you; but I see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious.\" They questioned him, \"And how did the Holy Man reach you?\"; and he replied, \"Walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night, ten days' journey for a well girt horseman.\" \"There is no doubt but that he is a Saint of Allah,\" said Sharrkan, \"but where is he now?\" They rejoined, \"We left him with our troops, the folk of the Faith, moving them to do battle with the rebels and the Faithless.\" Thereat Sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked Allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the Holy Man; and commended the dead to His mercy saying, \"This was writ in the Book.\" Then they set out making for Constantinople by forced marches, and whilst they were on this enterprise, behold, a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons, the eastern and the western, from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night. But Sharrkan looked at it and said, \"Verily, I fear lest this be the Infidels who have routed the army of Al-Islam for that this dust walleth the world, east and west, and hideth the two horizons, north and south.\" Presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness, blacker than the blackness of dismal days; nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the Day of Doom. Horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case, when behold, they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid; so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out, \"O people of the Best of Mankind,[FN#442] the lamp which shineth in darkness blind, verily the Infidels have outwitted the Moslems by guile, for they fell upon the host of the One God whilst they deemed themselves safe from the Faithless, and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile; so hasten to the aid of the Believers in the unity of God, and deliver them from those who deny Him!\" Now when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble; and, alighting from his steed in amazement, he kissed the Recluse's hands and feet. On like wise did his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the rest of the foot and horse troops; except the Wazir Dandan, who dismounted not but said, \"By Allah, my heart flieth from this devotee, for I never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane. So leave him and rejoin your comrades the Moslems, for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the Lord of the Three Worlds! How often have I here made razzias with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands!\" Said Sharrkan, \"Put away from thee such evil thought, hast thou not seen this Holy Man exciting the Faithful to fight, and holding spears and swords light? So slander him not, for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the pious.[FN#443] Look how he inciteth us to fight the foe; and, did not Almighty Allah love him, He had cast him aforetime into fearful torment.\" Then Sharrkan bade bring a Nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said, \"Mount, O pious man, devout and virtuous!\" But the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial, that he might attain his end; and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith,\n\n\"He prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy; * When once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good bye.\"[FN#444]\n\nSo the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen, like a wily fox meditating guile, and began to uplift her voice, chanting the Koran and praising the Compassionate One. And they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of Al-Islam, where Sharrkan found the Moslem in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight, whilst the sword of Greece havoc dight among the Faithful, the righteous and those who work upright,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan saw the Moslems in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright, the cause of this weakness among the Moslems was that the accursed old woman, Zat al- Dawahi, the foe of the Faith, after seeing that Bahram and Rustam had set forward with their troops to join Sharrkan and his brother Zau al-Makan, repaired to the camp of the Mahometans before Constantinople and caused the mission of the Emir Tarkash, as hath been before said. In this her purpose was to divide the Moslem forces the better to weaken them. Then she left them and entered Constantinople, and called with a loud voice on the knights of the Greeks, saying, \"Let me down a cord that I may tie thereto this letter, and do ye bear it to your King Afridun, that he may read it and to my son King Hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding.\" So they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following: \"From the terriblest of tribulations[FN#445] and the chiefest of all calamities, Zat al-Dawahi, to King Afridun greeting. But afterwards, of a truth I have contrived a device for destroying the Moslems; so bide ye quiet and content. I have cozened and captured their Sultan and the Wazir Dandan; and then I returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith, whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung. And I have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering Constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the Emir Tarkash to succour the capitves, of whom there be now left but few; it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth; and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man; for, verily the Messiah looketh down upon you and the Blessed Virgin favoureth you; and I hope of the Messiah that he forget not what deed I have done.\" When her letter came to King Afridun, he rejoiced with great joyance; and, sending at once for King Hardub of Greece, son of Zat al-Dawahi, read the letter to him as soon as he came,whereathe was exceeding glad and said, \"See my mother's craft; verily it dispenseth with swords, and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the Day of Dread.\" Rejoined Afridun, \"May the Messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile!\" Then he bade the Knights give orders for sallying outside the city, and the news was noised abroad in Constantinople. So the Nazarenes and the cohorts of the Cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers, shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies, and blaspheming the Lord of all Creatures. When the Chamberlain saw the sally, he said, \"Behold, the Greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our Sultan is far away; and haply they have attacked us, for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of King Zau al-Makan!\" Therewith he waxed wroth and cried out, \"Ho, soldiers of Al-Islam and favourers of the True Faith, an you flee you are lost, but if ye stand fast, ye win! Know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the Almighty is able to make it straight; Allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain!\" Thereupon the Moslems cried out, \"Allaho Akbar!\" and the believer in the One God shouted his slogan, and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might; scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore. The priests and monks priested it, tight girding their girdles and uplifting the Crucifixes, while the Moslem shouted out the professions of the Requiting King and verses of the Koran began to sing. The hosts of the Compassion are One fought against the legions of Satan; and head flew from body of man, while the good Angels hovered above the people of the Chosen Prophet, nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened. Now the miscreants had encompassed the Moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them; and the Faithless greeded for victory over the Faithful until day dawned and dazzled. There upon the Chamberlain mounted, he and his men, trusting thee Allah would help them to victory; and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post. And heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead; the craven turned tail and fled; and the Judge of death judged and sentence sped, so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain. Then the Moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent; and the Greek took possession of some of their tents; whereupon the Moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight, when meanwhile behold, up came Sharrkan with the rest of the host of Al-Islam and the standards of the Believers in Unity. And having come up with them, he charged the Infidels; and followed him Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Emirs Bahram and Rustam with his brother Tarkash. When the foe saw this, they lost head and their reason fled, and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous Believers joined their pious comrades. Then Sharrkan accosted the Chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness; and he in turn gave the Prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day. Thereat the Moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened; so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to Allah in their Fight for the Faith. But when the Idolaters beheld the standards Mohammedan and there on the profession of Faith Islamitan, proclaiming the Unity, they shrieked \"Woe!\" and \"Ruin!\" and besought succour of the Patriarchs of the Monasteries. Then fell they to calling upon John and Mary and the Cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter, whilst King Afridun went up to consult King Hardub of Greece, for the two Kings stood one at the head of each wing, right and left. Now there was with them also a famous cavalier, Lawiya highs, who commanded the centre; and they drew out in battle array, but indeed they were full of alarm and affray. Meanwhile, the Moslems aligned their forces and thereupon Sharrkan came to his brother, Zau al-Makan, and said, \"O King of the Age, doubtless they mean to champion it, and that is also the object of our desire; but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters, for by forethought is one half of life wrought.\" Replied the Sultan, \"As thou wilt, O companion of good counsel!\" \"It is my wish,\" added Sharrkan, \"to stand in mid line opposite the Infidel, with the Wazir Dandan on my left and thee on my right, whilst the Emir Bahram leads the dexter wing and the Emir Rustam leads the wing sinistral; and thou, O mighty King, shalt be under the standards and the ensigns, for that thou art the pillar of our defence; upon thee, after Allah, is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee.\" Zau al-Makan thanked him therefor, and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn; but, as things stood thus, behold, there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of Roum; and, as he drew near, they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule, fleeing with her master from the shock of swords. Her housings were of white silk covered by a prayer-carpet of Cash mere stuff, and on her back sat a Shaykh, an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect, garbed in a gown of white wool. He stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the Moslem and said, \"I am an ambassador to you all, and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver; so give me safe conduct and permit of speech, that I communicate to you my message.\" Replied Sharrkan, \"Thou art in safety: fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance.\" Thereupon the old man dismounted and, taking the Cross from his neck, placed it before the Sultan and humbled himself with much humility. Then quoth to him the Moslems, \"What is with thee of news?\"; and quoth he, \"I am an ambassador from King Afridun, for I counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the Compassionate One; and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular; so he agreed to that and he saith to you, 'Verily, I will ransom my army with my life; so let the Moslem King do as I do and with his life ransom his host. And if he kill me, there will be no stay left in the army of Roum, and if I kill him, there will be no stability with the Moslems.\" When Sharrkan heard this he said, \"O monk, I agree to that, for it is just nor may it be gainsaid; and behold, I will meet him in duello and do with him derring do, for I am Champion of the Faithful even as he is Champion of the Faithless; and if he slay me, he will have won the day and naught will remain for the Moslems forces save flight. So return to him, O thou monk, and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow, for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary; but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye.\" So the monk returned (and he rejoicing) to King Afridun and King Hardub, and told them both what Sharrkan had said, whereat King Afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness, and he said to himself, \"No doubt but this Sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance; and when I shall have slain him, their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered.\" Now Zat al-Dawahi had written to King Afridun of that and had told him how Sharrkan was a Knight of the Braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him; but Afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion; he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow. So when he heard the report of the monk that Sharrkan agreed to the duello, he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him. The Infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing; and, as soon as it was dawn, the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade. And behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain, mounted on a steed of purest strain, and for foray and fray full ready and fain. And that Knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight. On his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of Khalanj wood,[FN#446] the curious work of the Frank, weighing a quintal. Then the rider uncovered his face and cried out, saying, \"Whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me, and whoso knoweth me not right soon[FN#447] shall ken who I be. I am Afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened Shaw\u00e1hi,[FN#448] Zat al-Dawahi.\" But he had not ended speaking ere Sharrkan, the Champion of the Moslems, fared forth to meet him, mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone; and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered Indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore. He crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne, and he cried out to Afridun, \"Woe to thee, O accursed! dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain?\" Then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing: they advanced and retreated; and drew together and withdrew; and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play, and strife and stay, with stroke of sword and lunge of lance. Of the two armies looking on, some said, \"Sharrkan is victor!\" and others, \"Afridun will conquer!\"; and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle; and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan. Then cried out King Afridun to Sharrkan, saying, \"By the truth of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter; but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble. I ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a Prince; for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slave;[FN#449] and see! they bring thee out a charger which is not thine, that thou mayst mount and return to the fight. But by the truth of my Faith, thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and I am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee; and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night, thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse, till thou approve to the cavaliers, thy generous blood and skill in brunt.\" When Sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave, he waxt wroth and turned towards his men, meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse, when lo! Afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at Sharrkan. Now when the Moslem turned his back, he found none of the men near him, and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed Infidel; so he wheeled round in haste and behold, the javelin came at him, so he swerved from it, till his head was bent low as his saddle bow. The weapon grazed his breast, and pierced the skin of his chest, for Sharrkan was high bosomed: whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away. Thereat the accursed Afridun was joyful, thinking he had slain him; and shouted to the Infidels bidding them rejoice, whereat the Faithless were encouraged and the Faithful wept. When Zau al-Makan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell, he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him. Thereupon the Infidels drove at the Moslems; the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled, whilst the keen scymitar of Al-Yaman did good work. Now the first to reach Sharrkan was the Wazir Dandan,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau al-Makan saw that the accursed Infidel had struck with javelin his brother Sharrkan, he deemed him dead, and despatched cavaliers towards him; and the first to reach him were the Wazir Dandan and the Emir of the Turks, Bahram, and the Emir of the Daylamites, Rustam. They found him falling from his horse; so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother, Zau al-Makan; then they gave him in charge to his pages, and went again to do the work of cut and thrust. So the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing; nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray, till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay. So they called a truce and each army returned to its tents, whilst all the Infidels repaired to King Afridun and kissed the ground before him, and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over Sharrkan. Then the King fared for Constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm, when King Hardub came to him and said, \"May the Messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother, Zat al-Dawahi, shall pray for thee! Know that the Moslems can make no stay without Sharrkan.\" Replied Afridun, \"To morrow shall end the affair when to fight I fare: I will seek Zau al-Makan and slay him, and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail.\" Such was the case with the Kafirs; but as regards the host of Al-Islam, when Zau al-Makan returned to his tent, he thought of naught but his brother and, going into the pavilion, found him in evil case and sore condition; whereupon he summoned for counsel the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and Bahram. When they entered, they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine Sharrkan, and they wept and said, \"The world will not readily afford his like!\" and they watched by him all that night, and about the later hours came to them the Recluse in tears. When Zau al-Makan saw him, he rose in honour; and the Religious stroked Sharrkan's wound with his hand, chanting somewhat of the Koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the Compassionate One. And the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn, when he came to himself and, opening his eyes, moved his tongue in his mouth and spake. At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, saying, \"Of a truth the blessing of the Holy Man hath taken effect on him!\" And Sharrkan said, \"Praised be Allah for recovery; indeed, I am well at this hour. That accursed one played me false; and, but that I swerved aside lighter than lightening, the throw spear had pierced through my breast. So praised be Allah for saving me! And how is it with the Moslems?\" Answered Zau al-Makan, \"All are weeping for thee.\" Quoth Sharrkan, \"I am well and in good case; but where is the Holy Man?\" Now he was sitting by him and said, \"At thy head.\" So the Prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said, \"O my son! Be of good patience and Allah shall increase thy reward; for the wage is measured by the work.\" Sharrkan rejoined, \"Pray for me,\" and he prayed for him. As soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen, the Moslems sallied out to the plain and the Kafirs made ready to thrust and cut. Then the Islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight, and King Zau al-Makan and Afridun made to charge one at other. But when Zau al-Makan fared forth into the field, there came with him the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Bahram, saying, \"We will be thy sacrifice.\" He replied, \"By the Holy House and Zemzem and the Place![FN#450] I will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses.\" And when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered; then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing. Presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out, \"Where is Afridun, that I may make him taste the cup of disgrace?\" But when King Hardub saw the case he conjured Afridun not to attack him, saying, \"O King, yesterday it was thy turn to fight: it is mine to day. I care naught for his prowess.\" So he rushed out towards Zau al-Makan brand in hand and under him a stallion like Abjar, which was Antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet,\n\n\"On the glancing racer outracing glance * He speeds, as though he\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    would collar Doom:\nHis steed's black coat is of darkest jet, * And likest Night in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    her nightliest gloom:\nWhose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears * Like thunders\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rolling in thun d'rous boom:\nIf he race the wind he will lead the way, * And the lightning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     flash will behind him loom.''[FN#451]\n\nThen each rushed upon the opponent, parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him; and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event. At last Zau al-Makan cried out his war cry and rushed upon Hardub, King of C\u00e6sarea,[FN#452] and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot. When the Infidels saw this, they charged in a body, compact and united, upon Zau al-Makan, who met them amidfield, and they engaged in hewing and foining, till blood ran in rills. Then the Moslems cried out, \"Allaho Akbar!\" (God is most Great) and \"There is no god but the God!\", and invoked salvation for the Prophet, the Bringer of Glad Tidings, the Bearer of Bad Tidings. And there befel a great fight, but Allah assigned victory to the Faithful and defeat to the Faithless. The Wazir Dandan shouted, \"Take your blood revenge for King Omar bin al Nu'uman and his son Sharrkan!\"; and bared his head and cried out to the Turks. Now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse, and all charged with him as men, when the Faithless found naught to save their lives but flight. So they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the Moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number: much folk also were slain while going in at the gates, for the flock was great. Then the Greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault; and in fine the Moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory, and King Zau al-Makan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case. So he made a prostration of thanks to the Bountiful and the Exalted; and then he came forward and gave Sharrkan joy of his recovery. Answered he, \"Verily we are all under the benediction of this Religious, holy and righteous, nor would you have been victorious, but for his accepted orisons; indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the Moslems.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Zau al- Makan went in to his brother Sharrkan, he found him sitting with the Holy Man by his side; so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery. Answered he, \"Verily we are all under the benediction of this Recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers, indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the Moslems. I found strength return to me, when I heard your 'Allaho Akbar,' for then I knew you to be victorious over your enemies. But now recount to me, O my brother, what befel thee.\" So he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed Hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of Allah; and Sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess. When Zat al-Dawahi heard tell of her son's death (and she still drest as a devotee), her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears: she kept her counsel, however, and feigned to the Moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy. But she said to herself, \"By the truth of the Messiah, there remaineth no profit of my life, if I burn not his heart for his brother, Sharrkan, even as he hath burned my heart for King Hardub, the mainstay of Christendom and the hosts of Crossdom!\" Still she kept her secret. And the Wazir Dandan and King Zau al-Makan and the Chamberlain remained sitting with Sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound; after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength; whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves, saying, \"To morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege.\" Then said Sharrkan to them, \"Ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight; so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up.\" They accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion, and none remained with Sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman Zat al-Dawahi. He talked with her through part of the night, then he stretched himself to rest: and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead. Such was the case with Sharrkan and his men; but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and, looking at Sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep. Thereupon she sprang to her feet, as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake, and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock. Then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to Sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body. And once more she sprang to her feet; and, going the round of the sleeping servants, she cut off their heads also, lest they should awake. Then she left the tent and made for the Sultan's pavilion, but finding the guards on the alert, turned to that of the Wazir Dandan. Now she found him reading the Koran and when his sight fell upon her he said, \"Welcome to the Holy Man!\" Hearing this from the Wazir, her heart trembled and she said, \"The reason of my coming hither at this time is that I heard the voice of a saint amongst Allah's Saints and am going to him.\" Then she turned her back, but the Wazir said to himself, \"By Allah, I will follow our Devotee this night!\" So he rose and walked after her; but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps, she knew that he was following her: wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself, \"Unless I serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me.\" So she turned and said to him from afar, \"Ho, thou Wazir, I am going in search of this Saint that I may learn who he is; and, after learning this much, I will ask his leave for thee to visit him. Then I will come back and tell thee: for I fear thine accompanying me, without having his permission, lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society.\" Now when the Wazir heard these words, he was ashamed to answer her; so he left her and returned to his tent, and would have slept; but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him. Presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself, \"I will go to Sharrkan and chat with him till morning.\" But when he entered into Sharrkan's pavilion, he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food. At this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep; the folk hastened to him and, seeing the blood streaming, set up a clamour of weeping and wailing. Then the noise awoke the Sultan, who enquired what was the matter, and it was said to him, \"Sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered.\" So he rose in haste and entered the tent, and found the Wazir Dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head. Thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him, weeping and crying out, and so remained for a while, till he came to himself, when he looked at Sharrkan and wept with sore weeping, while the Wazir and Rustam and Bahram did the like. But the Chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself, such was his alarm. Then said Zau al-Makan, \"Know ye who did this deed and how is it I see not the Devotee, him who the things of this world hath put away?\" Quoth the Wazir, \"And who should have been the cause of this affliction, save that Devotee, that Satan? By Allah, my heart abhorred him from the first, because I know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous!\" And he repeated to the King the tale of how he would have followed the Religious, but he forbade him, whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before Him who is ever near, Him who ever answereth prayer, supplicating that He would cause the false Devotee who denied Allah's testimony to fall into their hands. Then they laid Sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they laid Sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues. Then they looked for the opening of the city gate; but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls; whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder. But King Zau al-Makan said, \"By Allah, I will not turn back from them, though I sit here for years and years, till I take blood revenge for my brother Sharrkan and waste Constantinople and kill the King of the Nazarenes, even if death overcome me and I be at rest from this woeful world!\" Then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the Monastery of Matruhina; and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them, and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him. Moreover, he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them, \"Do ye send supplies to your households, for I am resolved to abide by this city, year after year, till I have taken man bote for my brother Sharrkan, even if I die in this stead.\" And when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied, \"To hear is to obey!\" Thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same, together with the monies, to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied, and acquaint them saying, \"We are encamped before Constantinople and we will either destroy it or die; and, albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years, we will not depart hence till we take it.\" Moreover, he bade the Wazir Dandan write to his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, and said to him, \"Acquaint her with what hath befallen us, and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that, when I went out to war, my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed; and if she hath given birth to a boy, as I have heard say, hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news.\" Then he gave them somewhat of money, which they pouched and set out at once; and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages. After they had departed, Zau al-Makan turned to the Wazir Dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls. So the troops pushed forward, but found none on the ramparts, whereat they marvelled, while Zau al-Makan was troubled at the case, for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother Sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the Ascetic. In this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone. So far concerning the Moslems; but as regards the Greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this. As soon as Zat al-Dawahi had slain Sharrkan, she hastened her march and reached the walls of Constantinople, where she called out in the Greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope. Quoth they, \"Who art thou?\"; and quoth she, \"I am Zat al- Dawahi.\" They knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up; and, when inside the city, she went in to the King Afridun and said to him, \"What is this I hear from the Moslems? They say that my son King Hardub is slain.\" He answered, \"Yes;\" and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made Afridun and all who were present weep with her. Then she told the King how she had slain Sharrkan and thirty of his servants, whereat he rejoiced and thanked her; and, kissing her hands, exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son. Said she, \"By the truth of the Messiah, I will not rest content with killing that dog of the Moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son, a King of the Kings of the age! Now there is no help for it but that I work some guile and I contrive a wile whereby to slay the Sultan Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of Al-Islam; for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of Sharrkan's head; no, never!\" Then said she to King Afridun, \"Know, O King of the Age, that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my Girdle and to break the Crosses.\" Replied Afridun, \"Do what thou desire; I will not gainsay thee in aught. And if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing; for though the Moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years, they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness.\" Then the Accursed One (when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought) took ink case and paper and wrote thereon: \"From Shawahi, Zat al- Dawahi, to the host of the Moslems. Know ye that I entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand I slew your King Omar bin al-Nu'uman in the midst of his palace. Moreover, I slew, in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave, many of your men; and the last I killed were Sharrkan and his servants. And if fortune do not stay me and Satan obey me, I needs must slay me your Sultan and the Wazir Dandan, for I am she who came to you in disguise of a Recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits. Wherefore, an you would be in safety after this, fare ye forth at once; and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce; and though ye tarry here years and years, ye shall not do your desire on us. And so peace be yours!\" After writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for King Hardub; arid, on the fourth, she called a Knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the Moslem camp. When this was done, she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son, saying to him who took the kingship after him, \"Nothing will serve me but I must kill Zau al-Makan and all the nobles of Al-Islam.\" Such was the case with her; but as regards what occurred to the Moslems, all passed three days in trouble and anxiety, and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold, they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound. So they waited till he had shot it among them and the Sultan bade the Wazir Dandan take the missive and read it. He perused it accordingly; and, when Zau al-Makan heard it to end and understood its purport, his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy; and the Minister Dandan said, \"By Allah, my heart shrank from her!\" Quoth the Sultan, \"How could this whore play her tricks upon us twice? But by the Almighty I will not depart hence till I fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged, then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of Constantinople.\" And he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping. But when Zat al-Dawahi arrived amongst the Infidels and related to them her adventures at length, they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of Sharrkan. There upon the Moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the Sultan promised his men that, if it should be taken, he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts. But he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick, growing thin as a tooth pick. Presently the Wazir Dandan came in to him and said, \"Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come, and there is no profit in this mourning. How well saith the poet,\n\n\"Whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass; * What is to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     be without a failure shall become;\nSoon the becoming fortune shall be found to be, * And Folly's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     brother[FN#453] shall abide forlorn and glum.\"\n\nWherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms.\" He replied, \"O Wazir, my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home; and my mind is concerned for my subjects.\" Thereupon the Wazir and the bystanders wept; but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of Constantinople for a length of days. And they being thus, behold, news arrived from Baghdad, by one of the Emirs to the effect that the King's wife had been blessed with a boy, and that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had named him K\u00e1nm\u00e1k\u00e1n.[FN#454] Moreover, that the boy bid fair to be famous, already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens; and that she had commanded the Olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise; furthermore that the twain were well, that the land had enjoyed abundant rains, and that his comrade the Fireman was established in all prosperity, with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him; but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him. And she ended with the greeting of peace. Then quoth Zau al- Makan to the Wazir Dandan, \"Now is my back strengthened for that I have been blest with a son whose name is Kanmakan.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child, Zau al- Makan rejoiced with great joy and cried, \"Now is my back strengthened, for that I have been blessed with a son[FN#455] whose name is Kanmakan.\" And he spake to the Wazir Dandan, saying, \"I am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the Koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"Thy design is good.\" Thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb; so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the Koran; and some began reciting the Holy volume; whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of Allah, and thus they did till the morning. Then Zau al-Makan went up to the grave of his brother Sharrkan and poured forth copious tears, and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"They bore him bier'd, and all who followed wept * With Moses'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 shrieks what day o'erhead shook Tor;[FN#456]\nTill reached the grave which Pate had made his home, * Dug in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   men's souls who one sole God adore:\nNe'er had I thought before to see my joy * Borne on the bier\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   which heads of bearers bore:\nAh no! nor ere they homed thee in the dust * That stars of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   heaven earth ever covered o'er.\nIs the tomb dweller hostage of a stead, * Where light and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    splendour o'er thy face shall pour?\nPraise to restore his life her word hath pledged: * Cribbed and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   confined he shall dispread the more!\"\n\nWhen Zau al-Makan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops; then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe, and the Wazir repeated the words of the poet,\n\n\"Pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won; * Thou\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done\nLeftest this worldly house without reproach or blame; * Ah, may\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    th' ex change secure thee every benison!\nThou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence, * For us to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun.\nI see this world is only cheat and vanity, * Where man naught\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   else must seek but please the Truthful One:\nTh' Empyrean's Lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss, * And wi'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    thy faithful friends The Guide show goodly wone:\nI bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief, * Seeing the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     West in woe for lack of Easting Sun.\"\n\n\nWhen the Wazir Dandan had finished his reciting, he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls. Then came forward one who had been of Sharrkan's boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops, and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities, reciting the following pentastichs,\n\n\n\"Where gone is Bounty since thy hand is turned to clay? * And I\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     in misery lie since thou west ta'en away.\nSee'st not, O litter guide[FN#457] (Heaven keep thee glad and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     gay!), * How tears adorn my cheeks, these furrowed wrinkles\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     fray?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        A sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        dismay.[FN#458]\nBy Allah ne'er this heart within I spoke of thee; * Ah no! nor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     dared my sight to see thy brilliancy:\nSave that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree * Yea!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        May yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see.\"\n\n\nAnd when the man stinted reciting, Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears; after which all retired to their tents, and the King turning to the Wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign. On this wise the two passed days and nights, while Zau al-Makan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said, \"I long to hear stories and adventures of Kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love; haply Allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety, and stint and stay my weeping and wailing.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"If naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of Kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore, and so forth, this thing were easy, for I had no other business, in the lifetime of thy father (who hath found mercy) than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him. This very night I will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved, so shall thy breast be broadened.\" When Zau al-Makan heard these words from the Minister, his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night, that he might hear what the Wazir Dandan had to tell of the Kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before. And hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear, and what not; and when all was in presence, he summoned the Wazir Dandan, and the Emirs Rustam and Bahram and Tarkash and the Grand Chamberlain; then waited till the whole party was seated before him; whereupon he turned to the Minister and said, \"Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us.\" Replied the Wazir, \"With joy and good will.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau Al-Makan summoned the Wazir and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram, he turned towards the Minister Dandan and said, \"Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us.\" Replied the Wazir, \"With love and gladness! Know, O auspicious King, that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them and what befel them of things rare and fair, a story such as repelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like unto that of the patriarch Jacob[FN#459]; and it is as follows\":\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n[FN#138] This knightly tale, the longest in the Nights (xliv.\u2014 cxlv.), about one-eighth of the whole, does not appear in the Bres. Edit. Lane, who finds it \"objectionable,\" reduces it to two of its episodes, Az\u00edz-cum-Az\u00edzah and T\u00e1j al-Mul\u00fak. On the other hand it has been converted into a volume (8vo, pp. 240) \"Scharkan, Conte Arabe,\" etc. Traduit par M. Asselan Riche, etc. Paris: Dondey-Dupr\u00e9. 1829. It has its longueurs and at times is longsome enough; but it is interesting as a comparison between the chivalry of Al-Islam and European knight-errantry. Although all the characters are fictitious the period is evidently in the early crusading days. C\u00e6sarea, the second capital of Palestine, taken during the Caliphate of Omar (A.H. 19) and afterwards recovered, was fortified in A.H. 353 = 963 as a base against the Arabs by the Emperor Phocas, the Arab. \"Nakf\u00far\" i.e. Nicephorus. In A.H. 498=1104, crusading craft did much injury by plundering merchantmen between Egypt and Syria, to which allusion is found in the romance. But the story teller has not quite made up his mind about which C\u00e6sarea he is talking, and M. Riche tells us that C\u00e9sar\u00e9e is a \"ville de la Mauritanie, en Afrique\" (p. 20).\n\n[FN#139] The fifth Ommiade Caliph reign. A.H. 65-86 = 685-704.\n\n[FN#140] This does not merely mean that no one was safe from his wrath: or, could approach him in the heat of fight: it is a reminiscence of the masterful \"King Kulayb,\" who established game-laws in his dominions and would allow no man to approach his camp-fire. Moreover the Jinn lights a fire to decoy travellers, but if his victim be bold enough to brave him, he invites him to take advantage of the heat.\n\n[FN#141] China.\n\n[FN#142] The Jaxartes and the Bactrus (names very loosely applied).\n\n[FN#143] In full \"Sharrun k\u00e1na\" i.e. an evil (Sharr) has come to being (k\u00e1na) that is, \"bane to the foe\" a pagan and knightly name. The hero of the Romance \"Al-Dalhamah\" is described as a bitter gourd (colocynth), a viper, a calamity.\n\n[FN#144] This is a Moslem law (Koran chaps. iv. bodily borrowed from the Talmud) which does not allow a man to marry one wife unless he can carnally satisfy her. Moreover he must distribute his honours equally and each wife has a right to her night unless she herself give it up. This was the case even with the spouses of the Prophet; and his biography notices several occasions when his wives waived their rights in favour of one another M. Riche kindly provides the King with la piquante francaise (p. 15).\n\n[FN#145] So the celebrated mosque in Stambul, famed for being the largest church in the world is known to the Greeks as \"Agia (pron. Aya) Sophia\" and to Moslems as \"Aye Sof\u00edyeh\" (Holy Wisdom) i.e. the Logos or Second Person of the Trinity (not a Saintess). The sending a Christian girl as a present to a Moslem would, in these days, be considered highly scandalous. But it was done by the Mukaukis or Coptic Governor of Egypt (under Heraclius) who of course hated the Greeks. This worthy gave two damsels to Mohammed; one called S\u00edr\u00edn and the other M\u00e1riyah (Maria) whom the Prophet reserved for his especial use and whose abode is still shown at Al-Medinah. The Rev. Doctor Badger (loc. cit. p. 972) gives the translation of an epistle by Mohammed to this Mukaukis, written in the Cufic character ( ? ?) and sealed \"Mohammed, The Apostle of Allah.\" My friend seems to believe that it is an original, but upon this subject opinions will differ. It is, however, exceedingly interesting, beginning with \"Bismillah,\" etc., and ending (before the signature) with a quotation from the Koran (iii. 57); and it may be assumed as a formula addressee to foreign potentates by a Prophet who had become virtually \"King of Arabia.\"\n\n[FN#146] This prayer before \"doing the deed of kind\" is, I have said, Moslem as well Christian.\n\n[FN#147] Exodus i. 16, quoted by Lane (M. E., chaps. xxvii.).\nTorrens in his Notes cites Drayton's \"Moon-calf':\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Bring forth the birth-stool\u2014no, let it alone;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    She is so far beyond all compass grown,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Some other new device us needs must stead,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Or else she never can be brought to bed.\nIt is the \"groaning-chair\" of Poor Robin's Almanac (1676) and we find it alluded to in Boccaccio, the classical sedile which according to scoffers has formed the papal chair (a curule seat) ever since the days of Pope Joan, when it has been held advisable for one of the Cardinals to ascertain that His Holiness possesses all the instruments of virility. This \"Kurs\u00ed al-wil\u00e1dah\" is of peculiar form on which the patient is seated. A most interesting essay might be written upon the various positions preferred during delivery, e.g. the wild Irish still stand on all fours, like the so-called \"lower animals.\" Amongst the Moslems of Waday, etc., a cord is hung from the top of the hut, and the woman in labour holds on to it standing with her legs apart, till the midwife receives the child.\n\n[FN#148] Some Orientalists call \"lullilooing\" the trilling cry, which is made by raising the voice to its highest pitch and breaking it by a rapid succession of touches on the palate with the tongue-tip, others \"Ziraleet\" and Zagaleet, and one traveller tells us that it began at the marriage-festival of Isaac and Rebecca (!). Arabs term it classically \"Tahl\u00edl\" and vulgarly \"Zaghrutah\" (Plur. Zagh\u00e1rit) and Persians \"Kil.\" Finally in Don Quixote we have \"Lelilies,\" the battle-cry of the Moors (Duffield iii. 289). Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds, but the good missionary heard it at the festival of Jagannath. (Pilgrimage iii. 197 )\n\n[FN#149] i.e. \"Light of the Place\" (or kingdom) and \"Delight of the\nAge.\"\n\n[FN#150] It is utterly absurd to give the old heroic Persian name Afridun or Furaydun, the destroyer of Zoh\u00e1k or Zahh\u00e1k to a Greek, but such anachronisms are characteristic of The Nights and are evidently introduced on purpose. See Boccaccio, ix. 9.\n\n[FN#151] Arab. \"Yun\u00e1n\" lit. Ionia, which applies to all Greece, insular and continental, especially to ancient Greece.\n\n[FN#152] In 1870 I saw at Sidon a find of some hundreds of gold\n\"Philippi\" and \"Alexanders.\"\n\n[FN#153] M. Riche has (p. 21), \"Ces talismans travaill\u00e9s par le ciseau du c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Califaziri,\" adding in a note, \"Je pense que c'est un sculpteur Arabe.\"\n\n[FN#154] This periphrase, containing what seems to us a useless negative, adds emphasis in Arabic.\n\n[FN#155] This bit of geographical information is not in the Bull\nEdit.\n\n[FN#156] In Pers. = a tooth, the popular word.\n\n[FN#157] This preliminary move, called in Persian Nakl-i Safar, is generally mentioned. So the Franciscan monks in California, when setting out for a long journey through the desert, marched three times round the convent and pitched tents for the night under its walls.\n\n[FN#158] In Arab. \"Khazinah\" or \"Khaznah\" lit. a treasure, representing 1,000 \"K\u00eds\" or purses (each=\u00a35). The sum in the text is 7,000 purses X 5=\u00a335,000.\n\n[FN#159] Travellers often prefer such sites because they are sheltered from the wind, and the ground is soft for pitching tents; but many have come to grief from sudden torrents following rain.\n\n[FN#160] Arab \"Gh\u00e1bah\" not a forest in our sense of the word, but a place where water sinks and the trees (mostly Mimosas), which elsewhere are widely scattered, form a comparatively dense growth and collect in thickets. These are favourite places for wild beasts during noon-heats.\n\n[FN#161] At various times in the East Jews and Christians were ordered to wear characteristic garments, especially the Zunn\u00e1r or girdle.\n\n[FN#162] The description is borrowed from the Coptic Convent, which invariably has an inner donjon or keep. The oldest monastery in the world is Mar Antonios (St. Anthony the Hermit) not far from Suez. (Gold Mines of Midian, p. 85.)\n\n[FN#163] \"Daw\u00e1h\u00ed,\" plur. of D\u00e1hiyah = a mishap. The title means \"Mistress of Misfortunes\" or Queen of Calamities (to the enemy); and the venerable lady, as will be seen, amply deserved her name, which is pronounced Z\u00e1t al-Daw\u00e1h\u00ed.\n\n[FN#164] Arab. \"Kunfuz\"=hedgehog or porcupine.\n\n[FN#165] These flowers of speech are mere familiarities, not insults. In societies where the sexes are separated speech becomes exceedingly free. \"\u00c9tourdie que vous \u00eates,\" says M. Riche, toning down the text.\n\n[FN#166] Arab. \"Zirt,\" a low word. The superlative \"Zarr\u00e1t\" (fartermost) or, \"Abu Zirt\" (Father of farts) is a facetious term among the bean-eating Fellahs and a deadly insult amongst the Badawin (Night ccccx.). The latter prefer the word Tagg\u00e1a (Pilgrimage iii. 84). We did not disdain the word in farthingale=pet en air.\n\n[FN#167] Arab. \"kicked\" him, i.e. with the sharp corner of the shovel-stirrup. I avoid such expressions as \"spurring\" and \"pricking over the plain,\" because apt to give a wrong idea.\n\n[FN#168] Arab. \"Allaho Akbar!\" the classical Moslem slogan.\n\n[FN#169] Arab horses are never taught to leap, so she was quite safe on the other side of a brook nine feet broad.\n\n[FN#170] \"Batr\u00edk\" (vulg. Bitr\u00edk)=patricius, a title given to\nChristian knights who commanded ten thousand men; the Tarkhan (or\nNobb) heading four thousand, and the Kaumas (Arab. K\u00e1id) two\nhundred. It must not be confounded with Batrak (or\nBatrik)=patriarcha. (Lane's Lex.)\n\n[FN#171] Arab. \"K\u00e1zi al-Kuz\u00e1t,\" a kind of Chief Justice or Chancellor. The office wag established under the rule of Harun al Rashid, who so entitled Ab\u00fa Y\u00fasuf Ya'akab al-Ans\u00e1ri: therefore the allusion is anachronistic. The same Caliph also caused the Olema to dress as they do still.\n\n[FN#172] The allusion is Koranic: \"O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that He first created you of the dust of the ground (Adam), afterwards of seed\" (chaps. xxii.). But the physiological ideas of the Koran are curious. It supposes that the Mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women in the breast bone (chaps Ixxxvi.); that the mingled seed of the two (chaps. Ixxvi.) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fed through the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of the catamenia. Barzoi (Kalilah and D\u00edmnah) says:\u2014 \"Man's seed, falling into the woman's womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: when it thickens and curdles the Spirit moves it and it turns about like liquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, its limbs constructed and its joints distinguished. If the babe is a male, his face is placed towards his mother's back; if a female, towards her belly.\" (P. 262, Mr. L G.N. Keith- Falconer's translation.) But there is a curious prolepsis of the spermatozoa-theory. We read (Koran chaps. vii.), \"Thy Lord drew forth their posterity from the loins of the sons of Adam;\" and the commentators say that Allah stroked Adam's back and extracted from his loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape of small ants; these confessed their dependence on God and were dismissed to return whence they came.\" From this fiction it appears (says Sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown to the Mohammedans, and there is some little conformity between it and the modern theory of generatio ex animalculis in semine marium. The poets call this Yaum-i-Alast = the Day of Am-I-not (-your Lord)? which Sir William Jones most unhappily translated \"Art thou not with thy Lord ?\" (Alasta bi Rabbi- kum); fand they produce a grand vision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions before their Creator.\n\n[FN#173] The usual preliminary of a wrestling bout.\n\n[FN#174] In Eastern wrestling this counts as a fair fail. So Ajax fell on his back with Ulysses on his breast. (Iliad xxxii., 700, etc.)\n\n[FN#175] So biting was allowed amongst the Greeks in the , the final struggle on the ground.\n\n[FN#176] Supposed to be names of noted wrestlers. \"Kayim\" (not El-Kim as Torrens has it) is a term now applied to a juggler or \"professor\" of legerdemain who amuses people in the streets with easy tricks. (Lane, M. E., chaps. xx.)\n\n[FN#177] Lit. \"laughed in his face\" which has not the unpleasant meaning it bears in English.\n\n[FN#178] Arab. \"Abu riy\u00e1h\"=a kind of child's toy. It is our \"bull-roarer\" well known in Australia and parts of Africa.\n\n[FN#179] The people of the region south of the Caspian which is called \"Sea of Daylam.\" It has a long history; for which see D'Herbelot, s.v. \"Dilem.\"\n\n[FN#180] Coptic convents in Egypt still affect these drawbridges over the keep-moat.\n\n[FN#181] Koran iv., xxii. etc., meaning it is lawful to marry women taken in war after the necessary purification although their husbands be still living. This is not permitted with a free woman who is a True Believer. I have noted that the only concubine slave-girl mentioned in the Koran are these \"captives possessed by the right hand.\"\n\n[FN#182] The Amazonian dame is a favourite in folk-lore and is an ornament to poetry from the Iliad to our modern day. Such heroines, apparently unknown to the Pagan Arabs, were common in the early ages of Al-Islam as Ockley and Gibbon prove, and that the race is not extinct may be seen in my Pilgrimage (iii. 55) where the sister of Ibn Rumi resolved to take blood revenge for her brother.\n\n[FN#183] And Solomon said, \"O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne ?\" A terrible genius (i.e. an If rit of the Jinn named Dhakwan or the notorious Sakhr) said, \" I will bring it unto thee before thou arise from thy seat (of justice); for I am able to perform it, and may be trusted\" (Koran, xxvii. 38-39). Balk\u00eds or Bilk\u00eds (says the Durrat al-Ghaww\u00e1s) daughter of Hoz\u00e1d bin Sharhab\u00edl, twenty-second in the list of the rulers of Al- Yaman, according to some murdered her husband, and became, by Moslem ignorance, the Biblical \" Queen of Sheba.\" The Abyssinians transfer her from Arabian Saba to Ethiopia and make her the mother by Solomon of Menelek, their proto-monarch; thus claiming for their royalties an antiquity compared with which all reigning houses in the world are of yesterday. The dates of the Tab\u00e1bi'ah or Tobbas prove that the Bilkis of history ruled Al-Yaman in the early Christian era.\n\n[FN#184] Arab. \"Fass,\" fiss or fuss; the gem set in a ring; also applied to a hillock rounded en cabochon. In The Nights it is used to signify \"a fine gem.\"\n\n[FN#185] This prominence of the glut\u00e6i muscles is always insisted upon, because it is supposed to promise well in a bed-fellow. In Somali land where the people are sub- steatopygous, a rich young man, who can afford such luxury, will have the girls drawn up in line and choose her to wife who projects furthest behind\n\n[FN#186] The \"bull\" is only half mine.\n\n[FN#187] A favourite Arab phrase, the \"hot eye\" is one full of tears.\n\n[FN#188] i.e., \"Coral,\" coral branch, a favourite name for a slave-girl, especially a negress. It is the older \"Morgiana.\" I do not see why Preston in Al-Har\u00edni's \"Makamah (S\u00e9ance) of Singar\" renders it pearls, because Golius gives \"small pearls,\" when it is evidently \"coral.\" Richardson (Dissert. xlviii.) seems to me justified in finding the Pari (fairy) Marjan of heroic Persian history reflected in the Fairy Morgain who earned off King Arthur after the battle of Camelon.\n\n[FN#189] Arab. \"'Ud Jalaki\"=Jalak or Jalik being a poetical and almost obsolete name of Damascus.\n\n[FN#190] The fountain in Paradise whose water shall be drunk with \"pure\" wine mixed and sealed with musk (for clay). It is so called because it comes from the \"Sanam\" (Sanima, to be high) boss or highest ridge of the Moslem Heaven (Koran lv. 78 and lxxxiii. 27). Mr. Rodwell says \"it is conveyed to the highest apartments in the Pavilions of Paradise.\" (?)\n\n[FN#191] This \"hysterical\" temperament is not rare even amongst the bravest Arabs.\n\n[FN#192] An idea evidently derived from the \u00c6olipyla (olla animatoria) the invention of Hero Alexandrinus, which showed that the ancient Egyptians could apply the motive force of steam.\n\n[FN#193] Kuthayyir ibn Abi Jumah, a poet and far-famed R\u00e1w\u00ed or Tale-reciter, mentioned by Ibn Khallikan he lived at Al-Medinah and sang the attractions of one Azzah, hence his soubriquet S\u00e1hib (lover of) Azzah. As he died in A. H. 105 (=726), his presence here is a gross anachronism the imaginary Sharrkan flourished before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marw\u00e1n A. H. 65-86.\n\n[FN#194] Jam\u00edl bin Ma'amar, a poet and lover contemporary with\nAl-Kuthayrir.\n\n[FN#195] Arab. \"Tafazzal,\" a word of frequent use in conversation=\"favour me,\" etc.\n\n[FN#196] The word has a long history. From the Gr. or is the Lat. stibium; while the Low Latin \"antimonium\" and the Span. Althimod are by metathesis for Al-Ithmid. The dictionaries define the substance as a stone from which antimony is prepared, but the Arabs understand a semi-mythical mineral of yellow colour which enters into the veins of the eyes and gives them Iynx-like vision. The famous Anz nicknamed Zark\u00e1 (the blue eyed) of Yam\u00e1mah (Province) used it; and, according to some, invented Kohl. When her (protohistoric) tribe Jadis had destroyed all the rival race of Tasm, except Rib\u00e1h ibn Murrah; the sole survivor fled to the Tobba of Al-Yaman, who sent a host to avenge him. The king commanded his Himyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again Birnam wood). Zark\u00e1 from her Utum, or peel-tower, saw the army three marches off and cried, \"O folk, either trees or Himyar are coming upon you!\" adding, in Rajaz verse:\u2014\n\nI swear by Allah that trees creep onward, or that Himyar beareth somewhat which he draweth along!\n\nShe then saw a man mending his sandal. But Jadis disbelieved; Cassandra was slain and, when her eyes were cut out the vessels were found full of Ithmid. Hence Al-Mutanabbi sang:\n\n\"Sharper-sighted than Zark\u00e1 of Jau\" (Yam\u00e1mah).\n\nSee C. de Perceval i. 101; Arab. Prov. i. 192; and Chenery p. 381.\n(The Assemblies of Al-Hariri; London, Williams and Norgate, 1867).\nI have made many enquiries into the true nature of Ithmid and\nfailed to learn anything: on the Upper Nile the word is=Kohl.\n\n[FN#197] The general colour of chessmen in the East, where the game is played on a cloth more often than a board.\n\n[FN#198] Arab. \"Al-fil,\" the elephant=the French fol or fou and our bishop. I have derived \"elephant\" from P\u00edl (old Persian, Sansk. Pilu) and Arab. Fil, with the article Al-Fil, whence the Greek the suffix\u2014as being devoted to barbarous words as Obod-as (Al Ubayd), Aretas (Al-H\u00e1ris), etc. Mr. Isaac Taylor (The Alphabet i. 169), preserves the old absurdity of \"eleph-ant or ox-like (!) beast of Africa.\" Prof. Sayce finds the word al-ab (two distinct characters) in line 3, above the figure of an (Indian) elephant, on the black obelisk of Nimrod Mound, and suggests an Assyrian derivation.\n\n[FN#199] Arab. \"Shaukat\" which may also mean the \"pride\" or \"mainstay\" (of the army).\n\n[FN#200] Lit. \"smote him on the tendons of his neck.\" This is the famous shoulder-cut (Tawash shuh) which, with the leg-cut (Kalam), formed, and still forms, the staple of Eastern attack with the sword.\n\n[FN#201] Arab. \"Dir\u00e1s.\" Easterns do not thresh with flails. The material is strewed over a round and smoothed floor of dried mud in the open air and threshed by different connivances. In Egypt the favourite is a chair-like machine called \"Norag,\" running on iron plates and drawn by bulls or cows over the corn. Generally, however, Moslems prefer the old classical , the Tribulum of Virgil and Varro, a slipper-shaped sled of wood garnished on the sole with large-headed iron nails, or sharp fragments of flint or basalt. Thus is made the \"Tibn\" or straw, the universal hay of the East, which our machines cannot imitate.\n\n[FN#202] These numbers appear to be grossly exaggerated, but they were possible in the days of sword and armour: at the battle of Saffayn the Caliph Ali is said to have cut down five hundred and twenty-three men in a single night.\n\n[FN#203] Arab. \"Bika'\u00e1\": hence the \"Buka'ah\" or Clesyria.\n\n[FN#204] Richardson in his excellent dictionary (note 103) which modern priggism finds \"unscientific \" wonderfully derives this word from Arab. \"Khatt\u00e1f,\" a snatcher (i.e. of women), a ravisher. It is an evident corruption of \"captivus\" through Italian and French\n\n[FN#205] These periodical and fair-like visitations to convents are still customary; especially amongst the Christians of Damascus.\n\n[FN#206] Camphor being then unknown.\n\n[FN#207] The \"wrecker\" is known all over the world; and not only barbarians hold that ships driven ashore become the property of the shore\n\n[FN#208] Arab. \"Jokh\": it is not a dictionary word, but the only term in popular use for European broadcloth.\n\n[FN#209] The second person plural is used because the writer would involve the subjects of his correspondent in the matter.\n\n[FN#210] This part of the phrase, which may seem unnecessary to the European, is perfectly intelligible to all Orientalists. You may read many an Eastern letter and not understand it. Compare Boccacoo iv. 1.\n\n[FN#211] i.e. he was greatly agitated\n\n[FN#212] In text \"Li-ajal a al-Taudi'a,\" for the purpose of farewelling, a low Egyptianism; emphatically a \"Kal\u00e1m w\u00e1ti.\" (Pilgrimage thee iii. 330.)\n\n[FN#213] In the Mac. Edit. Sharrkan speaks, a clerical error.\n\n[FN#214] The Farsakh (Germ. Stunde) a measure of time rather than distance, is an hour's travel or its equivalent, a league, a meile=three English stat. miles. The word is still used in Persia its true home, but not elsewhere. It is very old, having been determined as a lineal measure of distance by Herodotus (ii. 5 and 6 ; v. 53), who computes it at 30 furlongs (=furrow-lengths, 8 to the stat. mile). Strabo (xi.) makes it range from 40 to 60 stades (each=606 feet 9 inches), and even now it varies between 1,500 to 6,000 yards. Captain Francklin (Tour to Persia) estimates it = about four miles. (Pilgrimage ii. 113.)\n\n[FN#215] Arab. \"Ashhab.\" Names of colours are few amongst semi civilised peoples, but in Arabia there is a distinct word for every shade of horseflesh.\n\n[FN#216] She had already said to him \"Thou art beaten in everything!\"\n\n[FN#217] Showing that she was still a Christian.\n\n[FN#218] This is not Badawi sentiment: the honoratioren amongst wild people would scorn such foul play; but amongst the settled Arabs honour between men and women is unknown and such \"hocussing\" would be held quite fair.\n\n[FN#219] The table of wine, in our day, is mostly a japanned tray with glasses and bottles, saucers of pickles and fruits and, perhaps, a bunch of flowers and aromatic herbs. During the Caliphate the \"wine-service\" was on a larger scale.\n\n[FN#220] Here the \"Bhang\" (almost a generic term applied to hellebore, etc.) may be hyoscyamus or henbane. Yet there are varieties of Cannabis, such as the Dakha of South Africa capable of most violent effect. I found the use of the drug well known to the negroes of the Southern United States and of the Brazil, although few of their owners had ever heard of it.\n\n[FN#221] Amongst Moslems this is a reference to Adam who first \"sinned against himself,' and who therefore is called \" Saf\u00edyu'llah,\" the Pure of Allah. (Pilgrimage iii. 333.)\n\n[FN#222] Meaning, an angry, violent man.\n\n[FN#223] Arab. \"Insh\u00e1d,\" which may mean reciting the verse of another or improvising one's own. In Modern Egypt \"Munshid\" is the singer or reciter of poetry at Zikrs (Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv.). Here the verses are quite bad enough to be improvised by the hapless Princess.\n\n[FN#224] The negro skin assumes this dust colour in cold, fear, concupiscence and other mental emotions.\n\n[FN#225] He compares her glance with the blade of a Yamani sword, a lieu commun of Eastern poetry. The weapons are famous in The Nights; but the best sword-cutlery came from Persia as the porcelain from China to Sana'\u00e1. Here, however, is especial allusion as to the sword \"Samsam\" or \"Samsamah.\" It belonged to the Himyarite Tobba, Amru bin Ma'ad Kurb, and came into the hands of Harun al-Rashid. When the Emperor of the Greeks sent a present of superior sword-blades to him by way of a brave, the Caliph, in the presence of the Envoys, took \"Samsam\" in hand and cut the others in twain as if they were cabbages without the least prejudice to the edge of \"Samsam.\"\n\n[FN#226] This touch of pathos is truly Arab. So in the \"Romance of Dalhamah\" (Lane, M. E. xxiii.) the infant Gundubah sucks the breast of its dead mother and the King exclaims, \"If she had committed this crime she would not be affording the child her milk after she was dead.\"\n\n[FN#227] Arab. \"Sadda'l-Akt\u00e1r,\" a term picturesque enough to be preserved in English. \"Sadd,\" I have said, is a wall or dyke, the term applied to the great dam of water- plants which obstructs the navigation of the Upper Nile, the lilies and other growths floating with the current from the (Victoria) Nyanza Lake. I may note that we need no longer derive from India the lotus-llily so extensively used by the Ancient Egyptians and so neglected by the moderns that it has well nigh disappeared. All the Central African basins abound in the Nymph\u00e6a and thence it found its way down the Nile Valley.\n\n[FN#228] Arab. \"Al Marh\u00famah\": equivalent to our \"late lamented.\"\n\n[FN#229] Vulgarly pronounced \"Mahmal,\" and by Egyptians and Turks \"Mehmel.\" Lane (M. E. xxiv.) has figured this queenly litter and I have sketched and described it in my Pilgrimage (iii. 12).\n\n[FN#230] For such fits of religious enthusiasm see my Pilgrimage (iii. 254).\n\n[FN#231] \"Ir\u00e1k\" (Mesopotamia) means \"a level country beside the banks of a ever.\"\n\n[FN#232] \"Al Kuds,\" or \"Bays al-Mukaddas,\" is still the popular name of Jerusalem, from the Heb. Yerushalaim ha-Kadushah (legend on shekel of Simon Maccabeus).\n\n[FN#233] \"Follow the religion of Abraham\" says the Koran (chaps. iii. 89). Abraham, titled \"Khal\u00edlu'llah,\" ranks next in dignity to Mohammed, preceding Isa, I need hardly say that his tomb is not in Jerusalem nor is the tomb itself at Hebron ever visited. Here Moslems (soi disant) are allowed by the jealousies of Europe to close and conceal a place which belongs to the world, especially to Jews and Christians. The tombs, if they exist, lie in a vault or cave under the Mosque.\n\n[FN#234] Ab\u00e1, or Ab\u00e1yah, vulg. Abayah, is a cloak of hair, goat's or camel's; too well known to require description.\n\n[FN#235] Arab. \"Al-Wakk\u00e1d,\" the man who lights and keeps up the bath-fires.\n\n[FN#236] Arab. \"M\u00e1 al-Khal\u00e1f\" (or \"Khil\u00e1f\") a sickly perfume but much prized, made from the flowers of the Salix \u00c6gyptiaca.\n\n[FN#237] Used by way of soap; like glasswort and other plants.\n\n[FN#238] i.e., \"Thou art only just recovered.\"\n\n[FN#239] To \"Nakh\" is to gurgle \"Ikh! Ikh!\" till the camel kneels. Hence the space called \"Barr al-Man\u00e1khah\" in Al-Medinah (Pilgrimage i. 222, ii. 91). There is a regular camel vocabulary amongst the Arabs, made up like our \"Gee\" (go ye!), etc. of significant words worn down.\n\n[FN#240] Arab. \"Laza,\" the Second Hell provided for Jews.\n\n[FN#241] The word has been explained (vol. i. 112).[see Volume 1, note 199] It is trivial, not occurring in the Koran which uses \"Arabs of the Desert ;\" \"Arabs who dwell in tents,\" etc. (chaps. ix. and xxxiii.). \"A'ar\u00e1bi\" is the classical word and the origin of \"Arab\" is disputed. According to Pocock (Not\u00e6 Spec. Hist. Arab.): \"Diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the Arabs; but the most certain of all is that which draws it from Arabah, which is part of the region of Tehama (belonging to Al-Medinah Pilgrimage ii. 118), which their father Ismail afterwards inhabited.\" Tehamah (sierra caliente) is the maritime region of Al Hijaz, the Moslems Holy Land; and its \"Arabah,\" a very small tract which named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as some have done, with the Wady Arabah, the ancient outlet of the Dead Sea. The derivation of \"Arab\" from \"Ya'arab\" a fancied son of Joktan is mythological. In Heb. Arabia may be called \"Eretz Ereb\" (or \"Arab\")=land of the West; but in Arabic \"Gharb\" (not Ereb) is the Occident and the Arab dates long before the Hebrew.\n\n[FN#242] \"When thine enemy extends his hand to thee, cut it off if thou can, or kiss it,\" wisely said Caliph al-Mansur.\n\n[FN#243] The Tartur was a peculiar turban worn by the Northern Arabs and shown in old prints. In modern Egypt the term is applied to the tall sugar-loaf caps of felt affected mostly by regular Dervishes. Burckhardt (Proverbs 194 and 398) makes it the high cap of felt or fur proper to the irregular cavalry called Dely or Delaty. In Dar For (Darfour) \"Tartur\" is a conical cap adorned with beads and cowries worn by the Manghwah or buffoon who corresponds with the Egyptian \"Khalb\u00fas\" or \"Maskharah\" and the Turkish \"Sutari.\" For an illustration see Plate iv. fig. 10 of Voyage au Darfour par Mohammed El Tounsy (The Tunisian), Paris, Duprat, 1845.\n\n[FN#244] The term is picturesque and true; we say \"gnaw,\" which is not so good.\n\n[FN#245] Here, meaning an Elder, a Chief, etc.; the word has been almost naturalised in English. I have noted that Abraham was the first \"Shaykh.\"\n\n[FN#246] This mention of weighing suggests the dust of Dean Swift and the money of the Gold Coast It was done, I have said, because the gold coin, besides being \"sweated\" was soft and was soon worn down.\n\n[FN#247] Fem. of N\u00e1j\u00ed (a deliverer, a saviour)=Salvadora.\n\n[FN#248] This, I have noted, is according to Koranic command (chaps. iv. 88). \"When you are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation.\" The longer answer to \"Peace be with (or upon) thee! \" is still universally the custom. The \"Salem\" is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observant traveller will easily make of it a Shibboleth.\n\n[FN#249] The Badawi, who was fool as well as rogue, begins to fear that he has kidnapped a girl of family.\n\n[FN#250] These examinations being very indecent are usually done in strictest privacy. The great point is to make sure of virginity.\n\n[FN#251] This is according to strict Moslem law: the purchaser may not look at the girl's nakedness till she is his, and he ought to manage matters through an old woman.\n\n[FN#252] Lit. wrath; affliction which chokes; in Hindustani it means simply anger.\n\n[FN#253] i.e. Heaven forbid I be touched by a strange man.\n\n[FN#254] Used for fuel and other purposes, such as making \"doss stick.\"\n\n[FN#255] Arab \"Yaftah'Allah\" the offer being insufficient. The rascal is greedy as a Badaw and moreover he is a liar, which the Badawi is not.\n\n[FN#256] The third of the four great Moslem schools of Theology, taking its name from the Imam al-Sh\u00e1fi'\u00ed (Mohammed ibn Idr\u00eds) who died in Egypt A.H. 204, and lies buried near Cairo. (Sale's Prel. Disc. sect. viii.)\n\n[FN#257] The Moslem form of Cabbala, or transcendental philosophy of the Hebrews.\n\n[FN#258] Arab. \"Bakh\" the word used by the Apostle to Ali his son-in-law. It is the Latin \"Euge.\"\n\n[FN#259] Readers, who read for amusement, will do well to \"skip\" the fadaises of this highly educated young woman.\n\n[FN#260] There are three Persian Kings of this name (Artaxerxes)\nwhich means \"Flour and milk,\" or \"high lion.\" The text alludes to\nArdeshir Babegan, so called because he married the daughter of\nBabak the shepherd, founder of the Sassanides in A.D. 202. See\nD,Herberot, and the Dabistan.\n\n[FN#261] Alluding to the proverb, \"Folk follow their King's faith,\"\n\"Cujus regio ejus religio\" etc.\n\n[FN#262] Second Abbaside, A.H. 136-158 (=754-775).\n\n[FN#263] The celebrated companion of Mohammed who succeeded Abu Bakr in the Caliphate (A.H. 13-23=634-644). The Sunnis know him as Al-Adil the Just, and the Shiahs detest him for his usurpation, his austerity and harshness. It is said that he laughed once and wept once. The laugh was caused by recollecting how he ate his dough-gods (the idols of the Hanifah tribe) in The Ignorance. The tears were drawn by remembering how he buried alive his baby daughter who, while the grave was being dug, patted away the dust from his hair and beard. Omar was doubtless a great man, but he is one of the most ungenial figures in Moslem history which does not abound in genialities. To me he suggests a Puritan, a Covenanter of the sourest and narrowest type; and I cannot wonder that the Persians abhor him, and abuse him on all occasions.\n\n[FN#264] The austere Caliph Omar whose scourge was more feared than the sword was the - author of the celebrated saying \"Consult them (feminines) and do clear contrary-wise.\"\n\n[FN#265] Our \"honour amongst thieves.\"\n\n[FN#266] The sixth successor of Mohammed and founder of the Banu Umayyah or Ommiades, called the \"sons of the little mother\" from their eponymus (A.H. 41-60=661-680). For his Badawi wife Maysun, and her abuse of her husband, see Pilgrimage iii. 262.\n\n[FN#267] Shaykh of the noble tribe, or rather nation, Banu Tam\u00edm and a notable of the day, surnamed, no one knows why, \"Sire of the Sea.\"\n\n[FN#268] This is essential for cleanliness in hot lands: however much the bath may be used, the body-pile and lower hair, if submitted to a microscope, will show more or less sordes adherent. The axilla-hair is plucked because if shaved the growing pile causes itching and the depilatories are held deleterious. At first vellication is painful but the skin becomes used to it. The pecten is shaved either without or after using depilatories, of which more presently. The body-pile is removed by \"Takhf\u00edf\"; the Lib\u00e1n Sh\u00e1mi (Syrian incense), a fir- gum imported from Scio, is melted and allowed to cool in the form of a pledget. This is passed over the face and all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots (Burckhardt No. 420). Not a few Anglo-Indians have adopted these precautions\n\n[FN#269] This Caliph was a tall, fair, handsome man of awe-inspiring aspect. Omar used to look at him and say, \"This is the C\u00e6sar of the Arabs,\" while his wife called him a \"fatted ass.\"\n\n[FN#270] The saying is attributed to Abraham when \"exercised\" by the unkindly temper of Sarah; \"woman is made hard and crooked like a rib;\" and the modern addition is, \"whoso would straighten her, breaketh her.\"\n\n[FN#271] i.e. \"When ready and in erection.\"\n\n[FN#272] \"And do first (before going in to your wives) some act which may be profitable unto your souls\" or, for you: soul's good. (Koran, chaps. ii. 223.) Hence Ahnaf makes this prayer.\n\n[FN#273] It was popularly said that \"Truth-speaking left Omar without a friend.\" Entitled \"The Just\" he was murdered by Abu L\u00fal\u00faah, alias F\u00edr\u00faz, a (Magian ?) slave of Al-Magh\u00edrah for denying him justice.\n\n[FN#274] Governor of Bassorah under the first four Caliphs. See\nD'Herbelot s.v. \"Asch\u00e1ri.\"\n\n[FN#275] Ziyad bin Abi Sufyan, illegitimate brother of the Caliph\nMu'awiyah afterwards governor of Bassorah, Cufa and Al-Hijaz.\n\n[FN#276] The seditions in Kufah were mainly caused by the wilful nepotism of Caliph Othman bin As\u00e1kir which at last brought about his death. His main quality seems to have been personal beauty: \"never was seen man or woman of fairer face than he and he was the most comely of men:\" he was especially famed for beautiful teeth which in old age he bound about with gold wire. He is described as of middling stature, large- limbed, broad shouldered, fleshy of thigh and long in the fore-arm which was hairy. His face inclined to yellow and was pock-marked; his beard was full and his curly hair, which he dyed yellow, fell below his ears. He is called \"writer of the Koran\" from his edition of the M.S., and \"Lord of the two Lights\" because he married two of the Prophet's daughters, Rukayyah and Umm Kulthum; and, according to the Shi'ahs who call him Othman-i-Lang or\" limping Othman,\" he vilely maltreated them. They justify his death as the act of an Ijm\u00e1' al-Muslim\u00edn, the general consensus of Moslems which ratifies \"Lynch law.\" Altogether Othman is a mean figure in history.\n\n[FN#277] \"N\u00e1r\" (fire) is a word to be used delicately from its connection with Gehenna. You say, e.g. \"bring me a light, a coal (bassah)\" etc.; but if you say \"bring me fire! \" the enemy will probably remark \"He wanteth fire even before his time!\" The slang expression would be \"bring the sweet.\" (Pilgrimage i. 121.)\n\n[FN#278] Omar is described as a man of fair complexion, and very ruddy, but he waxed tawny with age, when he also became bald and grey. He had little hair on the cheeks but a long mustachio with reddish ends. In stature he overtopped the people and was stout as he was tall. A popular saying of Mohammed's is, \"All (very) long men are fools save Omar, and all (very) short men are knaves save Ali.\" The Persians, who abhor Omar, compare every lengthy, ungainly, longsome thing with him; they will say, \"This road never ends, like the entrails of Omar.\" We know little about Ali's appearance except that he was very short and stout, broad and full-bellied with a tawny complexion and exceedingly hairy, his long beard, white as cotton, filling all the space between his shoulders. He was a \"pocket. Hercules,\" and incredible tales, like that about the gates of Khaybar, are told of his strength. Lastly, he was the only Caliph who bequeathed anything to literature: his \"Cantiloquium\" is famous and he has left more than one mystical and prophetic work. See Ockley for his \"Sentences\" and D'Herbelot s. D. \"Ali\" and \"Gebr.\" Ali is a noble figure in Moslem history.\n\n[FN#279] The emancipation from the consequences of his sins; or it may mean a holy death.\n\n[FN#280] Battle fought near Al-Medinah A.D. 625. The word is derived from \"shad\" (one). I have described the site in my Pilgrimage, (vol. ii. 227).\n\n[FN#281] \"Haphsa\" in older writers; Omar's daughter and one of Mohammed's wives, famous for her connection with the manuscripts of the Koran. From her were (or claimed to be) descended the Hafsites who reigned in Tunis and extended their power far and wide over the Maghrib (Mauritania), till dispossessed by the Turks.\n\n[FN#282] i.e. humbly without the usual strut or swim: it corresponds with the biblical walking or going softly. (I Kings xxi. 27; Isaiah xxxviii. 15, etc.)\n\n[FN#283] A theologian of the seventh and eighth centuries.\n\n[FN#284] i.e. to prepare himself by good works, especially alms-giving, for the next world.\n\n[FN#285] A theologian of the eighth century.\n\n[FN#286] Abd al-Aziz was eighth Ommiade (regn. A.H. 99=717) and the fifth of the orthodox, famed for a piety little known to his house. His most celebrated saying was, \" Be constant in meditation on death: if thou bein straitened case 'twill enlarge it, and if in affluence 'twill straiten it upon thee.\" He died. poisoned, it is said, in A.H 101,\n\n[FN#287] Abu Bakr originally called Abd al-Ka'abah (slave of the Ka'abah) took the name of Abdullah and was surnamed Abu Bakr (father of the virgin) when Mohammed, who before had married only widows, took to wife his daughter, the famous or infamous Ayishah. \"Bikr\" is the usual form, but \"Bakr,\" primarily meaning a young camel, is metaphorically applied to human youth (Lane's Lex. s. c.). The first Caliph was a cloth-merchant, like many of the Meccan chiefs. He is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep set eyes and thin-checked, of slender build and lean loined, stooping and with the backs of his hands fleshless. He used tinctures of Henna and Katam for his beard. The Persians who hate him, call him \"Pir-i-Kaft\u00e1r,\" the old she-hyaena, and believe that he wanders about the deserts of Arabia in perpetual rut which the males must satisfy.\n\n[FN#288] The second, fifth, sixth and seventh Ommiades.\n\n[FN#289] The mother of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz was a granddaughter of\nOmar bin al-Khattab.\n\n[FN#290] Brother of this Omar's successor, Yezid II.\n\n[FN#291] So the Turkish proverb \"The fish begins to stink at the head.\"\n\n[FN#292] Calling to the slaves.\n\n[FN#293] When the \"Day of Arafat\" (9th of Z\u00fa'l-Hijjah) falls upon a Friday. For this Hajj al- Akbar see my Pilgrimage iii. 226. It is often confounded by writers (even by the learned M. Caussin de Perceval) with the common Pilgrimage as opposed to the Umrah, or \" Lesser Pilgrimage\" (ibid. iii. 342, etc.). The latter means etymologically cohabiting with a woman in her father's house as opposed to 'Ars or leading her to the husband's home: it is applied to visiting Meccah and going through all the pilgrim-rites but not at the Pilgrimage-season. Hence its title \"Hajj al-Asghar\" the \"Lesser Hajj.\" But \"Umrah\" is also applied to a certain ceremony between the hills Saf\u00e1 (a large hard rock) and Marwah (stone full of flints), which accompanies the Hajj and which I have described (ibid. iii. 344). At Meccah I also heard of two places called Al-Umrah, the Greater in the Wady F\u00e1timah and the Lesser half way nearer the city (ibid. iii. 344).\n\n[FN#294] A fair specimen of the unworthy egoism which all religious systems virtually inculcate Here a pious father leaves his children miserable to save his own dirty soul.\n\n[FN#295] Chief of the Ban\u00fa Tam\u00edn, one of the noblest of tribes, derived from Tam\u00edm, the uncle of Kuraysh (Koreish); hence the poets sang:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     There cannot be a son nobler than Kuraysh,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor an uncle nobler than Tam\u00edm.\n\nThe high minded Tam\u00edn is contrasted with the mean-spirited Kays, who also gave rise to a tribe; and hence the saying concerning one absolutely inconsistent, \"Art thou now Tam\u00edn and then Kays?\"\n\n[FN#296] Surnamed Al-Sakafi, Governor of Al-Yaman and Irak.\n\n[FN#297] Tenth Ommiade (regn. A H. 105-125 = 724-743).\n\n[FN#298] Or \"clothe thee in worn-out clothes\" i.e. \"Become a Fakir\" or religious mendicant.\n\n[FN#299] This gratuitous incest in ignorance injures the tale and is as repugnant to Moslem as to Christian taste.\n\n[FN#300] The child is named either on the day of its birth or on that day week. The father whispers it in the right ear, often adding the Az\u00e1n or prayer-call, and repeating in the left ear the \"Ik\u00e1mah\" or Friday sentence. There are many rules for choosing names according to the week-day, the ascendant planet, the \"Sortes Coranic\u00e6,\" etc.\n\n[FN#301] Amongst Moslems as amongst Christians there are seven deadly sins: idolatry, murder, falsely charging modest women with unchastity, robbing orphans, usury, desertion in Holy War and disobedience to parents. The difference between the two creeds is noteworthy. And the sage knows only three, intemperance, ignorance and egoism.\n\n[FN#302] Meaning, \"It was decreed by Destiny; so it came to pass,\" appropriate if not neat.\n\n[FN#303] The short, stout, dark, long-haired and two-bunched camel from \"Bukhtar\" (Bactria), the \"Eastern\" (Bakhtar) region on the Amu or Jayhun (Oxus) River; afterwards called Khorasan. The two-humped camel is never seen in Arabia except with northern caravans, and to speak of it would be a sore test of Badawi credulity.\n\n[FN#304] \"Kayl\u00falah\" is the \"forty-winks\" about noon: it is a Sunnat or Practice of the Prophet who said, \"Make the mid-day siesta, for verily at this hour the devils sleep not.\" \"Ayl\u00falain\" is slumbering after morning prayers (our \"beauty-sleep\"), causing heaviness andid leness: \"Ghayl\u00falah\" is dozing about 9 a.m. engendering poverty and wretchedness: \"Kayl\u00falah\" (with the guttural Kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers and \"Fayl\u00falah\" is slumbering after sunset\u2014both held to be highly detrimental. (Pilgrimage ii 49.)\n\n[FN#305] The Biblical \"Hamath\" (Hightown) too well known to require description. It is still famous for the water-wheels mentioned by al-Hariri (assembly of the Banu Har\u00e1m).\n\n[FN#306] When they say, \"The levee flashes bright on the hills of\nAl-Yaman,\" the allusion is to the south quarter, where\nsummer-lightning is seen. Al-Yaman (always with the article) means,\nI have said, the right-hand region to one facing the rising sun and\nAl-Sham (Syria) the left-hand region.\n[FN#307] Again \"he\" for \"she,\" in delicacy and jealousy of making public the beauty or conditions of the \"veiled sex.\" Even public singers would hesitate to use a feminine pronoun. As will be seen however, the rule is not invariably kept and hardly ever in Badawi poetry.\n\n[FN#308] The normal pun on \"Nuzhat al-Zaman\" = Delight of the Age or Time.\n\n[FN#309] The reader will find in my Pilgrimage (i. 305) a sketch of the Takht-rawan or travelling-litter, in which pilgrimesses are wont to sleep.\n\n[FN#310] In poetry it holds the place of our Zephyr; end the \"B\u00e1d- i-Sab\u00e1\"=Breeze o' the morn, Is much addressed by Persian poets.\n\n[FN#311] Here appears the nervous, excitable, hysterical Arab temperament which is almost phrensied by the neighbourhood of a home from which he had run away.\n\n[FN#312] Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman.\n\n[FN#313] The idea is essentially Eastern, \"A lion at home and a lamb abroad\" is the popular saying.\n\n[FN#314] Arab. \"Hubb al-Watan\" (= love of birthplace, patriotism) of which the Tradition says \"Min al-Im\u00e1n\" (=is part of man's religion).\n\n[FN#315] He is supposed to speak en prince; and he yields to a prayer when he spurns a command.\n\n[FN#316] In such caravans each party must keep its own place under pain of getting into trouble with the watchmen and guards.\n\n[FN#317] Mr. Payne (ii. 109) borrows this and the next quotation from the Bull Edit. i. 386.\n\n[FN#318] For the expiation of inconsiderate oaths see Koran (chaps. v.). I cannot but think that Al-Islam treats perjury too lightly: all we can say is-that it improves upon Hinduism which practically seems to leave the punishment to the gods.\n\n[FN#319] \"Kausar,\" as has been said, represents the classical nectar, the Amrita of the Hindus.\n\n[FN#320] From Bull Edit. i. 186. The couplet in the Mac. Edit. i. 457 is very wildly applied.\n\n[FN#321] The \"insula\" of Sancho Panza.\n\n[FN#322] This should have assured him that he stood in no danger.\n\n[FN#323] Here ends the wearisome tale of the brother and sister, and the romance of chivalry begins once more with the usual Arab digressions.\n\n[FN#324] I have derived this word from the Persian \"rang\"=colour, hue, kind.\n\n[FN#325] Otherwise all would be superseded, like U. S. officials under a new President.\n\n[FN#326] Arab. \"N\u00edmshah\" from the Pers. N\u00edmchah, a \"half-sword,\" a long dagger worn in the belt. Richardson derives it from Namsh, being freckled (damasked).\n\n[FN#327] The Indian term for a tent large enough to cover a troop of cavalry.\n\n[FN#328] Arab. \"Marh\u00fam\" a formula before noticed. It is borrowed from the Jewish, \"of blessed memory\" (after the name of the honoured dead, Prov. x. 17.); with the addition of \"upon whom be peace,\" as opposed to the imprecation, \"May the name of the wicked rot!\"\n\n[FN#329] The speeches of the five damsels should be read only by students.\n\n[FN#330] i.e. Those who look for \"another and a better.\"\n\n[FN#331] The title of Caliph Abu Bakr because he bore truthful witness to the Apostle's mission or, others say, he confirmed the \"Mi'r\u00e1j\" or nocturnal journey to Heaven.\n\n[FN#332] All this is Koranic (chaps. ii., etc.).\n\n[FN#333] This may have applied more than once to \"hanging judges\" in the Far West.\n\n[FN#334] A traditionist and jurisconsult of Al-Medinah in the seventh and eighth centuries.\n\n[FN#335] The Alexander of the Koran and Eastern legends, not to be confounded with the Alexander of Macedon.

I (and verse 8 follows). The Archangel Gabriel is supposed to address Mohammed and not a few divines believe this Surah (chapter) to have been first revealed. Mr. Rodwell makes it No. ii. following the Fatrah or silent interval which succeeded No. xcvi. \"Clots of Blood.\" See his 2nd Edit. p. 3 for further details.\n\n[FN#342] i.e. dangerous to soul-health.\n\n[FN#343] In the Mac. Edit. \"Abd\" for \"Sa'id.\" The latter was a black and a native of Cufa during the first century (A.H ) and is still famous as a traditionist.\n\n[FN#344] Arab. \"Shirk,\" giving a partner to Allah, attending chiefly to Christians and idolaters and in a minor degree to Jews and Guebres. We usually English it by \"polytheism,\" which is clumsy and conveys a wrong idea\n\n[FN#345] Grandson of the Caliph Ali. He is one of the Imams\n(High-priests) of the Shi'ah school.\n\n[FN#346] An eminent traditionist of the eighth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#347] The prayers of the Fast-month and Pilgrimage-month are often said in especial places outside the towns and cities; these are the Indian Id(Eed-)g\u00e1h. They have a screen of wall about a hundred yards long with a central prayer-niche and the normal three steps for the preacher; and each extremity is garnished with an imitation minaret. They are also called Nam\u00e1z-gah and one is sketched by Herklots (Plate iii. fig. 2). The object of the trips thither in Zu'l-Ka'adah and Zu'l-Hijjah is to remind Moslems of the \"Ta'ar\u00edf,\" or going forth from Meccah to Mount Arafat.\n\n[FN#348] Arab. \"Al-H\u00e1fi,\" which in Egyptian means sore-footed as well. He was an ascetic of the eighth and ninth centuries (A.D.). He relates a tradition of the famous soldier saint Kh\u00e1lid bin Wal\u00edd who lies buried like the poet Ka'ab al-Ahb\u00e1r near Hums (Emessa) once the Botia, Phrygia, Abdera, Suabia of Syria now Halbun (pronounced Halb\u00e1un) near Damascus. I cannot explain how this Kuraysh noble (a glorious figure in Moslem history) is claimed by the Afghans as one of their countrymen and made to speak Pukhtu or Pushtu, their rough old dialect of Persian. The curious reader will consult my Pilgrimage iii. 322 for the dialogue between Mohammed and Khalid. Again there is general belief in Arabia that the English sent a mission to the Prophet, praying that Khalid might be despatched to proselytise them: unfortunately Mohammed was dead and the \"Ingr\u00edz\" ratted. It is popularly held that no armed man can approach Khalid's grave; but I suppose my revolver did not count.\n\n[FN#349] When he must again wash before continuing prayer.\n\n[FN#350] Bin Adham; another noted ascetic of the eighth century.\nThose curious about these unimportant names will consult the great\nBiographical Dictionary of Ibn Khallikan, translated by Baron\nMacGuckin de Slane (1842-45).\n\n[FN#351] Thus making Bishr the \"Im\u00e1m\" (artistes) lit. one who stands in front. In Koran xvii. 74 it means \"leader\": in ii. 118 Allah makes Abraham an \"Imam to mankind.\"\n\n[FN#352] A favourite sentiment in the East: we find it at the very beginning of Sa'di's Gulistan: better a weal-bringing lie than a harm-dealing truth.\n\n[FN#353] A penny, one sixth of the drachma.\n\n[FN#354] Founder of the Hanbali, fourth (in date) of the four orthodox Moslem schools. The Caliph al-Mu'atasim bi'llah, son of Harun al-Rashid, who believed the Koran to have been created and not a Logos (whatever that may be), co-eternal with Allah, scourged this Imam severely for \"differing in opinion\" (A.H. 220=833). In fact few of the notable reverends of that day escaped without a caress of the scourge or the sword.\n\n[FN#355] A learned man of the eighth century at Bassorah (A.D.).\n\n[FN#356] A traditionist of Khorasan in the ninth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#357] \"Azal,\" opp. to \"Abad,\" eternity without end, infinity.\n\n[FN#358] Koran lxvi. 6.\n\n[FN#359] A traditionist of Al-Medinah, eighth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#360] Arab. \"M\u00fas\u00e1\": the Egyptian word was \"Mesu,\" the \"child\" or the \"boy\" (brought up in the palace?), and the Hebrews made it \"Mosheh\" or \"one drawn out of the water;\" \"Mu\" in Egypt being water, the Arab \"Ma\"; whence probably the moderns have derived the dim. \"Moyeh ,\" vulg. Egyptian for water.\n\n[FN#361] Koran, chaps. xxviii.: Shu'ayb is our Jethro: Koran, chaps. vii. and xi. Mr. Rodwell suggests (p. 101) that the name has been altered from Hobab (Numb. x. 29).\n\n[FN#362] Arab. \"Taub\" (Saub), the long shirt popularly written in English Tobe and pronounced so by Egyptians. It is worn by both sexes (Lane, M. E. chaps. i. \"Tob\") in Egypt, and extends into the heart of Moslem Africa: I can compare it with nothing but a long nightgown dyed a dirty yellow by safflower and about as picturesque as a carter's smock-frock.\n\n[FN#363] There is nothing of this in the Koran; and it is a most unhappy addition, as Moses utterly and pretentiously ignored a \"next world.\"\n\n[FN#364] Koran xxviii. 22-27. Mohammed evidently confounded the contract between Laban and Jacob. (Gen. xxix. 15-39.)\n\n[FN#365] So says Al-Hariri (Ass. of Sasan), \"The neighbour before the house and the traveller before the journey.\" In certain cities the neighbourhood is the real detective police, noting every action and abating scandals (such as orgies, etc.) with a strong hand and with the full consent of public opinion and of the authorities. This loving the neighbour shows evident signs of being borrowed from Christianity.\n\n[FN#366] Al-Asamm a theologian of Balkh, ninth century (A.D.).\n\n[FN#367] The founder of the Senior School, for which see Sale Prel.\nDisc. sect. viii.\n\n[FN#368] Thus serving the Lord by sinning against his own body.\n\n[FN#369] An Egyptian doctor of the law (ninth century).\n\n[FN#370] Koran lxxvii. 35, 36. This is one of the earliest and most poetical chapters of the book.\n\n[FN#371] Abu Hanifah was scourged for refusing to take office and was put to death in prison, it is said by poison (A.H. 150=A.D. 767), for a judicial sentence authorising rebellion against the second Abbaside, Al-Mansur, surnamed Abu'l-Daw\u00e1nik (Father of Pence) for his exceeding avarice.\n\n[FN#372] \"L\u00e1 rayba f\u00ed-hi\" says the Koran (ii. 1) of itself; and the saying is popularly applied to all things of the Faith.\n\n[FN#373] Arab. \"Riv\u00e1l al-Ghayb,\" somewhat like the \"Himalayan Brothers\" of modern superstition. See Herklots (Qanoon-e-Islam) for a long and careful description of these \"Mard\u00e1n-i-Ghayb\" (Pers.), a \"class of people mounted on clouds,\" invisible, but moving in a circular orbit round the world, and suggesting the Hindu \"Lokap\u00e1las.\" They should not be in front of the traveller nor on his right, but either behind or on his left hand. Hence tables, memorial couplets and hemistichs are required to ascertain the station, without which precaution journeys are apt to end badly.\n\n[FN#374] A sweetmeat before noticed.\n\n[FN#375] Door hinges in the east are two projections for the top and bottom of the leaf playing in hollows of the lintel and threshold. It appears to be the primitive form, for we find it in the very heart of Africa. In the basaltic cities of the Hauran, where the doors are of thick stone, they move easily on these pins. I found them also in the official (not the temple)City of Palmyra, but all broken.\n\n[FN#376] The effect of the poison and of the incantation which accompanied it.\n\n[FN#377] King Omar who had raped her. My sympathies are all with the old woman who nightly punished the royal lecher.\n\n[FN#378] Arab. \"Zunn\u00e1r,\" the Gr. . Christians and Jews were compelled by the fanatical sumptuary laws of the Caliph Al- Mutawakkil (AD. 856) to wear a broad leather belt in public, hence it became a badge of the Faith. Probably it was confounded with the \"Janeo\" (Brahmanical thread) and the Parsi sacred girdle called Kashti. (Dabistan i, 297, etc.). Both Mandeville and La Brocqui\u00e8re speak of \"Christians of the Girdle, because they are all girt above,\" intending Jacobites or Nestorians.\n\n[FN#379] \"Sil\u00e1h d\u00e1r\" (Arab. and Pers.)=a military officer of high rank; literally an \"armour-bearer,\" chosen for velour and trustworthiness. So Jonathan had a \"young man\" (brave) who bare his armour (I Sam. xiv. 1, 6 and 7); and Goliath had a man that bare the shield before him (ibid. xvii. 7, 41). Men will not readily forget the name of Sulayman Agha, called the Silahdar, in Egypt. (Lane M. E. chaps. iv.)\n\n[FN#380] It will be told afterwards.\n\n[FN#381] The elder brother thus showed himself a vassal and proved himself a good Moslem by not having recourse to civil war.\n\n[FN#382] Arab. \"Ghazwah,\" the corrupt Gallicism, now\nEuropeanised=raid, foray.\n[FN#383] Turk in modern parlance means a Turkoman, a pomade: the settled people call themselves Osmanli or Othmanli. Turkoman=Turk- like.\n\n[FN#384] Arab. \"Nims\u00e1;\" southern Germans, Austrians; from the Slav. \"Nemica\" (any Germans), literally meaning \"The dumb\" (nemac), because they cannot speak Slav.\n\n[FN#385] Arab. \"Dub\u00e1r\u00e1\" from the Slav. \"Dubrovnik,\" from \"Dub\" (an oak) and \"Dubrava\" (an oak forest). Ragusa, once a rival of Venice, gave rise to the word \"Argosy.\" D'Herbelot calls it \"Dobravenedik\" or \"Good Venice,\" the Turkish name, because it paid tribute when Venice would not (?).\n\n[FN#386] Arab. \"Jawarnah,\" or, \"J\u00farnah\" evidently Zara, a place of many names, Jadera (Hirtius de Bell. Alex. cap. 13), Jadra, Zadra (whence the modern term), Diadora, Diadosca and Jadrossa. This important Liburnian city sent forth many cruisers in crusading days; hence the Arabs came to know its name.\n\n[FN#387] Arab. \"Banu'l-Asfar;\" which may mean \"Pale faces,\" in the sense of \"yeller girls\" (New Orleans) and that intended by North American Indians, or, possibly, the peoples with yellow (or rather tow-coloured) hair we now call Russians. The races of Hindostan term the English not \"white men,\" but \"red men;\" and the reason will at once be seen by comparing a Britisher with a high-caste N\u00e1gar Brahman whose face is of parchment colour as if he had drunk exsangue cuminum. The Yellow-faces of the text correspond with the Sansk. \"Svetadvipa\"\u2014Whiteman's Land.\n\n[FN#388] Arab. \"Al-Musakhkham.\" No Moslem believes that Isa was crucified and a favourite fancy is that Judas, changed to the likeness of Jesus, thus paid for his treason. (Evangel. Barnab\u00e6.) Hence the resurrection is called not \"Kiy\u00e1mah\" but \"Kum\u00e1mah\"=rubbish. This heresy about the Cross they share with the Docetes, \"certain beasts in the shape of men\" (says Ignatius), who held that a phantom was crucified. So far the Moslems are logical, for \"Isa,\" being angelically, miraculously and immaculately conceived, could not be; but they contradict themselves when they hold a vacant place near Mohammed's tomb for the body of Isa after his second coming as a forerunner to Mohammed and Doomday. (Pilgrimage ii. 89.)\n\n[FN#389] A diviner, priest, esp. Jewish, and not belonging to the tribe of Levi.\n\n[FN#390] Again the coarsest word \"Khara.\" The allusion is to the\nvulgar saying, \"Thou eatest skite!\" (i.e. thou talkest nonsense).\nDecent English writers modify this to, \"Thou eatest dirt:\" and Lord\nBeaconsfield made it ridiculous by turning it into \"eating sand.\"\n[FN#391] These silly scandals, which cause us only to smile, excite\nEasterns to fury. I have seen a Moslem wild with rage on hearing a\nChristian parody the opening words of the Koran, \"Bismillahi 'l-\nRahm\u00e1ni 'l-Rah\u00edm, Mismish wa Kamar al-din,\" roughly translated,\n\n\"In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate! Apricots and marmalede.\" The idea of the Holy Merde might have been suggested by the Hindus: see Mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton (prelate) carrying ox-dung and urine to the King, who therewith anoints his brow and breast, &c. And, incredible to relate, this is still practiced after a fashion by the Parsis, one of the most progressive and the sharpest witted of Asiatic races.\n\n[FN#392] Meaning that he had marked his brow with a cross (of ashes?) as certain do on Ash Wednesday.\n\n[FN#393] Syria, the \"left-hand land\" as has before been explained. The popular saying about its people is \"Sh\u00e1mi sh\u00fami!\"\u2014the Syrian is small potatoes (to render the sense Americanic\u00e8). Nor did Syrus, the slave in Roman days, bear the best of names. In Al-Hijaz the Syrian is addressed \"Ab\u00fa Sh\u00e1m\" (Father of Syria) and insulted as \"Abuser of the Salt\" (a traitor). Yet many sayings of Mohammed are recorded in honour of Syria, and he sometimes used Syriac words. Such were \"Bakh, bakh\" (=euge, before noticed), and \"Kakh,\" a congener of the Latin Cacus and Caca which our day has docked to \"cack.\" (Pilgrimage iii. 115)\n\n[FN#394] Koran xiv. 34. \"They (Unbelievers) shall be thrown therein (i.e., the House of Perdition=Hell); and an unhappy dwelling shall it be.\"\n\n[FN#395] The leg-cut is a prime favourite with the Eastern Sworder, and a heavy two-handed blade easily severs a horse's leg.\n\n[FN#396] Mohammed repeatedly declared (Koran lxi.) that the Christians had falsified the passage (\"I go to my Father and the Paraclete shall come,\" John xvi. 7) promising the advent of the Comforter, (ibid. xiv. 20; xv. 26) by substituting the latter word for glorious, renowned, i.e., Ahmed or Mohammed=the praised one. This may have been found in the Arabic translation of the Gospels made by Warakah, cousin to Mohammed's first wife; and hence in Koran lxi. we find Jesus prophesying of an Apostle \"whose name shall be Ahmad.\" The word has consequently been inserted into the Arabic Gospel of Saint Barnabas (Dabistan iii. 67). Moslems accept the Pentateuch, the Psalter and the Gospel; but assert (Koran, passim.) that all extant copies have been hopelessly corrupted, and they are right. Moses, to whom the Pentateuch is attributed, notices his own death and burial\u2014\"the mair the miracle,\" said the old Scotch lady. The \"Psalms of David\" range over a period of some five hundred years, and there are three Isaiahs who pass with the vulgar for one. The many apocryphal Gospels, all of which have been held genuine and canonical at different times and in different places, prove that the four, which are still in use, were retained because they lack the manifest absurdities of their discarded rivals.\n\n[FN#397] Arab. \" Labbayka; \" the Pilgrimage-cry (Night xxii.) which in Arabic is,\n\nLabbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!\nL\u00e1 Shar\u00edka lake, Labbayk'!\nInna 'l-hamda w'al ni'amata lake wa'l mulk!\nLabbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!\n\nSome add \"Here am I, and I honour Thee, the son of Thy two slaves; beneficence and good are all between Thy hands.\"With the \"Talbiyah\" the pilgrims should bless the Prophet, pray Allah to grant Heaven and exclaim, \"By Thy mercy spare us from the pains of Hell-fire!\" (Pilgrimage iii. 232.) Labbayka occurs in the verses attributed to Caliph Ali; so labba=he faced, and yalubbu=it faces (as one house faces another); lastly, he professed submission to Allah; in which sense, together with the verbal noun \"Talbiyah,\" it is used by Al- Hanri (Pref. and Ass. of Su'adah).\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Kiss\u00eds\" (plur. Kus\u00fas) from .\n\n[FN#399] Koran ii. The \"red cow\" is evidently the \"red heifer\" of\nBarnabas, chaps. vii.\n\n[FN#400] Arab. \"Al-J\u00e1sal\u00edk\"= .\n\n[FN#401] This is from the first \"Gospel of Infancy,\" wherein Jesus said to his mother, \"Verily I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Word which thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel did declare unto thee; and my Father hath sent me to save the world\" (chaps. i. 2.). The passage is virtually quoted in the Koran (chaps. iii. 141), of course omitting \" the Son of God\"\n\n[FN#402] Mohammed allowed his locks to grow down to his ear-lobes but never lower.\n\n[FN#403] Arab. \"Lis\u00e1m\" I have explained as a covering for the lower face, made by drawing over it the corner of the head-kerchief (Pilgrimage i. 346). The Lis\u00e1m of the African Taw\u00e1rik hoods the eyes so that a man must turn up his face to see, and swathes all the lower half, leaving only the nose exposed. And this is worn by many men by night as well as by day, doubtless to avoid the evil eye. The native Sultans of Darfur, like those of Bornu and others further west, used white muslin as a face-wrap: hence, too, the ceremonies when spitting, etc., etc. The K\u00fafiyah or head-kerchief of the Arabs soon reached Europe and became in Low Latin Cuphia; in Spanish Escofia; in Ital. Cuffia or Scuffia; in French Escoffion, Scofion (Reine Marguerite) Co\u00ebffe (une pellicule, marque de bonheur) Coiffe and Coife, &c.; the Scotch Curch or Coif, opposed to the maiden snood, and, lastly our Sergeant-at-Law's Coif. Littr\u00e9, the Learned, who in erudition was n\u00e9 coiff\u00e9, has missed this obvious derivation.\n\n[FN#404] \"Cutting,\" throughout the book, alludes to the scymitar with which Arabs never give point; and \"thrusting\" to the footman's spear and the horseman's lance.\n\n[FN#405] A popular phrase, I repeat, for extreme tenor and consternation.\n\n[FN#406] The name usually applies to a well-known district and city of Al Yaman, where \"Koss the eloquent\" was bishop in Mohammed's day: the Negiran of D'Herbelot. Here, however, it is the Syrian Najr\u00e1n (Nejr\u00e2n of Missionary Porter's miserable Handbook), now a wretched village near the volcanic Lajj\u00e1, about one hundred and twenty miles direct south of Damascus and held by Druzes and Christians.\n\n[FN#407] The Kant\u00e1r (quintal) of 100 ratls (Ibs.) =98-99 Ibs. avoir.\n\n[FN#408] Arab. \"Jur\u00e1b (bag) mi'adat- ih (of his belly),\" the \"curdling of the testicles\" in fear is often mentioned.\n\n[FN#409] Clearly alluding to the magic so deeply studied by medi\u00e6val Jews.\n\n[FN#410] Arab. \"Sah\u00e1kah,\" lit. rubbing. The Moslem Harem is a great school for this \"Lesbian (which I would call Atossan) love \"; but the motive of the practice lies deeper. As amongst men the mixture of the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, so the reverse makes women prefer their own sex. These tribades are mostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeks and upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the large projecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the Arabs as \"bazar\" hence Tabz\u00edr=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris. Burckhardt (Prov. 436) translates \" Bazarah\" by slut or wench. He adds \" it originally signifies the labia which the Cairenes also entice Zamb\u00far and which are cut off in girlhood.\" See also Lane, Lex. s.v.; Tabz\u00edr. Both writers confuse excision of the nymph\u00e6 with circumcision of the clitoris (Zamb\u00far) Al-Siy\u00fati (Kitab al-Iz\u00e1' fi'Ilm al-Nikah) has a very interesting chapter on Sapphic venery, which is well known to Europe as proved by such works as \"Gamiani,\" and \"Anandria ou Confessions de Mademoiselle Sappho, avec la Clef,\" Lesbos, 1718. Onanism is fatally prevalent: in many Harems and girls' schools tallow candles and similar succedanea are vainly forbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to be useless; of late years, however, China has sent some marvellous artificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, the latter material of course borrowed from Europe.\n\n[FN#411] This is considered a powerful aphrodisiac in the East. Hence male devotees are advised to avoid tile \"two reds,\" i.e. meat and wine; while the \"two reds,\" which corrupt women, are gold and saffron, that is perfumery. Hence also the saying of Mohammed:\u2014 \"Perfumes for men should have scent and not colour; for women should have colour and not scent.\" (Mishk\u00e1t al-Mas\u00e1b\u00edh ii. 361.)\n\n\n[FN#412] These are the \"Hib\u00e1s\" or thin cords of wool which the\nBadawi binds round his legs, I believe to keep off cramp.\n(Pilgrimage iii. 78).\n\n[FN#413] Crying out \"La il\u00e1ha illa 'llah.\" (There is no god but the\nGod.); technically called \"Tahl\u00edl.\"\n\n[FN#414] i.e. Men, angels and devils, the \"Triloka\" (triple people) of the Hindus. Alam\u00edn (plur.), never Alamayn (dual), is the Triregno denoted by the papal Tiara, the three Christian kingdoms being Heaven, Hell and Purgatory.\n\n[FN#415] Matrahinna or Mit-Rahinah is a well-known village near Memphis, the name being derived from the old Egyptian Minat-ro- hinnu, the port at the mouth of the canal. Let me remark that two of these three words, \"Minat\" and \"Ru,\" are still common in \" Aryan\" Persian.\n\n[FN#416] Kir\u00e1mat, a sign, a prodigy, opposed to Mu'ujizah, a miracle wrought by a prophet. The Sufis explain this thaumaturgy by Allah changing something of Nature's ordinary course in favour of an especial worshipper, and, after a fashion, this is Catholic doctrine (See Dabistan, iii. 173).\n\n[FN#417] Koran, x. 25, \"until the earth receive its vesture and be adorned with various plants.\"\n\n[FN#418] i.e. the young hair sprouting on the boy's cheek.\n\n[FN#419] A fighter for the faith and now a title which follows the name, e.g. Osm\u00e1n P\u00e1sh\u00e1 Gh\u00e1z\u00ed, whom the English press dubbed \"Ghazi Osman.\"\n\n[FN#420] That is the King of Constantinople.\n\n[FN#421] Cassia fistularis, a kind of carob: \" Shambar\" is the\nArab. form of the Persian \" Chambar.\"\n\n[FN#422] Koran, ii. 149. Hence the vulgar idea that Martyrs are still alive in the flesh. See my Pilgrimage (ii. 110 and elsewhere) for the romantic and picturesque consequences of that belief. The Commentators (Jal\u00e1l al-D\u00edn, etc.) play tricks with the Koranic words, \" they (martyrs) are not dead but living\" (iii. 179) by placing the happy souls in the crops of green birds which eat of the fruits and drink of the waters of Paradise; whereas the reprobates and the (very) wicked are deposited in black birds which drain the sanies and the boiling waters of Hell. Amongst the Greeks a body remaining entire long after death suggests Anathema Maranatha: it is the contrary with Catholic Christians (Boccaccio iv. 5, of the Pot of Basil). Concerning this creed see Maundrell, Letter of 1698.\n\n[FN#423] Tor is \"Mount Sinai\" in the Koran (xcv. 1). I have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: \"It is evident that Jebel Serbal dates only from the early days of Coptic Christianity; that Jebel Musa, its Greek rival, rose after the visions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of the Convent by Justinian belongs to A.D 527. Ras Safs\u00e1fah, its rival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called the invention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the south is the property of R\u00fcppell\" (Midian Revisited i., 237). I would therefore call the \"Sinaitic\" Peninsula, Peninsula of Paran in old days and Peninsula of Tor (from its chief port) in our time. It is still my conviction that the true Mount Sinai will be found in Jabal Ar\u00e1if, or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern Hajj- road from Suez to Akabah. Even about the name (which the Koran writes \"Sain\u00e1\" and \"S\u00edn\u00edn\") there is a dispute: It is usually derived from the root \"Sanah\"=sentis, a bush; but this is not satisfactory. Our eminent Assyriologist, Professor Sayce, would connect it with \"Sin,\" the Assyrian Moon- god as Mount Nebo with the Sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a Lunar temple as a Solar fane stands on Ba'al Zapuna (Baal Zephon) or the classical Mount Casius.\n\n[FN#424] Alluding to the miracle of Aaron's rod (the gift of Jethro) as related in the Koran (chapts. vii. 1., xx., etc.), where the Egyptian sorcerers threw down thick ropes which by their magic twisted and coiled like serpents.\n\n[FN#425] Arab. \"Ay\u00e1t\" lit. \"signs,\" here \"miracles of the truth,\" 1. c. Koranic versets as opposed to chapters. The ranks of the enemy represent the latter, sword-cuts the former\u2014a very persuasive mode of preaching.\n\n[FN#426] Lane (M. E. chapt.. iii.) shows by a sketch the position of the worshipper during this \"Sal\u00e1m\" which is addressed, some say, to the guardian angels, others suppose to all brother-believers and angels.\n\n[FN#427] i.e., where the Syrians found him.\n\n[FN#428] i.e., Dedianus Arabised; a name knightly and plebian.\n\n[FN#429] In such tales the Wazir is usually the sharp-witted man, contrasting with the \"dummy,\" or master.\n\n[FN#430] Carrier-pigeons were extensively used at this time. The Caliph Al-N\u00e1sir li-D\u00edni ll\u00e1h (regn. A.H. 575=1180) was, according to Ibn Khald\u00fan, very fond of them. The moderns of Damascus still affect them. My successor, Mr. Consul Kirby Green, wrote an excellent report on pigeon-fancying at Damascus. The so-called Maundeville or Mandeville in A. D. 1322 speaks of carrier-pigeons in Syria as a well-known mode Of intercourse between lord and lord.\n\n[FN#431] Mohammed who declared \"There is no monkery in Al-Islam,\" and who virtually abolished the priest, had an especial aversion to the shaveling (Ruhb\u00e1n). But the \"Gens \u00e6terna in qu\u00e2 nemo nascitur\" (Pliny v. 17) managed to appear even in Al-lslam, as Fakirs,, Dervishes, S\u00fafis, etc. Of this more hereafter.\n\n[FN#432] i.e. her holiness would act like a fascinating talisman.\n\n[FN#433] The \"smoking out\" practice is common amongst the Arabs: hence Marshal Pelissier's so- called \" barbarity.\" The Public is apt to forget that on a campaign the general's first duty is to save his own men by any practice which the laws of fair warfare do not absolutely forbid.\n\n[FN#434] i.e. Mohammed, who promised Heaven and threatened Hell.\n\n[FN#435] Arab. \"Ahr\" or \"ihr,\" fornication or adultery, i.e., irreligion, infidelity as amongst the Hebrews (Isaiah xxiii.17).\n\n[FN#436] A sign of defeat.\n\n[FN#437] In English \"last night\": I have already noted that the Moslem day, like the Jewish and the Scandinavian, begins at sundown; and \"layl \" a night, is often used to denote the twenty- four hours between sunset and sunset, whilst \"yaum,\" a day, would by us be translated in many cases \"battle-day.\"\n\n[FN#438] Iterum the \"Himalayan Brothers.\"\n\n[FN#439] Again, Mohammed who promised Good to the Good, and vice vers\u00e2.\n\n[FN#440] They are sad doggrel like most of the pi\u00e8ces d'occasion inserted in The Nights.\n\n[FN#441] Here \"Kahwah\" (coffee) is used in its original sense of strong old wine. The derivation is \"Akh\u00e1\"=fastidire fecit, causing disinclination for food, the Matambre (kill- hunger) of the Iberians. In old days the scrupulous called coffee \"Kihwah\" in order to distinguish it from 'Kakwah,\" wine.\n\n[FN#442] i.e. Mohammed, a common title.\n\n[FN#443] That is, fatal to the scoffer and the impious.\n\n[FN#444] Equivalent to our \"The Devil was sick,\" etc.\n\n[FN#445] i.e. to the enemy: the North American Indians (so called) use similar forms of \"inverted speech\"; and the Australian aborigines are in no way behind them.\n\n[FN#446] See Vol. i., p. 154 (Night xvi.).\n\n[FN#447] Arab. \"Sauf,\" a particle denoting a near future whereas\n\"Sa-\" points to one which may be very remote.\n\n[FN#448] From the root \"Shanh\"=having a fascinating eye, terrifying. The Irish call the fascinater \"eybitter\" and the victim (who is also rhymed to death) \"eybitten.\"\n\n[FN#449] i.e., not like the noble-born, strong in enduring the stress of fight.\n\n[FN#450] i.e., of Abraham. For the Well Zemzem and the Place of Abraham see my Pilgrimage (iii. 171-175, etc.), where I described the water as of salt-bitter taste, like that of Epsom (iii. 203). Sir William Muir (in his excellent life of Mahomet, I. cclviii.) remarks that \"the flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn;\" but soldered tins-full of water drawn a fortnight before are to be had in Calcutta and elsewhere after Pilgrimage time; and analysis would at once detect the salt.\n\n[FN#451] Racing was and is a favourite pastime with those hippomanists, the Arabs; but it contrasts strongly with our civilised form being a trial of endurance rather than of speed.

His (Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was and there being no pumps of Vartry water available for their ablutions, let alone drinking purposes, hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt Bridge, where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e. d. ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly, after a few such preliminaries, as, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, brushing, they both walked together along Beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as far as the farrier's and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens Street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But, as he confidently anticipated, there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.\n\nThis was a quandary but, bringing commonsense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullet's and the Signal House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons, though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So, as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion \u00e0 propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour, and, passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night), ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at present unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's, the stonecutter's, in his mind somehow in Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his fidus Achates, inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke's the baker's, it is said.\n\nEn route, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events, was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while, though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little juijitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward, or, failing that, the Bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias, or, he being the solicitor, rather old Wall, he meant to say, or Malony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the City, Pembroke Road, for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description, liable to go off at any time, which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall nut over anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of #. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and blood-making and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confr\u00e8res but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.\n\n\u2014And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.\n\nDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge when a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's Gumley. To avoid a meeting be drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.\n\n\u2014Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\nA figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted again, calling: Night! Stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of inherent delicacy, inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business, moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. Although unusual in the Dublin area, he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garotted.\n\nStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in any over sober state himself, recognised Corley's breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley, some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corley of the G Division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael Corley, of New Ross, had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it, though not proved, that she descended from the house of the Lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, his mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.\n\nTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends had all deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalled-for expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow, he was ill in.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I'm on the rocks.\n\n\u2014There'll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen told him, in a boys' school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garret Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.\n\n\u2014Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.\n\n\u2014I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.\n\nCorley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn't said a word about it.\n\nThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley's brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving of much credence. However, haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco, etcetera, as the Latin poet remarks, especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it Out of Corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful - whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat. But the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however, as it turned out.\n\n\u2014Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.\n\nAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.\n\n\u2014Thanks, Corley answered. You're a gentleman. I'll pay you back some time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeper.\n\nSubsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's bookkeeper there, that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.\nMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman's sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally, testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his next door neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude, with or without the option of a fine, would be a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.\n\nThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:\n\n\u2014He's down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.\n\nAt this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucket dredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse Quay and quite possibly Out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:\n\n\u2014Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?\n\n\u2014Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.\n\n\u2014Needs, Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds. But talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is Out of the question and, even supposing you did, you won't get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father's house?\n\n\u2014To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.\n\n\u2014I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned. Today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.\n\n\u2014I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?\n\n\u2014A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately, Out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying, as if the whole bally station belonged to them, to give Stephen the slip in the confusion.\n\nThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister, Dilly, sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were in your shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn't notice as much as I did but it wouldn't occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.\nHe understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it? was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.\n\n\u2014Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.\n\nThe guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by friendliness, which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or three low spirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to more or less... Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.\n\nAdjacent to the men's public urinal he perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.\n\n\u2014Putana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!\n\n\u2014Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi\u00f9\n\n\u2014Dice lui, pero.\n\n\u2014Farabutto! Mortacci sui!\n\nMr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been before; the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the invincible, though he wouldn't vouch for the actual facts, which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner, only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo, already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation, for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.\n\n\u2014Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say a roll of some description.\n\nAccordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores, or whatever they were, after a cursory examination, turned their eyes, apparently dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous individual, a portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.\n\nMr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in an audible tone of voice, apropos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:\n\n\u2014Beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write your poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! it is so melodious and full. Belladonna voglio.\n\nStephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from dead lassitude generally, replied:\n\n\u2014To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.\n\n\u2014Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.\n\nThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed, after which he beat a retreat to his counter. Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to... for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.\n\n\u2014Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time. Like names, Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody, Jesus, Mr Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?\n\n\u2014Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.\n\nThe redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:\n\n\u2014And what might your name be?\n\nJust in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure, from an unexpected quarter, answered:\n\n\u2014Dedalus.\n\nThe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.\n\n\u2014You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.\n\n\u2014I've heard of him, Stephen said.\n\nMr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.\n\n\u2014He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.\n\n\u2014All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.\n\nAs for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other Occupants of the shelter with the remark: I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. The left hand dead shot.\n\nThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.\n\n\u2014Bottle Out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.\n\nHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he screwed his features up some way sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\n\n\u2014Pom, he then shouted once.\n\nThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.\n\n\u2014Pom, he shouted twice.\n\nEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:\n\nBuffalo Bill shoots to kill,\nNever missed nor he never will.\n\nA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.\n\n\u2014Beg pardon, the sailor said.\n\n\u2014Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.\n\n\u2014Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.\n\n\u2014Murphy's my name, the sailor continued, W. B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?\n\n\u2014Queenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.\n\n\u2014That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's where I hails from. My little woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. For England, home and beauty. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years now, sailing about.\n\nMr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene - the homecoming to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones - a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way? Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grass widow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead. Rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Boo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband, W. B. Murphy.\n\nThe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:\n\n\u2014You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?\n\nThe jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.\n\n\u2014Thank you, the sailor said.\n\nHe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:\n\n\u2014We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon. There's my discharge. See? W. B. Murphy, A. B. S.\n\nIn confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbours a not very clean looking folded document.\n\n\u2014You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered, upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain Dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilooy. That's how the Russians prays.\n\n\u2014You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug, I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.\n\nHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously.\n\n\u2014Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.\n\nHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.\n\nAll focused their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping, amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.\n\n\u2014Chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver raw.\n\nHis postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes, if not more.\n\n\u2014Know how to keep them off? he inquired genially.\n\nNobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:\n\n\u2014Glass. That boggles 'em. Glass.\n\nMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows: Tarjeta Postal. Se\u00f1or A. Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat), having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's bona fides, nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside, considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on, culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower, abbey, wealth of Park Lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C. P. M'Coy type - lend me your valise and I'll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irish cast, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with its own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.\n\nAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the tapis in the Circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.\n\nIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for a matter of a couple of paltry pounds, was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime, for choice, when Dame Nature is at her spectacular best, constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs, even, Poulaphouca, to which there was a steam tram, but also farther away from the madding crowd, in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen, so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds of Donegal, where if report spoke true, the coup d'oeil was exceedingly grand, though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it, while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men, especially in the spring when young men s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the pillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to fathom, it seemed to him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or vice-versa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to Stephen.\n\n\u2014I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened, and every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the Chinese does.\n\nPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces, the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures.\n\n\u2014And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his back. Knife like that.\n\nWhilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking clasp knife, quite in keeping with his character, and held it in the striking position.\n\n\u2014In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. Prepare to meet your God, says he. Chuck! It went into his back up to the butt.\n\nHis heavy glance, drowsily roaming about, kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to. That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable stiletto.\n\nAfter which harrowing d\u00e9nouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.\n\n\u2014They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.\n\nAt this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss, Mr Bloom and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias the keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His inscrutable face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on. Funny very.\n\nThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading by fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives choza de; another, the seaman's discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some score of years previously, in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.\n\n\u2014Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.\n\nThe request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.\n\n\u2014Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.\n\nThe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no.\n\n\u2014Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.\n\n\u2014What year would that be about? Mr Bloom interpolated. Can you recall the boats?\n\nOur soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile, hungrily, before answering.\n\n\u2014I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.\n\nTired, seemingly, he ceased. His questioner, perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe. Suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant, to rule the waves. On more than one occasion - a dozen at the lowest - near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under - well, not exactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance, which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason, if no other, lifeboat Sunday was a very laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living, inland or seaside,-is the case might be, having it brought home to them like that, should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season, when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on, and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.\n\n\u2014There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded. Went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman's valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I've on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I'm game for that job, shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There's my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.\n\n\u2014What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance. My son Danny? He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it.\n\nThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink, intended to represent an anchor.\n\n\u2014There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked. Sure as nuts. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It's them black lads I objects to. I hate those buggers. Sucks your blood dry, they does.\n\nSeeing they were all looking at his chest, he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that, on top of the time honoured symbol of the mariner's hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man's sideface looking frowningly rather.\n\n\u2014Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton Fellow the name of Antonio done that. There he is himself, a Greek.\n\n\u2014Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.\n\nThat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the someway in his. Squeezing or...\n\n\u2014See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is, cursing the mate. And there he is now, he added. The same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.\n\nAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody, including Skin-the-Goat who this time stretched over.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.\n\nHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.\n\n\u2014Neat bit of work, longshoreman one said.\n\n\u2014And what's the number for? loafer number two queried.\n\n\u2014Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time, with some sort of a half smile, for a brief duration only, in the direction of the questioner about the number. A Greek he was.\n\nAnd then he added, with rather gallowsbird humour, considering his alleged end:\n\n\u2014As bad as old Antonio,\nFor he left me on my ownio.\n\nThe face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat, peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment, flusterfied but outwardly calm, and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink? His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.), and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not?\n\nYour washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles Street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say. Love me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round Skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her.\n\n\u2014The gunboat, the keeper said.\n\n\u2014It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter what the cause is from...\n\nStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:\n\n\u2014In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\n\nThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said that it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing he could truthfully state he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of that sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.\n\n\u2014 You, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\n\nThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:\n\n\u2014They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette.\n\nMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:\n\n\u2014Simple? I shouldn't think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays R\u00f6ntgen did, Or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time, Galileo was the man I mean. The same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.\n\n\u2014O, that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the best known passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence. On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.\n\n\u2014Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point. I'm not so sure about that. That's a matter of every man's opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them, like Hamlet and Bacon, as you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn't tell you. Can't you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it and take a piece of that bun. It's like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still, no one can give what he hasn't got. Try a bit.\n\n\u2014Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.\n\nFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to stir, or try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good. Shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings, and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. On the other hand, he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison, SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't remember when it was or where. Anyhow, inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.\n\n\u2014Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.\n\nThus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle - it clopped out of it when taken up - by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.\n\n\u2014Still, it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.\n\n\u2014Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But oblige me by taking away that knife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\n\nMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.\n\n\u2014Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom, apropos of knives, remarked to his confidente sotto voce. Do you think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.\n\nYet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.\n\nHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up, ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen Of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera. And when all was said and done, the lies a fellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.\n\nMind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though, that is rather a far cry you see once in a way. Marcella, the midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn't straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like to call them, behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There's an example again of simple souls.\n\nHowever, reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains), there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary, that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those Italianos, though candidly he was none the less free to admit those ice creamers and friers in the fish way, not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth, over in little Italy there, near the Coombe, were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuck in with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\n\n\u2014Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus double quick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half, that is. Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette, black. I, for one, certainly believe climate accounts for character. That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.\n\n\u2014The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.\n\n\u2014Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.\n\n\u2014Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle, Miss Portinari, he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.\n\n\u2014It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the Kildare street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind of women here. An exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings - it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but still it's a thing I simply hate to see.\n\nInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy, of course, had his own say to say. He had doubled the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.\n\nSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck of Daunt's rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque - nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it, Palme, on Booterstown Strand, that was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times) breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. Lady Cairns of Swansea, run into by the Mona, which was on an Opposite tack, in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the Mona's, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.\n\nAt this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat.\n\n\u2014Let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour, who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful dose.\n\nHe made tracks heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom, who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it, or unscrew, and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female, who, however, had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and girders of the Loop Line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but, after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme, the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself close at hand, the noise of his bilge-water some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently woke a horse of the cabrank.\n\nA hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brasier of live coke, the watcher of the corporation, who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability, from dictates of humanity, knowing him before - shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in the arms of Morpheus. A truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool #100 a year at one time which of course the double-barrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink, without a beggarly stiver. He drank, needless to be told, and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if - a big if, however - he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.\n\nAll, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra Basin, the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.\n\nThere were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently au fait.\n\nWhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask her captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British Government gave him for that day's work. Captain John Lever of the Lever line.\n\n\u2014Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.\n\nThat worthy, picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words, growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some Kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soir\u00e9e, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:\n\n\u2014The biscuits was as hard as brass,\nAnd the beef as salt as Lot's wife's arse.\nO Johnny Lever!\nJohnny Lever, O!\n\nAfter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and, regaining his seat, he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.\n\nSkin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds' worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling up the best meat in the market, and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was Colonel Everard down there in Cavan growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice - thoroughly monopolising all the conversation - was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero - a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.\n\nSilence all round marked the termination of his finale. The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed.\n\n\u2014Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.\n\nTo which cold douche, referring to downfall and so on, the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.\n\n\u2014Who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and generals we've got? Tell me that.\n\n\u2014The Irish for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.\n\n\u2014That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic peasant. He's the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?\n\nWhile allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words, when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows.\n\nFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went On, that turned Out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries, even though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place, rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, as the lookeron, a student of the human soul, if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (Bloom) couldn't help feeling, and most properly, it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen's evidence - or king's now - like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that, he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel, and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was), a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south - have her or swing for her - when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (the man having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on\n\nhis adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell - positively last performance then come up smiling again. Generous to a fault, of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some #. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the others, he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo, as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.\n\nHe took umbrage at something or other, that much injured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew, and in a heated fashion, offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts in the least, told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his family, like me, though in reality I'm not. That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath. He hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone saw. Am I not right?\n\nHe turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly.\n\n\u2014Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is, or, after all, any other, secundum carnem.\n\n\u2014Of course, Mr Bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It's all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality? I resent violence or intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak.\n\n\u2014Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen assented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right and the whole world was overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing.\n\n\u2014You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely.\n\nAll those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood - bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag - were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.\n\n\u2014They accuse - remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, who probably... and spoke nearer to, so as the others... in case they...\n\n\u2014Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History - would you be surprised to learn? - proves up to' the hilt Spain decayed when the Inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects, has much to answer for, imported them. Why? Because they are practical and are proved to be so. I don't want to indulge in any... because you know the standard works on the subject, and then, orthodox as you are... But in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America. Turks, it's in the dogma. Because if they didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better - at least, so I think. That's the juggle on which the p.p.'s raise the wind on false pretences. I'm, he resumed, with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of #300 per annum That's the vital issue at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that's my idea for what it's worth. I call that patriotism. Ubi patria, as we learned a small smattering of in our classical day in Alma Mater, vita bene. Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.\n\nOver his untasteable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning, burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn't say the words the voice he heard said - if you work.\n\n\u2014Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning to work.\n\nThe eyes were surprised at this observation, because as he, the person who owned them pro. tem. observed, or rather, his voice speaking did: All must work, have to, together.\n\n\u2014I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. That's work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education, you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.\n\n\u2014You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Ireland for short.\n\n\u2014I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.\n\n\u2014But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.\n\n\u2014What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately I didn't catch the latter portion. What was it you?...\n\nStephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee, Or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding:\n\n\u2014We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.\n\nAt this pertinent suggestion, Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down, but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say, the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way, foreign to his sober state. Probably the home life, to which Mr Bloom attached the utmost importance, had not been all that was needful or he hadn't been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him, whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly, nipped in the bud of premature decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance, there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the half crazy faddist, respectably connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries, among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual d\u00e9nouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged, for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen, which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts, even In the House of Lords, because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy as the law stands was terribly down on, though not for the reason they thought they were probably, whatever it was, except women chiefly, who were always fiddling more or less at one another, it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every well tailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine fillip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.\n\nFor which and further reasons he felt it was interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlooked for occasion, though why, he could not exactly tell, being, as it was, already several shillings to the bad, having, in fact, let himself in for it. Still, to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small... Intellectual stimulation as such was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt, of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in, especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz., coalminers, divers, scavengers, etc., were very much under the microscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing. Suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column, My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman's Shelter.\n\nThe pink edition, extra sporting, of the Telegraph, tell a graphic lie, lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed to A. Boudin, find the captain's age, his eyes went aimlessly over the respective captions which came under his special province, the allembracing give us this day our daily press. First he got a bit of a start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H. du Boyes, agent for typewriters or something like that. Great battle Tokio. Lovemaking in Irish #200 damages. Gordon Bennett. Emigration swindle. Letter from His Grace William. Ascot Throwaway recalls Derby of '92 when Captain Marshall's dark horse, Sir Hugo , captured the blue riband at long odds. New York disaster, thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral of the late Mr Patrick Dignam.\n\nSo to change the subject he read about Dignam, R.I.P., which, he reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff.\n\n\u2014This morning (Hynes put it in, of course), the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount, for internment in Clasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise, after a brief illness, came as great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present, were carried out (certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny) by Messrs. H. J. O'Neill & Son, 164 North Strand road. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan (motherinlaw), John Henry Menton, solr., Martin Cunningham, John Power eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora (must be where he called Monks the dayfather about Keyes's ad), Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus, Stephen Dedalus, B. A., Edward J. Lambert, Cornelius Kelleher, Joseph M'C. Hynes, L. Boom, C. P. M'Coy, - M'Intosh, and several others.\n\nNettled not a little by L. Boom (as it incorrectly stated) and the line of bitched type, but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M'Coy and Stephen Dedalus, B. A., who were conspicuous, needless to say, by their total absence (to say nothing of M'Intosh), L. Boom pointed it out to his companion B. A., engaged in stifling another yawn, half nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints.\n\n\u2014Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked, as soon as his bottom jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.\n\n\u2014It is, really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford's after all managing the thing, there.\n\nWhile the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the nonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits and starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three, his sidevalue 1,000 sovs., with 3,000 sovs. In specie added for entire colts and fillies, Mr F.

Though that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Of course, gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though, as the event turned out, the poor fool hadn't much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.\n\n\u2014There was every indication they would arrive at that, Mr Bloom said.\n\n\u2014Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.\n\nOne morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read, Return of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after Committee Room No. 15 until he was his old self again with no-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses. Dead he wasn't. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.\n\nAll the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels, and not singly but in their thousands, and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow of truth in the stories and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before, there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the Alice, where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart, so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. Naturally then, it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men, which undoubtedly he was, and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So-and-So who, though they weren't even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay. And then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come back - that haunting sense kind of drew you - to show the understudy in the title r\u00f4le how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it United Ireland, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid expression notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip - what's bred in the bone. Still, as regards return, you were a lucky dog if they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed. Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials, like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne. Bella was the boat's name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in, as the evidence went to show, and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, Lord Bellew, was it? As he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with, Excuse me, my name is So-and-So or some such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, Mr Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.\n\n\u2014That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.\n\n\u2014Fine lump of a woman, all the same, the soi-disant town-clerk, Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. I seen her picture in a barber's. Her husband was a captain or an officer.\n\n\u2014Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added. He was, and a cottonball one.\n\nThis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom, he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings. First, it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them, till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however, who were resolved upon encouraging his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Sino their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact namely, that he had shared her bedroom, which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact that the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties. The usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly, augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary, that is (who was just the usual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate), and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame, which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head, much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement, all seemed a kind of dream. And the coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown Strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years, looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying, as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.\n\n\u2014Just bears out what I was saying, he with glowing bosom said to Stephen. And, if I don't greatly mistake, she was Spanish too.\n\n\u2014The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.\n\n\u2014Was she? Bloom ejaculated surprised, though not astonished by any means. I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there it was, as she lived there. So, Spain.\n\nCarefully avoiding a book in his pocket Sweets of, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents rapidly, finally he.\n\n\u2014Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a fades photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?\n\nStephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady, with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she was in the full bloom of womanhood, In evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano, on the rest of which was In old Madrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin's premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.\n\nMrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna, Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about '96. Very like her then.\n\nBeside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the face, it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure, which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the... He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon, he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry. All the rest, yes, Puritanism. It does though, St Joseph's sovereign... whereas no photo could, because it simply wasn't art, in a word.\n\nThe spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he... so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm... And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. Nevertheless, he sat tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear, however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other's possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint. In fact, the slight soiling was only an added charm, like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better, in fact, with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he?... I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (sic) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.\n\nThe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, distingu\u00e9, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch, though you wouldn't think he had it in him... yet you would. Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of make-believe went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of letterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the decree nisi and the King's Proctor to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. But as for that, the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor, who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, Bloom, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred in the historic fracas when the fallen leader's - who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery - (leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the Insuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means, by the by, appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation, reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man, he was still a commanding figure, though carelessly garbed as usual, with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay, after placing him upon a pedestal, which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell's) was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time, being a gentleman born with a stake in the country, he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone, instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference; after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\n\nOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabmen and so on, who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones, with tears in her eyes, though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time, as quite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed, and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either, that man, or men in the plural, were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life, and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.\n\nIt was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains, as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women, who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies' society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi- or tri-weekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentpaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other's senior or like his father. But something substantial he certainly ought to eat, were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.\n\n\u2014At what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.\n\n\u2014Some time yesterday, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014Yesterday, exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow, Friday. Ah, you mean it's after twelve!\n\n\u2014The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.\n\nLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence, Bloom reflected. Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there somehow was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance, when the evicted tenants' question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people's minds though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle, at all events, was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession, as voicing the trend of modern Opinion, a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of, and even was twitted with going a step further than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\n\nAnyhow, upon weighing the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw, not that the cases were either identical or the reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to Ontario Terrace, as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives... Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. His initial impression was that he was a bit standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn't what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow. At least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet. He failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question, who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let XX equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks passim. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his God being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles, your God was a jew, because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhere about in the county Sligo.\n\n\u2014I propose, our hero eventually suggested, after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here, you just come with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the vicinity. You can't drink that stuff. Wait, I'll just pay this lot.\n\nThe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty, who didn't seem to...\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen, to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.\n\nAll kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (Bloom's) busy brain. Education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, hydros and concert tours in English watering resorts packed with theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.\n\nThe cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association dinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that Sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. - Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.\n\n\u2014And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.\n\nThe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.\n\n\u2014Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the town clerk queried.\n\n\u2014Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of sea-green portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Sand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking. The Arabian Nights' Entertainment was my favourite and Red as a Rose is She.\n\nThereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him, as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.\n\nTo cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise to his feet so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans) he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite to him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d., confectionery do., and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark. - Come, he counselled, to close the s\u00e9ance.\n\nSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear, they left the shelter or shanty together and the \u00e9lite society of oil skin and company whom nothing short Of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment... the door to...\n\n\u2014One thing I never understood, he said, to be original on the spur of the moment, why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down on the tables In cafes.\n\nTo which impromptu the never failing Bloom replied without a moment's hesitation, saying straight off:\n\n\u2014To sweep the floor in the morning.\n\nSo saying he skipped around nimbly, considering frankly, at the same time apologetic, to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the by, the right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.\n\n\u2014It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man. It's not far. Lean on me.\n\nAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on accordingly.\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.\n\nAnyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier, etc. where the municipal supernumerary, ex-Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones, the analogy was not at all bad, as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\n\nSo they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's Huguenots, Meyerbeer's Seven Last Words on the Cross, and Mozart's Twelfth Mass, he simply revelled in, the Gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini's Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers' church in Upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and, suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character, there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole, though favouring preferably light opera of the Don Giovanni description, and Martha, a gem in its line, he had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par excellence Lionel's air in Martha, M'appari, which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn't but launched out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and Byrd (William), who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen's Chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.\n\nOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swing chain, a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught a right the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.\n\nBy the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other's sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:\n\n\u2014Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\n\nThey thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh, because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger, putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute, he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big foolish nervous noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator, tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for a rooster; tiger, my eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind, somewhat distracted from Stephen's words, while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old...\n\n\u2014What's this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging in medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\n\nHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard type they unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.\n\nStill, supposing he had his father's gift, as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as Lady Fingall's Irish industries concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.\n\nExquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:\n\nVon der Sirenen Listigkeit\nTun die Poeten dichten.\n\nThese opening bars he sang and translated extempore. Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means, which he did.\n\nA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entr\u00e9e into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in- society's sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record - in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus omne. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big if however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped-up a too much feted prince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.\n\nThe horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person's character, no pun intended.\n\nThe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted\nand, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.\n\nSide by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.\n\nUnd alle Schiffe br\u00fccken.\n\nThe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by Father Maher. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their t\u00e9te \u00e0 t\u00e9te (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear

statue, becomes part of the machine\nFeelin' all the bumpers, always playin' clean\nPlays by intuition, the digit counters fall\nThat deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\n[Chorus 1: Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey]\nHe's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist\nA pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist\n\n[Post-Chorus: Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey]\nHow do you think he does it? I don't know!\nWhat makes him so good?\n\n[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]\nAin't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells\nDon't see no lights a-flashin', plays by sense of smell\nAlways gets the replay, never seen him fall\nThat deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\n\n[Chorus 2: Roger Daltrey & Pete Townshend]\nI thought I was the Bally table king\nBut I just handed my pinball crown to him\n\n[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]\nEven on my favorite table, he can beat my best\nHis disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest\nHe's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him

at clouds from both sides now\nFrom up and down and still somehow\nIt's cloud's illusions I recall\nI really don't know clouds at all\n[Verse 2]\nMoons and Junes and Ferris wheels\nThe dizzy dancing way you feel\nWhen every fairy tale comes real\nI've looked at love that way\nBut now it's just another show\nYou leave 'em laughin' when you go\nAnd if you care don't let them know\nDon't give yourself away\n\n[Chorus]\nI've looked at love from both sides now\nFrom win and lose and still somehow\nIt's love's illusions I recall\nI really don't know love at all\n\n[Verse 3]\nTears and fears and feeling proud\nTo say \"I love you\" right out loud\nDreams and schemes and circus crowds\nI've looked at life that way\nBut now old friends are acting strange\nThey shake their heads, they say I've changed\nWell something's lost but something's gained\nIn living every day\nSee Judy Collins LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like[Chorus]\nI've looked at life from both sides

station\nPlatform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows\nI walked into such a sad time at the station\nAs I walked out, felt my own need just beginning\n\n[Hook]\nI'll wait in the queue when the trains come back\nLie with you where the shadows run from themselves\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAt the party she was kindness in the hard crowd\nConsolation for the old wound now forgotten\nYellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes\nShe's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings\n\n[Hook]\nI'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;\nLie in the dark where

(Forever), and ever (Ever)\nWe never will part, oh, how I love you\nTogether (Together), together (Together)\nThat's how it must be to live without you\nWould only mean heartbreak for me (Ooh-hoo)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI run for the bus, dear\nBut while riding I think of us, dear (Us, dear)\nI say a little (Prayer for you)\nAnd at work I just take time\nAnd all through my coffee break time (Break time)\nI say a little (Prayer for you)\n\n[Chorus]\nForever (Forever), and ever (Ever)\nYou'll stay in my heart and I will love you\nForever (Forever), and ever (Ever)\nWe never will part, oh, how I love you\nTogether (Together), together (Together)\nThat's how it must be to live without you\nWould only mean heartbreak for me (Nobody but me)\nForever (Ever), and ever (Ever)\nYou'll stay in my heart and I will love you\nForever (Forever), and ever (Ever)\nWe never will part, oh, how I love you\nTogether (Together), together (Together)\nThat's how it must be to live without you\nWould only mean heartbreak for me (Ooh, ooh-hoo)\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nMy darling, believe me (Believe me)\nFor me, there is no one but you\nPlease love me true\nI'm in love with you (Answer my prayer)\nAnswer my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer)\nSay you'll love me true (Answer my prayer)\nAnswer my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer)\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ey) Forever (Forever), and ever (Ever, ever)\nYou'll stay in my heart and I will love you\nForever (Forever), and ever (Ever)\nWe never will part, oh, how I love you\nTogether (Together), together (Together)\nThat's how it must be to live without you\nWould only mean heartbreak for me (Oh, nobody but me)\n\n[Bridge]\nMy darling, believe me (Believe me)\nFor me, there is no one but you\nPlease love me true\n\n[Outro]\nThis is my prayer (Answer my prayer, baby)\nAnswer my prayer now, baby (Answer my prayer, baby)\nThis is my prayer (Answer my prayer, baby)\nAnswer it right now, baby (Answer my prayer, baby)\nSay you'll love me true (Answer my prayer, baby)\nThis is my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer, baby)\nI'm in love with you (Answer my prayer)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/945698",
