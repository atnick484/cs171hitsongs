evening will be nice\nAnd you can go and send me on my way.\"\nI said, \"You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?\"\nShe looked at me and this is what she said:\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked\nMoney don't grow on trees\nI got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed\nThere ain't nothing in this world for free\nOh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back\nThough you know, I wish I could\nOh no there ain't no rest for the wicked\nUntil we close our eyes for good\"\n[Verse 2]\nNot even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street\nWhen I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight\nAnd then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head\nHe made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight\nHe said, \"Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life\nBut if you try to make a move, I won't think twice\"\nI told him, \"You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask\nWhat made you want to live this kind of life?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHe said, \"There ain't no rest for the wicked\nMoney don't grow on trees\nI got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed\nThere ain't nothing in this world for free\nOh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back\nThough you know, I wish I could\nOh no there ain't no rest for the wicked\nUntil we close our eyes for good\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell now a couple hours passed and I was sitting in my house\nThe day was winding down and coming to an end\nAnd so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news\nAnd what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend\nI saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church\nHe'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills\nBut even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same\nOh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou know there ain't no rest for the wicked\nMoney don't grow on trees\nWe got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed\nThere ain't nothing in this world for free\nOh

sleeping in this sleepy town tonight\nAt the break of day\nI'll be a runaway\n\nA hundred miles in, I got a stupid grin\nOn my scruffy face\nWith every cigarette I'm burning my regrets\nDon't want to leave a trace\n\nAnd from the rearview, I've got clear view\nOf who I used to be\nA little bit faster now\nDon't wanna turn around\n\nI'm gonna pack my bags and never look back\nRun a parallel line with the railroad tracks\nAnd make my getaway\n\nI'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down\nLeave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight\nAnd at the break of day\nI'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway\n(I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway)\n\nIt's crazy, I know, to count on this road\nTo give me what I need\nBut with every state line\nSomehow I find another part of me, yeah, yeah\nYou might also likeI'm gonna pack my bags and never look back\nRun a parallel line with the railroad tracks\nAnd make my get away\n\nI'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down\nLeave everybody sleeping in this sleepy town tonight\nAnd at the break of day\nI'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway\n(I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway, I'll be a runaway)\n(I'll be a

you\nJohnny Ray fell off the wagon\nHe's been gone all afternoon\nI know my buddy so I drove to Skully's\nAnd found him at the bar\nI say hey man, what's going on\nHe said I don't know where to start\n\nSarah's old car's about to fall apart\nAnd the washer quit last week\nWe had to put momma in the nursing home\nAnd the baby's cutting teeth\nI didn't get much work this week\nAnd I got bills to pay\nI said I know this ain't what you wanna hear\nBut it's what I'm gonna say\n(Chorus)\nSounds like life to me it ain't no fantasy\nIt's just a common case of everyday reality\nMan I know it's tough but you gotta suck it up\nTo hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy\nIt sounds like life to me\n\nWell his face turned red and he shook his head\nHe said you don't understand\nThree kids and a wife depend on me\nAnd I'm just one man\nTo top it off I just found out\nThat Sarah's 2 months late\nI said hey bartender set us up a round\nWe need to celebrate\n\n(Chorus)\nSounds like life to me plain old destiny\nYeah the only thing for certain is uncertainty\nYou gotta hold on tight just enjoy the ride\nGet used to all this unpredictability\nSounds like life\n\nMan I know its tough but you gotta suck it up\nTo hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy\nSounds like life to me\nSounds like lifeYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 19, "api_path":

LA\nI was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade\nLaughing at my jeans and my boots beside those high-dollar shoes and Armani suits\nWhen the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free\nSo if you'd like the first one can be on me\nHe said I'm heading back from business, in New York and Rome\nTell me son, where do you call home?\n\nI said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church\nA courthouse clock that still don't work\nWhere a man's word means everything\nWhere moms and dads were high school flames and\nGave their children Grandmother's maiden name\nYes, it may not sound like much\nBut it's where I'm from\nSo we drank that round and then another\nThere wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover\nHe said I headed out west when I was barely 19\nJust a kid chasing my dreams\nAnd I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother\nHe's been fighting the cancer they discovered\nBut he called last night and said I think this is the end\nSo come take me home to my family and my friends\n\nWhere the quarterback dates the homecoming queen\nThe trucks a Ford and the tractor's green\nAnd \"Amazing Grace\" is what we sing\nWhere there's a county fair every fall\nAnd your friends are there no matter when you call\nIt may not sound like much but it's where I'm from\n\nAnd as we stood to claim the bags we checked\nHe said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that\nItalian suits haven't always been my style\nSee I was the quarterback of my high school team\nWe took state back in '63 and my wife well she is still my homecoming queen\n\nCause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church\nA courthouse clock that still don't work\nWhere a man's word means everything\nWhere moms and dads were high school flames\nGave their children Grandmother's maiden name\nYes, it may not sound like much\nI said it may not sound like much\nBut it's where I'm from\nAmazing Grace\nIt's where I'm from\nHow sweet the sound\nIt's where I'm

Zoe]\nI'm lost on a road\nDon't know which way to go\nI'm losing my mind\nLosing control of the wheel\nAnd I'm swerving\nOn and off the road\nI'm lost on a road\nBut survival is a must\nDon't know who I can trust\nI'm livin in a rush\nI don't understand this fuss\nMy brain is bout to bust\n\n[Hook 2]\nI think I'm losin it\nI might be losin it\nI just might lose\nAm I losin my mind?\nAnd I'm so

look good, she said I was handsome\nSo believed her, because I am lonely\nIm just a loner, my life is a movie\nTonight we're just actors, and this is a sitcom\nSo tell me you love me, and tell me i'll get some\n\n[Hook 1 & Hook 2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm makin this money\nJust to go spend it\nLivin the good life\nHope nobody ends it\nBut who are you kidding?\nAy who are you lying to?\nYou know if they

all he did was work\nHe said: \"The devil dreams on an idle horse\n\"So you listen to me squirt\n\"Don't get too high on the bottle\nAnd get right with the Man\nFight your fights, find a grace\nAnd all the things that you can change\nAnd help somebody if you can. \"\n\nNow Granny said: \"Sonny, stick to your ganas\nIf you believe in something, no matter what\n'Cause it's better to be hated for who you are\nThan be loved for who you're not. \"\nShe was five feet of concrete\nNew York born an' raised on a slick city street\nShe'd cold-stare you down, stand her ground\nStill kickin' and screamin' at 93\nI remember just how frail she looked in that hospital bed:\nTakin' her last few breaths of life, smilin' as she said:\n\n\"Don't get too high on the bottle\nJust a little sip ev'ry now and then\nFight your fights, find a grace\nAnd all the things that you can change\nAnd help somebody if you can\nAnd get right with the Man. \"\n\nInstrumental Break\n(C'mon now.)\nYou might also

God laugh, tell Him your plans.\"\n\n\"Don't get too high on the bottle\nGet right with the Man, son\nFight your fights, find a grace\nAnd all the things that you can change\nAnd help somebody if you

down...\n\n[Chorus]\nStep by step, heart to heart\nLeft, right, left, we all fall down\nLike toy soldiers\nBit by bit, torn apart\nWe never win, but the battle wages on\nFor toy soldiers\n[Verse 1]\nI'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure\nEven though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders\nI ain't never supposed to show it\nMy crew ain't supposed to know it\nEven if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino\nIt don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle\n'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example\nI need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em\nIf some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em\nThat Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it\nThere's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it\nI heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\nIt was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit\nAnd even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it\nI spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted\nAnd I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it\nThis ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it\nThat was never my object, for someone to get killed\nWhy would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?\nIt wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good\nI went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****\nAnd that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth\nAnd talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about\nPlus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef\nSo I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth\nWhile he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man\nWho literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand\nThis is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business\nBut still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause\u2014\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nStep by step, heart to heart\nLeft, right, left, we all fall down\nLike toy

your people dyin'\nBut now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it\nThe shit gets escalated\u2014it ain't just words no more, is it?\nIt's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'\nWe actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'\nMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\nAnd asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him\nUntil Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him\nFuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it\nMeanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction\nSome receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\nHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\nTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\nBut now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up\nWas through that publication, the same one that made me famous\nNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?\nWell, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!\nBut I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think\nThat we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\nAnd he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind\nWe still have soldiers that's on the front line\nWho's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders\nNever to extort us, strictly to show they support us\nAnd maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus\nTo show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important\nIt is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners\nTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\nBut I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered\nIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\nThan to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict\nI'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further\nBut don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\nI'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'\nOff at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\nI'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience\n'Cause\u2014\n[Chorus]\nStep by step, heart to heart\nLeft, right, left, we all fall down\nLike toy soldiers\nBit by bit, torn apart\nWe never win, but the battle wages on\nFor toy soldiers220Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/43047", "artist_names": "Snoop Dogg (Ft.

steps\nYou was broke down crying a mess\nSo I interferred\nI asked what's the reason for tears\nI was wishing you could tell me your fears\nBut I'll start with ya name\nYou told me how ya man playin games\nSo I said that it was time for a change\nAnd you just laughed\nBut it looked like you ain't laughed in while\nI was glad that I could give you a smile\nThen we both blushed\nBut really girl it ain't no rush\nI was thinking maybe we can discuss\nA future for us\nCause homeboy just got you crushed\nYou need to leave that clown in the dust\nTrust, I just wanna talk\nI'm thinking I can give you a call\nAnd we can pick it up\nWhere we left off\nI'll holla tomorrow\n[Hook]\nGirl I understand you loyal to ya man\nAnd that's alright aww baby\nBut that don't change the fact\nThat you fine and you stay crying every night nah baby\nGirl you got to let him know\nYou can't live like this no more\nNah baby\nCan't ya see\nTogether you and me could be so special ah baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nOur feelings get greater\nA million days later\nTalking all night we stay up but\nHere comes ya ex\nReturned with that drama and stress\nAll the nonsense that you just left but yet\nYou except and go back to try it again\nThen return with a broken heart\nThat I gotta mend\nThat's unfair\nI've only been your lover and friend\nAnd homey there he just front and pretend\nBut you don't care the life he leads is unsafe\nI would never place my hands to your face\nBut still I chase\nCat and mouse\nFirst you kick him out\nThen you at his house\nWhat is that about\nI can't figure you out\nEven your friend said I was better\nBut you listen to him\nNever like uh-uh whatever\nSo the next time hurt you again\nYou already knew where you should've been\nAnd that's with me\nYou might also like[Repeat Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll the times\nYou 2way telling me\nThat you miss me\nWanting me to come over and keep you busy\nRemember that\nNow that you gone\nIt's been kinda hard\nCan't think, can't sleep\nCan't do nothing at all\nJust tell me why you had to go back\nSee you ain't have to go through that\nMy baby\nYou could've been here right by my side\nMe and you at the park taking walks outside\nBut instead, I keep on having these dreams\nWaiting for my phone to ring\nMy baby wishing that it would be you\nBut I know that won't come true\n\n[Hook repeat 2x]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

drunk\nLet's hold down\nWhere the bar at?\n\n[Verse 1]\nOkay, okie dokey Obie's here\nNo more Focus Hobo's got a career\nAnd I like your brassiere and there's a party in here\nAnd I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear\nShe erotic and it's hot, saw Heineken beer\nPut it to the side and invite her to \"Cheers\"\nPull up a chair, nigga swear no drama\nPrepare for a player who's working with a monster\nI ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place\nShut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state\nConcentrate, you will find that your bound to get\nBut we found what's fate\nWe can watch two incredible mates masturbate\nWhy settle and wait\nLet's escalate to the nearest Super 8\nAnd see your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks\nC'mon\n[Chorus]\nAnd this is my favorite song\nNow sing along when the DJ throws it on\nAnd if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep\nAnd wake up, hopefully she got some teeth\nAnd this is my favorite song\nNow sing along when the DJ throws it on\nAnd if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep\nAnd wake up, hopefully she got some teeth\n\n[Verse 2]\nOkay holy moly derriere\nLook around the club booty everywhere\nShe caught me starin\nAnd my homies darin' me to approach Karen\nShe's model material, but she got a venereal\nTons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal\nShe holla cause I got a lot of dinerio\nThe DJ's playin Obie song on the stereo\nAnd she's impaired and she wants to be headin' home\nWith the real thing not the dildo clone\nAnd I know I don't wanna be headin home\nWith some double Ds full of silicon\nTen hoodrat chicks surround me outside\nFound me outside, clown me outside\n'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside\nBussin at the bitches screamin \"off to they rides!\"\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd this is my favorite song\nNow sing along when the DJ throws it on\nAnd if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep\nAnd wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huhh)\nAnd this

find a slim chick's atmosphere\nObesity's glarin' and she got me fearin'\nShe's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally, like a box of Cheerios\nCherry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls\nI'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder\nSo better cover up that blubber or I'll split\n(feet running away noise)\nAnd I ain't got time to play\nLet's investigate another place today\nLadies less in weight and the dress they shape\nDresses pettite, no window drapes\n\n[Bridge]\nWord to mother, they god damn Okra and beans\nGot ya Oprah in jeans\nSeems to me a little lean cuisine\nWouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch\n[Chorus]\nAnd this is my favorite song\nNow sing along when the DJ throws it on\nAnd if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep\nAnd wake up, hopefully she

home as my daddy's wife\nShe just shook her head when her momma said\n\"Are you sure he's the one?\" She was\nHe took a job and farmed on the side\nHe made the ends meet, but she kept 'em tied\nChanges were coming to their little world\nShe said \"What would you like, a boy or a girl?\"\nHe said \"Are you?\"\n\nShe said she was and never thought twice\n'Bout takin the next step in building their lives\nSoon there were three and she tried to be\nEverything to us And she was\n\nThose precious moments turned into years\nIn what seemed like the blink of an eye\nI held her hand as I leaned down to ask her\n\"Momma, Are you ready to say goodbye?\"\n\nShe said she was but she thought twice\nHoldin' my hand as she let go of life\nDaddy always said a woman like her\nWould be hard to

(Tainted)\nReal love (Yeah yeah) true love (It's so good girl) real love\n\n[Verse 1: T3]\nThink of her think of me\nThink about us, it's a intimacy\nI'm trying to strum like guitars in this beat\nAnd consider riding she'll kick the blahzay spleen\nPlus you got a man, but he ain't quite me\nThe type of man that try to give you what you need\nAnd he wanna know where you are, where you be\nWhere you going, where you stay, where you subject to be, damn\nIf I was him I wouldn't even leave\nI would trust you what you say that you are where you be\nSay he the type of nigga that's hella cheap\nTake his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's\nSee, I'm the type that try to stab in a jeep\nTry to take you out to see things and occasionally creep\nYeah, your man is doing things I can't really see\nDon't sound too good, it sound tainted to me\n[Hook: Dwele] (T3)\nReal love (It's so real girl) true love (It's so right girl)\nTainted love (It's real) real love (It's so good girl)\nTrue love (For real love) tainted love (Tainted)\nReal love (Yeah yeah) true love (It's so good girl) real love\n\n[Verse 2: Baatin]\nHow many years does it take for a record to blow?\nI'm doing exactly how many licks it took for my hoes\nSpending your cash flow cause she was so out ho\nScandal love, cause love full of scandal\nToo much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that\nWell it's the same tainted love in the music business\nPeople they lose their brain just to get up in this\nLet's be a star for a day, everything in life is just okay\nPeople say things they don't really wanna say\nHey but it's okay, cause you're a star for the day\nPeople'll smile at you when they really wanna frown\nWell a that's just the way tainted folk get down\nJust keep it real and, we'll see\nWhen the situation is tainted love is always free\n\nLove is always free\n\n[Hook: Dwele]\nReal love, true love, tainted love, real love\nTrue love, tainted love, real love, true love, real\nYou might also like[Verse 3: eLZhi]\nYou say you love me, but is it really real?\nWould you, fix me green tea if I'm feeling ill\nCould you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day?\nDinner by candlelight but you're the main entree\nAnd if so, I do the same with other treats to give you\nTrailing rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow\nWith a bucket of champagne on your night stand\nExperience what some women won't in they lifespan\nI'm sayin\n\n[Outro: Dwele]\nReal love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love\nSomeone to trust in you for real\nEverybody need love; that's real\nI would never want nothing tainted\nWait a minute, what you feel?\nFaded if your loving was tainted\nTrue, oh, I know true love is hard to find\nJust let it find you; for real\nIf you found love to keep it real\nKeep love from being tainted, being tainted\nOooh then you'll, be, alright\n(T3: Just sit y'all, Dwele, on more time, y'all, come on)\nThen you'll, be, alright5Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

Bonnie and Clyde\n\nWe met at a truckstop\nJohnson City, Tennessee\nI was gassin' up my Firebird\nWhen I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm\nSaid, 'Which way are you headed, boy\nDo you need some company'\nShe had me stoppin' at a quick mart\nBefore we made it out of town\nNext thing she was runnin' at me\nTellin' me to lay that hammer down\nCause there's a man right behind me\nDoin' his best to slow me down\n\nYeah and it's a long way to Richmond\nRollin' north on 95\nWith a redhead ridin' shotgun\n\nAnd a pistol by my side\nTearin' down that highway\nLike a modern day Bonnie and

"It\u2019s Goin\u2019 Down Lyrics[Intro: Mike Shinoda]\nWatch them flee, watch them flee\nWatch them flee, hip-hop heads\n\"And you do it like this\"\n(It's goin' down) It's goin' down\n(It's goin' down) It's goin' down\n(It's goin' down) It's goin' down\n(It's goin' down) It's goin' down\n\n[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]\nIt's goin' down, the rhythm projects 'round the next sound\nReflects the complex hybrid dialect, now\nDetect the mesh of many elements compressed down\nThe melting pot of a super future-esque style\nThe combination of a vocal caress\nWith lungs that gasp for breath from emotional stress\nWith special effects and a distorted collage\nCarefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]\nIt's goin' down, a logical progression on a timeline\nThe separation narrowed down to a fine line\nTo blur the edges so they blend together properly\nTake you on an audible odyssey, now\n\nIt's goin' down, a logical progression on a timeline\nThe separation narrowed down to a fine line\nTo blur the edges so they blend together properly\nTake you on an audible odyssey, now\n\n[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]\nIt's goin' down, put it out for the world to see\nLP and X-Men to the 10th degree\n(It's goin' down) Nobody in the world is safe\nWhen we melt down the wax in your record crate\n\n(It's goin' down) Put it out for the world to see\nLP and X-Men to the 10th degree\n(It's goin' down) Nobody in the world is safe\nWhen we melt down the wax in your record crate\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus]\n(It's goin' down) \"Put it on\"\n\"I said it goes like this\"\n\"And you do it like this\"\nIt's goin' down\n\n[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]\nOnce again it is\nComposed sentences altogether venomous\nThe four elements of natural force\nProjected daily, through the sound of the source\n\nEverybody on board as we blend, the sword with the pen\nThe mightiest of weapons swinging right from the chin\nTo elevate mental states long gone with the wind\nTo defend men for shoddy imitation pretends\n\nIt's goin' down, style assimilation, readily\nTrekking through the weaponry of a pure pedigree\nCleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me\nWhatever the weather be, we're advancing steadily\n\nIt's going down sub-terrestrial high\nA rhyme regiment that's calling the shots\nExecution of collaborative plots\nReady to bring the separation of style to a stop\n[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]\nIt's goin' down, a logical progression on a timeline\nThe separation narrowed down to a fine line\nTo blur the edges so they blend together properly\nTake you on an audible odyssey, now\n\n[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]\nIt's goin' down, put it out for the world to see\nLP and X-Men to the 10th degree\n(It's goin' down) Nobody in the world is safe\nWhen we melt down the wax in your record crate\n\n(It's goin' down) Put it out for the world to see\nLP and X-Men to the 10th degree\n(It's goin' down) Nobody in the world is safe\nWhen we melt down the wax in your record crate\n\n[Bridge: X-Ecutioners]\n\"X-Men 'bout to blast off world wide\"\n\"X-Men 'bout to blast off world wide\"\n\"And you do it like this\"\n\"'Bout to blast off world wide\"\n\n[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]\nIt's goin' down, put it out for the world to see\nLP and X-Men to the 10th degree\n(It's goin' down) Nobody in the world is safe\nWhen we melt down the wax in your record crate\n\n(It's goin' down) Put it out for the world to see\nLP and X-Men to the 10th degree\n(It's goin' down) Nobody in the world is safe\nWhen we melt down the wax in your record crate\n\n[Outro: Mike Shinoda]\n(It's goin' down) It's goin' down\n(It's goin' down) It's goin' down\n(It's goin' down) It's goin' down\n(It's goin' down)\n(It's goin' down)\n\"Put it on\", \"and it goes like this\"\n(It's goin' down)\n\"And you do it like this\"\n(It's goin' down)\n\"Put it on\", \"and it goes like this\"\n(It's goin' down)\n\"And you do it like this\"\n\n\"Like this\"6Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

whisper's my name\n\nThere you are with your hair all down\nAnd your feet are bare and your cotton gown\nWhat a beautiful sight\nIn the moonlight\nThe way you're looking at me with your loving

on\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere's only so many stars in the night\nThat can make up a milky way\nAnd there ain't more\nThan twenty-four long hours in a day\nBut they say everything has a limit\nThat ain't exactly true\n'Cause there ain't a limit to the love in my heart\nOr the way that I feel about you\n[Chorus]\nHell, even when the pyramids are gone\nYeah, my love goes on and on and on and on\nAnd on and on and on and on and on and on\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I got two hundred thousand miles\nOn a rusty old beat up truck\nAnd I hate to say but there's gonna come a day\nWhen I'm gonna have to give her up\nBut darlin' since I met you\nWell, here is how it is\nI could live with losing everything\nBut I would die without your kiss\n\n[Chorus]\nSo if you think this fire we lit inside\nWill burn out, you're wrong\nMy love goes on and on and on and on and on\nAnd on and on and on and on and on\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, I know that we can't spend\nEvery waking hour together\nBut I can hold you for tonight\nAnd I can love you forever\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nEvery time I think of what we've got\nAll I do is smile\n'Cause the beginning to the end of time\nCompared to this is a little while\nI've heard raindrops'll turn into oceans\nAnd oceans'll turn to dust\nBut there ain't a single force in the world\nThat'll have an effect on us\n\n[Chorus]\nBut that may be that the rocky\nRocky mountains don't last long\nBut my love goes on and on and on and on\nAnd on and on and on and on and on and on\nOn and on and on and on\nAnd on and on and on and on and on and onEmbed"},

notice your face\nRush to the liquor store and then a motel (Motel)\nCall up your friends just to cover your trail\nNot a word until the week goes by\nYou call me when you want some pie\n[Pre-Chorus: Charisse with Cassandra]\nWhy am I crying every night over you\nYou're never gonna leave her\nFinally I woke up and smelled the coffee\nI understand\nWhy two women can't share one man\n\n[Chorus:
