With the exception of the Max Roach Songbook , all of these recordings feature compositions authored by Reed.\n\n46. Reed composed \u201cThe Thorn\u201d in 2009 for WJ3 release The Next Phase. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d is a hard swinging track featuring an extremely distinctive and catchy hook that is the refrain of the song. The recording is infectiously rhythmic with clever melodic triplets throughout the hook played expertly by a tight rhythm section and commanding horns.\n\n47.

Copies of the recording were available for purchase through iTunes, EMusic, Amazon, and CDBaby.\n\n49.The Next Phase was available for listening on various streaming services including Spotify, Pandora, and Rhapsody.Defendants\u2019 Infringement of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d50. Neither Reed nor Jones granted permission to any of the Defendants to use \u201cThe Thorn\u201d in any manner whatsoever. Defendants\u2019 use of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d was completely unauthorized and without the knowledge or consent of owners Reed and Jones.\n\n51. Upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, one or all of the Defendants created a sound recording titled \u201cRigamortus\u201d, which was a track on Lamar\u2019s\nSection.80 (TopDawg).\n\n52. \u201cRigamortus\u201d is a hip-hip recording consisting entirely of the refrain from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d sound recording with lyrics added and performed by Lamar.\n\n53. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d is not merely a part of \u201cRigamortus\u201d or even the heart of \u201cRigamortus\u201d; it is \u201cRigamortus\u201d. The distinctive and catchy refrain from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d sound recording, sped up a bit, repeats as a continuous loop throughout the entire \u201cRigamortus\u201d song while Lamar raps over it. The clever melodic triplets, infectious rhythm, and commanding horns from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d are copied to \u201cRigamortus\u201d directly from Jones\u2019 sound recording. Defendants did not play any instruments or contribute any original musical performance to the \u201cRigamortus\u201d sound recording. The instrumental element of \u201cRigamortus\u201d and the composition that it embodies are owned and authored entirely by Jones and Reed respectively.\n\n54. The lyrics to \u201cRigamortus\u201d and the performance thereof are the only elements of \u201cRigamortus\u201d not copied directly from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d.\n\n55. Despite having contributed no original music to \u201cRigamortus\u201d, Lamar and Brown registered their claim of copyright in the composition \u201cRigamortus\u201d with the Copyright Office as reflected by Registration No. PA0001856022. Their authorship is described as music and lyrics. Records on file with ASCAP and the HFA show Lamar, Brown, and Spears as authors, listing them and their associated publishers along with TopDawg Entertainment as copyright claimants entitled to royalties.\n\n56. Upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, one or all of the Defendants created a sound recording titled \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d featuring famous rapper, Busta Rhymes (TopDawg).\n\n57. \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d is nearly identical to \u201cRigamortus\u201d, containing the same musical elements from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d as \u201cRigamortus\u201d, only with additional lyrics performed and  presumably authored by Busta Rhymes.\n\n58. \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d was released as a single by TopDawg Entertainment.\n\n59. ASCAP records for \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d list only Brown as sole author, despite that he contributed no original musical authorship to the work, and the Remix is a mere variation of \u201cRigamortus\u201d.\n\n60. Upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, one or all of the Defendants created a sound recording titled \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d (TopDawg).\n\n61. \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d was released on Ichiban: Sound in 3D by Defendant, Brown (TopDawg).\n\n62. \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d does not feature lyrics or vocal performances and consists only of the repeating loop that was taken from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d with minor sonic embellishments and studio sound effects added. Authorship in the sound recording and the underlying musical composition belong entirely to Reed and Jones.Striking Similarity of the Works61. The TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs all consist of the repeating loop of the distinctive and catchy refrain from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d sound recording.\n\n62. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d and the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs feature clever melodic triplets, infectious rhythm, and commanding horns.\n\n63. The TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs\u2019 striking similarity to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d is obvious, even to non-musicians. Jones and Reed became aware of the infringing \u201cRigamortus\u201d through non-musicians who brought the Lamar recording to their attention. After performing \u201cThe Thorn\u201d live at Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola in New York, Reed was approached by two separate members of the audience who exclaimed that Lamar sampled the song. A high school friend of Jones\u2019 saw Lamar\u2019s \u201cRigamortus\u201d video, immediately recognized \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, and contacted Jones. The Wikipedia page for Section.80 states: \u201c \u2018Rigamortus\u2019 contains a sample of \u2018The Thorn\u2019 as  performed by Willie Jones III\u201d, and the website found at www.whosampled.com (image below) states that music from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d appears throughout \u201cRigamortus\u201d, even though Lamar\u2019s album does not list \u201cThe Thorn\u201d or its authors among the album credits.64. Pianist Kris Bowers covered \u201cRigamortus\u201d, spelling it \u201cRigamortis\u201d and stating that the Lamar recording contains music from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, written by Reed and recorded on Jones\u2019 The Next Phase.\n\n65. All versions of \u201cRigamortus\u201d and \u201cRigamortis\u201d, starting with the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs and including covers, remakes, remixes, and other variations thereof are infringing derivative works adapted from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d.Access to Reed/Jones\u2019 \u201cThe Thorn\u201d66. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d appeared on The Next Phase, which was released to the worldwide general public for purchase on July 20, 2010. Online retailers iTunes, Amazon, and CDBaby carried the recording for anyone to purchase.\n\n67. \u201cThe Thorn\u201d was available for listening via streaming audio on the Internet from Spotify, Rhapsody, Pandora, and others on the July 20, 2010 release date.\n\n68. Upon information and belief, one or all of the Defendants obtained a copy of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d and copied it in order to make the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs in 2011.\n\n69. Neither Reed nor Jones nor their affiliated companies gave permission to any of the Defendants to copy, use, or otherwise exploit any of their music in any form whatsoever. Defendants appropriated \u201cThe Thorn\u201d without the knowledge or consent of the rightful owners of the song and sound recording. Defendants did so willfully; fully aware that the music they appropriated was not theirs and that they did not have permission to use it.\n\n69. Defendants did not attribute any of the musical element of the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs to Reed or Jones. No album credit or other acknowledgement was afforded Reed and Jones for \u201cThe Thorn\u201d.\n\n69. Brown has made it of record that he is an avid listener of jazz and relative of trumpet legend Clifford Brown.\n\n70. On September 7, 2011, Brown contacted Reed via facebook and inquired: \u201cI need to ask you a question about sampling ..Like if I were to sample your work for a hip hop record.. What would your feelings be about that?\u201d\n\n71. Unaware that \u201cThe Thorn\u201d had already been misappropriated by Brown, Reed replied by suggesting that they talk in more detail in the future. Reed did not consent to the use of any of his music in any part of the exchange with Brown.\n\n71. In a video posted to his own YouTube channel on September 17, 2011, producer Brown demonstrates exactly how he \u201ccreated\u201d \u201cRigamortus\u201d. The caption on the YouTube page lists the following description for the video: \u201cWillie B plays the original sample of \u2018Rigamortus\u2019 and shows the session in fruityloops. #HiiiPoWer.\u201d The video opens with Brown addressing viewers and then shifts to his computer from which he plays \u201cThe Thorn\u201d and the monitor reads: \u201cWillie Jones III The Thorn\u201d. The entire video is 2:31 in length and no instruments are used. Only the computer and the sound recording of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d are used to create \u201cRigamortus\u201d in less than three minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n72. In an interview posted on istandardproducers.com, Brown stated that the \u201cRigamortus\u201d instrumental track was something he made in his mother\u2019s back room with his only contribution being production. He went on to say that the track was really for a rap song that he wrote titled \u201cThe Thorn\u201d.Defendants\u2019 Exploitation of \u201cRigamortus\u201d and Other Infringing Derivative Works and Benefits Derived Therefrom73. \u201cRigamortus\u201d was released for worldwide purchase via the Internet as part of Lamar\u2019s acclaimed\nSection.80 (TopDawg).\n\n74. At the time of filing this Complaint, Plaintiffs are aware of the following versions of the infringing \u201cRigamortus\u201d: \u201cRigamortus\u201d, Kendrick Lamar:Section.80; \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d, Kendrick Lamar featuring Busta Rhymes; \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d, Willie B:Ichiban: Sound in 3D; \u201cRigamortis Cover\u201d, Kris Bowers; \u201cRigamortis\u201d, CGP All Stars: All the  Kings Men; \u201cRigamortis (Instrumental)\u201d, Syndicate Sound Labs: Kendrick\u2019s Instrumentals, Vol. 1; \u201cRigamortis\u201d, Redd:Potential; and \u201cNational Rigamortis (Radiohead x Kendrick Lamar)\u201d, the B.E.A.T.:undercover EP.\n\n75. All songs listed in the preceding paragraph are being sold, performed, licensed, and otherwise exploited for money by the Defendants.\n\n76. The numerous remakes, remixes, and excessive exploitation of \u201cRigamortus\u201d are a testament to the immense popularity of the musical portion of the song. However, they have saturated the airwaves and diminished the market for licensing \u201cThe Thorn\u201d for use by other  producers.\n\n77. Pharrell Williams praised Lamar as one of the next great hip hop artists, citing Rigamortis as a favorite and saying: \u201cI LOVE -- that jazz sh*t\u201d. (The image below is the moment when Williams expressed his love of the jazz.) Since then, Lamar has collaborated with Williams on music featured in the soundtrack to the film The Amazing Spider Man 2.78. Lady Gaga also is a known fan of Lamar\u2019s, tweeting the hashtag #Rigamortis on July 4, 2011 before attending his performance at Pitchfork music festival in Chicago.\n\n79. In an interview posted on hiphopdx.com, Brown states that \u201cRigamortus\u201d opened doors for him and \u201ccatapulted\u201d his career.\n\n80. As the listed copyright claimants to \u201cRigamortus\u201d, Defendants collect and/or are  believed to be entitled to collect royalties and licensing revenue from all exploitation of \u201cRigamortus\u201d including but not limited to remakes, remixes, videos, and streaming.\n\n81. Terrence \u201cPunch\u201d Henderson, co-president of TopDawg Entertainment told Billboard Magazine in an interview that appeared in the March 8, 2014 issue that Section.80 sold more than 130,000 copies.\n\n82. Upon information and belief, each and all of the Defendants infringed \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, and they knew, or should have known, of the infringing acts of each of the other Defendants, and they materially contributed to the infringement alleged herein.\n\n81. As a result of their wrongful conduct, Defendants are liable to Reed, Jones, Soldier\u2019s Hymn, and WJ3 for copyright infringement pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501, false designation of origin pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125, misappropriation pursuant to 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.30, unjust enrichment, and diminution of value.\n\n82. Reed and Jones have suffered, and will continue to suffer, substantial losses as a result of Defendants\u2019 conduct complained of herein.\n\n83. Reed, Jones, Soldier\u2019s Hymn, and WJ3 are entitled to recover damages, which include their losses and any and all profits Defendants have made as a result of their wrongful conduct pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504.\n\n84.

Plaintiffs allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1-84, as though fully set forth herein.\n\n86. Jones\u2019 WJ3 is the sole copyright owner of the sound recording \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, which Defendants willfully infringed.\n\n87. Reed and his Soldier\u2019s Hymn are the sole copyright owner and publisher of the composition \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, embodied in the sound recording of the same name, which Defendants willfully infringed.\n\n88. Defendants are directly liable for copyright infringement because, after obtaining access to \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, they copied the copyrighted work to create the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs: \u201cRigamortus\u201d, \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d and \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d, all infringing derivative works.\n\n89. TopDawg Entertainment is directly liable for copyright infringement because it sells, distributes, and licenses the infringing TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs and sound recordings for remakes, derivative works, and synchronization with video elements and other infringing uses.\n\n90. All defendants are directly liable for copyright infringement because they license the TDE \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs for remakes and derivative works including \u201cRigamortis Cover\u201d, \"Kris Bowers; \u201cRigamortis\u201d, CGP All Stars: All the Kings Men; \u201cRigamortis (Instrumental)\u201d, Syndicate Sound Labs: Kendrick\u2019s Instrumentals, Vol. 1; \u201cRigamortis\u201d, Redd: Potential ; and \u201cNational Rigamortis (Radiohead x Kendrick Lamar)\u201d, the B.E.A.T.: undercover EP.\n\n91. The unauthorized copying, adaptation, performance, and distribution of works copied and derived from \u201cThe Thorn\u201d constitute violations of the United States Copyright Act, and each and all Defendants are acting as direct infringers pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et. seq.\n\n92. As a direct and proximate result of the wrongful conduct of Defendants, Reed/Soldier\u2019s Hymn and Jones/WJ3 have suffered and continue to suffer substantial money damages at an amount to be proven at trial.SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF Contributory Copyright Infringement93. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations set forth in  paragraphs 1-92 inclusive, as though fully set forth herein. 94. Each Defendant is liable for contributory infringement in that each knew or should have known of the infringing activity alleged herein, and knowingly induced, caused and/or materially contributed to the infringing acts alleged herein, by aiding in the creation, development and/or exploitation of all of the works alleged herein to be infringing. 95.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in  paragraphs 1-98 inclusive, as though fully set forth herein. 100. Defendants\u2019 failure to attribute authorship to Plaintiffs and Defendants\u2019 registration, licensing, and promotion of the various \u201cRigamortus\u201d songs as their creation constitutes false designation of origin under the Lanham Act.FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF Misappropriation, 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.30101. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in  paragraphs 1-100 inclusive, as though fully set forth herein. 102. Defendants obtained Plaintiffs\u2019 musical performance of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d and the composition embodied therein, exploited these properties in numerous ways for pecuniary gain and career advancement.

The numerous versions of \u201cRigamortus\u201d by TopDawg artists and their licensees has saturated the airwaves with \u201cThe Thorn\u201d, thereby diminishing its value. This market saturation has effectively destroyed any opportunity Plaintiffs would have had to license \u201cThe Thorn\u201d to the producer of their choice.\n\n108. Artists and producers far more successful than the Defendants (such as \u201cHappy\u201d  phenom, Pharrell Williams and pop queen Lady Gaga) have openly expressed their love of \u201cThe Thorn\u201d through their praise of the \u201cRigamortus\u201d instrumental. Plaintiffs\u2019 opportunity to license \u201cThe Thorn\u201d for use by artists and/or producers on that level has been eliminated by Defendants\u2019 excessive exploitation of the song.\n\nWHEREFORE, Reed/Soldier\u2019s Hymn and Jones/WJ3 pray as set forth above and for the following relief:\n\n(i) Ordering Defendants to immediately cease and desist all exploitation of all versions of \u201cRigamortus\u201d/\u201dRigamortis\u201d and their derivatives and remakes and associated audiovisual works;\n\n(ii) Ordering the impoundment and destruction of all infringing articles;\n\n(iii) Ordering Defendants to transfer to Plaintiffs all copyrights in \u201cRigamortus\u201d, \u201cRigamortus (Remix)\u201d, and \u201cRigamortus (Full Instrumental)\u201d, including but not limited to copyright in the sound recordings and underlying compositions in all versions of the songs;\n\n(iv) Ordering Defendants to amend all U.S. Copyright Registrations, ASCAP Registrations and HFA Registrations so that all Defendants are removed and replaced by Plaintiffs as authors and copyright claimants;\n\n(v) Ordering Defendants, jointly and severally, to pay Plaintiffs damages they have sustained and will sustain, and any income, gains, profits, and advantages obtained by Defendants as a result of their wrongful acts alleged hereinabove, in an amount according to  proof but not less than $1,000,000.00;\n\n(vi) Full disgorgement of Defendants\u2019 profits from the infringement;\n\n(vii) Ordering Defendants to pay to Plaintiffs all royalties earned now and in the future from all versions of \u201cRigamortus\u201d/\u201dRigamortis\u201d without deductions for any expenses or disbursements such as recording costs;\n\n(viii) Ordering Defendants, jointly and severally, to pay Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses, and costs incurred in connection with this action, in an amount which cannot yet be\n\n(ix) Ordering Defendants, jointly and severally, to pay to Plaintiffs pre- and post- judgment interest;\n\n(x) Ordering Defendants, jointly and severally, to acknowledge Plaintiffs as authors and creators of the \u201cRigamortus\u201d sound recordings and underlying compositions, and all derivative works which have been released or authorized and will be released or authorized, indirectly or directly, by Defendants;\n\n(xi) Ordering Defendants publicly to acknowledge the infringement and apologize to Reed, Jones, and the other musicians who made possible their success;\n\n(xii) For such further relief and remedies the Court may deem just and proper.JURY TRIAL DEMANDEDPlaintiffs hereby request a trial by jury on each claim for relief alleged in the Complaint.\n\nDated: July 2, 2014\n\nERIC S.

"Songs of the South: Tennessee - p.3 LyricsCumberland Plateau, Tennessee Valley and\nUnaka Mountains Region -\nBluegrass and String Band Music\n\nBluegrass and string band music has one of the most fiercely loyal audiences in American music.  Followers don't look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life.  You'll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members, and many make it their life's work.  That kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music. Whether it's history and tradition they hear, or that they hear it as a true expression of Americana, the performers and their audiences are passionate. You'll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by Leslie Blake Price entitled Bluegrass Nation: A Historical and Cultural Analysis of America's Truest Music.\n\nAny discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknow-ledge the contributions of the Carter Family.  They were one of the most influential groups in country music history, and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to \"folk stories in song\".  The original group consisted of A.P., his wife Sara, and her sister Maybelle.  They influenced all that followed in country and folk music, from Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Doc Watson all the way up to Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris and Ketch Secor.\n\nIt's unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the Carter Family's contributions. A.P. collected hundreds of Appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today.  They recorded hundreds of songs. but \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", and \"Keep on the Sunny Side\" will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music.\n\nThat foundation work was built-up by those who followed.  In bluegrass, there are no better examples of where we are today today than Earl Skruggs' \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", the Foggy Mountain Boys' \"Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms\" or the Osborne Brothers' \"Rocky Top\", but here is a short list of more recent (and also great) examples of bluegrass and string music:Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Sweet Amarillo\"The SteelDrivers' \"Wearin' a Hole\"The Grascals' \"Old Friend of Mine\"Dailey & Vincent's \"Take Me Back (And Leave Me There)\"Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas and Russ Barenberg's\n\"St. Anne's Reel\"Wilson Banjo Company's \"95 Years\"Yonder Mountain String Band's \"Alison\"Top Ten Music Shrines in Tennessee\nIf you're into music and history, here are some great places to visit when you're in Tennessee:In the Coastal Plains region:Graceland - Memphis\nElvis promised his parents he'd build them the finest house in town, and put an end to years of struggle. Graceland was the fulfillment of that dream.Sun Studios - Memphis\nJohhny Cash, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis recorded here - all at the same time.Stax American Soul Music Museum - Memphis\nStax made hit soul music in the 50s and 60s, and this is one of only a few museums dedicated to soul.In the Nashville Basin region:Country Music Hall of Fame - Nashville\nThe museum\u2019s core exhibition is \"Sing Me Back Home: A Journey Through Country Music\". It's a full-immersion experience.Ryman Auditorium - Nashville\nThe first Grand Ole Opry started here in 1925. It's almost like being in a cathedral.Johnny Cash Museum - Nashville\nIt's captivating, real and raw - just like Cash himself.Jack Daniel's Distillery - Lynchburg\nWhat, you ask, does Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 have to do with Tennessee music?In the Cumberland/TN Valley/Unaka Mtns region:Cumberland Caverns - McMinnville\nBluegrass concerts are presented every month in the Volcano Room of Cumberland Caverns. They've been featured on NBC and PBS.Dollywood - Pigeon Forge\nThink of it as Disneyland with a bluegrass soundtrack.Birthplace of Country Music Museum - Bristol\nTells the story of the 1927 Bristol Sessions recordings that included the Carter Family and Jimmie RodgersTennessee Artists:Here's a list of some of the most famous musicians that were born in Tennessee or made the state their home. Each artist is listed with one - three songs to give you a sampler of their music. The list is long, but not comprehensive. Think of it as a primer. (With apologies to our Texas readers for the inclusion of Townes Van Zandt and other sons of the republic.

to scream and shout\nYou keep on playing games\nI walk around the block and I think maybe you'll change\nBut just when it seems we've got it all worked out\nYou start naming names\nI don't believe that I was the one to blame\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd maybe next time you'll cry\nWhen someone like me says goodbye\nYou'll wake up when she's gone and wonder\nHow you could let her go\nBut look at me, I'm

all the leaves on the trees are falling\nTo the sound of the breezes that blow\nAnd I\u2019m trying to please to the calling\nOf your heartstrings that play soft and low\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou know the night\u2019s magic seems to whisper and hush\nYou know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush\n\n[Chorus]\nCan I just have one more moondance with you, my love?\nCan I just make some more romance with you, my love?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I want to make love to you tonight\nI can\u2019t wait \u2019til the morning has come\nAnd I know now the time is just right\nAnd straight into my arms you will run\nAnd when you come my heart will be waiting\nTo make sure that you\u2019re never alone\nThere and then all my dreams will come true, dear\nThere and then I will make you my own\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd every time I touch you, you just tremble inside\nThen I know how much you want me that you can\u2019t hide\n\n[Chorus]\nCan I just have one more moondance with you, my

me one more time just for old time's sake\nLove me one more time there's no more pride at stake\nLove me one more time we can erase all the lonely days\nOne more time one more time one more time\n\nI wish that I could find the strength\nTo walk out the door with my pride\nBut memories of our faded love\nKeep pushing the judgment aside\nI wish that you would lay down beside me\nIf only to buffer the pain\nThere's no one else waiting to fill up my night\nAnd I like a familiar terrain\n\nYes since we're both together\nAnd it's lonesome out tonight\nMaybe we can help each other\nIf you hold me very tight\n\nLove me one more time just for old time's sake\nLove me one more time there's no more pride at stake\nLove me one more time we can erase all the lonely days\nOne more time one more time one more time\n\nI said love me one more time just for old time's sake\nLove me one more time there's no more pride at stake\nLove me one more time we can erase all the lonely days\nOne more time one more time one more time\nYou might also likeI said love me one more time just for old time's sake\nLove me one more time there's no more pride at stake\nLove me one more time we can erase all the lonely days\nOne more time one more time one more timeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 418, "api_path": "/songs/409534", "artist_names": "Radio Hamburg", "full_title": "Radio Hamburg TOP

Ghetto Lyrics[Intro: Lou Rawls]\nYou know\nI was in New York City a few months ago\nAnd the garbage and the trashmen were on strike\nI'm tellin', the maintenance people of the city\nWhat they were tryin' to do\nThey were tryin' to get a little more money\nYou know, get a little raise in pay\nBut at that particular time the city was broke\nThey were about to declare default\nI tell you, the garbage in some places\nWere stacked up two, three stories high\nAt night, haha\nBoy, at night it weren't even safe to walk the street\n'Cause there come the rats\nThe roaches and the waterbugs\nAnd the neighborhood hustlin', baby\nTryin' to get somethin' to eat, see?\nAnd let met tell you somethin'\nIt was stinkin'\nAnd it was all kind of diseases in there, you know?\nBut it only brought to mind the fact that\nYou can no longer depend on the man downtown\nTo take care of business like he's supposed to\nWhen he's supposed to\nIf all of us would get it like it's supposed to be\nAs far as cleaniness, you know, and safety\nWe gotta get together and do it for ourselves\nThat's the only way it's gonna be done\nAnd you know what I'm talkin' about?\nLet me tell you what I mean\nClean it up, clean it up (Well, y'all)\nClean it up, clean it up (You gotta get it)\nClean it up, clean it up (Yes, gonna get it)\nClean it up, clean it up\nGhetto!\nTalkin' 'bout the ghetto!\nGhetto is our home\nThat's where we live, where we live\n\n[Billy Paul]\nGet some paint, fetch your hammer, your nails\nYour broom, your mop and your pails\nWe're gonna wash it, polish\nAnd make it all clean\n\n[Archie Bell]\nLet's wash away all of the sins\nTime for a new life to begin\nIn the ghetto\nI said (Clean it up, clean it up)\nI said we're gonna (Clean it up, clean it up)\n\nBecause the

order for us to survive\nI said we're gonna (Clean it up, clean it up) Do it\nWe got to (Clean it up, clean it up) Hey!\n\n(Ghetto) Said the ghetto\n(Ghetto is our home)\nThat's where we live from day to day\n(Where we live, where we live)\n\n[The O'Jays]\nAll of you brothers that live on the mainline\nYou lived in the ghetto once upon a time\nWe need everybody to lend a hand\nNow you've helped everybody else\nNow's the time for you to help yourself\nWe can't depend, depend on the people downtown\nWell, well, get it up, get it up\nClean it up, clean it up (Well, well, ya)\nClean it up, clean it up (Hey, hey, hey)\nGhetto, ghetto\nGhetto is our home\nYeah, that's where we live, where we live\nI said (Clean it up, clean it up)\n(Come on, y'all, let's clean it up, clean it up)\n(Come on,

Now this preference is a main element in our nature, and as we study it we find ourselves opening up a number of large questions on every side.\n\nLet me go back for a moment to what I have already quoted from Bishop Wilson:\u2014\"First, never go against the best light you have; secondly, take care that your light be not darkness.\" I said we show, as a nation, laudable energy and persistence in walking according to the best light we have, but are not quite careful enough, perhaps, to see that our light be not darkness. This is only another version of the old story that energy is our strong point and favourable characteristic, rather than intelligence. But we may give to this idea a more general form still, in which it will have a yet larger range of application. We may regard this energy driving at practice, this paramount sense of the obligation of duty, self-control, and work, this earnestness in going manfully with the best light we [143] have, as one force. And we may regard the intelligence driving at those ideas which are, after all, the basis of right practice, the ardent sense for all the new and changing combinations of them which man's development brings with it, the indomitable impulse to know and adjust them perfectly, as another force. And these two forces we may regard as in some sense rivals,\u2014rivals not by the necessity of their own nature, but as exhibited in man and his history,\u2014and rivals dividing the empire of the world between them. And to give these forces names from the two races of men who have supplied the most signal and splendid manifestations of them, we may call them respectively the forces of Hebraism and Hellenism. Hebraism and Hellenism,\u2014between these two points of influence moves our world. At one time it feels more powerfully the attraction of one of them, at another time of the other; and it ought to be, though it never is, evenly and happily balanced between them.\n\nThe final aim of both Hellenism and Hebraism, as of all great spiritual disciplines, is no doubt the same: man's perfection or salvation. The very language which they both of them use in schooling [144] us to reach this aim is often identical. Even when their language indicates by variation,\u2014sometimes a broad variation, often a but slight and subtle variation,\u2014the different courses of thought which are uppermost in each discipline, even then the unity of the final end and aim is still apparent. To employ the actual words of that discipline with which we ourselves are all of us most familiar, and the words of which, therefore, come most home to us, that final end and aim is \"that we might be partakers of the divine nature.\"  These are the words of a Hebrew apostle, but of Hellenism and Hebraism alike this is, I say, the aim. When the two are confronted, as they very often are confronted, it is nearly always with what I may call a rhetorical purpose; the speaker's whole design is to exalt and enthrone one of the two, and he uses the other only as a foil and to enable him the better to give effect to his purpose. Obviously, with us, it is usually Hellenism which is thus reduced to minister to the triumph of Hebraism. There is a sermon on Greece and the Greek spirit by a man never to be mentioned without interest and respect, Frederick Robertson, in which this rhetorical use of Greece and the Greek [145] spirit, and the inadequate exhibition of them necessarily consequent upon this, is almost ludicrous, and would be censurable if it were not to be explained by the exigences of a sermon. On the other hand, Heinrich Heine, and other writers of his sort, give us the spectacle of the tables completely turned, and of Hebraism brought in just as a foil and contrast to Hellenism, and to make the superiority of Hellenism more manifest. In both these cases there is injustice and misrepresentation. The aim and end of both Hebraism and Hellenism is, as I have said, one and the same, and this aim and end is august and admirable.\n\nStill, they pursue this aim by very different courses. The uppermost idea with Hellenism is to see things as they really are; the uppermost idea with Hebraism is conduct and obedience. Nothing can do away with this ineffaceable difference; the Greek quarrel with the body and its desires is, that they hinder right thinking, the Hebrew quarrel with them is, that they hinder right acting. \"He that keepeth the law, happy is he;\" \"There is nothing sweeter than to take heed unto the commandments of the Lord;\" +\u2014that is the Hebrew [146] notion of felicity; and, pursued with passion and tenacity, this notion would not let the Hebrew rest till, as is well known, he had, at last, got out of the law a network of prescriptions to enwrap his whole life, to govern every moment of it, every impulse, every action. The Greek notion of felicity, on the other hand, is perfectly conveyed in these words of a great French moralist: \"C'est le bonheur des hommes\"\u2014when? when they abhor that which is evil?\u2014 no; when they exercise themselves in the law of the Lord day and night?\u2014no; when they die daily?\u2014no; when they walk about the New Jerusalem with palms in their hands?\u2014no; but when they think aright, when their thought hits,\u2014\"quand ils pensent juste.\" At the bottom of both the Greek and the Hebrew notion is the desire, native in man, for reason and the will of God, the feeling after the universal order,\u2014in a word, the love of God. But, while Hebraism seizes upon certain plain, capital intimations of the universal order, and rivets itself, one may say, with unequalled grandeur of earnestness and intensity on the study and observance of them, the bent of Hellenism is to follow, with flexible activity, the whole play of the universal order, to be [147] apprehensive of missing any part of it, of sacrificing one part to another, to slip away from resting in this or that intimation of it, however capital. An unclouded clearness of mind, an unimpeded play of thought, is what this bent drives at. The governing idea of Hellenism is spontaneity of consciousness; that of Hebraism, strictness of conscience.\n\nChristianity changed nothing in this essential bent of Hebraism to set doing above knowing. Self-conquest, self-devotion, the following not our own individual will, but the will of God, obedience, is the fundamental idea of this form, also, of the discipline to which we have attached the general name of Hebraism. Only, as the old law and the network of prescriptions with which it enveloped human life were evidently a motive power not driving and searching enough to produce the result aimed at,\u2014patient continuance in well doing, self- conquest,\u2014Christianity substituted for them boundless devotion to that inspiring and affecting pattern of self-conquest offered by Christ; and by the new motive power, of which the essence was this, though the love and admiration of Christian churches have for centuries been employed in varying, amplifying, [148] and adorning the plain description of it, Christianity, as St. Paul truly says, \"establishes the law,\"+ and in the strength of the ampler power which she has thus supplied to fulfil it, has accomplished the miracles, which we all see, of her history.\n\nSo long as we do not forget that both Hellenism and Hebraism are profound and admirable manifestations of man's life, tendencies, and powers, and that both of them aim at a like final result, we can hardly insist too strongly on the divergence of line and of operation with which they proceed. It is a divergence so great that it most truly, as the prophet Zechariah says,  \"has raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece!\" + The difference whether it is by doing or by knowing that we set most store, and the practical consequences which follow from this difference, leave their mark on all the history of our race and of its development. Language may be abundantly quoted from both Hellenism and Hebraism to make it seem that one follows the same current as the other towards the same goal. They are, truly, borne towards the same goal; but the currents which bear them are infinitely different. It is true, Solomon will praise [149] knowing:  \"Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it.\" + And in the New Testament, again, Christ is a \"light,\"+ and \"truth makes us free.\"+ It is true, Aristotle will undervalue knowing: \"In what concerns virtue,\"  says he, \"three things are necessary,\u2014knowledge, deliberate will, and perseverance; but, whereas the two last are all important, the first is a matter of little importance.\"  It is true that with the same impatience with which St. James enjoins a man to be not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work,+ Epictetus exhorts us to do what we have demonstrated to ourselves we ought to do; or he taunts us with futility, for being armed at all points to prove that lying is wrong, yet all the time continuing to lie. It is true, Plato, in words which are almost the words of the New Testament or the Imitation, calls life a learning to die. But underneath the superficial agreement the fundamental divergence still subsists. The understanding of Solomon is \"the walking in the way of the commandments;\" this is \"the way of peace,\" + and it is of this that blessedness comes. In the New Testament, the truth which gives us the peace of God and makes us free, is the love of Christ constraining [150] us to crucify, as he did, and with a like purpose of moral regeneration, the flesh with its affections and lusts, and thus establishing, as we have seen, the law. To St. Paul it appears possible to \"hold the truth in unrighteousness,\"+ which is just what Socrates judged impossible. The moral virtues, on the other hand, are with Aristotle but the porch and access to the intellectual, and with these last is blessedness. That partaking of the divine life, which both Hellenism and Hebraism, as we have said, fix as their crowning aim, Plato expressly denies to the man of practical virtue merely, of self-conquest with any other motive than that of perfect intellectual vision; he reserves it for the lover of pure knowledge, of seeing things as they really are,\u2014the philomath\u00eas.+\nBoth Hellenism and Hebraism arise out of the wants of human nature, and address themselves to satisfying those wants. But their methods are so different, they lay stress on such different points, and call into being by their respective disciplines such different activities, that the face which human nature presents when it passes from the hands of one of them to those of the other, is no longer the [151] same. To get rid of one's ignorance, to see things as they are, and by seeing them as they are to see them in their beauty, is the simple and attractive ideal which Hellenism holds out before human nature; and from the simplicity and charm of this ideal, Hellenism, and human life in the hands of Hellenism, is invested with a kind of a\u00ebrial ease, clearness, and radiancy; they are full of what we call sweetness and light. Difficulties are kept out of view, and the beauty and rationalness of the ideal have all our thoughts. \"The best man is he who most tries to perfect himself, and the happiest man is he who most feels that he is perfecting himself,\" \u2014this account of the matter by Socrates, the true Socrates of the Memorabilia, has something so simple, spontaneous, and unsophisticated about it, that it seems to fill us with clearness and hope when we hear it. But there is a saying which I have heard attributed to Mr. Carlyle about Socrates,\u2014a very happy saying, whether it is really Mr. Carlyle's or not,\u2014which excellently marks the essential point in which Hebraism differs from Hellenism. \"Socrates,\" this saying goes, \"is terribly at ease in Zion\" Hebraism,\u2014and here is the source of its [152] wonderful strength,\u2014 has always been severely preoccupied with an awful sense of the impossibility of being at ease in Zion; of the difficulties which oppose themselves to man's pursuit or attainment of that perfection of which Socrates talks so hopefully, and, as from this point of view one might almost say, so glibly. It is all very well to talk of getting rid of one's ignorance, of seeing things in their reality, seeing them in their beauty; but how is this to be done when there is something which thwarts and spoils all our efforts? This something is sin; and the space which sin fills in Hebraism, as compared with Hellenism, is indeed prodigious. This obstacle to perfection fills the whole scene, and perfection appears remote and rising away from earth, in the background. Under the name of sin, the difficulties of knowing oneself and conquering oneself which impede man's passage to perfection, become, for Hebraism, a positive, active entity hostile to man, a mysterious power which I heard Dr. Pusey the other day, in one of his impressive sermons, compare to a hideous hunchback seated on our shoulders, and which it is the main business of our lives to hate and oppose. The discipline of the [153] Old Testament may be summed up as a discipline teaching us to abhor and flee from sin; the discipline of the New Testament, as a discipline teaching us to die to it. As Hellenism speaks of thinking clearly, seeing things in their essence and beauty, as a grand and precious feat for man to achieve, so Hebraism speaks of becoming conscious of sin, of awakening to a sense of sin, as a feat of this kind. It is obvious to what wide divergence these differing tendencies, actively followed, must lead. As one passes and repasses from Hellenism to Hebraism, from Plato to St. Paul, one feels inclined to rub one's eyes and ask oneself whether man is indeed a gentle and simple being, showing the traces of a noble and divine nature; or an unhappy chained captive, labouring with groanings that cannot be uttered to free himself from the body of this death.\n\nApparently it was the Hellenic conception of human nature which was unsound, for the world could not live by it. Absolutely to call it unsound, however, is to fall into the common error of its Hebraising enemies; but it was unsound at that particular moment of man's development, it was premature. The indispensable basis of conduct and [154] self-control, the platform upon which alone the perfection aimed at by Greece can come into bloom, was not to be reached by our race so easily; centuries of probation and discipline were needed to bring us to it. Therefore the bright promise of Hellenism faded, and Hebraism ruled the world. Then was seen that astonishing spectacle, so well marked by the often quoted words of the prophet Zechariah, when men of all languages of the nations took hold of the skirt of him that was a Jew, saying:\u2014 \"We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\" + And the Hebraism which thus received and ruled a world all gone out of the way and altogether become unprofitable, was, and could not but be, the later, the more spiritual, the more attractive development of Hebraism. It was Christianity; that is to say, Hebraism aiming at self-conquest and rescue from the thrall of vile affections, not by obedience to the letter of a law, but by conformity to the image of a self-sacrificing example. To a world stricken with moral enervation Christianity offered its spectacle of an inspired self-sacrifice; to men who refused themselves nothing, it showed one who refused [155] himself everything;\u2014\"my Saviour banished joy\" says George Herbert. When the alma Venus, the life-giving and joy-giving power of nature, so fondly cherished by the Pagan world, could not save her followers from self- dissatisfaction and ennui, the severe words of the apostle came bracingly and refreshingly: \"Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.\" + Throughout age after age, and generation after generation, our race, or all that part of our race which was most living and progressive, was baptized into a death;+ and endeavoured, by suffering in the flesh, to cease from sin. Of this endeavour, the animating labours and afflictions of early Christianity, the touching asceticism of mediaeval Christianity, are the great historical manifestations. Literary monuments of it, each, in its own way, incomparable, remain in the Epistles of St. Paul, in St. Augustine's Confessions, and in the two original and simplest books of the Imitation.*\n\nOf two disciplines laying their main stress, the [156] one, on clear intelligence, the other, on firm obedience; the one, on comprehensively knowing the grounds of one's duty, the other, on diligently practising it; the one on taking all possible care (to use Bishop Wilson's words again) that the light we have be not darkness, the other, that according to the best light we have we diligently walk,\u2014the priority naturally belongs to that discipline which braces man's moral powers, and founds for him an indispensable basis of character. And, therefore, it is justly said of the Jewish people, who were charged with setting powerfully forth that side of the divine order to which the words conscience and self-conquest point, that they were \"entrusted with the oracles of God;\" + as it is justly said of Christianity, which followed Judaism and which set forth this side with a much deeper effectiveness and a much wider influence, that the wisdom of the old Pagan world was foolishness compared to it. No words of devotion and admiration can be too strong to render thanks to these beneficent forces which have so borne forward humanity in its appointed work of coming to the knowledge and possession of itself; above all, in those great [157] moments when their action was the wholesomest and the most necessary.\n\nBut the evolution of these forces, separately and in themselves, is not the whole evolution of humanity,\u2014their single history is not the whole history of man; whereas their admirers are always apt to make it stand for the whole history. Hebraism and Hellenism are, neither of them, the law of human development, as their admirers are prone to make them; they are, each of them, contributions to human development,\u2014august contributions, invaluable contributions; and each showing itself to us more august, more invaluable, more preponderant over the other, according to the moment in which we take them, and the relation in which we stand to them. The nations of our modern world, children of that immense and salutary movement which broke up the Pagan world, inevitably stand to Hellenism in a relation which dwarfs it, and to Hebraism in a relation which magnifies it. They are inevitably prone to take Hebraism as the law of human development, and not as simply a contribution to it, however precious. And yet the lesson must perforce be [158] learned, that the human spirit is wider than the most priceless of the forces which bear it onward, and that to the whole development of man Hebraism itself is, like Hellenism, but a contribution.\n\nPerhaps we may help ourselves to see this clearer by an illustration drawn from the treatment of a single great idea which has profoundly engaged the human spirit, and has given it eminent opportunities for showing its nobleness and energy. It surely must be perceived that the idea of the immortality of the soul, as this idea rises in its generality before the human spirit, is something grander, truer, and more satisfying, than it is in the particular forms by which St. Paul, in the famous fifteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Corinthians,+ and Plato, in the Phaedo, endeavour to develope and establish it. Surely we cannot but feel, that the argumentation with which the Hebrew apostle goes about to expound this great idea is, after all, confused and inconclusive; and that the reasoning, drawn from analogies of likeness and equality, which is employed upon it by the Greek philosopher, is over-subtle and sterile? Above and beyond the inadequate solutions which Hebraism and Hellenism here attempt, extends the immense [159] and august problem itself, and the human spirit which gave birth to it. And this single illustration may suggest to us how the same thing happens in other cases also.\n\nBut meanwhile, by alternations of Hebraism and Hellenism, of man's intellectual and moral impulses, of the effort to see things as they really are, and the effort to win peace by self-conquest, the human spirit proceeds, and each of these two forces has its appointed hours of culmination and seasons of rule. As the great movement of Christianity was a triumph of Hebraism and man's moral impulses, so the great movement which goes by the name of the Renascence* was an uprising and re-instatement of man's intellectual impulses and of Hellenism. We in England, the devoted children of Protestantism, chiefly know the Renascence by its subordinate and secondary side of the Reformation. The Reformation has been often called a Hebraising revival, a return to the ardour and sincereness of primitive [160] Christianity. No one, however, can study the development of Protestantism and of Protestant churches without feeling that into the Reformation too,\u2014Hebraising child of the Renascence and offspring of its fervour, rather than its intelligence, as it undoubtedly was,\u2014the subtle Hellenic leaven of the Renascence found its way, and that the exact respective parts in the Reformation, of Hebraism and of Hellenism, are not easy to separate. But what we may with truth say is, that all which Protestantism was to itself clearly conscious of, all which it succeeded in clearly setting forth in words, had the characters of Hebraism rather than of Hellenism. The Reformation was strong, in that it was an earnest return to the Bible and to doing from the heart the will of God as there written; it was weak, in that it never consciously grasped or applied the central idea of the Renascence,\u2014the Hellenic idea of pursuing, in all lines of activity, the law and science, to use Plato's words, of things as they really are. Whatever direct superiority, therefore, Protestantism had over Catholicism was a moral superiority, a superiority arising out of its greater sincerity and earnestness,\u2014at the moment of its apparition at any [161] rate,\u2014in dealing with the heart and conscience; its pretensions to an intellectual superiority are in general quite illusory. For Hellenism, for the thinking side in man as distinguished from the acting side, the attitude of mind of Protestantism towards the Bible in no respect differs from the attitude of mind of Catholicism towards the Church. The mental habit of him who imagines that Balaam's ass spoke, in no respect differs from the mental habit of him who imagines that a Madonna of wood or stone winked; and the one, who says that God's Church makes him believe what he believes, and the other, who says that God's Word makes him believe what he believes, are for the philosopher perfectly alike in not really and truly knowing, when they say God's Church and God's Word, what it is they say, or whereof they affirm.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, therefore, Hellenism re-entered the world, and again stood in presence of Hebraism,\u2014a Hebraism renewed and purged. Now, it has not been enough observed, how, in the seventeenth century, a fate befell Hellenism in some respects analogous to that which befell it at the commencement of our era. The Renascence, that [162] great re-awakening of Hellenism, that irresistible return of humanity to nature and to seeing things as they are, which in art, in literature, and in physics, produced such splendid fruits, had, like the anterior Hellenism of the Pagan world, a side of moral weakness, and of relaxation or insensibility of the moral fibre, which in Italy showed itself with the most startling plainness, but which in France, England, and other countries was very apparent too. Again this loss of spiritual balance, this exclusive preponderance given to man's perceiving and knowing side, this unnatural defect of his feeling and acting side, provoked a reaction. Let us trace that reaction where it most nearly concerns us.\n\nScience has now made visible to everybody the great and pregnant elements of difference which lie in race, and in how signal a manner they make the genius and history of an Indo-European people vary from those of a Semitic people. Hellenism is of Indo-European growth, Hebraism is of Semitic growth; and we English, a nation of Indo- European stock, seem to belong naturally to the movement of Hellenism. But nothing more strongly marks the essential unity of man than the affinities we can [163] perceive, in this point or that, between members of one family of peoples and members of another; and no affinity of this kind is more strongly marked than that likeness in the strength and prominence of the moral fibre, which, notwithstanding immense elements of difference, knits in some special sort the genius and history of us English, and of our American descendants across the Atlantic, to the genius and history of the Hebrew people. Puritanism, which has been so great a power in the English nation, and in the strongest part of the English nation, was originally the reaction, in the seventeenth century, of the conscience and moral sense of our race, against the moral indifference and lax rule of conduct which in the sixteenth century came in with the Renascence. It was a reaction of Hebraism against Hellenism; and it powerfully manifested itself, as was natural, in a people with much of what we call a Hebraising turn, with a signal affinity for the bent which was the master-bent of Hebrew life. Eminently Indo-European by its humour, by the power it shows, through this gift, of imaginatively acknowledging the multiform aspects of the problem of life, and of thus getting itself unfixed from its own over- [164] certainty, of smiling at its own over-tenacity, our race has yet (and a great part of its strength lies here), in matters of practical life and moral conduct, a strong share of the assuredness, the tenacity, the intensity of the Hebrews. This turn manifested itself in Puritanism, and has had a great part in shaping our history for the last two hundred years. Undoubtedly it checked and changed amongst us that movement of the Renascence which we see producing in the reign of Elizabeth such wonderful fruits; undoubtedly it stopped the prominent rule and direct development of that order of ideas which we call by the name of Hellenism, and gave the first rank to a different order of ideas. Apparently, too, as we said of the former defeat of Hellenism, if Hellenism was defeated, this shows that Hellenism was imperfect, and that its ascendency at that moment would not have been for the world's good.\n\nYet there is a very important difference between the defeat inflicted on Hellenism by Christianity eighteen hundred years ago, and the check given to the Renascence by Puritanism. The greatness of the difference is well measured by the difference in force, beauty, significance and usefulness, between [165] primitive Christianity and Protestantism. Eighteen hundred years ago it was altogether the hour of Hebraism; primitive Christianity was legitimately and truly the ascendent force in the world at that time, and the way of mankind's progress lay through its full development. Another hour in man's development began in the fifteenth century, and the main road of his progress then lay for a time through Hellenism. Puritanism was no longer the central current of the world's progress, it was a side stream crossing the central current and checking it. The cross and the check may have been necessary and salutary, but that does not do away with the essential difference between the main stream of man's advance and a cross or side stream. For more than two hundred years the main stream of man's advance has moved towards knowing himself and the world, seeing things as they are, spontaneity of consciousness; the main impulse of a great part, and that the strongest part, of our nation, has been towards strictness of conscience. They have made the secondary the principal at the wrong moment, and the principal they have at the wrong moment treated as secondary. This contravention of the [166] natural order has produced, as such contravention always must produce, a certain confusion and false movement, of which we are now beginning to feel, in almost every direction, the inconvenience. In all directions our habitual courses of action seem to be losing efficaciousness, credit, and control, both with others and even with ourselves; everywhere we see the beginnings of confusion, and we want a clue to some sound order and authority. This we can only get by going back upon the actual instincts and forces which rule our life, seeing them as they really are, connecting them with other instincts and forces, and enlarging our whole view and rule of life.\n\nNotes\n\n145. +Proverbs 29:18 is the source of the first passage. I have not found the exact language of the second quotation, but the thought resembles that of Psalms 19:9-10:  \"The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.\" King James Bible.\n\n148. +Romans 3:31. \"Do we then make void the law through faith? / God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\" King James Bible.\n\n148. +Zechariah 9:12-13. \"Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee; / When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.\" King James Bible.\n149. +Proverbs 16:22.  \"Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.\"  King James Bible.\n\n149. +John 8:12. \"Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" And again: John 9:4-5. \"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. / As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\"  King James Bible.\n\n149. +John 8:31-32.  \"Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; / And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\"  King James Bible.\n\n149. +James 1:25. \"But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.\" King James Bible.\n\n149. +Proverbs 2:20-21 may be the passage Arnold has in mind, although the language differs:  \"That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. / For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.\" One of the central devices in Proverbs is the metaphor of the \"path\"\u2014of uprightness, folly, etc. King James Bible.\n\n150. +Romans 1:18.  \"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.\"  King James Bible.\n\n150. +Philomath\u00eas, \"fond of knowledge, loving knowledge.\"  (Liddell and Scott.)

Saint Paul wrestles in this chapter to explain the Resurrection's promise. For example, refer to 15:50-53: \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. / Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, / In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. / For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"\n159. *I have ventured to give to the foreign word Renaissance, destined to become of more common use amongst us as the movement which it denotes comes, as it will come, increasingly to interest us, an English form.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1688130",

day\nYou might also likeWho's gonna love her\nWhen you send her on home to Brooklyn\nWhile her mom and her dad are running free in L.A\nWhile her mom and her dad are running free in L.AEmbed"},

felon, nigga, who you tellin'?\n[Chorus: Havoc]\nCause we allustrious, ashes to ashes\nAnd dust to dust, if you fuck with us\nIt's a must we bust, and if you stand with us\nNine times out of ten son

trash rap - wanna fight me?\nYou shook to death, take breaths and step lightly\nY'all Little League niggas is so bald they might be\nSpent too much time with wifey, come out to play\nWith the hard-headed, Infamous song torture\nCrack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight\nPull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights\nMy spiral book, hold the world's most lethal\nThere's no cure, for what my pen do neither\nBring the fever, y'all niggas is the rap jesters\nWhile we was gone for a moment, y'all kept the crowd goin' now\nMove over bacon, time for some'in meatier\nYour shit's weak, your best song was mediocre\nFuck a penis, how dare you entertain the thought\nThat you could come out to challenge me in blood talk?\nTake a walk jerk, this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill\nThis is rap for real, somethin' you feel\nYou catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo\nIt's heavy metal for the black people, rock'n'roll\nBut it's hip-hop though, my drug music\nIt's thereapeutic to the user, you slam dance to it\nYou might also like[Chorus: Prodigy]\nNigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes 'til death do us\nAnd y'all weak to us\nIf you stand amongst

lead up in shit\nThe better you get, the better we get, and that's it\nYo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom\nStop 'em in they tracks, goin at 'em when you send 'em\nImperial dogs, creepin' through fog\nCarved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal\nWe roll Mobb D-iezel, the whole Q.U. double-E, N-S\nAnd when you spot us, play low-key\n[Verse 4: Prodigy]\nDunn these niggas is actresses\nAnd they tryin' to play the man's role\nCan't they see us wildin' out on the video?\nDon't they see us in the club swingin' elbows?\nOr on the street with our jewels on the cell

your heart\nCause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart\nChallengin' the Mobb in the arts\nOur literature stands colossal, compared to y'alls\nWay ahead of your time, you're strugglin' to

There are several grades of lawyers' clerks. There is the articled clerk, who has paid a premium, and is an attorney in perspective, who runs a tailor's bill, receives invitations to parties, knows a family in Gower Street, and another in Tavistock Square; who goes out of town every long vacation to see his father, who keeps live horses innumerable; and who is, in short, the very aristocrat of clerks. There is the salaried clerk\u2014out of door, or in door, as the case may be\u2014who devotes the major part of his thirty shillings a week to his Personal pleasure and adornments, repairs half-price to the Adelphi Theatre at least three times a week, dissipates majestically at the cider cellars afterwards, and is a dirty caricature of the fashion which expired six months ago. There is the middle-aged copying clerk, with a large family, who is always shabby, and often drunk. And there are the office lads in their first surtouts, who feel a befitting contempt for boys at day-schools, club as they go home at night, for saveloys and porter, and think there's nothing like 'life.' There are varieties of the genus, too numerous to recapitulate, but however numerous they may be, they are all to be seen, at certain regulated business hours, hurrying to and from the places we have just mentioned.\n\nThese sequestered nooks are the public offices of the legal profession, where writs are issued, judgments signed, declarations filed, and numerous other ingenious machines put in motion for the torture and torment of His Majesty's liege subjects, and the comfort and emolument of the practitioners of the law. They are, for the most part, low-roofed, mouldy rooms, where innumerable rolls of parchment, which have been perspiring in secret for the last century, send forth an agreeable odour, which is mingled by day with the scent of the dry-rot, and by night with the various exhalations which arise from damp cloaks, festering umbrellas, and the coarsest tallow candles.\n\nAbout half-past seven o'clock in the evening, some ten days or a fortnight after Mr. Pickwick and his friends returned to London, there hurried into one of these offices, an individual in a brown coat and brass buttons, whose long hair was scrupulously twisted round the rim of his napless hat, and whose soiled drab trousers were so tightly strapped over his Blucher boots, that his knees threatened every moment to start from their concealment. He produced from his coat pockets a long and narrow strip of parchment, on which the presiding functionary impressed an illegible black stamp. He then drew forth four scraps of paper, of similar dimensions, each containing a printed copy of the strip of parchment with blanks for a name; and having filled up the blanks, put all the five documents in his pocket, and hurried away.\n\nThe man in the brown coat, with the cabalistic documents in his pocket, was no other than our old acquaintance Mr. Jackson, of the house of Dodson & Fogg, Freeman's Court, Cornhill. Instead of returning to the office whence he came, however, he bent his steps direct to Sun Court, and walking straight into the George and Vulture, demanded to know whether one Mr. Pickwick was within.\n'Call Mr. Pickwick's servant, Tom,' said the barmaid of the George and Vulture.\n'Don't trouble yourself,' said Mr. Jackson. 'I've come on business. If you'll show me Mr. Pickwick's room I'll step up myself.'\n'What name, Sir?' said the waiter.\n'Jackson,' replied the clerk.\n\nThe waiter stepped upstairs to announce Mr. Jackson; but Mr. Jackson saved him the trouble by following close at his heels, and walking into the apartment before he could articulate a syllable.\n\nMr. Pickwick had, that day, invited his three friends to dinner; they were all seated round the fire, drinking their wine, when Mr. Jackson presented himself, as above described.\n\n'How de do, sir?' said Mr. Jackson, nodding to Mr. Pickwick.\nThat gentleman bowed, and looked somewhat surprised, for the physiognomy of Mr. Jackson dwelt not in his recollection.\n\n'I have called from Dodson and Fogg's,' said Mr. Jackson, in an explanatory tone.\nMr. Pickwick roused at the name. 'I refer you to my attorney, Sir; Mr. Perker, of Gray's Inn,' said he. 'Waiter, show this gentleman out.'\n'Beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick,' said Jackson, deliberately depositing his hat on the floor, and drawing from his pocket the strip of parchment. 'But personal service, by clerk or agent, in these cases, you know, Mr. Pickwick\u2014nothing like caution, sir, in all legal forms\u2014eh?'\n\nHere Mr. Jackson cast his eye on the parchment; and, resting his hands on the table, and looking round with a winning and persuasive smile, said, 'Now, come; don't let's have no words about such a little matter as this. Which of you gentlemen's name's Snodgrass?'\n\nAt this inquiry, Mr. Snodgrass gave such a very undisguised and palpable start, that no further reply was needed.\n\n'Ah! I thought so,' said Mr. Jackson, more affably than before. 'I've a little something to trouble you with, Sir.'\n'Me!'exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass.\n\n'It's only a subpoena in Bardell and Pickwick on behalf of the plaintiff,' replied Jackson, singling out one of the slips of paper, and producing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket. 'It'll come on, in the settens after Term: fourteenth of Febooary, we expect; we've marked it a special jury cause, and it's only ten down the paper. That's yours, Mr. Snodgrass.' As Jackson said this, he presented the parchment before the eyes of Mr. Snodgrass, and slipped the paper and the shilling into his hand.\n\nMr. Tupman had witnessed this process in silent astonishment, when Jackson, turning sharply upon him, said\u2014\n'I think I ain't mistaken when I say your name's Tupman, am I?'\nMr. Tupman looked at Mr. Pickwick; but, perceiving no encouragement in that gentleman's widely-opened eyes to deny his name, said\u2014\n\n'Yes, my name is Tupman, Sir.'\n'And that other gentleman's Mr. Winkle, I think?' said Jackson. Mr. Winkle faltered out a reply in the affirmative; and both gentlemen were forthwith invested with a slip of paper, and a shilling each, by the dexterous Mr. Jackson.\n\n'Now,' said Jackson, 'I'm afraid you'll think me rather troublesome, but I want somebody else, if it ain't inconvenient. I have Samuel Weller's name here, Mr. Pickwick.'\n\n'Send my servant here, waiter,' said Mr. Pickwick. The waiter retired, considerably astonished, and Mr. Pickwick motioned Jackson to a seat.\n\nThere was a painful pause, which was at length broken by the innocent defendant. 'I suppose, Sir,' said Mr. Pickwick, his indignation rising while he spoke\u2014'I suppose, Sir, that it is the intention of your employers to seek to criminate me upon the testimony of my own friends?'\n\nMr. Jackson struck his forefinger several times against the left side of his nose, to intimate that he was not there to disclose the secrets of the prison house, and playfully rejoined\u2014\n\n'Not knowin', can't say.'\n'For what other reason, Sir,' pursued Mr. Pickwick, 'are these subpoenas served upon them, if not for this?'\n\n'Very good plant, Mr. Pickwick,' replied Jackson, slowly shaking his head. 'But it won't do. No harm in trying, but there's little to be got out of me.'\nHere Mr. Jackson smiled once more upon the company, and, applying his left thumb to the tip of his nose, worked a visionary coffee-mill with his right hand, thereby performing a very graceful piece of pantomime (then much in vogue, but now, unhappily, almost obsolete) which was familiarly denominated 'taking a grinder.'\n'No, no, Mr. Pickwick,' said Jackson, in conclusion; 'Perker's people must guess what we've served these subpoenas for. If they can't, they must wait till the action comes on, and then they'll find out.' Mr. Pickwick bestowed a look of excessive disgust on his unwelcome visitor, and would probably have hurled some tremendous anathema at the heads of Messrs. Dodson & Fogg, had not Sam's entrance at the instant interrupted him.\n'Samuel Weller?' said Mr. Jackson, inquiringly.\n\n'Vun o' the truest things as you've said for many a long year,' replied Sam, in a most composed manner.\n\n'Here's a subpoena for you, Mr. Weller,' said Jackson.\n'What's that in English?' inquired Sam.\n'Here's the original,' said Jackson, declining the required explanation.\n'Which?' said Sam.\n'This,' replied Jackson, shaking the parchment.\n'Oh, that's the 'rig'nal, is it?' said Sam. 'Well, I'm wery glad I've seen the 'rig'nal, 'cos it's a gratifyin' sort o' thing, and eases vun's mind so much.'\n'And here's the shilling,' said Jackson. 'It's from Dodson and Fogg's.'\n'And it's uncommon handsome o' Dodson and Fogg, as knows so little of me, to come down vith a present,' said Sam. 'I feel it as a wery high compliment, sir; it's a wery honorable thing to them, as they knows how to reward merit werever they meets it. Besides which, it's affectin' to one's feelin's.'\n\nAs Mr. Weller said this, he inflicted a little friction on his right eyelid, with the sleeve of his coat, after the most approved manner of actors when they are in domestic pathetics.\n\nMr. Jackson seemed rather puzzled by Sam's proceedings; but, as he had served the subpoenas, and had nothing more to say, he made a feint of putting on the one glove which he usually carried in his hand, for the sake of appearances; and returned to the office to report progress.\n\nMr. Pickwick slept little that night; his memory had received a very disagreeable refresher on the subject of Mrs. Bardell's action. He breakfasted betimes next morning, and, desiring Sam to accompany him, set forth towards Gray's Inn Square.\n'Sam!' said Mr. Pickwick, looking round, when they got to the end of Cheapside.\n'Sir?' said Sam, stepping up to his master.\n\n'Which way?' 'Up Newgate Street.'\nMr. Pickwick did not turn round immediately, but looked vacantly in Sam's face for a few seconds, and heaved a deep sigh.\n'What's the matter, sir?' inquired Sam.\n\n'This action, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'is expected to come on, on the fourteenth of next month.' 'Remarkable coincidence that 'ere, sir,' replied Sam.\n'Why remarkable, Sam?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Walentine's day, sir,' responded Sam; 'reg'lar good day for a breach o' promise trial.'\nMr. Weller's smile awakened no gleam of mirth in his master's countenance. Mr. Pickwick turned abruptly round, and led the way in silence.\n\nThey had walked some distance, Mr. Pickwick trotting on before, plunged in profound meditation, and Sam following behind, with a countenance expressive of the most enviable and easy defiance of everything and everybody, when the latter, who was always especially anxious to impart to his master any exclusive information he possessed, quickened his pace until he was close at Mr. Pickwick's heels; and, pointing up at a house they were passing, said\u2014\n\n'Wery nice pork-shop that 'ere, sir.'\n'Yes, it seems so,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n'Celebrated sassage factory,' said Sam.\n'Is it?' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Is it!' reiterated Sam, with some indignation; 'I should rayther think it was. Why, sir, bless your innocent eyebrows, that's where the mysterious disappearance of a 'spectable tradesman took place four years ago.'\n\n'You don't mean to say he was burked, Sam?' said Mr. Pickwick, looking hastily round.\n\n'No, I don't indeed, sir,' replied Mr. Weller, 'I wish I did; far worse than that. He was the master o' that 'ere shop, sir, and the inwentor o' the patent-never-leavin'-off sassage steam-ingin, as 'ud swaller up a pavin' stone if you put it too near, and grind it into sassages as easy as if it was a tender young babby. Wery proud o' that machine he was, as it was nat'ral he should be, and he'd stand down in the celler a-lookin' at it wen it was in full play, till he got quite melancholy with joy. A wery happy man he'd ha' been, Sir, in the procession o' that 'ere ingin and two more lovely hinfants besides, if it hadn't been for his wife, who was a most owdacious wixin. She was always a-follerin' him about, and dinnin' in his ears, till at last he couldn't stand it no longer. \"I'll tell you what it is, my dear,\" he says one day; \"if you persewere in this here sort of amusement,\" he says, \"I'm blessed if I don't go away to 'Merriker; and that's all about it.\" \"You're a idle willin,\" says she, \"and I wish the 'Merrikins joy of their bargain.\" Arter which she keeps on abusin' of him for half an hour, and then runs into the little parlour behind the shop, sets to a-screamin', says he'll be the death on her, and falls in a fit, which lasts for three good hours\u2014one o' them fits wich is all screamin' and kickin'. Well, next mornin', the husband was missin'. He hadn't taken nothin' from the till\u2014hadn't even put on his greatcoat\u2014so it was quite clear he warn't gone to 'Merriker. Didn't come back next day; didn't come back next week; missis had bills printed, sayin' that, if he'd come back, he should be forgiven everythin' (which was very liberal, seein' that he hadn't done nothin' at all); the canals was dragged, and for two months arterwards, wenever a body turned up, it was carried, as a reg'lar thing, straight off to the sassage shop. Hows'ever, none on 'em answered; so they gave out that he'd run away, and she kep' on the bis'ness. One Saturday night, a little, thin, old gen'l'm'n comes into the shop in a great passion and says, \"Are you the missis o' this here shop?\" \"Yes, I am,\" says she. \"Well, ma'am,\" says he, \"then I've just looked in to say that me and my family ain't a-goin' to be choked for nothin'; and more than that, ma'am,\" he says, \"you'll allow me to observe that as you don't use the primest parts of the meat in the manafacter o' sassages, I'd think you'd find beef come nearly as cheap as buttons.\" \"As buttons, Sir!\" says she. \"Buttons, ma'am,\" says the little, old gentleman, unfolding a bit of paper, and showin' twenty or thirty halves o' buttons. \"Nice seasonin' for sassages, is trousers' buttons, ma'am.\" \"They're my husband's buttons!\" says the widder beginnin' to faint, \"What!\" screams the little old gen'l'm'n, turnin' wery pale. \"I see it all,\" says the widder; \"in a fit of temporary insanity he rashly converted hisself into sassages!\" And so he had, Sir,' said Mr. Weller, looking steadily into Mr. Pickwick's horror-stricken countenance, 'or else he'd been draw'd into the ingin; but however that might ha' been, the little, old gen'l'm'n, who had been remarkably partial to sassages all his life, rushed out o' the shop in a wild state, and was never heerd on arterwards!'\n\nThe relation of this affecting incident of private life brought master and man to Mr. Perker's chambers. Lowten, holding the door half open, was in conversation with a rustily-clad, miserable-looking man, in boots without toes and gloves without fingers. There were traces of privation and suffering\u2014almost of despair\u2014in his lank and care-worn countenance; he felt his poverty, for he shrank to the dark side of the staircase as Mr. Pickwick approached.\n\n'It's very unfortunate,' said the stranger, with a sigh.\n'Very,' said Lowten, scribbling his name on the doorpost with his pen, and rubbing it out again with the feather. 'Will you leave a message for him?'\n'When do you think he'll be back?' inquired the stranger.\n'Quite uncertain,' replied Lowten, winking at Mr. Pickwick, as the stranger cast his eyes towards the ground.\n\n'You don't think it would be of any use my waiting for him?' said the stranger, looking wistfully into the office.\n'Oh, no, I'm sure it wouldn't,' replied the clerk, moving a little more into the centre of the doorway. 'He's certain not to be back this week, and it's a chance whether he will be next; for when Perker once gets out of town, he's never in a hurry to come back again.'\n'Out of town!' said Mr. Pickwick; 'dear me, how unfortunate!'\n\n'Don't go away, Mr. Pickwick,' said Lowten, 'I've got a letter for you.' The stranger, seeming to hesitate, once more looked towards the ground, and the clerk winked slyly at Mr. PickwiCK, as if to intimate that some exquisite piece of humour was going forward, though what it was Mr. Pickwick could not for the life of him divine. 'Step in, Mr. Pickwick,' said Lowten. 'Well, will you leave a message, Mr. Watty, or will you call again?'\n\n'Ask him to be so kind as to leave out word what has been done in my business,' said the man; 'for God's sake don't neglect it, Mr. Lowten.'\n\n'No, no; I won't forget it,' replied the clerk. 'Walk in, Mr. Pickwick. Good-morning, Mr. Watty; it's a fine day for walking, isn't it?' Seeing that the stranger still lingered, he beckoned Sam Weller to follow his master in, and shut the door in his face.\n\n'There never was such a pestering bankrupt as that since the world began, I do believe!' said Lowten, throwing down his pen with the air of an injured man. 'His affairs haven't been in Chancery quite four years yet, and I'm d\u2014d if he don't come worrying here twice a week. Step this way, Mr. Pickwick. Perker IS in, and he'll see you, I know. Devilish cold,' he added pettishly, 'standing at that door, wasting one's time with such seedy vagabonds!' Having very vehemently stirred a particularly large fire with a particularly small poker, the clerk led the way to his principal's private room, and announced Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Ah, my dear Sir,' said little Mr. Perker, bustling up from his chair. 'Well, my dear sir, and what's the news about your matter, eh? Anything more about our friends in Freeman's Court? They've not been sleeping, I know that. Ah, they're very smart fellows; very smart, indeed.'\n\nAs the little man concluded, he took an emphatic pinch of snuff, as a tribute to the smartness of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg.\n\n'They are great scoundrels,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n'Aye, aye,' said the little man; 'that's a matter of opinion, you know, and we won't dispute about terms; because of course you can't be expected to view these subjects with a professional eye. Well, we've done everything that's necessary. I have retained Serjeant Snubbin.'\n\n'Is he a good man?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.\n'Good man!' replied Perker; 'bless your heart and soul, my dear Sir, Serjeant Snubbin is at the very top of his profession. Gets treble the business of any man in court\u2014engaged in every case. You needn't mention it abroad; but we say\u2014we of the profession\u2014that Serjeant Snubbin leads the court by the nose.'\n\nThe little man took another pinch of snuff as he made this communication, and nodded mysteriously to Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'They have subpoenaed my three friends,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n'Ah! of course they would,' replied Perker. 'Important witnesses; saw you in a delicate situation.'\n\n'But she fainted of her own accord,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'She threw herself into my arms.'\n\n'Very likely, my dear Sir,' replied Perker; 'very likely and very natural. Nothing more so, my dear Sir, nothing. But who's to prove it?'\n\n'They have subpoenaed my servant, too,' said Mr. Pickwick, quitting the other point; for there Mr. Perker's question had somewhat staggered him.\n\n'Sam?' said Perker.\nMr. Pickwick replied in the affirmative.\n\n'Of course, my dear Sir; of course. I knew they would. I could have told you that, a month ago. You know, my dear Sir, if you WILL take the management of your affairs into your own hands after entrusting them to your solicitor, you must also take the consequences.' Here Mr. Perker drew himself up with conscious dignity, and brushed some stray grains of snuff from his shirt frill.\n\n'And what do they want him to prove?' asked Mr. Pickwick, after two or three minutes' silence.\n\n'That you sent him up to the plaintiff 's to make some offer of a compromise, I suppose,' replied Perker. 'It don't matter much, though; I don't think many counsel could get a great deal out of HIM.'\n\n'I don't think they could,' said Mr. Pickwick, smiling, despite his vexation, at the idea of Sam's appearance as a witness. 'What course do we pursue?'\n'We have only one to adopt, my dear Sir,' replied Perker; 'cross-examine the witnesses; trust to Snubbin's eloquence; throw dust in the eyes of the judge; throw ourselves on the jury.'\n\n'And suppose the verdict is against me?' said Mr. Pickwick.\nMr. Perker smiled, took a very long pinch of snuff, stirred the fire, shrugged his shoulders, and remained expressively silent.\n\n'You mean that in that case I must pay the damages?' said Mr. Pickwick, who had watched this telegraphic answer with considerable sternness.\n\nPerker gave the fire another very unnecessary poke, and said, 'I am afraid so.'\n'Then I beg to announce to you my unalterable determination to pay no damages whatever,' said Mr. Pickwick, most emphatically. 'None, Perker. Not a pound, not a penny of my money, shall find its way into the pockets of Dodson and Fogg. That is my deliberate and irrevocable determination.' Mr. Pickwick gave a heavy blow on the table before him, in confirmation of the irrevocability of his intention.\n\n'Very well, my dear Sir, very well,' said Perker. 'You know best, of course.'\n'Of course,' replied Mr. Pickwick hastily. 'Where does Serjeant Snubbin live?' 'In Lincoln's Inn Old Square,' replied Perker.\n'I should like to see him,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'See Serjeant Snubbin, my dear Sir!' rejoined Perker, in utter amazement. 'Pooh, pooh, my dear Sir, impossible. See Serjeant Snubbin! Bless you, my dear Sir, such a thing was never heard of, without a consultation fee being previously paid, and a consultation fixed. It couldn't be done, my dear Sir; it couldn't be done.'\n\nMr. Pickwick, however, had made up his mind not only that it could be done, but that it should be done; and the consequence was, that within ten minutes after he had received the assurance that the thing was impossible, he was conducted by his solicitor into the outer office of the great Serjeant Snubbin himself.\n\nIt was an uncarpeted room of tolerable dimensions, with a large writing-table drawn up near the fire, the baize top of which had long since lost all claim to its original hue of green, and had gradually grown gray with dust and age, except where all traces of its natural colour were obliterated by ink-stains. Upon the table were numerous little bundles of papers tied with red tape; and behind it, sat an elderly clerk, whose sleek appearance and heavy gold watch-chain presented imposing indications of the extensive and lucrative practice of Mr. Serjeant Snubbin.\n\n'Is the Serjeant in his room, Mr. Mallard?' inquired Perker, offering his box with all imaginable courtesy.\n\n'Yes, he is,' was the reply, 'but he's very busy. Look here; not an opinion given yet, on any one of these cases; and an expedition fee paid with all of 'em.' The clerk smiled as he said this, and inhaled the pinch of snuff with a zest which seemed to be compounded of a fondness for snuff and a relish for fees.\n\n'Something like practice that,' said Perker.\n'Yes,' said the barrister's clerk, producing his own box, and offering it with the greatest cordiality; 'and the best of it is, that as nobody alive except myself can read the serjeant's writing, they are obliged to wait for the opinions, when he has given them, till I have copied 'em, ha-ha-ha!'\n\n'Which makes good for we know who, besides the serjeant, and draws a little more out of the clients, eh?' said Perker; 'ha, ha, ha!' At this the serjeant's clerk laughed again\u2014not a noisy boisterous laugh, but a silent, internal chuckle, which Mr. Pickwick disliked to hear. When a man bleeds inwardly, it is a dangerous thing for himself; but when he laughs inwardly, it bodes no good to other people.\n\n'You haven't made me out that little list of the fees that I'm in your debt, have you?' said Perker.\n\n'No, I have not,' replied the clerk.\n'I wish you would,' said Perker. 'Let me have them, and I'll send you a cheque. But I suppose you're too busy pocketing the ready money, to think of the debtors, eh? ha, ha, ha!' This sally seemed to tickle the clerk amazingly, and he once more enjoyed a little quiet laugh to himself.\n\n'But, Mr. Mallard, my dear friend,' said Perker, suddenly recovering his gravity, and drawing the great man's great man into a Corner, by the lappel of his coat; 'you must persuade the Serjeant to see me, and my client here.'\n\n'Come, come,' said the clerk, 'that's not bad either. See the Serjeant! come, that's too absurd.' Notwithstanding the absurdity of the proposal, however, the clerk allowed himself to be gently drawn beyond the hearing of Mr. Pickwick; and after a short conversation conducted in whispers, walked softly down a little dark passage, and disappeared into the legal luminary's sanctum, whence he shortly returned on tiptoe, and informed Mr. Perker and Mr. Pickwick that the Serjeant had been prevailed upon, in violation of all established rules and customs, to admit them at once.\n\nMr. Serjeant Snubbins was a lantern-faced, sallow-complexioned man, of about five-and-forty, or\u2014as the novels say\u2014he might be fifty. He had that dull-looking, boiled eye which is often to be seen in the heads of people who have applied themselves during many years to a weary and laborious course of study; and which would have been sufficient, without the additional eyeglass which dangled from a broad black riband round his neck, to warn a stranger that he was very near-sighted. His hair was thin and weak, which was partly attributable to his having never devoted much time to its arrangement, and partly to his having worn for five-and-twenty years the forensic wig which hung on a block beside him. The marks of hairpowder on his coat-collar, and the ill-washed and worse tied white neckerchief round his throat, showed that he had not found leisure since he left the court to make any alteration in his dress; while the slovenly style of the remainder of his costume warranted the inference that his personal appearance would not have been very much improved if he had. Books of practice, heaps of papers, and opened letters, were scattered over the table, without any attempt at order or arrangement; the furniture of the room was old and rickety; the doors of the book-case were rotting in their hinges; the dust flew out from the carpet in little clouds at every step; the blinds were yellow with age and dirt; the state of everything in the room showed, with a clearness not to be mistaken, that Mr. Serjeant Snubbin was far too much occupied with his professional pursuits to take any great heed or regard of his personal comforts.\n\nThe Serjeant was writing when his clients entered; he bowed abstractedly when Mr. Pickwick was introduced by his solicitor; and then, motioning them to a seat, put his pen carefully in the inkstand, nursed his left leg, and waited to be spoken to.\n'Mr. Pickwick is the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick, Serjeant Snubbin,' said Perker.\n\n'I am retained in that, am I?' said the Serjeant.\n'You are, Sir,' replied Perker.\n\nThe Serjeant nodded his head, and waited for something else.\n'Mr. Pickwick was anxious to call upon you, Serjeant Snubbin,' said Perker, 'to state to you, before you entered upon the case, that he denies there being any ground or pretence whatever for the action against him; and that unless he came into court with clean hands, and without the most conscientious conviction that he was right in resisting the plaintiff's demand, he would not be there at all. I believe I state your views correctly; do I not, my dear Sir?' said the little man, turning to Mr. Pickwick.\n'Quite so,' replied that gentleman.\n\nMr. Serjeant Snubbin unfolded his glasses, raised them to his eyes; and, after looking at Mr. Pickwick for a few seconds with great curiosity, turned to Mr. Perker, and said, smiling slightly as he spoke\u2014'Has Mr. Pickwick a strong case?'\nThe attorney shrugged his shoulders.\n'Do you propose calling witnesses?'\n'No.'\nThe smile on the Serjeant's countenance became more defined; he rocked his leg with increased violence; and, throwing himself back in his easy-chair, coughed dubiously.\nThese tokens of the Serjeant's presentiments on the subject, slight as they were, were not lost on Mr. Pickwick. He settled the spectacles, through which he had attentively regarded such demonstrations of the barrister's feelings as he had permitted himself to exhibit, more firmly on his nose; and said with great energy, and in utter disregard of all Mr. Perker's admonitory winkings and frownings\u2014\n\n'My wishing to wait upon you, for such a purpose as this, Sir, appears, I have no doubt, to a gentleman who sees so much of these matters as you must necessarily do, a very extraordinary circumstance.'\n\nThe Serjeant tried to look gravely at the fire, but the smile came back again.\n'Gentlemen of your profession, Sir,' continued Mr. Pickwick, 'see the worst side of human nature. All its disputes, all its ill-will and bad blood, rise up before you. You know from your experience of juries (I mean no disparagement to you, or them) how much depends upon effect; and you are apt to attribute to others, a desire to use, for purposes of deception and Self-interest, the very instruments which you, in pure honesty and honour of purpose, and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your client, know the temper and worth of so well, from constantly employing them yourselves. I really believe that to this circumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of your being, as a body, suspicious, distrustful, and over-cautious. Conscious as I am, sir, of the disadvantage of making such a declaration to you, under such circumstances, I have come here, because I wish you distinctly to understand, as my friend Mr. Perker has said, that I am innocent of the falsehood laid to my charge; and although I am very well aware of the inestimable value of your assistance, Sir, I must beg to add, that unless you sincerely believe this, I would rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than have the advantage of them.'\n\nLong before the close of this address, which we are bound to say was of a very prosy character for Mr. Pickwick, the Serjeant had relapsed into a state of abstraction. After some minutes, however, during which he had reassumed his pen, he appeared to be again aware of the presence of his clients; raising his head from the paper, he said, rather snappishly\u2014\n\n'Who is with me in this case?'\n'Mr. Phunky, Serjeant Snubbin,' replied the attorney.\n'Phunky\u2014Phunky,' said the Serjeant, 'I never heard the name before. He must be a very young man.'\n\n'Yes, he is a very young man,' replied the attorney. 'He was only called the other day. Let me see\u2014he has not been at the Bar eight years yet.'\n'Ah, I thought not,' said the Serjeant, in that sort of pitying tone in which ordinary folks would speak of a very helpless little child. 'Mr. Mallard, send round to Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014' 'Phunky's\u2014Holborn Court, Gray's Inn,' interposed Perker. (Holborn Court, by the bye, is South Square now.) 'Mr. Phunky, and say I should be glad if he'd step here, a moment.'\n\nMr. Mallard departed to execute his commission; and Serjeant Snubbin relapsed into abstraction until Mr. Phunky himself was introduced.\nAlthough an infant barrister, he was a full-grown man. He had a very nervous manner, and a painful hesitation in his speech; it did not appear to be a natural defect, but seemed rather the result of timidity, arising from the consciousness of being 'kept down' by want of means, or interest, or connection, or impudence, as the case might be. He was overawed by the Serjeant, and profoundly courteous to the attorney.\n'I have not had the pleasure of seeing you before, Mr. Phunky,' said Serjeant Snubbin, with haughty condescension.\n\nMr. Phunky bowed. He HAD had the pleasure of seeing the Serjeant, and of envying him too, with all a poor man's envy, for eight years and a quarter.\n'You are with me in this case, I understand?' said the Serjeant.\n\nIf Mr. Phunky had been a rich man, he would have instantly sent for his clerk to remind him; if he had been a wise one, he would have applied his forefinger to his forehead, and endeavoured to recollect, whether, in the multiplicity of his engagements, he had undertaken this one or not; but as he was neither rich nor wise (in this sense, at all events) he turned red, and bowed.\n\n'Have you read the papers, Mr. Phunky?' inquired the Serjeant.\nHere again, Mr. Phunky should have professed to have forgotten all about the merits of the case; but as he had read such papers as had been laid before him in the course of the action, and had thought of nothing else, waking or sleeping, throughout the two months during which he had been retained as Mr. Serjeant Snubbin's junior, he turned a deeper red and bowed again.\n\n'This is Mr. Pickwick,' said the Serjeant, waving his pen in the direction in which that gentleman was standing.\n\nMr. Phunky bowed to Mr. Pickwick, with a reverence which a first client must ever awaken; and again inclined his head towards his leader.\n\n'Perhaps you will take Mr. Pickwick away,' said the Serjeant, 'and\u2014and\u2014and\u2014hear anything Mr. Pickwick may wish to communicate. We shall have a consultation, of course.' With that hint that he had been interrupted quite long enough, Mr. Serjeant Snubbin, who had been gradually growing more and more abstracted, applied his glass to his eyes for an instant, bowed slightly round, and was once more deeply immersed in the case before him, which arose out of an interminable lawsuit, originating in the act of an individual, deceased a century or so ago, who had stopped up a pathway leading from some place which nobody ever came from, to some other place which nobody ever went to.\n\nMr. Phunky would not hear of passing through any door until Mr. Pickwick and his solicitor had passed through before him, so it was some time before they got into the Square; and when they did reach it, they walked up and down, and held a long conference, the result of which was, that it was a very difficult matter to say how the verdict would go; that nobody could presume to calculate on the issue of an action; that it was very lucky they had prevented the other party from getting Serjeant Snubbin; and other topics of doubt and consolation, common in such a position of affairs.\n\nMr. Weller was then roused by his master from a sweet sleep of an hour's duration; and, bidding adieu to Lowten, they returned to the city.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1161148", "artist_names": "Cliff Richard", "full_title": "I Can\u2019t Ask

FOREST NEAR THE CAVE OF PROMETHEUS. PANTHEA AND IONE ARE SLEEPING: THEY AWAKEN GRADUALLY DURING THE FIRST SONG\n\nVOICE OF UNSEEN SPIRITS:\nThe pale stars are gone!\nFor the sun, their swift shepherd,\nTo their folds them compelling,\nIn the depths of the dawn,\nHastes, in meteor-eclipsing array, and the flee\nBeyond his blue dwelling,\nAs fawns flee the leopard.\nBut where are ye?\n[A TRAIN OF DARK FORMS AND SHADOWS PASSES BY CONFUSEDLY, SINGING.]\n\nHere, oh, here:\nWe bear the bier\nOf the father of many a cancelled year!\nSpectres we\nOf the dead Hours be,\nWe bear Time to his tomb in eternity.\nStrew, oh, strew\nHair, not yew!\nWet the dusty pall with tears, not dew!\nBe the faded flowers\nOf Death's bare bowers\nSpread on the corpse of the King of Hours!\nHaste, oh, haste!\nAs shades are chased,\nTrembling, by day, from heaven's blue waste.\nWe melt away,\nLike dissolving spray,\nFrom the children of a diviner day,\nWith the lullaby\nOf winds that die\nOn the bosom of their own harmony!\n\nIONE:\nWhat dark forms were they?\nPANTHEA:\nThe past Hours weak and gray,\nWith the spoil which their toil\nRaked together\nFrom the conquest but One could foil.\n\nIONE:\nHave they passed?\n\nPANTHEA:\nThey have passed;\nThey outspeeded the blast,\nWhile 'tis said, they are fled:\n\nIONE:\nWhither, oh, whither?\n\nPANTHEA:\nTo the dark, to the past, to the dead.\n\nVOICE OF UNSEEN SPIRITS:\nBright clouds float in heaven,\nDew-stars gleam on earth,\nWaves assemble on ocean,\nThey are gathered and driven\nBy the storm of delight, by the panic of glee!\nThey shake with emotion,\nThey dance in their mirth.\nBut where are ye?\nThe pine boughs are singing\nOld songs with new gladness,\nThe billows and fountains\nFresh music are flinging,\nLike the notes of a spirit from land and from sea;\nThe storms mock the mountains\nWith the thunder of gladness.\nBut where are ye?\nIONE:\nWhat charioteers are these?\n\nPANTHEA:\nWhere are their chariots?\n\nSEMICHORUS OF HOURS:\nThe voice of the Spirits of Air and of Earth\nHas drawn back the figured curtain of sleep\nWhich covered our being and darkened our birth\nIn the deep.\n\nA VOICE:\nIn the deep?\n\nSEMICHORUS 2:\nOh, below the deep.\n\nSEMICHORUS 1:\nAn hundred ages we had been kept\nCradled in visions of hate and care,\nAnd each one who waked as his brother slept,\nFound the truth\u2014\n\nSEMICHORUS 2:\nWorse than his visions were!\n\nSEMICHORUS 1:\nWe have heard the lute of Hope in sleep;\nWe have known the voice of Love in dreams;\nWe have felt the wand of Power, and leap\u2014\n\nSEMICHORUS 2:\nAs the billows leap in the morning beams!\n\nCHORUS:\nWeave the dance on the floor of the breeze,\nPierce with song heaven's silent light,\nEnchant the day that too swiftly flees,\nTo check its flight ere the cave of Night.\nOnce the hungry Hours were hounds\nWhich chased the day like a bleeding deer,\nAnd it limped and stumbled with many wounds\nThrough the nightly dells of the desert year.\nBut now, oh weave the mystic measure\nOf music, and dance, and shapes of light,\nLet the Hours, and the spirits of might and pleasure,\nLike the clouds and sunbeams, unite\u2014\n\nA VOICE:\nUnite!\n\nPANTHEA:\nSee, where the Spirits of the human mind\nWrapped in sweet sounds, as in bright veils, approach.\n\nCHORUS OF SPIRITS:\nWe join the throng\nOf the dance and the song,\nBy the whirlwind of gladness borne along;\nAs the flying-fish leap\nFrom the Indian deep,\nAnd mix with the sea-birds, half-asleep.\n\nCHORUS OF HOURS:\nWhence come ye, so wild and so fleet,\nFor sandals of lightning are on your feet,\nAnd your wings are soft and swift as thought,\nAnd your eyes are as love which is veiled not?\n\nCHORUS OF SPIRITS:\nWe come from the mind\nOf human kind\nWhich was late so dusk, and obscene, and blind,\nNow 'tis an ocean\nOf clear emotion,\nA heaven of serene and mighty motion.\nFrom that deep abyss\nOf wonder and bliss,\nWhose caverns are crystal palaces;\nFrom those skiey towers\nWhere Thought's crowned powers\nSit watching your dance, ye happy Hours!\nFrom the dim recesses\nOf woven caresses,\nWhere lovers catch ye by your loose tresses;\nFrom the azure isles,\nWhere sweet Wisdom smiles,\nDelaying your ships with her siren wiles.\nFrom the temples high\nOf Man's ear and eye,\nRoofed over Sculpture and Poesy;\nFrom the murmurings\nOf the unsealed springs\nWhere Science bedews her Daedal wings.\nYears after years,\nThrough blood, and tears,\nAnd a thick hell of hatreds, and hopes, and fears;\nWe waded and flew,\nAnd the islets were few\nWhere the bud-blighted flowers of happiness grew.\nOur feet now, every palm,\nAre sandalled with calm,\nAnd the dew of our wings is a rain of balm;\nAnd, beyond our eyes,\nThe human love lies\nWhich makes all it gazes on Paradise.\n\nCHORUS OF SPIRITS AND HOURS:\nThen weave the web of the mystic measure;\nFrom the depths of the sky and the ends of the earth,\nCome, swift Spirits of might and of pleasure,\nFill the dance and the music of mirth,\nAs the waves of a thousand streams rush by\nTo an ocean of splendour and harmony!\n\nCHORUS OF SPIRITS:\nOur spoil is won,\nOur task is done,\nWe are free to dive, or soar, or run;\nBeyond and around,\nOr within the bound\nWhich clips the world with darkness round.\nWe'll pass the eyes\nOf the starry skies\nInto the hoar deep to colonize;\nDeath, Chaos, and Night,\nFrom the sound of our flight,\nShall flee, like mist from a tempest's might.\nAnd Earth, Air, and Light,\nAnd the Spirit of Might,\nWhich drives round the stars in their fiery flight;\nAnd Love, Thought, and Breath,\nThe powers that quell Death,\nWherever we soar shall assemble beneath.\nAnd our singing shall build\nIn the void's loose field\nA world for the Spirit of Wisdom to wield;\nWe will take our plan\nFrom the new world of man,\nAnd our work shall be called the Promethean.\nCHORUS OF HOURS:\nBreak the dance, and scatter the song;\nLet some depart, and some remain;\n\nSEMICHORUS 1:\nWe, beyond heaven, are driven along:\n\nSEMICHORUS 2:\nUs the enchantments of earth retain:\n\nSEMICHORUS 1:\nCeaseless, and rapid, and fierce, and free,\nWith the Spirits which build a new earth and sea,\nAnd a heaven where yet heaven could never be;\n\nSEMICHORUS 2:\nSolemn, and slow, and serene, and bright,\nLeading the Day and outspeeding the Night,\nWith the powers of a world of perfect light;\n\nSEMICHORUS 1:\nWe whirl, singing loud, round the gathering sphere,\nTill the trees, and the beasts, and the clouds appear\nFrom its chaos made calm by love, not fear.\n\nSEMICHORUS 2:\nWe encircle the ocean and mountains of earth,\nAnd the happy forms of its death and birth\nChange to the music of our sweet mirth.\nCHORUS OF HOURS AND SPIRITS:\nBreak the dance, and scatter the song;\nLet some depart, and some remain,\nWherever we fly we lead along\nIn leashes, like starbeams, soft yet strong,\nThe clouds that are heavy with love's sweet rain.\n\nPANTHEA:\nHa! they are gone!\n\nIONE:\nYet feel you no delight\nFrom the past sweetness?\n\nPANTHEA:\nAs the bare green hill\nWhen some soft cloud vanishes into rain,\nLaughs with a thousand drops of sunny water\nTo the unpavilioned sky!\n\nIONE:\nEven whilst we speak\nNew notes arise. What is that awful sound?\n\nPANTHEA:\n'Tis the deep music of the rolling world\nKindling within the strings of the waved air\nAeolian modulations.\n\nIONE:\nListen too,\nHow every pause is filled with under-notes,\nClear, silver, icy, keen awakening tones,\nWhich pierce the sense, and live within the soul,\nAs the sharp stars pierce winter's crystal air\nAnd gaze upon themselves within the sea.\n\nPANTHEA:\nBut see where through two openings in the forest\nWhich hanging branches overcanopy,\nAnd where two runnels of a rivulet,\nBetween the close moss violet-inwoven,\nHave made their path of melody, like sisters\nWho part with sighs that they may meet in smiles,\nTurning their dear disunion to an isle _200\nOf lovely grief, a wood of sweet sad thoughts;\nTwo visions of strange radiance float upon\nThe ocean-like enchantment of strong sound,\nWhich flows intenser, keener, deeper yet\nUnder the ground and through the windless air.\n\nIONE:\nI see a chariot like that thinnest boat,\nIn which the Mother of the Months is borne\nBy ebbing light into her western cave,\nWhen she upsprings from interlunar dreams;\nO'er which is curved an orblike canopy\nOf gentle darkness, and the hills and woods,\nDistinctly seen through that dusk aery veil,\nRegard like shapes in an enchanter's glass;\nIts wheels are solid clouds, azure and gold,\nSuch as the genii of the thunderstorm\nPile on the floor of the illumined sea\nWhen the sun rushes under it; they roll\nAnd move and grow as with an inward wind;\nWithin it sits a winged infant, white\nIts countenance, like the whiteness of bright snow,\nIts plumes are as feathers of sunny frost,\nIts limbs gleam white, through the wind-flowing folds\nOf its white robe, woof of ethereal pearl.\nIts hair is white, the brightness of white light\nScattered in strings; yet its two eyes are heavens\nOf liquid darkness, which the Deity\nWithin seems pouring, as a storm is poured\nFrom jagged clouds, out of their arrowy lashes,\nTempering the cold and radiant air around,\nWith fire that is not brightness; in its hand\nIt sways a quivering moonbeam, from whose point\nA guiding power directs the chariot's prow\nOver its wheeled clouds, which as they roll\nOver the grass, and flowers, and waves, wake sounds,\nSweet as a singing rain of silver dew.\n\nPANTHEA:\nAnd from the other opening in the wood\nRushes, with loud and whirlwind harmony,\nA sphere, which is as many thousand spheres,\nSolid as crystal, yet through all its mass\nFlow, as through empty space, music and light:\nTen thousand orbs involving and involved,\nPurple and azure, white, and green, and golden,\nSphere within sphere; and every space between\nPeopled with unimaginable shapes,\nSuch as ghosts dream dwell in the lampless deep,\nYet each inter-transpicuous, and they whirl\nOver each other with a thousand motions,\nUpon a thousand sightless axles spinning,\nAnd with the force of self-destroying swiftness,\nIntensely, slowly, solemnly, roll on,\nKindling with mingled sounds, and many tones,\nIntelligible words and music wild.\nWith mighty whirl the multitudinous orb\nGrinds the bright brook into an azure mist\nOf elemental subtlety, like light;\nAnd the wild odour of the forest flowers,\nThe music of the living grass and air,\nThe emerald light of leaf-entangled beams\nRound its intense yet self-conflicting speed,\nSeem kneaded into one aereal mass\nWhich drowns the sense. Within the orb itself,\nPillowed upon its alabaster arms,\nLike to a child o'erwearied with sweet toil,\nOn its own folded wings, and wavy hair,\nThe Spirit of the Earth is laid asleep,\nAnd you can see its little lips are moving,\nAmid the changing light of their own smiles,\nLike one who talks of what he loves in dream.\n\nIONE:\n'Tis only mocking the orb's harmony.\n\nPANTHEA:\nAnd from a star upon its forehead, shoot,\nLike swords of azure fire, or golden spears\nWith tyrant-quelling myrtle overtwined,\nEmbleming heaven and earth united now,\nVast beams like spokes of some invisible wheel\nWhich whirl as the orb whirls, swifter than thought,\nFilling the abyss with sun-like lightenings,\nAnd perpendicular now, and now transverse,\nPierce the dark soil, and as they pierce and pass,\nMake bare the secrets of the earth's deep heart;\nInfinite mine of adamant and gold,\nValueless stones, and unimagined gems,\nAnd caverns on crystalline columns poised\nWith vegetable silver overspread;\nWells of unfathomed fire, and water springs\nWhence the great sea, even as a child is fed,\nWhose vapours clothe earth's monarch mountain-tops\nWith kingly, ermine snow. The beams flash on\nAnd make appear the melancholy ruins\nOf cancelled cycles; anchors, beaks of ships;\nPlanks turned to marble; quivers, helms, and spears,\nAnd gorgon-headed targes, and the wheels\nOf scythed chariots, and the emblazonry\nOf trophies, standards, and armorial beasts,\nRound which death laughed, sepulchred emblems\nOf dead destruction, ruin within ruin!\nThe wrecks beside of many a city vast,\nWhose population which the earth grew over\nWas mortal, but not human; see, they lie,\nTheir monstrous works, and uncouth skeletons,\nTheir statues, homes and fanes; prodigious shapes\nHuddled in gray annihilation, split,\nJammed in the hard, black deep; and over these,\nThe anatomies of unknown winged things,\nAnd fishes which were isles of living scale,\nAnd serpents, bony chains, twisted around\nThe iron crags, or within heaps of dust\nTo which the tortuous strength of their last pangs\nHad crushed the iron crags; and over these\nThe jagged alligator, and the might\nOf earth-convulsing behemoth, which once\nWere monarch beasts, and on the slimy shores,\nAnd weed-overgrown continents of earth,\nIncreased and multiplied like summer worms\nOn an abandoned corpse, till the blue globe\nWrapped deluge round it like a cloak, and they\nYelled, gasped, and were abolished; or some God\nWhose throne was in a comet, passed, and cried,\n'Be not!' And like my words they were no more.\n\nTHE EARTH:\nThe joy, the triumph, the delight, the madness!\nThe boundless, overflowing, bursting gladness,\nThe vaporous exultation not to be confined!\nHa! ha! the animation of delight\nWhich wraps me, like an atmosphere of light,\nAnd bears me as a cloud is borne by its own wind.\n\nTHE MOON:\nBrother mine, calm wanderer,\nHappy globe of land and air,\nSome Spirit is darted like a beam from thee,\nWhich penetrates my frozen frame,\nAnd passes with the warmth of flame,\nWith love, and odour, and deep melody\nThrough me, through me!\n\nTHE EARTH:\nHa! ha! the caverns of my hollow mountains,\nMy cloven fire-crags, sound-exulting fountains\nLaugh with a vast and inextinguishable laughter.\nThe oceans, and the deserts, and the abysses,\nAnd the deep air's unmeasured wildernesses,\nAnswer from all their clouds and billows, echoing after.\nThey cry aloud as I do. Sceptred curse,\nWho all our green and azure universe\nThreatenedst to muffle round with black destruction, sending\nA solid cloud to rain hot thunderstones,\nAnd splinter and knead down my children's bones,\nAll I bring forth, to one void mass battering and blending,\u2014\nUntil each crag-like tower, and storied column,\nPalace, and obelisk, and temple solemn,\nMy imperial mountains crowned with cloud, and snow, and fire,\nMy sea-like forests, every blade and blossom\nWhich finds a grave or cradle in my bosom,\nWere stamped by thy strong hate into a lifeless mire:\nHow art thou sunk, withdrawn, covered, drunk up\nBy thirsty nothing, as the brackish cup\nDrained by a desert-troop, a little drop for all;\nAnd from beneath, around, within, above,\nFilling thy void annihilation, love\nBursts in like light on caves cloven by the thunder-ball.\n\nTHE MOON:\nThe snow upon my lifeless mountains\nIs loosened into living fountains,\nMy solid oceans flow, and sing and shine:\nA spirit from my heart bursts forth,\nIt clothes with unexpected birth\nMy cold bare bosom: Oh! it must be thine\nOn mine, on mine!\nGazing on thee I feel, I know\nGreen stalks burst forth, and bright flowers grow,\nAnd living shapes upon my bosom move:\nMusic is in the sea and air,\nWinged clouds soar here and there,\nDark with the rain new buds are dreaming of:\n'Tis love, all love!\n\nTHE EARTH:\nIt interpenetrates my granite mass,\nThrough tangled roots and trodden clay doth pass\nInto the utmost leaves and delicatest flowers;\nUpon the winds, among the clouds 'tis spread,\nIt wakes a life in the forgotten dead,\nThey breathe a spirit up from their obscurest bowers.\nAnd like a storm bursting its cloudy prison\nWith thunder, and with whirlwind, has arisen\nOut of the lampless caves of unimagined being:\nWith earthquake shock and swiftness making shiver\nThought's stagnant chaos, unremoved for ever,\nTill hate, and fear, and pain, light-vanquished shadows, fleeing,\nLeave Man, who was a many-sided mirror,\nWhich could distort to many a shape of error,\nThis true fair world of things, a sea reflecting love;\nWhich over all his kind, as the sun's heaven\nGliding o'er ocean, smooth, serene, and even,\nDarting from starry depths radiance and life, doth move:\nLeave Man, even as a leprous child is left,\nWho follows a sick beast to some warm cleft\nOf rocks, through which the might of healing springs is poured;\nThen when it wanders home with rosy smile,\nUnconscious, and its mother fears awhile\nIt is a spirit, then, weeps on her child restored.\nMan, oh, not men! a chain of linked thought,\nOf love and might to be divided not,\nCompelling the elements with adamantine stress;\nAs the sun rules, even with a tyrant's gaze,\nThe unquiet republic of the maze\nOf planets, struggling fierce towards heaven's free wilderness.\nMan, one harmonious soul of many a soul,\nWhose nature is its own divine control,\nWhere all things flow to all, as rivers to the sea;\nFamiliar acts are beautiful through love;\nLabour, and pain, and grief, in life's green grove\nSport like tame beasts, none knew how gentle they could be!\nHis will, with all mean passions, bad delights,\nAnd selfish cares, its trembling satellites,\nA spirit ill to guide, but mighty to obey,\nIs as a tempest-winged ship, whose helm\nLove rules, through waves which dare not overwhelm,\nForcing life's wildest shores to own its sovereign sway.\nAll things confess his strength. Through the cold mass\nOf marble and of colour his dreams pass;\nBright threads whence mothers weave the robes their children wear;\nLanguage is a perpetual Orphic song,\nWhich rules with Daedal harmony a throng\nOf thoughts and forms, which else senseless and shapeless were.\nThe lightning is his slave; heaven's utmost deep\nGives up her stars, and like a flock of sheep\nThey pass before his eye, are numbered, and roll on!\nThe tempest is his steed, he strides the air;\nAnd the abyss shouts from her depth laid bare,\nHeaven, hast thou secrets? Man unveils me; I have none.\n\nTHE MOON:\nThe shadow of white death has passed\nFrom my path in heaven at last,\nA clinging shroud of solid frost and sleep;\nAnd through my newly-woven bowers,\nWander happy paramours,\nLess mighty, but as mild as those who keep\nThy vales more deep.\n\nTHE EARTH:\nAs the dissolving warmth of dawn may fold\nA half unfrozen dew-globe, green, and gold,\nAnd crystalline, till it becomes a winged mist,\nAnd wanders up the vault of the blue day,\nOutlives the noon, and on the sun's last ray\nHangs o'er the sea, a fleece of fire and amethyst.\n\nTHE MOON:\nThou art folded, thou art lying\nIn the light which is undying\nOf thine own joy, and heaven's smile divine;\nAll suns and constellations shower\nOn thee a light, a life, a power\nWhich doth array thy sphere; thou pourest thine\nOn mine, on mine!\n\nTHE EARTH:\nI spin beneath my pyramid of night,\nWhich points into the heavens dreaming delight,\nMurmuring victorious joy in my enchanted sleep;\nAs a youth lulled in love-dreams faintly sighing,\nUnder the shadow of his beauty lying,\nWhich round his rest a watch of light and warmth doth keep.\n\nTHE MOON:\nAs in the soft and sweet eclipse,\nWhen soul meets soul on lovers' lips,\nHigh hearts are calm, and brightest eyes are dull;\nSo when thy shadow falls on me,\nThen am I mute and still, by thee\nCovered; of thy love, Orb most beautiful,\nFull, oh, too full!\nThou art speeding round the sun\nBrightest world of many a one;\nGreen and azure sphere which shinest\nWith a light which is divinest\nAmong all the lamps of Heaven\nTo whom life and light is given;\nI, thy crystal paramour\nBorne beside thee by a power\nLike the polar Paradise,\nMagnet-like of lovers' eyes;\nI, a most enamoured maiden\nWhose weak brain is overladen\nWith the pleasure of her love,\nManiac-like around thee move\nGazing, an insatiate bride,\nOn thy form from every side\nLike a Maenad, round the cup\nWhich Agave lifted up\nIn the weird Cadmaean forest.\nBrother, wheresoe'er thou soarest\nI must hurry, whirl and follow\nThrough the heavens wide and hollow,\nSheltered by the warm embrace\nOf thy soul from hungry space,\nDrinking from thy sense and sight\nBeauty, majesty, and might,\nAs a lover or a chameleon\nGrows like what it looks upon,\nAs a violet's gentle eye\nGazes on the azure sky\nUntil its hue grows like what it beholds,\nAs a gray and watery mist\nGlows like solid amethyst\nAthwart the western mountain it enfolds,\nWhen the sunset sleeps\nUpon its snow\u2014\n\nTHE EARTH:\nAnd the weak day weeps\nThat it should be so.\nOh, gentle Moon, the voice of thy delight\nFalls on me like thy clear and tender light\nSoothing the seaman, borne the summer night,\nThrough isles for ever calm;\nOh, gentle Moon, thy crystal accents pierce\nThe caverns of my pride's deep universe,\nCharming the tiger joy, whose tramplings fierce\nMade wounds which need thy balm.\n\nPANTHEA:\nI rise as from a bath of sparkling water,\nA bath of azure light, among dark rocks,\nOut of the stream of sound.\n\nIONE:\nAh me! sweet sister,\nThe stream of sound has ebbed away from us,\nAnd you pretend to rise out of its wave,\nBecause your words fall like the clear, soft dew\nShaken from a bathing wood-nymph's limbs and hair.\n\nPANTHEA:\nPeace! peace! a mighty Power, which is as darkness,\nIs rising out of Earth, and from the sky\nIs showered like night, and from within the air\nBursts, like eclipse which had been gathered up\nInto the pores of sunlight: the bright visions,\nWherein the singing spirits rode and shone,\nGleam like pale meteors through a watery night.\n\nIONE:\nThere is a sense of words upon mine ear.\n\nPANTHEA:\nAn universal sound like words: Oh, list!\n\nDEMOGORGON:\nThou, Earth, calm empire of a happy soul,\nSphere of divinest shapes and harmonies,\nBeautiful orb! gathering as thou dost roll\nThe love which paves thy path along the skies:\n\nTHE EARTH:\nI hear: I am as a drop of dew that dies.\n\nDEMOGORGON:\nThou, Moon, which gazest on the nightly Earth\nWith wonder, as it gazes upon thee;\nWhilst each to men, and beasts, and the swift birth\nOf birds, is beauty, love, calm, harmony:\n\nTHE MOON:\nI hear: I am a leaf shaken by thee!\n\nDEMOGORGON:\nYe Kings of suns and stars, Daemons and Gods,\nEthereal Dominations, who possess\nElysian, windless, fortunate abodes\nBeyond Heaven's constellated wilderness:\n\nA VOICE FROM ABOVE:\nOur great Republic hears: we are blest, and bless.\n\nDEMOGORGON:\nYe happy Dead, whom beams of brightest verse\nAre clouds to hide, not colours to portray,\nWhether your nature is that universe\nWhich once ye saw and suffered\u2014\n\nA VOICE: FROM BENEATH:\nOr as they\n\nWhom we have left, we change and pass away.\nDEMOGORGON:\n\nYe elemental Genii, who have homes\nFrom man's high mind even to the central stone\nOf sullen lead; from heaven's star-fretted domes\nTo the dull weed some sea-worm battens on:\n\nA CONFUSED VOICE:\nWe hear: thy words waken Oblivion.\n\nDEMOGORGON:\nSpirits, whose homes are flesh; ye beasts and birds,\nYe worms and fish; ye living leaves and buds;\nLightning and wind; and ye untameable herds,\nMeteors and mists, which throng air's solitudes:\u2014\n\nA VOICE:\nThy voice to us is wind among still woods.\n\nDEMOGORGON:\nMan, who wert once a despot and a slave;\nA dupe and a deceiver; a decay;\nA traveller from the cradle to the grave\nThrough the dim night of this immortal day:\n\nALL:\nSpeak: thy strong words may never pass away.\n\nDEMOGORGON:\nThis is the day, which down the void abysm\nAt the Earth-born's spell yawns for Heaven's despotism,\nAnd Conquest is dragged captive through the deep:\nLove, from its awful throne of patient power\nIn the wise heart, from the last giddy hour\nOf dread endurance, from the slippery, steep,\nAnd narrow verge of crag-like agony, springs\nAnd folds over the world its healing wings.\nGentleness, Virtue, Wisdom, and Endurance,\nThese are the seals of that most firm assurance\nWhich bars the pit over Destruction's strength;\nAnd if, with infirm hand, Eternity,\nMother of many acts and hours, should free\nThe serpent that would clasp her with his length;\nThese are the spells by which to reassume\nAn empire o'er the disentangled doom.\nTo suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite;\nTo forgive wrongs darker than death or night;\nTo defy Power, which seems omnipotent;\nTo love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates\nFrom its own wreck the thing it contemplates;\nNeither to change, nor falter, nor repent;\nThis, like thy glory, Titan, is to be\nGood, great and joyous, beautiful and free;\nThis is alone Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4721361",

Sterling", "lyrics": "Don\u2019t Bring Black People to Clippers Games LyricsStiviano\nHoney, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nDonald Sterling\nI\u2019m sorry too.\n\nStiviano\nI wish I could change the skin. The color of my skin.\n\nSterling\nThat isn\u2019t the issue. You\u2019ve missed this issue.\nStiviano\nWhat\u2019s the issue?\n\nSterling\nThe issue is we don\u2019t have to broadcast everything.\n\nStiviano\nI\u2019m not broadcasting anything. I don\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nSterling\nNobody said you did anything wrong.\n\nStiviano\nI don\u2019t do anything wrong. If we ever have any issues it\u2019s because people call you and tell you things about me that are not true.\n\nSterling\nThen why are you broadcasting? \u2026 And why are you taking pictures with minorities...why?\nStiviano\nWhat\u2019s wrong with minorities? What\u2019s wrong with black people?\nSterling\nNothing. Nothing.\nStiviano\nWhat\u2019s wrong with Hispanics?\nSterling\nIt\u2019s like talking to an enemy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with minorities, they\u2019re fabulous. Fabulous. Because you\u2019re an enemy to me.\n\nStiviano\nWhy?\n\nSterling\nBecause you don\u2019t understand.\nStiviano\nI don\u2019t understand what?\n\nSterling\nNothing. Nothing.\n\nStiviano\nThat racism still is alive?\n\nSterling\nNo, but there\u2019s a culture. People feel certain things. Hispanics feel certain things towards blacks. Blacks feel certain things toward other groups. It\u2019s been that way historically, and it will always be that way.\nStiviano\nBut it\u2019s not that way in my heart and in my mind.\n\nSterling\nBut maybe you want to adjust to the world.\nStiviano\nBut why if the world doesn't do anything for me and they don't make me happy?\n\nSterling\nYou're right. I don't wanna argue with you. I don't wanna argue.\n\nStiviano\nI can\u2019t be racist in my heart.\n\nSterling\nAnd that\u2019s good. I\u2019m living in a culture, and I have to live within the culture. So that\u2019s the way it is\u2026.You can\u2019t be flexible. You can\u2019t be flexible, you can't--\n\nStiviano\nI am flexible. I understand that that\u2019s the way you were raised, and that\u2019s your culture. And I\u2019m respectful and--\nSterling\nWell why do have to disrespect them. Those are--\n\nStiviano\nWho am I disrespecting?\n\nSterling\nThe world before you.\nStiviano\nWhy am I disrespecting them?\n\nSterling\nBy walking, and you\u2019re perceived as either a Latina or a white girl. Why can\u2019t you be walking publicly with black people? Why? Is there a benefit to you?\nStiviano\nIs it a benefit to me? Does it matter if they\u2019re white or blue or yellow?\n\nSterling\nI guess that you don\u2019t know that. Maybe you\u2019re stupid. Maybe you don\u2019t know what people think of you. It does matter, yeah! It matters.\n\nStiviano\nDo you know that I\u2019m mixed?\n\nSterling\nNo, I don\u2019t know that.\n\nStiviano\nYou know that I\u2019m mixed.\n\nSterling\nYou told me you were going to remove those. You said, \u201cYes, I understand you.\u201d I mean, you change from day to day. Wow. So painful. Wow.\n\nStiviano\nPeople call you and tell you that I have black people on my Instagram. And it bothers you.\n\nSterling\nYeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you\u2019re associating with black people. Do you have to?\n\nStiviano\nYou associate with black people.\nSterling\nI\u2019m not you, and you\u2019re not me. You\u2019re supposed to be a delicate white or a delicate Latina girl.\nStiviano\nI\u2019m a mixed girl. And you\u2019re in love with me. And I\u2019m black and Mexican, whether you like it or not, whether the world accepts it or not. And you\u2019re asking me to remove something that\u2019s part of me and in my bloodstream because the world thinks different of me and you\u2019re afraid of what they\u2019re going to think see because of your upbringing? You want me to have hate towards black people?\n\nSterling\nI don\u2019t want you to have hate. That\u2019s what people do, they turn things around. I want you to love them, privately. In your whole life, everyday, you can be with them. Every single day of your life.\nStiviano\nBut not in public?\n\nSterling\nBut why publicize it on the Instagram and why bring it to my games?\n\nStiviano\nWhy bring the black people to the games...I\u2026\n\nSterling\nI don't think we need to discuss anymore. It's over. I don't wanna talk about it.\n\nStiviano\nI'm sorry that you feel that way.\n\nSterling\nI feel that way so strongly, and it may cause our relationship to just break apart. And if it does, it does. It's better to break apart now, than to break apart later.\nStiviano\nI\u2019m sorry that you still have people around you that are full of racism and hate in their heart. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re still racist in your heart. I\u2019m sorry that you live in a world that\u2019s still--\n\nSterling\nHow about your whole life, everyday, you could whatever you want. You can sleep with them, you can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is not to promote it on that...and not to bring them to my games.\n\nStiviano\nI don\u2019t bring anyone to the games.\n\nSterling\nOk then, there's nothing to argue about.\n\nStiviano\nI know.\n\nSterling\nOK, we\u2019ve got a big problem here...We\u2019ve got a big problem. If you didn\u2019t like someone that I was with I would stop seeing that person and\u2026\n\nStiviano\nI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have any more friends. What would you like me to do? Remove the skin color out of my skin?\n\nSterling\nIs that a real issue or are you making something up?\n\nStiviano\nI mean, I just don\u2019t understand what the issue is.\n\nSterling\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you or your skin color. Why are you saying these things? To upset me?\n\nStiviano\nSweetie, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nSterling\nI\u2019m so sorry too. We made a giant mistake. Both of us. Everything you say to me is so painful. Do I want you to change the color of your skin? You really know how to hurt somebody, instead of saying, \u201cI understand.\u201d\nStiviano\nI don\u2019t understand how you can have so much hate toward minorities.\nSterling\nI don\u2019t have any hate on nothing.\nStiviano\nHow a person like you who\u2019s elevated, who\u2019s here still feels he\u2019s above the world and you can\u2019t even be seen with someone considered of a different skin color.\nSterling\nThey can be with me all day long and all night long.\n\nStiviano\nI can\u2019t believe that a man who\u2019s educated, a man who\u2019s a scholar, a man--\n\nSterling\nWell, believe it, and stop talking about it! You\u2019re not making any good points. You can\u2019t believe this man...that\u2019s all I am. I\u2019m not a good person in your eyes. If I was a good person, you wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this, I can\u2019t believe that.\u201d Which are all lies. I love the black people.\nStiviano\nLook at all this negativity coming from--\n\nSterling\nThere is no negativity. I love everybody. I\u2019m just saying, in your lousy fucking Instagrams, you don\u2019t have to have yourself with, walking with black people. You don\u2019t have to. If you want to, do it.\n\nStiviano\nIf it\u2019s white people it\u2019s OK?\n\n[Long pause]\nStiviano\nIf it was Larry Bird, would it have made a difference?\nSterling\nYou\u2019re just a...big fighter. I can see -- who would want to live with a woman like you? Who would want to live with a woman like you? All you ever wanted to do is fight. You\u2019re a born fighter.\nStiviano\nI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re mad.\nSterling\nYou have the worst mouth.\n\nStiviano\nWhy are you so angry, honey? What\u2019s wrong?\n\nSterling\nWhy would you bring up Larry Bird? What does he got to do with it? You can walk all night long with your sisters. Or you family.\nStiviano\nI saw someone I admire. I admire Magic Johnson.\n\nSterling\nOK, good.\n\nStiviano\nI\u2019m sorry.\nSterling\nOK.\n\nStiviano\nHe\u2019s made a lot of changes for his community, for the world, for the people, for the minorities. He\u2019s helped a lot of people.\n\nSterling\nWhy are you forcing this down my throat? I\u2019m finished talking to you.\n\nStiviano\nAnd I took a picture with someone I admire. He happens to be black, and I\u2019m sorry.\nSterling\nI think that fact that you admire him -- I\u2019ve known him well, and he should be admired. And I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s too bad you can\u2019t admire him privately, and during YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE, your whole life, admire him, bring him here, feed him, fuck him, I don\u2019t care. You can do anything. But don\u2019t put him on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don\u2019t bring him to my games. OK?\n\nStiviano\nI don\u2019t...I\u2019ve never brought...I don\u2019t know him personally.\n\nSterling\nPlease leave me alone. Please? Please?\n\nStiviano\nI\u2019m sorry. Is there anything that I can do to make you feel better?\n\nSterling\nNo, you can never make me feel better.58Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1616826", "artist_names": "Donna Summer", "full_title": "Try Me, I Know We Can Make It by\u00a0Donna\u00a0Summer", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/219fbab69b1060ecfaeae06e4d4bcf99.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/219fbab69b1060ecfaeae06e4d4bcf99.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1616826, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 7705233, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1638138530, "path": "/Donna-summer-try-me-i-know-we-can-make-it-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Donna-summer-try-me-i-know-we-can-make-it-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1976, "month": 3, "day": 5}, "release_date_for_display": "March 5, 1976", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Mar. 5, 1976", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/219fbab69b1060ecfaeae06e4d4bcf99.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/219fbab69b1060ecfaeae06e4d4bcf99.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Try Me, I Know We Can Make It", "title_with_featured": "Try Me, I Know We Can Make It", "updated_by_human_at": 1638138576, "url": "https://genius.com/Donna-summer-try-me-i-know-we-can-make-it-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/223454", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4cb02c74065332b50a7b3511da5c5b17.500x331x1.jpg", "id": 223454, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f2b6c24793156c952712dea923eaf204.500x451x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Donna Summer", "slug": "Donna-summer", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Donna-summer"}, "artist": "Donna Summer", "lyrics": "Try Me, I Know We Can Make It LyricsTry me, try me, try me, try me\nJust one time\nTry me, try me, try me, try me\nAnytime, oh try me for love\nBaby, don't you think you should?\n\nFill me, fill me, fill me, fill me\nFull of love\nFill me, fill me, fill me, fill me\nTo the top, oh, fill me with love\nBaby, is my loving good?\nI just wanna feel your body close to mine\nI just wanna share my lovin', baby, all the time\nAll the time\n\nOh, try me, try me, try me, try me\nJust one time\nTry me, try me, try me, try me\nAnytime, oh try me for love\nBaby, won't you try me for love?\n\nI just wanna feel your body close to mine\nI just wanna share your lovin', baby, all the time\nAll the time\n\nOh, try me, try me, try me, try me\nJust one time\nTry me, try me, try me, try me\nJust one time\nBaby, won't you try me for love?\n\nTry me (Try me, try me, try me, try me\nJust one time)\nOh, try me (Try me, try me, try me, try me\nJust one time)\nBaby, try me (Try me, try me, try me, try me\nJust one time)\nI want you to try me (Try me, try me, try me, try me\nJust one time)\nOh now baby, please?

LyricsYou know most people look through their wallets or their pocketbooks\nAnd way down at the bottom Past the credit cards and baby pictures, greenstamps, you usually find a little old dog eared piece poetry\n\nI was cleaning out my wallet the other day and I ran across a whole bunch of I.O.U.'s some of them thirty years overdue. Funny thing is that all these I.O.U.'s are owed to one person, and I kinda feel like right now might be a pretty good time for an accounting\n\nMom, you listenin?\n\nMom, I owe you for so many things, a lot of services, like night watchman for instance, for lying awake nights listening for coughs, cries, creaking floorboards and me coming in too late. You had the eye of an eagle, the roar of a lion, but you always had a heart as big as a house\n\nI owe you for services as a short order cook, chef, baker, for making sirloin out of hamburger, turkey out of tuna fish and two big ol' strapping boys out of leftovers\nI owe you for cleaning services, for the daily scrubbing of face and ears all work done by hand and for the frequent dusting of a small boys pants to try to make sure that he led a spotless life and for washing and ironing, no laundry could ever do. For drying the tears of childhood and for Ironing out the problems of growing up\n\nI owe you for servics as a bodyguard, for protecting me from the terrors of thunderstorms and nightmares ha, and too many green apples\n\nAnd Lord knows I owe you for medical attention, for nursing me through measles, mumps, bruises, bumps, splinters and spring fever\nAnd let's not forget medical advise either, Oh, no\nImportant things like ha ha, don't scratching it or it won't get well\nIf you cross your eyes they're gonna stick like that And probably ah, most Important of all was, be sure you got on clean underwear boy, in case you're in an accident\n\nAnd I owe you for veterinarian services, for feeding every lost dog that I dragged home at the end of the rope and for healing the pains of puppy love\n\nAnd I owe you for entertainment, entertainment that kept the household going during some pretty tough times, for wonderful productions at Christmas, 4th of July and birthdays, and for making make believe come true on a very limited budget\n\nI owe you for construction work, for building kites, confidence, hopes and dreams and somehow you made em all touch the sky\n\nAnd for cementing a family together so it would stand the worst kinds of shocks and blows and for laying down a good strong foundation to build a life on\n\nI owe you for carrying charges, for carrying me on your books for the necessities of life that a growing boy just gotta have. Things like, a oh, a pair of high top boots with a little pocket on the side for a jackknife\n\nAnd one thing, Mom, I will never ever forget when there were two pieces of apple pie left and three hungry people I noticed that you were the one who suddenly decided that you really didn't like apple pie in the 1st place\n\nThese are just a very few of the things for which payment is long overdue, the person I owe em to worked very cheap\nShe managed by simply doing without a whole lotta things that she needed herself\n\nMy I.O.U.'s add up to much more than I could ever hope to repay\nBut you know the nicest thing about it all is that, I know that she'll mark the entire bill paid in full for just one kiss and four little words\nYou might also likeMom, I love youEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

heard her jingle\nIt's never struck a chord\nWith a smile as bright as sunshine\nShe called me through the poster\nAnd welcomed me aboard\nShe led me she fed me\nShe read me like a book\nBut I'm hiding in the small print\nWon't you take another look?\nAnd take me away\nTry me, Mandy, fly me away\n\n[Bridge]\nThe world was spinning like a ball\nAnd then it wasn't there at all\nAnd as my heart began to fall\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI saw her walking on the water\nAs the sharks were comin' for me\nI felt Mandy pull me up, give me the kiss of life\nJust like the girl in Dr. No No No No\nOh, when they pulled me from the wreckage\nAnd her body couldn't be found\nWas it in my mind it seems\nI had a crazy dream\nI told them so but they said no no no no\nYou might also like[Verse

Cory walks to up a vending machine to get a snack, while Feeny retrieves coffee from the machine next to it.]\n\nCory: Good morning, Mr. Feeny. (Puts money in vending machine and pushed button)\n\nFeeny: Morning, Mr. Matthews. (Cory pulls a candy bar from the vending machine) A candy bar? Doesn\u2019t your mother feed you a proper breakfast?\n\nCory: Oh yeah, she does. Now, I gotta get the taste of shredded wheat out of my mouth. (Opens candy bar)\n\nFeeny: Y\u2019know, you\u2019re not doing your body any favors loading up on junk like that. (Sips coffee)\n\nCory: Oh, thanks, Mr. Feeny. And please enjoy that high-vitamin astronaut drink you\u2019re sucking down. (Steps away)\nFeeny: There\u2019s no gravity in space, Mr. Matthews. Therefore astronauts suck up; learn from them. (Walks away)\n\n(Cory walks over to a table where is friends, Shawn and Nicolas are sitting and joins them)\n\nShawn: He\u2019s a teacher, man. Keeping ragging on him, he\u2019s gonna make your whole sixth grade year miserable\n\nCory: (Shrugs) I\u2019m gonna be miserable anyhow. At least this way I\u2019m taking him with me\n\nShawn: Hey, who\u2019s that? (Looks to a table where Feeny is sitting with a younger, female teacher)\n\nNicolas: I think she\u2019s new\n\nShawn: She must be new, she\u2019s talking to Feeny\n\nNicolas: (To Cory) Okay, so how late did you stay up last night?\n\nCory: Monologue.\n\nNicolas: Monologue, First Guest.\n\nShawn: Monologue, First Guest, Bad Sketch.\n\nCory: Monologue, First Guest, Bad Sketch, Funny Zoo Animal.\n\nNicolas: Monologue, First Guest, Bad Sketch, Funny Zoo Animal, Steve Lawrence!\nCory: Whoa!\n\nShawn: Steve Lawrence? (Nicolas nods)\n\n(Bell rings)\n\nShawn: (Stands with friends) And there\u2019s the bell\n\nCory: Four hours 'til lunch. (They all walk off)\n\n[Opening Credits]\n\n[SCENE \u2013 Feeny\u2019s classroom. Feeny has them acting out the famous scene from Romeo and Juliet, with a female student of his, Vanessa, lies on the desk while Nicolas stands over her]\n\nFeeny: She\u2019s dead, Mr. Bornihay. Pick up the knife and kill yourself\n\nNicolas: Come on, Mr. Feeny, you and I both know she\u2019s not really dead. May I please stab her a few times just to make sure?\n\nVanessa: (Sits up quickly and gets in Nicolas\u2019s face) Hey! You touch me with that knife, you better kill me the first time\n\nNicolas: (Terrified) Mr. Feeny\u2026\n\nFeeny: All right, all right\u2026 (Lays Vanessa back down)\n\n[Cut to Shawn and Cory, sitting in the back of the class. Shawn, sitting behind Cory, leans forward to speak. Cory has his hand cupped around his right ear]\nShawn: (Whispering) Cory\n\nCory: (Whispering) Huh?\n\nShawn: (Whispering) What\u2019s the score?\n\nCory: (Quietly, not quite whispering) Bottom of the third, two out, Dykstra\u2019s on second, Kruk\u2019s on first, 3 and 2 to Dalton. (Out of nowhere, Feeny\u2019s hand pulls Cory\u2019s hand away from his ear, revealing a small headphone)\n\nFeeny: (Pulls headphone out of Cory\u2019s ear) What\u2019s this, Mr. Matthews?\n\nCory: (Cups hand to ear) Huh? What\u2019d you say, Mr. Feeny? You took my hearing aid\n\nFeeny: (Pulls at the cord and takes Cory\u2019s radio, then puts the headphone in his ear) (Recites play-by-play unemotionally) Smoltz delivers, Dalton swings. Oh, he got a piece of that one. It\u2019s a long drive, deep to center. Otis Nixon back, back to the warning track, climbs up the wall, and\u2026 (Turns off radio)\n\nCory: (Buries face in hands, sighing) Ohh!\n\nFeeny: (Wrapping headphone wire around Cory\u2019s radio) Mr. Matthews, Romeo and Juliet is Shakespeare\u2019s ultimate testament of love between a man and a woman\n\nNicolas: (From offscreen) Help! Help! Mr. Feeny! Help! (Camera cuts to Nicolas, who is pinned to the desk by Vanessa, who\u2019s trying to stab him with the fake knife) Help! Help!\n\nFeeny: (Rushes over, manages to take the knife from Vanessa) Ms. Kincaid, thank you! Thank you (leads her off the desk) for that, uh, vigorous interpretation. (Places knife & radio on his desk, turns to Cory) Mr. Matthews, you do not listen to the ballgame in the middle of my class\n\nCory: (Stands) Mr. Feeny, who cares about some guy who killed himself over some dumb girl?\n\nFeeny: (Shakes his head, paces towards Cory) The tragedy here, Mr. Matthews, is not about a dumb girl or the boy who kills himself because of her. It\u2019s about the all-consuming power of love and the inevitability of its influence on each of our lives\n\nCory: (Looks at him with confusion) Are you aware that I\u2019m only eleven years old?\n\nFeeny: Are you aware that you have detention Friday afternoon?\n\nCory: No, actually I did not know that. (Feeny nods)\n\n[SCENE \u2013 Cory & Eric\u2019s room. Eric is pacing back & forth while talking on the phone.]\n\nEric: (Into phone) You will? Okay, great. (Pause) Yeah, me too. (Pause) All righty. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) Yes! (Jumps)\n\nCory: (Enters) YES! Phillies won, 8-3!\n\nEric: I\u2019m going out with Heather Ralston! (They give each other high fives)\n\nCory: You know what that means?\n\nEric: It means every guy in the tenth grade wants to be me. (Sits on bed)\n\nCory: It means if they win Friday night, that they\u2019re in the playoffs!\n\nEric: Look, Cory, we gotta talk about something\n\nCory: (Disregards Eric\u2019s remark, paces away in thought) That makes the game we\u2019re going to the most important game of the year!\n\nEric: Look, Cory, my date with Heather\u2019s Friday\n\nCory: (Paces back) Now, I got a slight case of detention from Feeny, but I\u2019ll just meet you at the bus. (Realizes) (Sternly) What?\n\nEric: It\u2019s the only night she was available\n\nCory: You\u2019re not going to the game? (Sits on bed) That\u2019s terrible\n\nEric: Actually, Cory, it, uh\u2026 it gets worse\n\nCory: (Desperately, semi-serious) She\u2019s going to the game with us?\n\nEric: (Encouragingly) You\u2019re really close!\n\nCory: (Unsure) She and I are going to the game?\n\nEric: (Stands) Come on, Cory, it\u2019s my first date with her. It\u2019s really important to me\n\nCory: (Stands) But Eric, going to the Phillies game is like our special thing\n\nEric: Cory, I\u2019m trying to get a special thing going with Heather. Now, look. You could be happy for me and accept this like a mature guy or you can\u2026\n\nCory: (Interrupting, screaming) DAD! (Exits running)\n\nEric: (Continuing his thought) Overreact\n\n[Cut to Matthews\u2019 living room. Alan is sitting on the couch reading the newspaper, Morgan is also on the couch playing with her doll, and Amy is sitting at the desk next to the staircase reading some letters. Cory enters, running]\n\nCory: Dad!\n\nAmy: Just the kid I want to see\n\nCory: Mom, we have a major problem. (Moves towards Alan at the couch)\n\nAmy: You have detention with Mr. Feeny. (Cory stops)\n\nCory: (Rhetorically) How could you possibly know that?\n\nAmy: (Steps over to Cory) He stuck his head over the fence and told me while I was bringing in the groceries\n\nCory: (To Alan) I want to move\n\nAlan: Why did you get detention?\n\nCory: You know, you\u2019re missing the bigger issue, Dad. You bought a house next to my teacher. I want to move. I want to move now. (Moves towards door) Get the guy with the gold jacket. I\u2019ll be in the car\n\nAlan: Why did you get detention? (Cory stops, walks back)\n\nAmy: Apparently, he\u2019d rather listen to the baseball game on the radio than try to understand the emotional content of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nCory: Mom, I\u2019m a kid! I don\u2019t understand the emotional content of Full House!\n\nMorgan: (Raises hand) I do!\n\n(Eric enters from upstairs)\n\nCory: Besides, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re dumping on me. I\u2019m not the one who sold out my only brother for some girl\n\nAmy: (Excitedly) Eric, she said yes! (Runs over to him, hugs him)\n\nEric: Yep\n\nAmy: Congratulations\n\nCory: You were in on this?\n\nEric: Oh, come on, Cory, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re making a big deal about this game?\n\nCory: (Walks past them) I don\u2019t care about the game. I don\u2019t care about the tickets. I wouldn\u2019t take them if you offered them to me\n\nEric: Alright, look. (Walks over) I\u2019ll just take Heather somewhere else. Here, you want the tickets? (holds them out)\n\nCory: Yes! (Grabs at tickets, but Eric snatches them away)\n\nEric: Get real! (Exits into kitchen)\n\nCory: Dad!\n\nAlan: Cory, he paid for those tickets with his own money, he can take whoever he likes\n\nCory: But I earned those tickets. I slept with him for eleven years!\n\nAlan: Look, pal, when you\u2019re older you\u2019ll understand how your brother feels because girls will be important to you, too\n\nCory: (Defeated) Fine. My brother betrays me, my parents take his side\u2014fine. I don\u2019t have a friend in this house. (Walks past Morgan)\n\nMorgan: Do you want me and Debbie to go to the baseball game with you?\n\nCory: (Mockingly) Hey, go to the game with my sister and her doll. Great! Maybe during the 7th inning stretch I could run through the stadium in my old Spider-Man underwear\n\nMorgan: Well, you don\u2019t have to dress up for me\n\n[SCENE \u2013 School cafeteria. Cory, Shawn, and Nicolas are looking at their disgusting lunch food. After prodding his meat-type product, Shawn looks up to his friends]\n\nShawn: Well, mine\u2019s got fuzz\n\nCory: (Poking his) Mine\u2019s got lips\n\n(Nicolas takes his lunch from his brown paper bag and then puts the bag aside)\n\nShawn: Hey, bag man. Rough life being an only child, huh?\n\nCory: (Looking at Nicolas) Yeah. Rougher life being an orphan, which is what I am as of last night\n\nNicolas: What happened?\n\nCory: I dumped my family and my family dumped me. It was mutual. They\u2019re keeping the house\n\nShawn: Well, we\u2019re here for you, Cory\n\nCory: Thanks. You\u2019re my new brothers. (Pats Shawn\u2019s and Nicolas\u2019s arms) Hey, how about we go to the game Friday night?\n\nNicolas: I thought the game was sold out\n\nCory: It is, so we go down early. There\u2019s always guys with extra tickets\n\nShawn: Don\u2019t you have detention Friday?\n\nCory: Uh, don\u2019t worry about detention. I can handle Feeny. Feeny loves me\n\nShawn: Feeny hates you\n\nCory: Well, it\u2019s one of the two. We\u2019ll see who\u2019s right. (Walks over to the table where Feeny is sitting alone) Mr. Feeny, may I sit down?\n\nFeeny: (Reading a book) I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t\n\nCory: (Calling back to his friends) Hates me. (Sits)\n\nFeeny: (Sternly) Mr. Matthews, I spend 35 to 40 hours a week dealing with the perceived problems of whiny little people like yourself. Now, this is my lunch period, my respite from the fray. I spend four hours with you every morning and three hours with you every afternoon. Now for God\u2019s sake, get out of my face. (Cory looks terrified) (Calling to a colleague) Evelyn!\n\nEvelyn: (Walks over and salutes) George\n\nFeeny: (Stands, pulls out a chair) I saved a place for you\n\nEvelyn: (Sits down with lunch tray) Oh, aren\u2019t you sweet? (Sighs, takes off glasses) (Looking at Cory) And who is this young man?\n\nCory: Uh, my name\u2019s Cory Matthews. Mr. Feeny\u2019s my teacher. He hates me\n\nEvelyn: Now Cory, I\u2019m sure that Mr. Feeny doesn\u2019t hate you\n\n(Feeny sits, he and Cory exchange sarcastic smiles)\n\n[SCENE \u2013 Cory\u2019s backyard, where a tree house sits in a tree. Amy walks through the yard with a brown paper bag, takes a step up the ladder on the tree, and leans into the tree house, pushing the curtain aside. Cory is inside the tree house.]\n\nAmy: (Holding up bag) Oh, good. Caught you home. Housewarming gift. (Holds out bag, Cory takes it) Chocolate pie with a side of barbequed chicken and corn on the cob. Now, I would\u2019ve bought you a plant, but, hey, you\u2019re in a tree\n\nCory: Thanks, mom\n\nAmy: Are you all right?\n\nCory: Of course I\u2019m all right. I\u2019ve been in this tree house a million times\n\nAmy: Never after dark\u2026 (Laughing maniacally) (Exits)\n\n(Cory opens his bag and looks through it)\n\nMorgan: (Calling from the foot of the ladder) Cory!\n\nCory: (To self) I gotta build a moat around this place. (Leans out the door to talk to Morgan)\n\nMorgan: Do you want Debbie to keep you company?\n\nCory: Why would I want your doll to keep me company?\n\nMorgan: In case you get scared\n\nCory: Morgan, I\u2019m eleven years old. I don\u2019t get scared. And even if I did get scared and had to defend myself, my weapon of choice would not be a chick with a plastic head\n\nMorgan: Well you don\u2019t have to get so snippy. (Exits)\n\nCory: (Looks up and can see right into Feeny\u2019s dining room. He sees Feeny setting a very fancy meal for two people, putting out a salad) Hey, America\u2019s funniest home teacher. (Feeny sets out flowers. Feeny\u2019s phone rings and he picks it up. After a brief phone conversation, and a shot of Cory looking interesting, Feeny looks dejected, hangs up the phone, and begins to clear one of the place settings. Feeny then sits, all by himself, and serves himself some salad, as Cory looks on while taking a bite of his large chicken leg.)\n\n[SCENE \u2013 Cory and Eric\u2019s room. Cory enters, looks around to see if the coast is clear. It is, so he goes towards his drawer and begins sifting through his sock drawer. Amy enters from the bathroom carrying a bunch of laundry. Quietly, she drops the laundry, picks up a toy gun, and points it to Cory\u2019s back.]\n\nAmy: Okay, mister, drop my son\u2019s underwear\n\nCory: (Holding his hands out sideways) Mom, it\u2019s me\n\nAmy: How do I know it\u2019s you?\n\nCory: Who else would want my underwear?\n\nAmy: (Withdraws the gun) Good point. (Puts in on the bed)\n\nCory: Now, don\u2019t get your hopes up. I\u2019m not moving back in or anything\n\nAmy: Oh, hey, I\u2019m just here straightening up the room for the boy we rented it out to\n\nCory: Well, I hope he\u2019s got better luck with brothers than I did\n\nAmy: (Motherly, strokes Cory\u2019s hair) You still feeling a little abandoned, Cor?\n\nCory: Yeah, well, life goes on\n\nAmy: Yeah, that\u2019s what your dad said when it happened to him\n\nCory: Why? Who abandoned Dad?\n\nAmy: You did\n\nCory: I never did anything like this to Dad\n\nAmy: (Folding laundry) Oh, when you were little you couldn\u2019t wait for your dad to get home from work so you could throw the football around with him. I\u2019ll tell you something, he looked forward to it as much as you did\n\nCory: So how come we don\u2019t do that so much anymore?\n\nAmy: Well\u2026 (Pats bed, she and Cory sit) You got a little older, and you had a bunch of friends, and you were more interested in throwing the football around with them\n\nCory: Wait a minute, it sounds like you\u2019re saying I\u2019m the bad guy\n\nAmy: No, honey, there\u2019s no bad guy. All I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s natural that people grow up and priorities change. Okay? (Stands to attend to laundry)\n\nCory: Mom?\n\nAmy: Hmm?\n\nCory: (Nodding) You were always very cordial to me when I lived here\n\nAmy: Thank you, Cory, and I give you my word that the new boy will never replace you in our hearts. (Smiles, touches Cory\u2019s cheek, exits with laundry)\n\n[SCENE \u2013 Feeny\u2019s classroom at four \u2018o\u2019clock. The room is empty except for Feeny grading papers at his desk and Cory sitting silently, in his Phillies jersey, at the nearest desk. Cory is tapping his hands, bored.]\n\nCory: (Sighs) You\u2019re not gonna talk to me at all, are you, Mr. Feeny? (Feeny ignores him) Because I\u2019ve been sitting in this seat for 38 minutes and I\u2019ve been very good and I think you should let me go. (Feeny, wordless, staples some papers together a bit violently) Look, and eleven-year-old boy cannot sit still this long. I\u2019m gonna get up. (Cautiously, Cory stands) I\u2019m up. (Feeny says nothing, not even looking up) I\u2019m dancing. (Cory does a little dance around his desk in front of Mr. Feeny) (Grinning) I\u2019m leaving. (Walks backwards to the door, puts his hand on the knob) My hand is on the knob. (Opens door) The door is open. (Steps out, shuts door) Fine. (From behind the closed door) I\u2019m in the hall! (Feeny staples another paper) (Agitated, Cory reenters) Mr. Feeny, this stinks! (Points, wanders back towards his desk)\n\nFeeny: It\u2019s supposed to stink, Mr. Matthews. It\u2019s detention. You\u2019re being detained from whatever it is you\u2019d rather be doing\n\nCory: (At desk) Well, I think it\u2019s a cruel and unusual life-sucking torture\n\nFeeny: (Nodding) You\u2019ve captured the essence\n\nCory: Why do we have to stay here? Just because I don\u2019t want to hear about this love stuff? Because I know it only leads to no good, and I know in your heart you agree with me\n\nFeeny: (Writing on a paper, vaguely interested) What brings you that conclusion, Mr. Matthews?\n\nCory: \u2018Cause you and I had dinner together last night\n\nFeeny: Really? I wasn\u2019t aware\n\nCory: I had chocolate pie and you had salad for two all by yourself\n\nFeeny: (Looks up) How did you know that?\n\nCory: \u2018Cause I slept in my tree house last night. You know why? \u2018Cause this love stuff has turned my whole family against me. And you\u2019re teaching us how it\u2019s worth killing yourself for when I know you don\u2019t really believe that, do you?\n\nFeeny: (Smacks down his red pen) Well\u2026 You shrewd little observer of the human condition. (Stands, imposingly) How blissful it must be for you to have lived so little and yet already reached your conclusions about the greatest wonder of the universe\n\nCory: (Stutters) Y-you know what, Mr. Feeny? Keep the radio\n\nFeeny: (Paces from behind his desk) Shakespeare wrote plays and sonnets. The Greeks wrote tragedies and comedies. Robert Burns, Emily Dickinson, the Brownings examined the depths of human emotions. (Leans on his desk directly in front of Cory) And do you know what each one of these poets, playwrights, and philosophers had in common, Mr. Matthews?\n\nCory: (Unsure) They all took your class?\n\nFeeny: Every one of them was older than eleven. (Stands, paces around some more) You come into my classroom at the beginning of the year, and at the end, you go. And I really don\u2019t know if, in the time we spent together, I have taught you anything! Well, this afternoon, Mr. Matthews, you are going to learn something from me! (Points) (Dead serious) Do I have your attention?\n\nCory: Yes, sir\n\nFeeny: (Paces back in front of Cory, scratching his head, then sits on the desk next to him) I live on the other side of the fence from you, Cory. And it\u2019s impossible not to face in your direction every once in a while and notice the people in the next yard. And through the years, I\u2019ve got to know them. It is apparent that they are fine individuals, but (pause) their real strength (pause) comes from being a family. And do you know why they\u2019re a family, Cory? Because, at one time, a man and a woman realized that they loved each other and pursued the unlimited potential of what may come from that love. (Gestures to Cory with open arms) And here you are. (Stands) There is no greater aspiration than to have love in our lives, Mr. Matthews. Romeo knew it and died for it. Others know it, and prepare salads. And those who don\u2019t know it will sit in detention for the rest of their lives. (Cory looks petrified) (Feeny circles back to behind his desk) This particular detention is over. (Cory is frozen)\n\n[SCENE \u2013 Matthews\u2019 living room. Cory, still adorned in his Phillies jersey, enters from the backyard carrying a bag. He looks around and shuts the door gently, and though he\u2019s sneaking in. He smiles, then runs to the staircase, where he sees Morgan sitting at her nearby play table having a tea party.]\n\nMorgan: Do you want to have tea with me?\n\nCory: No, Morgan, I don\u2019t want anybody to know I\u2019m here, okay?\n\nMorgan: Oh, okay. You\u2019re moving back in?\n\nCory: Yeah, don\u2019t tell anybody\n\nMorgan: Oh, okay. (Yelling) Cory\u2019s back!\n\nCory: No!! Shhh!! (Backpedals into Alan) (To Alan) Hi, honey, I\u2019m home\n\nAlan: (Playing along) Well, it\u2019s about time. Dinner\u2019s on the table and the kids have been animals. (Morgan laughs)\n\nCory: (To Alan) I know that you and Mom will lose out on all that rental income, but I want my old room back\n\nAlan: Well, that comes at quite an economic blow, but we\u2019ll try to get by\n\nCory: Dad, I\u2019m sorry I dumped you for my friends\n\nAlan: When did you do that?\n\nCory: You know, all the time\n\nAlan: Well, Cory, I\u2019m glad that you have friends. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back. (Hugs him)\n\nCory & Alan: (While hugging) (Cory is serious, Alan is mocking, simultaneous nonetheless) No, don\u2019t hug me!\n\n[SCENE \u2013 Cory is in his rooms playing video games with his toy gun pointed at the screen.]\n\nCory: Die! (Shoots the screen) Die! (Shoots it again) Die! (Shoots it again) (Eric enters) Die! (Shoots the screen) Die! (Shoots at Eric) Die! (Shoots the screen again)\n\nEric: (Pointing to the screen) You missed the puppy-looking thing in the corner\n\nCory: Die! (Shoots it, emitting an odd dying animal sound)\n\nEric: There\u2019s one we don\u2019t have to neuter. (Takes off jacket)\n\nCory: (Puts down the gun) Five to three. The Phillies are in the playoffs\n\nEric: Yeah, I heard\n\nCory: What do you mean you heard? You were there\n\nEric: I really wasn\u2019t paying that much attention to the game, Cory\n\nCory: Why not? It was a great game\n\nEric: It was not, however, a great date\n\nCory: You had a bad date?\n\nEric: No, I had a great date. (Grabs a crate, sits on it) Heather was beautiful. She knew what to say, she knew what to do. Unfortunately, her date spilled food, tripped over chairs, and had nothing interesting to say for nine innings\n\nCory: Eric, you\u2019re much too cool for some girl\n\nEric: News flash: I\u2019m not cool! (Stands) You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\n\nCory: Okay, you\u2019re not cool. And now you know better than to go to a game without your brother\n\nEric: (Sitting at desk) You\u2019re right\n\nCory: I am?\n\nEric: Yeah, that\u2019s my first and last date with Heather. I never want to see her again\n\nCory: Good. (Picks up gun and begins shooting the screen. Stops, looks to Eric) You don\u2019t mean that\n\nEric: (Lying) Yes, I do\n\nCory: (Hands Eric the phone) Here\n\nEric: What\u2019s this?\n\nCory: Call her\n\nEric: Who?\n\nCory: (Mimicking) \u201cWho?\u201d Heather! My nemesis! Call her!\n\nEric: Why?\n\nCory: \u2018Cause you\u2019re sitting there, drooling and pathetic, and I know somewhere inside\u2019s my cool brother. And I\u2019m not gonna get him back unless you call her\n\nEric: Look. (Puts down phone) I\u2019m not calling her. I sat there all night and didn\u2019t say anything. What could I say now?\n\nCory: (Hands him the phone) Take her to a movie. There, you\u2019re supposed to sit and not say anything. A movie\u2019s perfect for your current skill level. (Walks to the door)\n\nEric: Why do you want me to call her?\n\nCory: I\u2019m told love is worth it. (Shrugs, exits)\n\n[Cut to the living room. Morgan is at her tea table. Cory enters from upstairs. Morgan looks up to Cory, then goes back to her imaginary tea]\n\nCory: Aren\u2019t you going to invite me to have tea with you? (Morgan picks up a doll from the chair and throws it on the floor. Then, she gestures towards the chair, offering it to Cory. Cory sits) Morgan, I want you to know something. No matter how old I get, I\u2019m always gonna be your big brother\n\nMorgan: Sugar? (Pantomimes pouring)\n\nCory: And even if I ever \u2013 which I won\u2019t \u2013 get interested in girls\u2026\n\nMorgan: Milk? (Pantomimes pouring)\n\nCory: \u2026and it seems like I don\u2019t care about you anymore\u2026\n\nMorgan: Ketchup? (Pantomimes squirting)\n\nCory: \u2026I still always want you to invite me to have tea with you\n\nAmy: (Enters) Morgan, honey, put your tea set away and brush your teeth. It\u2019s time to go to bed\n\nMorgan: (Stands, tugs on Cory\u2019s shirt) Do I have to?\n\nCory: You\u2019re asking me? (Morgan nods) (To Amy) How about if we just stay up and finish our tea?\n\nAmy: You volunteering to put your sister to bed?\n\nCory: (Shrugs) Yeah, I guess I am\n\nAmy: Why?\n\nCory: (Nodding) \u2018Cause I don\u2019t understand anything about my entire life. (Amy exits, Morgan give Cory a kiss on the cheek) (Insincerely) Yeah, thanks\u2026\n\n[TAG \u2013 Lunchroom. Cory, Nicolas, and Shawn are once again watching Feeny and Evelyn.]\n\nNicolas: Two days in a row\n\nShawn: She just doesn\u2019t learn\n\n[Cut to Feeny\u2019s table with Evelyn]\n\nFeeny: Evelyn, I hope I\u2019m not being too forward, but instead of cafeteria lunch, maybe one evening we could have dinner together?\n\nEvelyn: Of course, George. I\u2019d love it\n\nFeeny: Good. (Cory looks confused) (He and Evelyn get up and begin walking) I\u2019m quite the cook, you know\n\nEvelyn: Really?\n\nFeeny: Oh, yes. Just the other night, I prepared a lovely salad nicoise for my sister, but she had to cancel at the last moment. (Stops at Cory, Evelyn proceeds onward) Confused, Mr. Matthews?\n\nCory: (Nods) Yes I am, sir\n\nFeeny: As it should be.

II (Chap. 9.1) LyricsEulogy On Henry Clay,\n\nDelivered In The State House At Springfield, Illinois, July 16, 1852\n\nOn the fourth day of July, 1776, the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of Great Britain, inhabiting a portion of the Atlantic coast of North America, publicly declared their national independence, and made their appeal to the justice of their cause and to the God of battles for the maintenance of that declaration. That people were few in number and without resources, save only their wise heads and stout hearts. Within the first year of that declared independence, and while its maintenance was yet problematical, while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels and their haughty would-be masters was still waging,\u2014of undistinguished parents and in an obscure district of one of those colonies Henry Clay was born. The infant nation and the infant child began the race of life together. For three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in hand. They have been companions ever. The nation has passed its perils, and it is free, prosperous, and powerful. The child has reached his manhood, his middle age, his old age, and is dead. In all that has concerned the nation the man ever sympathized; and now the nation mourns the man.\n\nThe day after his death one of the public journals, opposed to him politically, held the following pathetic and beautiful language, which I adopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy, originating with a political friend, might offend good taste, but chiefly because I could not in any language of my own so well express my thoughts:\n\n\"Alas, who can realize that Henry Clay is dead! Who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the council-chambers of his country to beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten, or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around! Who can realize that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased, that the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilled, that the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no more, and the magic of that eloquent tongue, which spake as spake no other tongue besides, is hushed hushed for ever! Who can realize that freedom's champion, the champion of a civilized world and of all tongues and kindreds of people, has indeed fallen! Alas, in those dark hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced, and which she may be called to experience again, to whom now may her people look up for that counsel and advice which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give, and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation will receive? Perchance in the whole circle of the great and gifted of our land there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman may fall; one who while we now write is doubtless pouring his tears over the bier of his brother and friend brother, friend, ever, yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make them. Ah, it is at times like these that the petty distinctions of mere party disappear. We see only the great, the grand, the noble features of the departed statesman; and we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political adherents\u2014we do [not] beg this permission, we claim it as a right, though we feel it as a privilege. Henry Clay belonged to his country\u2014to the world; mere party cannot claim men like him. His career has been national, his fame has filled the earth, his memory will endure to the last syllable of recorded time.\n\n\"Henry Clay is dead! He breathed his last on yesterday, at twenty minutes after eleven, in his chamber at Washington. To those who followed his lead in public affairs, it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy and pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead. But all Americans may show the grief which his death inspires, for his character and fame are national property. As on a question of liberty he knew no North, no South, no East, no West, but only the Union which held them all in its sacred circle, so now his countrymen will know no grief that is not as wide-spread as the bounds of the confederacy. The career of Henry Clay was a public career. From his youth he has been devoted to the public service, at a period, too, in the world's history justly regarded as a remarkable era in human affairs. He witnessed in the beginning the throes of the French Revolution. He saw the rise and fall of Napoleon. He was called upon to legislate for America and direct her policy when all Europe was the battlefield of contending dynasties, and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations. His voice spoke war and peace in the contest with Great Britain.\n\"When Greece rose against the Turks and struck for liberty, his name was mingled with the battle-cry of freedom. When South America threw off the thraldom of Spain, his speeches were read at the head of her armies by Bolivar. His name has been, and will continue to be, hallowed in two hemispheres, for it is\n\n\"'One of the few, the immortal names\nThat were not born to die!'\n\n\"To the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added a quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth. His eloquence has not been surpassed. In the effective power to move the heart of man, Clay was without an equal, and the heaven-born endowment, in the spirit of its origin, has been most conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud. On at least three important occasions he has quelled our civil commotions by a power and influence which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times. And in our last internal discord, when this Union trembled to its centre, in old age he left the shades of private life, and gave the death-blow to fraternal strife, with the vigor of his earlier years, in a series of senatorial efforts which in themselves would bring immortality by challenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age. He exorcised the demon which possessed the body politic, and gave peace to a distracted land. Alas! the achievement cost him his life. He sank day by day to the tomb his pale but noble brow bound with a triple wreath, put there by a grateful country. May his ashes rest in peace, while his spirit goes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him.\"\n\nWhile it is customary and proper upon occasions like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased, in the case of Mr. Clay it is less necessary than most others; for his biography has been written and rewritten and read and reread for the last twenty-five years; so that, with the exception of a few of the latest incidents of his life, all is as well known as it can be. The short sketch which I give is, therefore, merely to maintain the connection of this discourse.\n\nHenry Clay was born on the twelfth day of April, 1777, in Hanover County, Virginia. Of his father, who died in the fourth or fifth year of Henry's age, little seems to be known, except that he was a respectable man and a preacher of the Baptist persuasion. Mr. Clay's education to the end of life was comparatively limited. I say \"to the end of life,\" because I have understood that from time to time he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life. Mr. Clay's lack of a more perfect early education, however it may be regretted generally, teaches at least one profitable lesson: it teaches that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that, if he will, he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably. In his twenty-third year Mr. Clay was licensed to practise law, and emigrated to Lexington, Kentucky. Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803, when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature. By successive elections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of 1806, when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the United States Senate. In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and by that body chosen Speaker. In 1808 he was re-elected to the same body. In 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy of two years in the United States Senate. In 1811 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, and on the first day of taking his seat in that body he was chosen its Speaker. In 1813 he was again elected Speaker. Early in 1814, being the period of our last British war, Mr. Clay was sent as commissioner, with others, to negotiate a treaty of peace, which treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year. On his return from Europe he was again elected to the lower branch of Congress, and on taking his seat in December, 1815, was called to his old post-the Speaker's chair, a position in which he was retained by successive elections, with one brief intermission, till the inauguration of John Quincy Adams, in March, 1825. He was then appointed Secretary of State, and occupied that important station till the inauguration of General Jackson, in March, 1829. After this he returned to Kentucky, resumed the practice of law, and continued it till the autumn of 1831, when he was by the Legislature of Kentucky again placed in the United States Senate. By a reelection he was continued in the Senate till he resigned his seat and retired, in March, 1848. In December, 1849, he again took his seat in the Senate, which he again resigned only a few months before his death.\n\nBy the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of Mr. Clay's official life in 1803 to the end of 1852 is but one year short of half a century, and that the sum of all the intervals in it will not amount to ten years. But mere duration of time in office constitutes the smallest part of Mr. Clay's history. Throughout that long period he has constantly been the most loved and most implicitly followed by friends, and the most dreaded by opponents, of all living American politicians. In all the great questions which have agitated the country, and particularly in those fearful crises, the Missouri question, the nullification question, and the late slavery question, as connected with the newly acquired territory, involving and endangering the stability of the Union, his has been the leading and most conspicuous part. In 1824 he was first a candidate for the Presidency, and was defeated; and, although he was successively defeated for the same office in 1832 and in 1844, there has never been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of the American people did not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevating him to the Presidency. With other men, to be defeated was to be forgotten; but with him defeat was but a trifling incident, neither changing him nor the world's estimate of him. Even those of both political parties who have been preferred to him for the highest office have run far briefer courses than he, and left him still shining high in the heavens of the political world. Jackson, Van Buren, Harnson, Polk, and Taylor all rose after, and set long before him. The spell\u2014the long-enduring spell\u2014with which the souls of men were bound to him is a miracle. Who can compass it? It is probably true he owed his pre-eminence to no one quality, but to a fortunate combination of several. He was surpassingly eloquent; but many eloquent men fail utterly, and they are not, as a class, generally successful. His judgment was excellent; but many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed. His will was indomitable; but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better than a character for useless obstinacy. These, then, were Mr. Clay's leading qualities. No one of them is very uncommon; but all together are rarely combined in a single individual, and this is probably the reason why such men as Henry Clay are so rare in the world.\n\nMr. Clay's eloquence did not consist, as many fine specimens of eloquence do, of types and figures, of antithesis and elegant arrangement of words and sentences, but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity, and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause. This it is that truly touches the chords of sympathy; and those who heard Mr. Clay never failed to be moved by it, or ever afterward forgot the impression. All his efforts were made for practical effect. He never spoke merely to be heard. He never delivered a Fourth of July oration, or a eulogy on an occasion like this. As a politician or statesman, no one was so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground. Whatever he did he did for the whole country. In the construction of his measures, he ever carefully surveyed every part of the field, and duly weighed every conflicting interest. Feeling as he did, and as the truth surely is, that the world's best hope depended on the continued union of these States, he was ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slightest tendency to separate them.\n\nMr. Clay's predominant sentiment, from first to last, was a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty\u2014a strong sympathy with the oppressed everywhere, and an ardent wish for their elevation. With him this was a primary and all-controlling passion. Subsidiary to this was the conduct of his whole life. He loved his country partly because it was his own country, and mostly because it was a free country; and he burned with a zeal for its advancement, prosperity, and glory, because he saw in such the advancement, prosperity, and glory of human liberty, human right, and human nature. He desired the prosperity of his countrymen, partly because they were his countrymen, but chiefly to show to the world that free men could be prosperous.\n\nThat his views and measures were always the wisest needs not to be affirmed; nor should it be on this occasion, where so many thinking differently join in doing honor to his memory. A free people in times of peace and quiet when pressed by no common danger-naturally divide into parties. At such times the man who is of neither party is not, cannot be, of any consequence. Mr. Clay therefore was of a party. Taking a prominent part, as he did, in all the great political questions of his country for the last half century, the wisdom of his course on many is doubted and denied by a large portion of his countrymen; and of such it is not now proper to speak particularly. But there are many others, about his course upon which there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic Americans. Of these last are the War of 1812, the Missouri question, nullification, and the now recent compromise measures. In 1812 Mr. Clay, though not unknown, was still a young man. Whether we should go to war with Great Britain being the question of the day, a minority opposed the declaration of war by Congress, while the majority, though apparently inclined to war, had for years wavered, and hesitated to act decisively. Meanwhile British aggressions multiplied, and grew more daring and aggravated. By Mr. Clay more than any other man the struggle was brought to a decision in Congress. The question, being now fully before Congress, came up in a variety of ways in rapid succession, on most of which occasions Mr. Clay spoke. Adding to all the logic of which the subject was susceptible that noble inspiration which came to him as it came to no other, he aroused and nerved and inspired his friends, and confounded and bore down all opposition. Several of his speeches on these occasions were reported and are still extant, but the best of them all never was. During its delivery the reporters forgot their vocation, dropped their pens, and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the close. The speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men, and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely astonishing. The precise language of this speech we shall never know; but we do know we cannot help knowing\u2014that with deep pathos it pleaded the cause of the injured sailor, that it invoked the genius of the Revolution, that it apostrophized the names of Otis, of Henry, and of Washington, that it appealed to the interests, the pride, the honor, and the glory of the nation, that it shamed and taunted the timidity of friends, that it scorned and scouted and withered the temerity of domestic foes, that it bearded and defied the British lion, and, rising and swelling and maddening in its course, it sounded the onset, till the charge, the shock, the steady struggle, and the glorious victory all passed in vivid review before the entranced hearers.\n\nImportant and exciting as was the war question of 1812, it never so alarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the Republic as afterward did the Missouri question. This sprang from that unfortunate source of discord\u2014negro slavery. When our Federal Constitution was adopted, we owned no territory beyond the limits or ownership of the States, except the territory northwest of the River Ohio and east of the Mississippi. What has since been formed into the States of Maine, Kentucky and Tennessee, was, I believe, within the limits of or owned by Massachusetts, Virginia, and North Carolina. As to the Northwestern Territory, provision had been made even before the adoption of the Constitution that slavery should never go there. On the admission of States into the Union, carved from the territory we owned before the Constitution, no question, or at most no considerable question, arose about slavery\u2014those which were within the limits of or owned by the old States following respectively the condition of the parent State, and those within the Northwest Territory following the previously made provision. But in 1803 we purchased Louisiana of the French, and it included with much more what has since been formed into the State of Missouri. With regard to it, nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery. When, therefore, in 1819, Missouri, having formed a State constitution without excluding slavery, and with slavery already actually existing within its limits, knocked at the door of the Union for admission, almost the entire representation of the non-slaveholding States objected. A fearful and angry struggle instantly followed. This alarmed thinking men more than any previous question, because, unlike all the former, it divided the country by geographical lines. Other questions had their opposing partisans in all localities of the country and in almost every family, so that no division of the Union could follow such without a separation of friends to quite as great an extent as that of opponents. Not so with the Missouri question. On this a geographical line could be traced, which in the main would separate opponents only. This was the danger. Mr. Jefferson, then in retirement, wrote:\n\n\"I had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to pay any attention to public affairs, confident they were in good hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which I am not distant. But this momentous question, like a firebell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. It is hushed, indeed, for the moment. But this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence. A geographical line coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated, and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper. I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any practicable way.\n\n\"The cession of that kind of property\u2014for it is so misnamed\u2014is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected, and gradually and with due sacrifices I think it might be. But as it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other.\"\n\nMr. Clay was in Congress, and, perceiving the danger, at once engaged his whole energies to avert it. It began, as I have said, in 1819; and it did not terminate till 1821. Missouri would not yield the point; and Congress that is, a majority in Congress\u2014by repeated votes showed a determination not to admit the State unless it should yield. After several failures, and great labor on the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission, it was by a vote rejected, and, as all seemed to think, finally. A sullen gloom hung over the nation. All felt that the rejection of Missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the Union, because those States which already had what Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish would go with Missouri. All deprecated and deplored this, but none saw how to avert it. For the judgment of members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty; each had a constituency to meet and to answer to. Mr. Clay, though worn down and exhausted, was appealed to by members to renew his efforts at compromise. He did so, and by some judicious modifications of his plan, coupled with laborious efforts with individual members and his own overmastering eloquence upon that floor, he finally secured the admission of the State. Brightly and captivating as it had previously shown, it was now perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment, or at most but a helping hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril.\nAfter the settlement of the Missouri question, although a portion of the American people have differed with Mr. Clay, and a majority even appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration, he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as the man for the crisis. Accordingly, in the days of nullification, and more recently in the reappearance of the slavery question connected with our territory newly acquired of Mexico, the task of devising a mode of adjustment seems to have been cast upon Mr. Clay by common consent\u2014and his performance of the task in each case was little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation.\n\nMr. Clay's efforts in behalf of the South Americans, and afterward in behalf of the Greeks, in the times of their respective struggles for civil liberty, are among the finest on record, upon the noblest of all themes, and bear ample corroboration of what I have said was his ruling passion\u2014a love of liberty and right, unselfishly, and for their own sakes.\n\nHaving been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already, I am unwilling to close without referring more particularly to Mr. Clay's views and conduct in regard to it. He ever was on principle and in feeling opposed to slavery. The very earliest, and one of the latest, public efforts of his life, separated by a period of more than fifty years, were both made in favor of gradual emancipation. He did not perceive that on a question of human right the negroes were to be excepted from the human race. And yet Mr. Clay was the owner of slaves. Cast into life when slavery was already widely spread and deeply seated, he did not perceive, as I think no wise man has perceived, how it could be at once eradicated without producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty itself. His feeling and his judgment, therefore, ever led him to oppose both extremes of opinion on the subject. Those who would shiver into fragments the Union of these States, tear to tatters its now venerated Constitution, and even burn the last copy of the Bible, rather than slavery should continue a single hour, together with all their more halting sympathizers, have received, and are receiving, their just execration; and the name and opinions and influence of Mr. Clay are fully and, as I trust, effectually and enduringly arrayed against them. But I would also, if I could, array his name, opinions, and influence against the opposite extreme\u2014against a few but an increasing number of men who, for the sake of perpetuating slavery, are beginning to assail and to ridicule the white man's charter of freedom, the declaration that \"all men are created free and equal.\" So far as I have learned, the first American of any note to do or attempt this was the late John C. Calhoun; and if I mistake not, it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the Governor of South Carolina. We, however, look for and are not much shocked by political eccentricities and heresies in South Carolina. But only last year I saw with astonishment what purported to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of Virginia, copied, with apparent approbation, into a St. Louis newspaper, containing the following to me very unsatisfactory language:\n\"I am fully aware that there is a text in some Bibles that is not in mine. Professional abolitionists have made more use of it than of any passage in the Bible. It came, however, as I trace it, from Saint Voltaire, and was baptized by Thomas Jefferson, and since almost universally regarded as canonical authority`All men are born free and equal.'\n\n\"This is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation. I am sorry to say that I have never seen two men of whom it is true. But I must admit I never saw the Siamese Twins, and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism.\"\n\nThis sounds strangely in republican America. The like was not heard in the fresher days of the republic. Let us contrast with it the language of that truly national man whose life and death we now commemorate and lament: I quote from a speech of Mr. Clay delivered before the American Colonization Society in 1827:\n\n\"We are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question. The society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquillity. It addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience. It seeks to affect no man's property. It neither has the power nor the will to affect the property of any one contrary to his consent. The execution of its scheme would augment instead of diminishing the value of property left behind. The society, composed of free men, conceals itself only with the free. Collateral consequences we are not responsible for. It is not this society which has produced the great moral revolution which the age exhibits. What would they who thus reproach us have done? If they would repress all tendencies toward liberty and ultimate emancipation, they must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of this society. They must go back to the era of our liberty and independence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return. They must renew the slave trade, with all its train of atrocities. They must suppress the workings of British philanthropy, seeking to meliorate the condition of the unfortunate West Indian slave. They must arrest the career of South American deliverance from thraldom. They must blow out the moral lights around us and extinguish that greatest torch of all which America presents to a benighted world\u2014pointing the way to their rights, their liberties, and their happiness. And when they have achieved all those purposes their work will be yet incomplete. They must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty. Then, and not till then, when universal darkness and despair prevail, can you perpetuate slavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent efforts among free men in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race doomed to bondage.\"\n\nThe American Colonization Society was organized in 1816. Mr. Clay, though not its projector, was one of its earliest members; and he died, as for many preceding years he had been, its president. It was one of the most cherished objects of his direct care and consideration, and the association of his name with it has probably been its very greatest collateral support. He considered it no demerit in the society that it tended to relieve the slave-holders from the troublesome presence of the free negroes; but this was far from being its whole merit in his estimation. In the same speech from which we have quoted he says:\n\n\"There is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her children, whose ancestors have been torn from her by the ruthless hand of fraud and violence. Transplanted in a foreign land, they will carry back to their native soil the rich fruits of religion, civilization, law, and liberty. May it not be one of the great designs of the Ruler of the universe, whose ways are often inscrutable by short-sighted mortals, thus to transform an original crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe?\"\n\nThis suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the African race and African continent was made twenty-five years ago. Every succeeding year has added strength to the hope of its realization. May it indeed be realized. Pharaoh's country was cursed with plagues, and his hosts were lost in the Red Sea, for striving to retain a captive people who had already served them more than four hundred years. May like disasters never befall us! If, as the friends of colonization hope, the present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery, and at the same time in restoring a captive people to their long-lost fatherland with bright prospects for the future, and this too so gradually that neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change, it will indeed be a glorious consummation. And if to such a consummation the efforts of Mr. Clay shall have contributed, it will be what he most ardently wished, and none of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his kind.\n\nBut Henry Clay is dead. His long and eventful life is closed. Our country is prosperous and powerful; but could it have been quite all it has been, and is, and is to be, without Henry Clay? Such a man the times have demanded, and such in the providence of God was given us. But he is gone. Let us strive to deserve, as far as mortals may, the continued care of Divine Providence, trusting that in future national emergencies He will not fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security.\n\nNOTE.

"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Angela-carter"}, "artist": "Angela Carter", "lyrics": "The Bloody Chamber LyricsI remember how, that night, I lay awake in the wagon-lit in a tender, delicious ecstasy of excitement, my burning cheek pressed against the impeccable linen of the pillow and the pounding of my heart mimicking that of the great pistons ceaselessly thrusting the train that bore me through the night, away from Paris, away from girlhood, away from the white, enclosed quietude of my mother's apartment, into the unguessable country of marriage.\n\nAnd I remember I tenderly imagined how, at this very moment, my mother would be moving slowly about the narrow bedroom I had left behind for ever, folding up and putting away all my little relics, the tumbled garments I would not need any more, the scores for which there had been no room in my trunks, the concert programmes I'd abandoned; she would linger over this torn ribbon and that faded photograph with all the half-joyous, half-sorrowful emotions of a woman on her daughter's wedding day. And, in the midst of my bridal triumph, I felt a pang of loss as if, when he put the gold band on my finger, I had, in some way, ceased to be her child in becoming his wife.\n\nAre you sure, she'd said when they delivered the gigantic box that held the wedding dress he'd bought me, wrapped up in tissue paper and red ribbon like a Christmas gift of crystallized fruit. Are you sure you love him? There was a dress for her, too; black silk, with the dull, prismatic sheen of oil on water, finer than anything she'd worn since that adventurous girlhood in Indo-China, daughter of a rich tea planter. My eagle-featured, indomitable mother; what other student at the Conservatoire could boast that her mother had outfaced a junkful of Chinese pirates, nursed a village through a visitation of the plague, shot a man-eating tiger with her own hand and all before she was as old as I?\n\n'Are you sure you love him?'\n\n'I'm sure I want to marry him,' I said.\n\nAnd would say no more. She sighed, as if it was with reluctance that she might at last banish the spectre of poverty from its habitual place at our meagre table. For my mother herself had gladly, scandalously, defiantly beggared herself for love; and, one fine day, her gallant soldier never returned from the wars, leaving his wife and child a legacy of tears that never quite dried, a cigar box full of medals and the antique service revolver that my mother, grown magnificently eccentric in hardship, kept always in her reticule, in case--how I teased her--she was surprised by footpads on her way home from the grocer's shop.\nNow and then a starburst of lights spattered the drawn blinds as if the railway company had lit up all the stations through which we passed in celebration of the bride. My satin nightdress had just been shaken from its wrappings; it had slipped over my young girl's pointed breasts and shoulders, supple as a garment of heavy water, and now teasingly caressed me, egregious, insinuating, nudging between my thighs as I shifted restlessly in my narrow berth. His kiss, his kiss with tongue and teeth in it and a rasp of beard, had hinted to me, though with the same exquisite tact as this nightdress he'd given me, of the wedding night, which would be voluptuously deferred until we lay in his great ancestral bed in the sea-girt, pinnacled domain that lay, still, beyond the grasp of my imagination ... that magic place, the fairy castle whose walls were made of foam, that legendary habitation in which he had been born. To which, one day, I might bear an heir. Our destination, my destiny.\n\nAbove the syncopated roar of the train, I could hear his even, steady breathing. Only the communicating door kept me from my husband and it stood open. If I rose up on my elbow, I could see the dark, leonine shape of his head and my nostrils caught a whiff of the opulent male scent of leather and spices that always accompanied him and sometimes, during his courtship, had been the only hint he gave me that he had come into my mother's sitting room, for, though he was a big man, he moved as softly as if all his shoes had soles of velvet, as if his footfall turned the carpet into snow.\n\nHe had loved to surprise me in my abstracted solitude at the piano. He would tell them not to announce him, then soundlessly open the door and softly creep up behind me with his bouquet of hot-house flowers or his box of marrons glac\u00e9s, lay his offering upon the keys and clasp his hands over my eyes as I was lost in a Debussy prelude. But that perfume of spiced leather always betrayed him; after my first shock, I was forced always to mimic surprise, so that he would not be disappointed.\n\nHe was older than I. He was much older than I; there were streaks of pure silver in his dark mane. But his strange, heavy, almost waxen face was not lined by experience. Rather, experience seemed to have washed it perfectly smooth, like a stone on a beach whose fissures have been eroded by successive tides. And sometimes that face, in stillness when he listened to me playing, with the heavy eyelids folded over eyes that always disturbed me by their absolute absence of light, seemed to me like a mask, as if his real face, the face that truly reflected all the life he had led in the world before he met me, before, even, I was born, as though that face lay underneath this mask. Or else, elsewhere. As though he had laid by the face in which he had lived for so long in order to offer my youth a face unsigned by the years.\n\nAnd, elsewhere, I might see him plain. Elsewhere. But, where?\n\nIn, perhaps, that castle to which the train now took us, that marvellous castle in which he had been born.\n\nEven when he asked me to marry him, and I said: 'Yes,' still he did not lose that heavy, fleshy composure of his. I know it must seem a curious analogy, a man with a flower, but sometimes he seemed to me like a lily. Yes. A lily. Possessed of that strange, ominous calm of a sentient vegetable, like one of those cobra-headed, funereal lilies whose white sheaths are curled out of a flesh as thick and tensely yielding to the touch as vellum. When I said that I would marry him, not one muscle in his face stirred, but he let out a long, extinguished sigh. I thought: Oh! how he must want me! And it was as though the imponderable weight of his desire was a force I might not withstand, not by virtue of its violence but because of its very gravity.\n\nHe had the ring ready in a leather box lined with crimson velvet, a fire opal the size of a pigeon's egg set in a complicated circle of dark antique gold. My old nurse, who still lived with my mother and me, squinted at the ring askance: opals are bad luck, she said. But this opal had been his own mother's ring, and his grandmother's, and her mother's before that, given to an ancestor by Catherine de Medici ... every bride that came to the castle wore it, time out of mind. And did he give it to his other wives and have it back from them? asked the old woman rudely; yet she was a snob. She hid her incredulous joy at my marital coup--her little Marquise--behind a fa\u00e7ade of fault-finding. But, here, she touched me. I shrugged and turned my back pettishly on her. I did not want to remember how he had loved other women before me, but the knowledge often teased me in the threadbare self-confidence of the small hours.\n\nI was seventeen and knew nothing of the world; my Marquis had been married before, more than once, and I remained a little bemused that, after those others, he should now have chosen me. Indeed, was he not still in mourning for his last wife? Tsk, tsk, went my old nurse.\n\nAnd even my mother had been reluctant to see her girl whisked off by a man so recently bereaved. A Romanian countess, a lady of high fashion. Dead just three short months before I met him, a boating accident, at his home, in Brittany. They never found her body but I rummaged through the back copies of the society magazines my old nanny kept in a trunk under her bed and tracked down her photograph. The sharp muzzle of a pretty, witty, naughty monkey; such potent and bizarre charm, of a dark, bright, wild yet worldly thing whose natural habitat must have been some luxurious interior decorator's jungle filled with potted palms and tame, squawking parakeets.\n\nBefore that? Her face is common property; everyone painted her but the Redon engraving I liked best, The Evening Star Walking on the Rim of Night. To see her skeletal, enigmatic grace, you would never think she had been a barmaid in a caf\u00e9 in Montmartre until Puvis de Chavannes saw her and had her expose her flat breasts and elongated thighs to his brush. And yet it was the absinthe doomed her, or so they said.\n\nThe first of all his ladies? That sumptuous diva; I had heard her sing Isolde, precociously musical child that I was, taken to the opera for a birthday treat. My first opera; I had heard her sing Isolde. With what white-hot passion had she burned from the stage! So that you could tell she would die young. We sat high up, halfway to heaven in the gods, yet she half-blinded me. And my father, still alive (oh, so long ago), took hold of my sticky little hand, to comfort me, in the last act, yet all I heard was the glory of her voice.\n\nMarried three times within my own brief lifetime to three different graces, now, as if to demonstrate the eclecticism of his taste, he had invited me to join this gallery of beautiful women, I, the poor widow's child with my mouse-coloured hair that still bore the kinks of the plaits from which it had so recently been freed, my bony hips, my nervous, pianist's fingers.\nHe was rich as Croesus. The night before our wedding--a simple affair, at the Mairie, because his countess was so recently gone--he took my mother and me, curious coincidence, to see Tristan. And, do you know, my heart swelled and ached so during the Liebestod that I thought I must truly love him. Yes. I did. On his arm, all eyes were upon me. The whispering crowd in the foyer parted like the Red Sea to let us through. My skin crisped at his touch.\n\nHow my circumstances had changed since the first time I heard those voluptuous chords that carry such a charge of deathly passion in them! Now, we sat in a loge, in red velvet armchairs, and a braided, bewigged flunkey brought us a silver bucket of iced champagne in the interval. The froth spilled over the rim of my glass and drenched my hands, I thought: My cup runneth over. And I had on a Poiret dress. He had prevailed upon my reluctant mother to let him buy my trousseau; what would I have gone to him in, otherwise? Twice-darned underwear, faded gingham, serge skirts, hand-me-downs. So, for the opera, I wore a sinuous shift of white muslin tied with a silk string under the breasts. And everyone stared at me. And at his wedding gift.\n\nHis wedding gift, clasped round my throat. A choker of rubies, two inches wide, like an extraordinarily precious slit throat.\n\nAfter the Terror, in the early days of the Directory, the aristos who'd escaped the guillotine had an ironic fad of tying a red ribbon round their necks at just the point where the blade would have sliced it through, a red ribbon like the memory of a wound. And his grandmother, taken with the notion, had her ribbon made up in rubies; such a gesture of luxurious defiance! That night at the opera comes back to me even now ... the white dress; the frail child within it; and the flashing crimson jewels round her throat, bright as arterial blood.\n\nI saw him watching me in the gilded mirrors with the assessing eye of a connoisseur inspecting horseflesh, or even of a housewife in the market, inspecting cuts on the slab. I'd never seen, or else had never acknowledged, that regard of his before, the sheer carnal avarice of it; and it was strangely magnified by the monocle lodged in his left eye. When I saw him look at me with lust, I dropped my eyes but, in glancing away from him, I caught sight of myself in the mirror. And I saw myself, suddenly, as he saw me, my pale face, the way the muscles in my neck stuck out like thin wire. I saw how much that cruel necklace became me. And, for the first time in my innocent and confined life, I sensed in myself a potentiality for corruption that took my breath away.\n\nThe next day, we were married.\n\nThe train slowed, shuddered to a halt. Lights; clank of metal; a voice declaring the name of an unknown, never-to-be visited station; silence of the night; the rhythm of his breathing, that I should sleep with, now, for the rest of my life. And I could not sleep. I stealthily sat up, raised the blind a little and huddled against the cold window that misted over with the warmth of my breathing, gazing out at the dark platform towards those rectangles of domestic lamplight that promised warmth, company, a supper of sausages hissing in a pan on the stove for the station master, his children tucked up in bed asleep in the brick house with the painted shutters ... all the paraphernalia of the everyday world from which I, with my stunning marriage, had exiled myself.\n\nInto marriage, into exile; I sensed it, I knew it--that, henceforth, I would always be lonely. Yet that was part of the already familiar weight of the fire opal that glimmered like a gypsy's magic ball, so that I could not take my eyes off it when I played the piano. This ring, the bloody bandage of rubies, the wardrobe of clothes from Poiret and Worth, his scent of Russian leather--all had conspired to seduce me so utterly that I could not say I felt one single twinge of regret for the world of tar-tines and maman that now receded from me as if drawn away on a string, like a child's toy, as the train began to throb again as if in delighted anticipation of the distance it would take me.\n\nThe first grey streamers of the dawn now flew in the sky and an eldritch half-light seeped into the railway carriage. I heard no change in his breathing but my heightened, excited senses told me he was awake and gazing at me. A huge man, an enormous man, and his eyes, dark and motionless as those eyes the ancient Egyptians painted upon their sarcophagi, fixed upon me. I felt a certain tension in the pit of my stomach, to be so watched, in such silence. A match struck. He was igniting a Romeo y Julieta fat as a baby's arm.\n\n'Soon,' he said in his resonant voice that was like the tolling of a bell and I felt, all at once, a sharp premonition of dread that lasted only as long as the match flared and I could see his white, broad face as if it were hovering, disembodied, above the sheets, illuminated from below like a grotesque carnival head. Then the flame died, the cigar glowed and filled the compartment with a remembered fragrance that made me think of my father, how he would hug me in a warm fug of Havana, when I was a little girl, before he kissed me and left me and died.\n\nAs soon as my husband handed me down from the high step of the train, I smelled the amniotic salinity of the ocean. It was November; the trees, stunted by the Atlantic gales, were bare and the lonely halt was deserted but for his leather-gaitered chauffeur waiting meekly beside the sleek black motor car. It was cold; I drew my furs about me, a wrap of white and black, broad stripes of ermine and sable, with a collar from which my head rose like the calyx of a wildflower. (I swear to you, I had never been vain until I met him.) The bell clanged; the straining train leapt its leash and left us at that lonely wayside halt where only he and I had descended. Oh, the wonder of it; how all that might of iron and steam had paused only to suit his convenience. The richest man in France.\n\n'Madame.'\n\nThe chauffeur eyed me; was he comparing me, invidiously, to the countess, the artist's model, the opera singer? I hid behind my furs as if they were a system of soft shields. My husband liked me to wear my opal over my kid glove, a showy, theatrical trick--but the moment the ironic chauffeur glimpsed its simmering flash he smiled, as though it was proof positive I was his master's wife. And we drove towards the widening dawn, that now streaked half the sky with a wintry bouquet of pink of roses, orange of tiger-lilies, as if my husband had ordered me a sky from a florist. The day broke around me like a cool dream.\nSea; sand; a sky that melts into the sea--a landscape of misty pastels with a look about it of being continuously on the point of melting. A landscape with all the deliquescent harmonies of Debussy, of the \u00e9tudes I played for him, the reverie I'd been playing that afternoon in the salon of the princess where I'd first met him, among the teacups and the little cakes, I, the orphan, hired out of charity to give them their digestive of music.\n\nAnd, ah! his castle. The faery solitude of the place; with its turrets of misty blue, its courtyard, its spiked gate, his castle that lay on the very bosom of the sea with seabirds mewing about its attics, the casements opening on to the green and purple, evanescent departures of the ocean, cut off by the tide from land for half a day ... that castle, at home neither on the land nor on the water, a mysterious, amphibious place, contravening the materiality of both earth and the waves, with the melancholy of a mermaiden who perches on her rock and waits, endlessly, for a lover who had drowned far away, long ago. That lovely, sad, sea-siren of a place!\n\nThe tide was low; at this hour, so early in the morning, the causeway rose up out of the sea. As the car turned on to the wet cobbles between the slow margins of water, he reached out for my hand that had his sultry, witchy ring on it, pressed my fingers, kissed my palm with extraordinary tenderness. His face was as still as ever I'd seen it, still as a pond iced thickly over, yet his lips, that always looked so strangely red and naked between the black fringes of his beard, now curved a little. He smiled; he welcomed his bride home.\n\nNo room, no corridor that did not rustle with the sound of the sea and all the ceilings, the walls on which his ancestors in the stern regalia of rank lined up with their dark eyes and white faces, were stippled with refracted light from the waves which were always in motion; that luminous, murmurous castle of which I was the chatelaine, I, the little music student whose mother had sold all her jewellery, even her wedding ring, to pay the fees at the Conservatoire.\n\nFirst of all, there was the small ordeal of my initial interview with the housekeeper, who kept this extraordinary machine, this anchored, castellated ocean liner, in smooth running order no matter who stood on the bridge; how tenuous, I thought, might be my authority here! She had a bland, pale, impassive, dislikeable face beneath the impeccably starched white linen head-dress of the region. Her greeting, correct but lifeless, chilled me; daydreaming, I dared presume too much on my status ... briefly wondered how I might install my old nurse, so much loved, however cosily incompetent, in her place. Ill-considered schemings! He told me this one had been his foster mother; was bound to his family in the utmost feudal complicity, 'as much part of the house as I am, my dear'. Now her thin lips offered me a proud little smile. She would be my ally as long as I was his. And with that, I must be content.\n\nBut, here, it would be easy to be content. In the turret suite he had given me for my very own, I could gaze out over the tumultuous Atlantic and imagine myself the Queen of the Sea. There was a Bechstein for me in the music room and, on the wall, another wedding present--an early Flemish primitive of Saint Cecilia at her celestial organ. In the prim charm of this saint, with her plump, sallow cheeks and crinkled brown hair, I saw myself as I could have wished to be. I warmed to a loving sensitivity I had not hitherto suspected in him. Then he led me up a delicate spiral staircase to my bedroom; before she discreetly vanished, the housekeeper set him chuckling with some, I dare say, lewd blessing for newlyweds in her native Breton. That I did not understand. That he, smiling, refused to interpret.\n\nAnd there lay the grand, hereditary matrimonial bed, itself the size, almost, of my little room at home, with the gargoyles carved on its surfaces of ebony, vermilion lacquer, gold leaf; and its white gauze curtains, billowing in the sea breeze. Our bed. And surrounded by so many mirrors! Mirrors on all the walls, in stately frames of contorted gold, that reflected more white lilies than I'd ever seen in my life before. He'd filled the room with them, to greet the bride, the young bride. The young bride, who had become that multitude of girls I saw in the mirrors, identical in their chic navy blue tailor-mades, for travelling, madame, or walking. A maid had dealt with the furs. Henceforth, a maid would deal with everything.\n\n'See,' he said, gesturing towards those elegant girls. 'I have acquired a whole harem for myself!'\n\nI found that I was trembling. My breath came thickly. I could not meet his eye and turned my head away, out of pride, out of shyness, and watched a dozen husbands approach me in a dozen mirrors and slowly, methodically, teasingly, unfasten the buttons of my jacket and slip it from my shoulders. Enough! No; more! Off comes the skirt; and, next, the blouse of apricot linen that cost more than the dress I had for first communion. The play of the waves outside in the cold sun glittered on his monocle; his movements seemed to me deliberately coarse, vulgar. The blood rushed to my face again, and stayed there.\n\nAnd yet, you see, I guessed it might be so--that we should have a formal disrobing of the bride, a ritual from the brothel. Sheltered as my life had been, how could I have failed, even in the world of prim bohemia in which I lived, to have heard hints of his world?\n\nHe stripped me, gourmand that he was, as if he were stripping the leaves off an artichoke--but do not imagine much finesse about it; this artichoke was no particular treat for the diner nor was he yet in any greedy haste. He approached his familiar treat with a weary appetite. And when nothing but my scarlet, palpitating core remained, I saw, in the mirror, the living image of an etching by Rops from the collection he had shown me when our engagement permitted us to be alone together ... the child with her sticklike limbs, naked but for her button boots, her gloves, shielding her face with her hand as though her face were the last repository of her modesty; and the old, monocled lecher who examined her, limb by limb. He in his London tailoring; she, bare as a lamb chop. Most pornographic of all confrontations. And so my purchaser unwrapped his bargain. And, as at the opera, when I had first seen my flesh in his eyes, I was aghast to feel myself stirring.\n\nAt once he closed my legs like a book and I saw again the rare movement of his lips that meant he smiled.\n\nNot yet. Later. Anticipation is the greater part of pleasure, my little love.\n\nAnd I began to shudder, like a racehorse before a race, yet also with a kind of fear, for I felt both a strange, impersonal arousal at the thought of love and at the same time a repugnance I could not stifle for his white, heavy flesh that had too much in common with the armfuls of arum lilies that filled my bedroom in great glass jars, those undertakers' lilies with the heavy pollen that powders your fingers as if you had dipped them in turmeric. The lilies I always associate with him; that are white. And stain you.\n\nThis scene from a voluptuary's life was now abruptly terminated. It turns out he has business to attend to; his estates, his companies--even on your honeymoon? Even then, said the red lips that kissed me before he left me alone with my bewildered senses--a wet, silken brush from his beard; a hint of the pointed tip of the tongue. Disgruntled, I wrapped a neglige of antique lace around me to sip the little breakfast of hot chocolate the maid brought me; after that, since it was second nature to me, there was nowhere to go but the music room and soon I settled down at my piano.\n\nYet only a series of subtle discords flowed from beneath my fingers: out of tune ... only a little out of tune; but I'd been blessed with perfect pitch and could not bear to play any more. Sea breezes are bad for pianos; we shall need a resident piano-tuner on the premises if I'm to continue with my studies! I flung down the lid in a little fury of disappointment; what should I do now, how shall I pass the long, sea-lit hours until my husband beds me?\n\nI shivered to think of that.\n\nHis library seemed the source of his habitual odour of Russian leather. Row upon row of calf-bound volumes, brown and olive, with gilt lettering on their spines, the octavo in brilliant scarlet morocco. A deep-buttoned leather sofa to recline on. A lectern, carved like a spread eagle, that held open upon it an edition of Huysmans's L\u00e0-bas, from some over-exquisite private press; it had been bound like a missal, in brass, with gems of coloured glass. The rugs on the floor, deep, pulsing blues of heaven and red of the heart's dearest blood, came from Isfahan and Bokhara; the dark panelling gleamed; there was the lulling music of the sea and a fire of apple logs. The flames flickered along the spines inside a glass-fronted case that held books still crisp and new. Eliphas Levy; the name meant nothing to me. I squinted at a title or two: The Initiation, The Key of Mysteries, The Secret of Pandora's Box, and yawned. Nothing, here, to detain a seventeen-year-old girl waiting for her first embrace. I should have liked, best of all, a novel in yellow paper; I wanted to curl up on the rug before the blazing fire, lose myself in a cheap novel, munch sticky liqueur chocolates. If I rang for them, a maid would bring me chocolates.\n\nNevertheless, I opened the doors of that bookcase idly to browse. And I think I knew, I knew by some tingling of the fingertips, even before I opened that slim volume with no title at all on the spine, what I should find inside it. When he showed me the Rops, newly bought, dearly prized, had he not hinted that he was a connoisseur of such things? Yet I had not bargained for this, the girl with tears hanging on her cheeks like stuck pearls, her cunt a split fig below the great globes of her buttocks on which the knotted tails of the cat were about to descend, while a man in a black mask fingered with his free hand his prick, that curved upwards like the scimitar he held. The picture had a caption: 'Reproof of curiosity'. My mother, with all the precision of her eccentricity, had told me what it was that lovers did; I was innocent but not na\u00efve. The Adventures of Eulalie at the Harem of the Grand Turk had been printed, according to the flyleaf, in Amsterdam in 1748, a rare collector's piece. Had some ancestor brought it back himself from that northern city? Or had my husband bought it for himself, from one of those dusty little bookshops on the Left Bank where an old man peers at you through spectacles an inch thick, daring you to inspect his wares ... I turned the pages in the anticipation of fear; the print was rusty. Here was another steel engraving: 'Immolation of the wives of the Sultan'. I knew enough for what I saw in that book to make me gasp.\n\nThere was a pungent intensification of the odour of leather that suffused his library; his shadow fell across the massacre.\n\n'My little nun has found the prayerbooks, has she?' he demanded, with a curious mixture of mockery and relish; then, seeing my painful, furious bewilderment, he laughed at me aloud, snatched the book from my hands and put it down on the sofa.\n\n'Have the nasty pictures scared Baby? Baby mustn't play with grownups' toys until she's learned how to handle them, must she?'\n\nThen he kissed me. And with, this time, no reticence. He kissed me and laid his hand imperatively upon my breast, beneath the sheath of ancient lace. I stumbled on the winding stair that led to the bedroom, to the carved, gilded bed on which he had been conceived. I stammered foolishly: We've not taken luncheon yet; and, besides, it is broad daylight...\n\nAll the better to see you.\n\nHe made me put on my choker, the family heirloom of one woman who had escaped the blade. With trembling fingers, I fastened the thing about my neck. It was cold as ice and chilled me. He twined my hair into a rope and lifted it off my shoulders so that he could the better kiss the downy furrows below my ears; that made me shudder. And he kissed those blazing rubies, too. He kissed them before he kissed my mouth. Rapt, he intoned:' Of her apparel she retains/Only her sonorous jewellery.'\n\nA dozen husbands impaled a dozen brides while the mewing gulls swung on invisible trapezes in the empty air outside.\n\nI was brought to my senses by the insistent shrilling of the telephone. He lay beside me, felled like an oak, breathing stertorously, as if he had been fighting with me. In the course of that one-sided struggle, I had seen his deathly composure shatter like a porcelain vase flung against a wall; I had heard him shriek and blaspheme at the orgasm; I had bled. And perhaps I had seen his face without its mask; and perhaps I had not. Yet I had been infinitely dishevelled by the loss of my virginity.\n\nI gathered myself together, reached into the cloisonne cupboard beside the bed that concealed the telephone and addressed the mouthpiece. His agent in New York. Urgent.\n\nI shook him awake and rolled over on my side, cradling my spent body in my arms. His voice buzzed like a hive of distant bees. My husband. My husband, who, with so much love, filled my bedroom with lilies until it looked like an embalming parlour. Those somnolent lilies, that wave their heavy heads, distributing their lush, insolent incense reminiscent of pampered flesh.\n\nWhen he'd finished with the agent, he turned to me and stroked the ruby necklace that bit into my neck, but with such tenderness now, that I ceased flinching and he caressed my breasts. My dear one, my little love, my child, did it hurt her? He's so sorry for it, such impetuousness, he could not help himself; you see, he loves her so ... and this lover's recitative of his brought my tears in a flood. I clung to him as though only the one who had inflicted the pain could comfort me for suffering it. For a while, he murmured to me in a voice I'd never heard before, a voice like the soft consolations of the sea. But then he unwound the tendrils of my hair from the buttons of his smoking jacket, kissed my cheek briskly and told me the agent from New York had called with such urgent business that he must leave as soon as the tide was low enough. Leave the castle? Leave France! And would be away for at least six weeks.\n\n'But it is our honeymoon!'\n\nA deal, an enterprise of hazard and chance involving several millions, lay in the balance, he said. He drew away from me into that waxworks stillness of his; I was only a little girl, I did not understand. And, he said unspoken to my wounded vanity, I have had too many honeymoons to find them in the least pressing commitments. I know quite well that this child I've bought with a handful of coloured stones and the pelts of dead beasts won't run away. But, after he'd called his Paris agent to book a passage for the States next day--just one tiny call, my little one--we should have time for dinner together.\n\nAnd I had to be content with that,\n\nA Mexican dish of pheasant with hazelnuts and chocolate; salad; white, voluptuous cheese; a sorbet of muscat grapes and Asti spumante. A celebration of Krug exploded festively. And then acrid black coffee in precious little cups so fine it shadowed the birds with which they were painted. I had Cointreau, he had cognac in the library, with the purple velvet curtains drawn against the night, where he took me to perch on his knee in a leather armchair beside the flickering log fire. He had made me change into that chaste little Poiret shift of white muslin; he seemed especially fond of it, my breasts showed through the flimsy stuff, he said, like little soft white doves that sleep, each one, with a pink eye open. But he would not let me take off my ruby choker, although it was growing very uncomfortable, nor fasten up my descending hair, the sign of a virginity so recently ruptured that still remained a wounded presence between us. He twined his fingers in my hair until I winced; I said, I remember, very little.\n\n'The maid will have changed our sheets already,' he said. 'We do not hang the bloody sheets out of the window to prove to the whole of Brittany you are a virgin, not in these civilized times. But I should tell you it would have been the first time in all my married lives I could have shown my interested tenants such a flag.'\n\nThen I realized, with a shock of surprise, how it must have been my innocence that captivated him--the silent music, he said, of my unknowingness, like La Terrasse des audiences au clair de lune played upon a piano with keys of ether. You must remember how ill at ease I was in that luxurious place, how unease had been my constant companion during the whole length of my courtship by this grave satyr who now gently martyrized my hair. To know that my naivety gave him some pleasure made me take heart. Courage! I shall act the fine lady to the manner born one day, if only by virtue of default.\n\nThen, slowly yet teasingly, as if he were giving a child a great, mysterious treat, he took out a bunch of keys from some interior hidey-hole in his jacket--key after key, a key, he said, for every lock in the house. Keys of all kinds--huge, ancient things of black iron; others slender, delicate, almost baroque; wafer-thin Yale keys for safes and boxes. And, during his absence, it was I who must take care of them all.\n\nI eyed the heavy bunch with circumspection. Until that moment, I had not given a single thought to the practical aspects of marriage with a great house, great wealth, a great man, whose key ring was as crowded as that of a prison warder. Here were the clumsy and archaic keys for the dungeons, for dungeons we had in plenty although they had been converted to cellars for his wines; the dusty bottles inhabited in racks all those deep holes of pain in the rock on which the castle was built. These are the keys to the kitchens, this is the key to the picture gallery, a treasure house filled by five centuries of avid collectors--ah! he foresaw I would spend hours there.\n\nHe had amply indulged his taste for the Symbolists, he told me with a glint of greed. There was Moreau's great portrait of his first wife, the famous Sacrificial Victim with the imprint of the lacelike chains on her pellucid skin. Did I know the story of the painting of that picture? How, when she took off her clothes for him for the first time, she fresh from her bar in Montmartre, she had robed herself involuntarily in a blush that reddened her breasts, her shoulders, her arms, her whole body? He had thought of that story, of that dear girl, when first he had undressed me ... Ensor, the great Ensor, his monolithic canvas: The Foolish Virgins. Two or three late Gauguins, his special favourite the one of the tranced brown girl in the deserted house which was called: Out of the Night We Come, Into the Night We Go. And, besides the additions he had made himself, his marvellous inheritance of Watteaus, Poussins and a pair of very special Fragonards, commissioned for a licentious ancestor who, it was said, had posed for the master's brush himself with his own two daughters ... He broke off his catalogue of treasures abruptly.\n\nYour thin white face, ch\u00e9rie; he said, as if he saw it for the first time. Your thin white face, with its promise of debauchery only a connoisseur could detect.\n\nA log fell in the fire, instigating a shower of sparks; the opal on my finger spurted green flame. I felt as giddy as if I were on the edge of a precipice; I was afraid, not so much of him, of his monstrous presence, heavy as if he had been gifted at birth with more specific gravity than the rest of us, the presence that, even when I thought myself most in love with him, always subtly oppressed me ... No. I was not afraid of him; but of myself. I seemed reborn in his unreflective eyes, reborn in unfamiliar shapes. I hardly recognized myself from his descriptions of me and yet, and yet--might there not be a grain of beastly truth hi them? And, in the red firelight, I blushed again, unnoticed, to think he might have chosen me because, in my innocence, he sensed a rare talent for corruption.\n\nHere is the key to the china cabinet--don't laugh, my darling; there's a king's ransom in S\u00e8vres in that closet, and a queen's ransom in Limoges. And a key to the locked, barred room where five generations of plate were kept.\n\nKeys, keys, keys. He would trust me with the keys to his office, although I was only a baby; and the keys to his safes, where he kept the jewels I should wear, he promised me, when we returned to Paris. Such jewels! Why, I would be able to change my earrings and necklaces three times a day, just as the Empress Josephine used to change her underwear. He doubted, he said, with that hollow, knocking sound that served him for a chuckle, I would be quite so interested in his share certificates although they, of course, were worth infinitely more.\n\nOutside our firelit privacy, I could hear the sound of the tide drawing back from the pebbles of the foreshore; it was nearly time for him to leave me. One single key remained unaccounted for on the ring and he hesitated over it; for a moment, I thought he was going to unfasten it from its brothers, slip it back into his pocket and take it away with him.\n\n'What is that key?' I demanded, for his chaffing had made me bold. 'The key to your heart? Give it me!'\n\nHe dangled the key tantalizingly above my head, out of reach of my straining fingers; those bare red lips of his cracked sidelong in a smile.\n\n'Ah, no,' he said. 'Not the key to my heart. Rather, the key to my enfer.'\n\nHe left it on the ring, fastened the ring together, shook it musically, like a carillon. Then threw the keys in a jingling heap in my lap. I could feel the cold metal chilling my thighs through my thin muslin frock. He bent over me to drop a beard-masked kiss on my forehead.\n\n'Every man must have one secret, even if only one, from his wife,' he said. 'Promise me this, my whey-faced piano-player; promise me you'll use all the keys on the ring except that last little one I showed you. Play with anything you find, jewels, silver plate; make toy boats of my share certificates, if it pleases you, and send them sailing off to America after me. All is yours, everywhere is open to you--except the lock that this single key fits. Yet all it is is the key to a little room at the foot of the west tower, behind the still-room, at the end of a dark little corridor full of horrid cobwebs that would get into your hair and frighten you if you ventured there. Oh, and you'd find it such a dull little room! But you must promise me, if you love me, to leave it well alone. It is only a private study, a hideaway, a \"den\", as the English say, where I can go, sometimes, on those infrequent yet inevitable occasions when the yoke of marriage seems to weigh too heavily on my shoulders. There I can go, you understand, to savour the rare pleasure of imagining myself wifeless.'\n\nThere was a little thin starlight in the courtyard as, wrapped in my furs, I saw him to his car. His last words were, that he had telephoned the mainland and taken a piano-tuner on to the staff; this man would arrive to take up his duties the next day. He pressed me to his vicu\u00f1a breast, once, and then drove away.\n\nI had drowsed away that afternoon and now I could not sleep. I lay tossing and turning in his ancestral bed until another daybreak discoloured the dozen mirrors that were iridescent with the reflections of the sea. The perfume of the lilies weighed on my senses; when I thought that, henceforth, I would always share these sheets with a man whose skin, as theirs did, contained that toad-like, clammy hint of moisture, I felt a vague desolation that within me, now my female wound had healed, there had awoken a certain queasy craving like the cravings of pregnant women for the taste of coal or chalk or tainted food, for the renewal of his caresses. Had he not hinted to me, in his flesh as in his speech and looks, of the thousand, thousand baroque intersections of flesh upon flesh? I lay in our wide bed accompanied by, a sleepless companion, my dark newborn curiosity.\n\nI lay in bed alone. And I longed for him. And he disgusted me.\n\nWere there jewels enough in all his safes to recompense me for this predicament? Did all that castle hold enough riches to recompense me for the company of the libertine with whom I must share it? And what, precisely, was the nature of my desirous dread for this mysterious being who, to show his mastery over me, had abandoned me on my wedding night?\n\nThen I sat straight up in bed, under the sardonic masks of the gargoyles carved above me, riven by a wild surmise. Might he have left me, not for Wall Street but for an importunate mistress tucked away God knows where who knew how to pleasure him far better than a girl whose fingers had been exercised, hitherto, only by the practice of scales and arpeggios? And, slowly, soothed, I sank back on to the heaping pillows; I acknowledged that the jealous scare I'd just given myself was not unmixed with a little tincture of relief.\n\nAt last I drifted into slumber, as daylight filled the room and chased bad dreams away. But the last thing I remembered, before I slept, was the tall jar of lilies beside the bed, how the thick glass distorted their fat stems so they looked like arms, dismembered arms, drifting drowned in greenish water.\n\nCoffee and croissants to console this bridal, solitary waking. Delicious. Honey, too, in a section of comb on a glass saucer. The maid squeezed the aromatic juice from an orange into a chilled goblet while I watched her as I lay in the lazy, midday bed of the rich. Yet nothing, this morning, gave me more than a fleeting pleasure except to hear that the piano-tuner had been at work already. When the maid told me that, I sprang out of bed and pulled on my old serge skirt and flannel blouse, costume of a student, in which I felt far more at ease with myself than in any of my fine new clothes.\n\nAfter my three hours of practice, I called the piano-tuner in, to thank him. He was blind, of course; but young, with a gentle mouth and grey eyes that fixed upon me although they could not see me. He was a blacksmith's son from the village across the causeway; a chorister in the church whom the good priest had taught a trade so that he could make a living. All most satisfactory. Yes. He thought he would be happy here. And if, he added shyly, he might sometimes be allowed to hear me play ... for, you see, he loved music. Yes. Of course, I said. Certainly. He seemed to know that I had smiled.\n\nAfter I dismissed him, even though I'd woken so late, it was still barely time for my 'five o'clock'. The housekeeper, who, thoughtfully forewarned by my husband, had restrained herself from interrupting my music, now made me a solemn visitation with a lengthy menu for a late luncheon. When I told her I did not need it, she looked at me obliquely, along her nose. I understood at once that one of my principal functions as chatelaine was to provide work for the staff. But, all the same, I asserted myself and said I would wait until dinner-time, although I looked forward nervously to the solitary meal. Then I found I had to tell her what I would like to have prepared for me; my imagination, still that of a schoolgirl, ran riot. A fowl in cream--or should I anticipate Christmas with a varnished turkey? No; I have decided. Avocado and shrimp, lots of it, followed by no entr\u00e9e at all. But surprise me for dessert with every ice-cream in the ice box. She noted all down but sniffed; I'd shocked her. Such tastes! Child that I was, I giggled when she left me.\n\nBut, now ... what shall I do, now?\n\nI could have spent a happy hour unpacking the trunks that contained my trousseau but the maid had done that already, the dresses, the tailor-mades hung in the wardrobe in my dressing room, the hats on wooden heads to keep their shape, the shoes on wooden feet as if all these inanimate objects were imitating the appearance of life, to mock me. I did not like to linger in my overcrowded dressing room, nor in my lugubriously lily-scented bedroom. How shall I pass the time?\n\nI shall take a bath in my own bathroom! And found the taps were little dolphins made of gold, with chips of turquoise for eyes. And there was a tank of goldfish, who swam in and out of moving fronds of weeds, as bored, I thought, as I was. How I wished he had not left me. How I wished it were possible to chat with, say, a maid; or, the piano-tuner ... but I knew already my new rank forbade overtures of friendship to the staff.\n\nI had been hoping to defer the call as long as I could, so that I should have something to look forward to in the dead waste of time I foresaw before me, after my dinner was done with, but, at a quarter before seven, when darkness already surrounded the castle, I could contain myself no longer. I telephoned my mother. And astonished myself by bursting into tears when I heard her voice.\n\nNo, nothing was the matter. Mother, I have gold bath taps.\n\nI said, gold bath taps!\n\nNo; I suppose that's nothing to cry about, Mother.\n\nThe line was bad, I could hardly make out her congratulations, her questions, her concern, but I was a little comforted when I put the receiver down.\n\nYet there still remained one whole hour to dinner and the whole, unimaginable desert of the rest of the evening.\n\nThe bunch of keys lay, where he had left them, on the rug before the library fire which had warmed their metal so that they no longer felt cold to the touch but warm, almost, as my own skin. How careless I was; a maid, tending the logs, eyed me reproachfully as if I'd set a trap for her as I picked up the clinking bundle of keys, the keys to the interior doors of this lovely prison of which I was both the inmate and the mistress and had scarcely seen. When I remembered that, I felt the exhilaration of the explorer.\n\nLights! More lights!\n\nAt the touch of a switch, the dreaming library was brilliantly illuminated. I ran crazily about the castle, switching on every light I could find--I ordered the servants to light up all their quarters, too, so the castle would shine like a seaborne birthday cake lit with a thousand candles, one for every year of its life, and everybody on shore would wonder at it. When everything was lit as brightly as the caf\u00e9 in the Gare du Nord, the significance of the possessions implied by that bunch of keys no longer intimidated me, for I was determined, now, to search through them all for evidence of my husband's true nature. His office first, evidently.\n\nA mahogany desk half a mile wide, with an impeccable blotter and a bank of telephones. I allowed myself the luxury of opening the safe that contained the jewellery and delved sufficiently among the leather boxes to find out how my marriage had given me access to a jinn's treasury--parures, bracelets, rings ... While I was thus surrounded by diamonds, a maid knocked on the door and entered before I spoke; a subtle discourtesy. I would speak to my husband about it. She eyed my serge skirt superciliously; did madame plan to dress for dinner?\n\nShe made a moue of disdain when I laughed to hear that, she was far more the lady than I. But, imagine--to dress up in one of my Poiret extravaganzas, with the jewelled turban and aigrette on my head, roped with pearl to the navel, to sit down all alone in the baronial dining hall at the head of that massive board at which King Mark was reputed to have fed his knights ... I grew calmer under the cold eye of her disapproval. I adopted the crisp inflections of an officer's daughter. No, I would not dress for dinner. Furthermore, I was not hungry enough for dinner itself. She must tell the housekeeper to cancel the dormitory feast I'd ordered. Could they leave me sandwiches and a flask of coffee in my music room? And would they all dismiss for the night?\n\nMais oui, madame.\n\nI knew by her bereft intonation I had let them down again but I did not care; I was armed against them by the brilliance of his hoard. But I would not find his heart amongst the glittering stones; as soon as she had gone, I began a systematic search of the drawers of his desk.\n\nAll was in order, so I found nothing. Not a random doodle on an old envelope, nor the faded photograph of a woman. Only the files of business correspondence, the bills from the home farms, the invoices from tailors, the billets-doux from international financiers. Nothing. And this absence of the evidence of his real life began to impress me strangely; there must, I thought, be a great deal to conceal if he takes such pains to hide it.\n\nHis office was a singularly impersonal room, facing inwards, on to the courtyard, as though he wanted to turn his back on the siren sea in order to keep a clear head while he bankrupted a small businessman in Amsterdam or--I noticed with a thrill of distaste--engaged in some business in Laos that must, from certain cryptic references to his amateur botanist's enthusiasm for rare poppies, be to do with opium. Was he not rich enough to do without crime? Or was the crime itself his profit? And yet I saw enough to appreciate his zeal for secrecy.\n\nNow I had ransacked his desk, I must spend a cool-headed quarter of an hour putting every last letter back where I had found it, and, as I covered the traces of my visit, by some chance, as I reached inside a little drawer that had stuck fast, I must have touched a hidden spring, for a secret drawer flew open within that drawer itself; and this secret drawer contained--at last!--a file marked: Personal.\n\nI was alone, but for my reflection in the uncurtained window.\n\nI had the brief notion that his heart, pressed flat as a flower, crimson and thin as tissue paper, lay in this file. It was a very thin one.\n\nI could have wished, perhaps, I had not found that touching, ill-spelt note, on a paper napkin marked La Coupole, that began: 'My darling, I cannot wait for the moment when you may make me yours completely.' The diva had sent him a page of the score of Tristan, the Liebestod, with the single, cryptic word: 'Until...' scrawled across it. But the strangest of all these love letters was a postcard with a view of a village graveyard, among mountains, where some black-coated ghoul enthusiastically dug at a grave; this little scene, executed with the lurid exuberance of Grand Guignol, was captioned: 'Typical Transylvanian Scene--Midnight, All Hallows.' And, on the other side, the message: 'On the occasion of this marriage to the descendant of Dracula--always remember, \"the supreme and unique pleasure of love is the certainty that one is doing evil\". Toutes amiti\u00e9s, C.'\n\nA joke. A joke in the worst possible taste; for had he not been married to a Romanian countess? And then I remembered her pretty, witty face, and her name--Carmilla. My most recent predecessor in this castle had been, it would seem, the most sophisticated.\n\nI put away the file, sobered. Nothing in my life of family love and music had prepared me for these grown-up games and yet these were clues to his self that showed me, at least, how much he had been loved, even if they did not reveal any good reason for it. But I wanted to know still more; and, as I closed the office door and locked it, the means to discover more fell in my way.\n\nFell, indeed; and with the clatter of a dropped canteen of cutlery, for, as I turned the slick Yale lock, I contrived, somehow, to open up the key ring itself, so that all the keys tumbled loose on the floor. And the very first key I picked out of that pile was, as luck or ill fortune had it, the key to the room he had forbidden me, the room he would keep for his own so that he could go there when he wished to feel himself once more a bachelor.\n\nI made my decision to explore it before I felt a faint resurgence of my ill-defined fear of his waxen stillness. Perhaps I half-imagined, then, that I might find his real self in his den, waiting there to see if indeed I had obeyed him; that he had sent a moving figure of himself to New York, the enigmatic, self-sustaining carapace of his public person, while the real man, whose face I had glimpsed in the storm of orgasm, occupied himself with pressing private business in the study at the foot of the west tower, behind the still-room. Yet, if that were so, it was imperative that I should find him, should know him; and I was too deluded by his apparent taste for me to think my disobedience might truly offend him.\n\nI took the forbidden key from the heap and left the others lying there.\n\nIt was now very late and the castle was adrift, as far as it could go from the land, in the middle of the silent ocean where, at my orders, it floated, like a garland of light. And all silent, all still, but for the murmuring of the waves.\n\nI felt no fear, no intimation of dread. Now I walked as firmly as I had done in my mother's house.\n\nNot a narrow, dusty little passage at all; why had he lied to me? But an ill-lit one, certainly; the electricity, for some reason, did not extend here, so I retreated to the still-room and found a bundle of waxed tapers in a cupboard, stored there with matches to light the oak board at grand dinners. I put a match to my little taper and advanced with it in my hand, like a penitent, along the corridor hung with heavy, I think Venetian, tapestries. The flame picked out, here, the head of a man, there, the rich breast of a woman spilling through a rent in her dress--the Rape of the Sabines, perhaps? The naked swords and immolated horses suggested some grisly mythological subject. The corridor wound downwards; there was an almost imperceptible ramp to the thickly carpeted floor. The heavy hangings on the wall muffled my footsteps, even my breathing. For some reason, it grew very warm; the sweat sprang out in beads on my brow. I could no longer hear the sound of the sea.\n\nA long, a winding corridor, as if I were in the viscera of the castle; and this corridor led to a door of worm-eaten oak, low, round-topped, barred with black iron.\n\nAnd still I felt no fear, no raising of the hairs on the back of the neck, no prickling of the thumbs.\n\nThe key slid into the new lock as easily as a hot knife into butter.\n\nNo fear; but a hesitation, a holding of the spiritual breath.\n\nIf I had found some traces of his heart in a file marked: Personal, perhaps, here, in his subterranean privacy, I might find a little of his soul. It was the consciousness of the possibility of such a discovery, of its possible strangeness, that kept me for a moment motionless, before, in the foolhardiness of my already subtly tainted innocence, I turned the key and the door creaked slowly back.\n\n'There is a striking resemblance between the act of love and the ministrations of a torturer,' opined my husband's favourite poet; I had learned something of the nature of that similarity on my marriage bed. And now my taper showed me the outlines of a rack. There was also a great wheel, like the ones I had seen in woodcuts of the martyrdoms of the saints, in my old nurse's little store of holy books. And--just one glimpse of it before my little flame caved in and I was left in absolute darkness--a metal figure, hinged at the side, which I knew to be spiked on the inside and to have the name: the Iron Maiden.\n\nAbsolute darkness. And, about me, the instruments of mutilation.\n\nUntil that moment, this spoiled child did not know she had inherited nerves and a will from the mother who had defied the yellow outlaws of Indo-China; My mother's spirit drove me on, into that dreadful place, in a cold ecstasy to know the very worst. I fumbled for the matches in my pocket; what a dim, lugubrious light they gave! And yet, enough, oh, more than enough, to see a room designed for desecration and some dark night of unimaginable lovers whose embraces were annihilation.\n\nThe walls of this stark torture chamber were the naked rock; they gleamed as if they were sweating with fright. At the four corners of the room were funerary urns, of great antiquity, Etruscan, perhaps, and, on three-legged ebony stands, the bowls of incense he had left burning which filled the room with a sacerdotal reek. Wheel, rack and Iron Maiden were, I saw, displayed as grandly as if they were items of statuary and I was almost consoled, then, and almost persuaded myself that I might have stumbled only upon a little museum of his perversity, that he had installed these monstrous items here only for contemplation.\n\nYet at the centre of the room lay a catafalque, a doomed, ominous bier of Renaissance workmanship, surrounded by long white candles and, at its foot, an armful of the same lilies with which he had filled my bedroom, stowed in a four-foot-high jar glazed with a sombre Chinese red. I scarcely dared examine this catafalque and its occupant more closely; yet I knew I must.\n\nEach time I struck a match to light those candles round her bed, it seemed a garment of that innocence of mine for which he had lusted fell away from me.\n\nThe opera singer lay, quite naked, under a thin sheet of very rare and precious linen, such as the princes of Italy used to shroud those whom they had poisoned. I touched her, very gently, on the white breast; she was cool, he had embalmed her. On her throat I could see the blue imprint of his strangler's fingers. The cool, sad flame of the candles flickered on her white, closed eyelids. The worst thing was, the dead lips smiled.\n\nBeyond the catafalque, in the middle of the shadows, a white, nacreous glimmer; as my eyes accustomed themselves to the gathering darkness, I at last--oh, horrors!--made out a skull; yes, a skull, so utterly denuded, now, of flesh, that it scarcely seemed possible the stark bone had once been richly upholstered with life. And this skull was strung up by a system of unseen cords, so that it appeared to hang, disembodied, in the still, heavy air, and it had been crowned with a wreath of white roses, and a veil of lace, the final image of his bride.\n\nYet the skull was still so beautiful, had shaped with its sheer planes so imperiously the face that had once existed above it, that I recognized her the moment I saw her; face of the evening star walking on the rim of night. One false step, oh, my poor, dear girl, next in the fated sisterhood of his wives; one false step and into the abyss of the dark you stumbled.\n\nAnd where was she, the latest dead, the Romanian countess who might have thought her blood would survive his depredations? I knew she must be here, in the place that had wound me through the castle towards it on a spool of inexorability. But, at first, I could see no sign of her. Then, for some reason--perhaps some change of atmosphere wrought by my presence--the metal shell of the Iron Maiden emitted a ghostly twang; my feverish imagination might have guessed its occupant was trying to clamber out, though, even in the midst of my rising hysteria, I knew she must be dead to find a home there.\n\nWith trembling fingers, I prised open the front of the upright coffin, with its sculpted face caught in a rictus of pain. Then, overcome, I dropped the key I still held in my other hand. It dropped into the forming pool of her blood.\n\nShe was pierced, not by one but by a hundred spikes, this child of the land of the vampires who seemed so newly dead, so full of blood ... oh God! how recently had he become a widower? How long had he kept her in this obscene cell? Had it been all the time he had courted me, in the clear light of Paris?\n\nI closed the lid of her coffin very gently and burst into a tumult of sobbing that contained both pity for his other victims and also a dreadful anguish to know I, too, was one of them.\n\nThe candles flared, as if in a draught from a door to elsewhere. The light caught the fire opal on my hand so that it flashed, once, with a baleful light, as if to tell me the eye of God--his eye--was upon me. My first thought, when I saw the ring for which I had sold myself to this fate, was, how to escape it.\n\nI retained sufficient presence of mind to snuff out the candles round the bier with my fingers, to gather up my taper, to look around, although shuddering, to ensure I had left behind me no traces of my visit.\n\nI retrieved the key from the pool of blood, wrapped it in my handkerchief to keep my hands clean, and fled the room, slamming the door behind me. It crashed to with a juddering reverberation, like the door of hell.\n\nI could not take refuge in my bedroom, for that retained the memory of his presence trapped in the fathomless silvering of his mirrors. My music room seemed the safest place, although I looked at the picture of Saint Cecilia with a faint dread; what had been the nature of her martyrdom? My mind was in a tumult; schemes for flight jostled with one another ... as soon as the tide receded from the causeway, I would make for the mainland--on foot, running, stumbling; I did not trust that leather-clad chauffeur, nor the well-behaved housekeeper, and I dared not take any of the pale, ghostly maids into my confidence, either, since they were his creatures, all. Once at the village, I would fling myself directly on the mercy of the gendarmerie.\n\nBut--could I trust them, either? His forefathers had ruled this coast for eight centuries, from this castle whose moat was the Atlantic. Might not the police, the advocates, even the judge, all be in his service, turning a common blind eye to his vices since he was milord whose word must be obeyed? Who, on this distant coast, would believe the white-faced girl from Paris who came running to them with a shuddering tale of blood, of fear, of the ogre murmuring in the shadows? Or, rather, they would immediately know it to be true. But were all honour-bound to let me carry it no further.\n\nAssistance. My mother. I ran to the telephone; and the line, of course, was dead.\n\nDead as his wives.\n\nA thick darkness, unlit by any star, still glazed the windows. Every lamp in my room burned, to keep the dark outside, yet it seemed still to encroach on me, to be present beside me but as if masked by my lights, the night like a permeable substance that could seep into my skin. I looked at the precious little clock made from hypocritically innocent flowers long ago, in Dresden; the hands had scarcely moved one single hour forward from when I first descended to that private slaughterhouse of his. Time was his servant, too; it would trap me, here, in a night that would last until he came back to me, like a black sun on a hopeless morning.\n\nAnd yet the time might still be my friend; at that hour, that very hour, he set sail for New York.\n\nTo know that, in a few moments, my husband would have left France calmed my agitation a little. My reason told me I had nothing to fear; the tide that would take him away to the New World would let me out of the imprisonment of the castle. Surely I could easily evade the servants. Anybody can buy a ticket at a railway station. Yet I was still rilled with unease. I opened the lid of the piano; perhaps I thought my own particular magic might help me, now, that I could create a pentacle out of music that would keep me from harm for, if my music had first ensnared him, then might it not also give me the power to free myself from him?\n\nMechanically, I began to play but my fingers were stiff and shaking. At first, I could manage nothing better than the exercises of Czerny but simply the act of playing soothed me and, for solace, for the sake of the harmonious rationality of its sublime mathematics, I searched among his scores until I found The Well-Tempered Clavier. I set myself the therapeutic task of playing all Bach's equations, every one, and, I told myself, if I played them all through without a single mistake--then the morning would find me once more a virgin.\n\nCrash of a dropped stick.\n\nHis silver-headed cane! What else? Sly, cunning, he had returned; he was waiting for me outside the door!\n\nI rose to my feet; fear gave me strength. I flung back my head defiantly.\n\n'Come in!' My voice astonished me by its firmness, its clarity.\n\nThe door slowly, nervously opened and I saw, not the massive, irredeemable bulk of my husband but the slight, stooping figure of the piano-tuner, and he looked far more terrified of me than my mother's daughter would have been of the Devil himself. In the torture chamber, it seemed to me that I would never laugh again; now, helplessly, laugh I did, with relief, and, after a moment's hesitation, the boy's face softened and he smiled a little, almost in shame. Though they were blind, his eyes were singularly sweet.\n\n'Forgive me,' said Jean-Yves. 'I know I've given you grounds for dismissing me, that I should be crouching outside your door at midnight ... but I heard you walking about, up and down--I sleep in a room at the foot of the west tower--and some intuition told me you could not sleep and might, perhaps, pass the insomniac hours at your piano. And I could not resist that. Besides, I stumbled over these--'\n\nAnd he displayed the ring of keys I'd dropped outside my husband's office door, the ring from which one key was missing. I took them from him, looked round for a place to stow them, fixed on the piano stool as if to hide them would protect me. Still he stood smiling at me. How hard it was to make everyday conversation.\n\n'It's perfect,' I said. 'The piano. Perfectly in tune.'\n\nBut he was full of the loquacity of embarrassment, as though I would only forgive him for his impudence if he explained the cause of it thoroughly.\n\n'When I heard you play this afternoon, I thought I'd never heard such a touch. Such technique. A treat for me, to hear a virtuoso! So I crept up to your door now, humbly as a little dog might, madame, and put my ear to the keyhole and listened, and listened--until my stick fell to the floor through a momentary clumsiness of mine, and I was discovered.'\n\nHe had the most touchingly ingenuous smile.\n\n'Perfectly in tune,' I repeated. To my surprise, now I had said it, I found I could not say anything else. I could only repeat: 'In tune ... perfect ... in tune,' over and over again. I saw a dawning surprise in his face. My head throbbed. To see him, in his lovely, blind humanity, seemed to hurt me very piercingly, somewhere inside my breast; his figure blurred, the room swayed about me. After the dreadful revelation of that bloody chamber, it was his tender look that made me faint.\n\nWhen I recovered consciousness, I found I was lying in the piano-tuner's arms and he was tucking the satin cushion from the piano-stool under my head.\n\n'You are in some great distress,' he said. 'No bride should suffer so much, so early in her marriage.'\n\nHis speech had the rhythms of the countryside, the rhythms of the tides.\n\n'Any bride brought to this castle should come ready dressed in mourning, should bring a priest and a coffin with her,' I said.\n\n'What's this?'\n\nIt was too late to keep silent; and if he, too, were one of my husband's creatures, then at least he had been kind to me. So I told him everything, the keys, the interdiction, my disobedience, the room, the rack, the skull, the corpses, the blood.\n\n'I can scarcely believe it,' he said, wondering. 'That man ... so rich; so well-born.'\n\n'Here's proof,' I said and tumbled the fatal key out of my handkerchief on to the silken rug.\n\n'Oh God,' he said. 'I can smell the blood.'\n\nHe took my hand; he pressed his arms about me. Although he was scarcely more than a boy, I felt a great strength flow into me from his touch.\n\n'We whisper all manner of strange tales up and down the coast,' he said.' There was a Marquis, once, who used to hunt young girls on the mainland; he hunted them with dogs, as though they were foxes. My grandfather had it from his grandfather, how the Marquis pulled a head out of his saddle bag and showed it to the blacksmith while the man was shoeing his horse. \"A fine specimen of the genus, brunette, eh, Guillaume?\" And it was the head of the blacksmith's wife.'\n\nBut, in these more democratic times, my husband must travel as far as Paris to do his hunting in the salons. Jean-Yves knew the moment I shuddered.\n\n'Oh, madame! I thought all these were old wives' tales, chattering of fools, spooks to scare bad children into good behaviour! Yet how could you know, a stranger, that the old name for this place is the Castle of Murder?'\n\nHow could I know, indeed? Except that, in my heart, I'd always known its lord would be the death of me.\n\n'Hark!' said my friend suddenly. 'The sea has changed key; it must be near morning, the tide is going down.'\n\nHe helped me up. I looked from the window, towards the mainland, along the causeway where the stones gleamed wetly in the thin light of the end of the night and, with an almost unimaginable horror, a horror the intensity of which I cannot transmit to you, I saw, in the distance, still far away yet drawing moment by moment inexorably nearer, the twin headlamps of his great black car, gouging tunnels through the shifting mist.\n\nMy husband had indeed returned; this time, it was no fancy.\n\n'The key!' said Jean-Yves. 'It must go back on the ring, with the others. As though nothing had happened.'\n\nBut the key was still caked with wet blood and I ran to my bathroom and held it under the hot tap. Crimson water swirled down the basin but, as if the key itself were hurt, the bloody token stuck. The turquoise eyes of the dolphin taps winked at me derisively; they knew my husband had been too clever for me! I scrubbed the stain with my nail brush but still it would not budge. I thought how the car would be rolling silently towards the closed courtyard gate; the more I scrubbed the key, the more vivid grew the stain.\n\nThe bell in the gatehouse would jangle. The porter's drowsy son would push back the patchwork quilt, yawning, pull the shirt over his head, thrust his feet into his sabots ... slowly, slowly; open the door for your master as slowly as you can ...\n\nAnd still the bloodstain mocked the fresh water that spilled from the mouth of the leering dolphin.\n\n'You have no more time,' said Jean-Yves. 'He is here. I know it. I must stay with you.'\n\n'You shall not!' I said. 'Go back to your room, now. Please.'\n\nHe hesitated. I put an edge of steel in my voice, for I knew I must meet my lord alone.\n\n'Leave me!'\n\nAs soon as he had gone, I dealt with the keys and went to my bedroom. The causeway was empty; Jean-Yves was correct, my husband had already entered the castle. I pulled the curtains close, stripped off my clothes and pulled the bedcurtains round me as a pungent aroma of Russian leather assured me my husband was once again beside me.\n\n'Dearest!'\n\nWith the most treacherous, lascivious tenderness, he kissed my eyes, and, mimicking the new bride newly wakened, I flung my arms around him, for on my seeming acquiescence depended my salvation.\n\n'Da Silva of Rio outwitted me,' he said wryly.' My New York agent telegraphed Le Havre and saved me a wasted journey. So we may resume our interrupted pleasures, my love.'\n\nI did not believe one word of it. I knew I had behaved exactly according to his desires; had he not bought me so that I should do so? I had been tricked into my own betrayal to that illimitable darkness whose source I had been compelled to seek in his absence and, now that I had met that shadowed reality of his that came to life only in the presence of its own atrocities, I must pay the price of my new knowledge. The secret of Pandora's box; but he had given me the box, himself, knowing I must learn the secret. I had played a game in which every move was governed by a destiny as oppressive and omnipotent as himself, since that destiny was himself; and I had lost. Lost at that charade of innocence and vice in which he had engaged me. Lost, as the victim loses to the executioner.\n\nHis hand brushed my breast, beneath the sheet. I strained my nerves yet could not help but flinch from the intimate touch, for it made me think of the piercing embrace of the Iron Maiden and of his lost lovers in the vault. When he saw my reluctance, his eyes veiled over and yet his appetite did not diminish. His tongue ran over red lips already wet. Silent, mysterious, he moved away from me to draw off his jacket. He took the gold watch from his waistcoat and laid it on the dressing table, like a good bourgeois; scooped out his raiding loose change and now--oh God!--makes a great play of patting his pockets officiously, puzzled lips pursed, searching for something that has been mislaid. Then turns to me with a ghastly, a triumphant smile.\n\n'But of course! I gave the keys to you!'\n\n'Your keys? Why, of course. Here, they're under the pillow; wait a moment--what--Ah! No ... now, where can I have left them? I was whiling away the evening without you at the piano, I remember. Of course! The music room!'\n\nBrusquely he flung my n\u00e9glig\u00e9 of antique lace on the bed.\n\n'Go and get them.'\n\n'Now? This moment? Can't it wait until morning, my darling?'\n\nI forced myself to be seductive. I saw myself, pale, pliant as a plant that begs to be trampled underfoot, a dozen vulnerable, appealing girls reflected in as many mirrors, and I saw how he almost failed to resist me. If he had come to me in bed, I would have strangled him, then.\n\nBut he half-snarled: 'No. It won't wait. Now.'\n\nThe unearthly light of dawn filled the room; had only one previous dawn broken upon me in that vile place? And there was nothing for it but to go and fetch the keys from the music stool and pray he would not examine them too closely, pray to God his eyes would fail him, that he might be struck blind.\n\nWhen I came back into the bedroom carrying the bunch of keys that jangled at every step like a curious musical instrument, he was sitting on the bed in his immaculate shirtsleeves, his head sunk in his hands.\n\nAnd it seemed to me he was in despair.\n\nStrange. In spite of my fear of him, that made me whiter than my wrap, I felt there emanate from him, at that moment, a stench of absolute despair, rank and ghastly, as if the lilies that surrounded him had all at once begun to fester, or the Russian leather of his scent were reverting to the elements of flayed hide and excrement of which it was composed. The chthonic gravity of his presence exerted a tremendous pressure on the room, so that the blood pounded in my ears as if we had been precipitated to the bottom of the sea, beneath the waves that pounded against the shore.\n\nI held my life in my hands amongst those keys and, in a moment, would place it between his well-manicured fingers. The evidence of that bloody chamber had showed me I could expect no mercy. Yet, when he raised his head and stared at me with his blind, shuttered eyes as though he did not recognize me, I felt a terrified pity for him, for this man who lived in such strange, secret places that, if I loved him enough to follow him, I should have to die.\n\nThe atrocious loneliness of that monster!\n\nThe monocle had fallen from his face. His curling mane was disordered, as if he had run his hands through it in his distraction. I saw how he had lost his impassivity and was now filled with suppressed excitement. The hand he stretched out for those counters in his game of love and death shook a little; the face that turned towards me contained a sombre delirium that seemed to me compounded of a ghastly, yes, shame but also of a terrible, guilty joy as he slowly ascertained how I had sinned.\n\nThat tell-tale stain had resolved itself into a mark the shape and brilliance of the heart on a playing card. He disengaged the key from the ring and looked at it for a while, solitary, brooding.\n\n'It is the key that leads to the kingdom of the unimaginable,' he said. His voice was low and had in it the timbre of certain great cathedral organs that seem, when they are played, to be conversing with God.\n\nI could not restrain a sob.\n\n'Oh, my love, my little love who brought me a white gift of music,' he said, almost as if grieving. 'My little love, you'll never know how much I hate daylight!\"\n\nThen he sharply ordered: 'Kneel!'\n\nI knelt before him and he pressed the key lightly to my forehead, held it there for a moment. I felt a faint tingling of the skin and, when I involuntarily glanced at myself in the mirror, I saw the heart-shaped stain had transferred itself to my forehead, to the space between the eyebrows, like the caste mark of a brahmin woman. Or the mark of Cain. And now the key gleamed as freshly as if it had just been cut. He clipped it back on the ring, emitting that same, heavy sigh as he had done when I said that I would marry him.\n\n'My virgin of the arpeggios, prepare yourself for martyrdom.'\n\n'What form shall it take?' I said.\n\n'Decapitation,' he whispered, almost voluptuously. 'Go and bathe yourself; put on that white dress you wore to hear Tristan and the necklace that prefigures your end. And I shall take myself off to the armoury, my dear, to sharpen my great-grandfather's ceremonial sword.'\n\n'The servants?'\n\n'We shall have absolute privacy for our last rites; I have already dismissed them. If you look out of the window you can see them going to the mainland.'\n\nIt was now the full, pale light of morning; the weather was grey, indeterminate, the sea had an oily, sinister look, a gloomy day on which to die. Along the causeway I could see trouping every maid and scullion, every pot-boy and pan-scourer, valet, laundress and vassal who worked in that great house, most on foot, a few on bicycles. The faceless housekeeper trudged along with a great basket in which, I guessed, she'd stowed as much as she could ransack from the larder. The Marquis must have given the chauffeur leave to borrow the motor for the day, for it went last of all, at a stately pace, as though the procession were a cortege and the car already bore my coffin to the mainland for. burial.\n\nBut I knew no good Breton earth would cover me, like a last, faithful lover; I had another fate.\n\n'I have given them all a day's holiday, to celebrate our wedding,' he said. And smiled.\n\nHowever hard I stared at the receding company, I could see no sign of Jean-Yves, our latest servant, hired but the preceding morning.\n\n'Go, now. Bathe yourself; dress yourself. The lustratory ritual and the ceremonial robing; after that, the sacrifice. Wait in the music room until I telephone for you. No, my dear!' And he smiled, as I started, recalling the line was dead.' One may call inside the castle just as much as one pleases; but, outside--never.'\n\nI scrubbed my forehead with the nail brush as I had scrubbed the key but this red mark would not go away, either, no matter what I did, and I knew I should wear it until I died, though that would not be long. Then I went to my dressing room and put on that white muslin shift, costume of a victim of an auto-da-f\u00e9, he had bought me to listen to the Liebestod in. Twelve young women combed out twelve listless sheaves of brown hair in the mirrors; soon, there would be none. The mass of lilies that surrounded me exhaled, now, the odour of their withering. They looked like the trumpets of the angels of death.\n\nOn the dressing table, coiled like a snake about to strike, lay the ruby choker.\n\nAlready almost lifeless, cold at heart, I descended the spiral staircase to the music room but there I found I had not been abandoned.\n\n'I can be of some comfort to you,' the boy said.' Though not much use.'\n\nWe pushed the piano stool in front of the open window so that, for as long as I could, I would be able to smell the ancient, reconciling smell of the sea that, in time, will cleanse everything, scour the old bones white, wash away all the stains. The last little chambermaid had trotted along the causeway long ago and now the tide, fated as I, came tumbling in, the crisp wavelets splashing on the old stones.\n\n'You do not deserve this,' he said.\n\n'Who can say what I deserve or no?' I said. 'I've done nothing; but that may be sufficient reason for condemning me.'\n\n'You disobeyed him,' he said. 'That is sufficient reason for him to punish you.'\n\n'I only did what he knew I would.'\n\n'Like Eve,' he said.\n\nThe telephone rang a shrill imperative. Let it ring. But my lover lifted me up and set me on my feet; I knew I must answer it. The receiver felt heavy as earth.\n\n'The courtyard. Immediately.'\n\nMy lover kissed me, he took my hand. He would come with me if I would lead him. Courage. When I thought of courage, I thought of my mother. Then I saw a muscle in my lover's face quiver.\n\n'Hoofbeats!' he said.\n\nI cast one last, desperate glance from the window and, like a miracle, I saw a horse and rider galloping at a vertiginous speed along the causeway, though the waves crashed, now, high as the horse's fetlocks. A rider, her black skirts tucked up around her waist so she could ride hard and fast, a crazy, magnificent horsewoman in widow's weeds.\n\nAs the telephone rang again.\n\n'Am I to wait all morning?'\n\nEvery moment, my mother drew nearer.\n\n'She will be too late,' Jean-Yves said and yet he could not restrain a note of hope that, though it must be so, yet it might not be so.\n\nThe third, intransigent call.\n\n'Shall I come up to heaven to fetch you down, Saint Cecilia? You wicked woman, do you wish me to compound my crimes by desecrating the marriage bed?'\n\nSo I must go to the courtyard where my husband waited in his London-tailored trousers and the shirt from Turnbull and Asser, beside the mounting block, with, in his hand, the sword which his great-grandfather had presented to the little corporal, in token of surrender to the Republic, before he shot himself. The heavy sword, unsheathed, grey as that November morning, sharp as childbirth, mortal.\n\nWhen my husband saw my companion, he observed: 'Let the blind lead the blind, eh? But does even a youth as besotted as you are think she was truly blind to her own desires when she took my ring? Give it me back, whore.'\n\nThe fires in the opal had all died down. I gladly slipped it from my finger and, even in that dolorous place, my heart was lighter for the lack of it. My husband took it lovingly and lodged it on the tip of his little finger; it would go no further.\n\n'It will serve me for a dozen more fianc\u00e9es,' he said. 'To the block, woman. No--leave the boy; I shall deal with him later, utilizing a less exalted instrument than the one with which I do my wife the honour of her immolation, for do not fear that in death you will be divided.'\n\nSlowly, slowly, one foot before the other, I crossed the cobbles. The longer I dawdled over my execution, the more time it gave the avenging angel to descend ...\n\n'Don't loiter, girl! Do you think I shall lose appetite for the meal if you are so long about serving it? No; I shall grow hungrier, more ravenous with each moment, more cruel ... Run to me, run! I have a place prepared for your exquisite corpse in my display of flesh!'\n\nHe raised the sword and cut bright segments from the air with it, but still I lingered although my hopes, so recently raised, now began to flag. If she is not here by now, her horse must have stumbled on the causeway, have plunged into the sea ... One thing only made me glad; that my lover would not see me die.\n\nMy husband laid my branded forehead on the stone and, as he had done once before, twisted my hair into a rope and drew it away from my neck.\n\n'Such a pretty neck,' he said with what seemed to be a genuine, retrospective tenderness. 'A neck like the stem of a young plant.'\n\nI felt the silken bristle of his beard and the wet touch of his lips as he kissed my nape. And, once again, of my apparel I must retain only my gems; the sharp blade ripped my dress in two and it fell from me. A little green moss, growing in the crevices of the mounting block, would be the last thing I should see in all the world.\n\nThe whizz of that heavy sword.\n\nAnd--a great battering and pounding at the gate, the jangling of the bell, the frenzied neighing of a horse! The unholy silence of the place shattered in an instant. The blade did not descend, the necklace did not sever, my head did not roll. For, for an instant, the beast wavered in his stroke, a sufficient split second of astonished indecision to let me spring upright and dart to the assistance of my lover as he struggled sightlessly with the great bolts that kept her out.\n\nThe Marquis stood transfixed, utterly dazed, at a loss. It must have been as if he had been watching his beloved Tristan for the twelfth, the thirteenth time and Tristan stirred, then leapt from his bier in the last act, announced in a jaunty aria interposed from Verdi that bygones were bygones, crying over spilt milk did nobody any good and, as for himself, he proposed to live happily ever after. The puppet master, open-mouthed, wide-eyed, impotent at the last, saw his dolls break free of their strings, abandon the rituals he had ordained for them since time began and start to live for themselves; the king, aghast, witnesses the revolt of his pawns.\n\nYou never saw such a wild thing as my mother, her hat seized by the winds and blown out to sea so that her hair was her white mane, her black lisle legs exposed to the thigh, her skirts tucked round her waist, one hand on the reins of the rearing horse while the other clasped my father's service revolver and, behind her, the breakers of the savage, indifferent sea, like the witnesses of a furious justice. And my husband stood stock-still, as if she had been Medusa, the sword still raised over his head as in those clockwork tableaux of Bluebeard that you see in glass cases at fairs.\n\nAnd then it was as though a curious child pushed his centime into the slot and set all in motion. The heavy, bearded figure roared out aloud, braying with fury, and, wielding the honourable sword as if it were a matter of death or glory, charged us, all three.\n\nOn her eighteenth birthday, my mother had disposed of a man-eating tiger that had ravaged the villages in the hills north of Hanoi. Now, without a moment's hesitation, she raised my father's gun, took aim and put a single, irreproachable bullet through my husband's head.\n\nWe lead a quiet life, the three of us. I inherited, of course, enormous wealth but we have given most of it away to various charities. The castle is now a school for the blind, though I pray that the children who live there are not haunted by any sad ghosts looking for, crying for, the husband who will never return to the bloody chamber, the contents of which are buried or burned, the door sealed.\n\nI felt I had a right to retain sufficient funds to start a little music school here, on the outskirts of Paris, and we do well enough. Sometimes we can even afford to go to the Op\u00e9ra, though never to sit in a box, of course. We know we are the source of many whisperings and much gossip but the three of us know the truth of it and mere chatter can never harm us. I can only bless the--what shall I call it?--the maternal telepathy that sent my mother running headlong from the telephone to the station after I had called her, that night. I never heard you cry before, she said, by way of explanation. Not when you were happy. And who ever cried because of gold bath taps?\n\nThe night train, the one I had taken; she lay in her berth, sleepless as I had been. When she could not find a taxi at that lonely halt, she borrowed old Dobbin from a bemused farmer, for some internal urgency told her that she must reach me before the incoming tide sealed me away from her for ever. My poor old nurse, left scandalized at home--what? interrupt milord on his honeymoon?--she died soon after. She had taken so much secret pleasure in the fact that her little girl had become a marquise; and now here I was, scarcely a penny the richer, widowed at seventeen in the most dubious circumstances and busily engaged in setting up house with a piano-tuner. Poor thing, she passed away in a sorry state of disillusion! But I do believe my mother loves him as much as I do.\n\nNo paint nor powder, no matter how thick or white, can mask that red mark on my forehead; I am glad he cannot see it--not for fear of his revulsion, since I know he sees me clearly with his heart--but, because it spares my shame.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1026700", "artist_names": "Rod
