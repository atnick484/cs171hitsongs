We got plenty guns\nKeep two lil' savages on X and they gon' get it done\nAnd them hollow tips do surgery, they gon' clip his lungs\nIt was goin' down on the set, that's when this shit was fun\nI just

again\n'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man\nI'd be the man\nI'd be the man\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey'd say I hustled, put in the work\nThey wouldn\u2019t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve\nWhat I was wearing, if I was rude\nCould all be separated from my good ideas and power moves\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd they would toast to me, oh, let the players play\nI\u2019d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so sick of running as fast as I can\nWondering if I\u2019d get there quicker if I was a man\nAnd I'm so sick of them coming at me again\n'Cause if I was a

stars\nI didn't listen very\u2005hard\nWhen\u2005she told me\u2005she was crazy from the start\nShe\u2005put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)\nI said she was a work of art (Work of art)\nI didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)\nWhen she told me she was crazy from the start\n\n[Verse 1]\nI drive down open roads so slow\nHere comes a train, I'll let it go\nAin't got nobody on my phone\nDon't like being all alone (Don't like being all alone)\nNot good at keeping with the trends (No, no)\nToo good at welcoming amends\nIt's been a while since I've heard her say\nThat we were more than friends (Oh)\nOh, I, I-I-I, know a lot is going on\nBut girl, please tell me\nAnd I'll let you be\nAre you still with me or not?\n[Chorus]\nShe put my name with yellow hearts\nHer favorite color, like the stars\nI didn't listen very hard\nWhen she told me she was crazy from the start\nShe put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)\nI said she was a work of art (Work of art)\nI didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)\nWhen she told me she was crazy from the start\n\n[Refrain]\nShe put yellow hearts around my name\nI thought they were all just the same\nTo you, what do they really mean?\nHave you only been playing games?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm by the garden with the carpenter bees\nLike I'm Bob Ross-in' with a Harden beard\nTaking it all in like I got no issues in my nature\nPrimroses blooming in the night\nBirds wanna take me on a flight\nAppreciating my land 'fore it turns into a glacier\nChasers are of no good use\nThis taste will be long endured\nWhy'd you have to go so soon?\nI thought this was as good as new\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nShe put yellow hearts around my name\nI thought they were all just the same\nTo you, what do they really mean?\nHave you only been playing games?\n\n[Chorus]\nShe put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)\nHer favorite color, like the stars (Like the stars)\nI didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)\nWhen she told me she was crazy from the start\nShe put my name with yellow hearts (She put yellow hearts around my name)\nI said she was a work of art (I thought they were all just the same)\nI didn't listen very hard (To you, what do they really mean?)\nWhen she told me she was crazy from the start (Have you only been playing games?)\n\n[Outro]\nHave you only been playing games?\nNo,

the rules\nI drew inside the lines\nI never asked for anything that wasn't mine\nI waited patiently for my time\nBut when it finally came\nHe called her name\nAnd now I feel this overwhelming pain\nI mean it's in my veins\nI mean it's in my brain\nMy thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train\nI'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame\nI know exactly who to blame\n[Chorus]\nI never thought of myself as mean\nI always thought that I'd be the queen\nAnd there's no in between\n'Cause if I can't have that\nThen I would be the leader of the dark\nAnd the bad\nNow there's a devil on my shoulder\nWhere the angels used to be\nAnd it's calling me the queen\n\n[Verse 2]\nBeing nice was my pastime\nBut I've been hurt for the last time\nAnd I won't ever let another person take advantage of me\nThe anger burns my skin, third-degree\nNow my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea\nThere's nobody getting close to me\nThey're gonna bow to the Evil Queen\nYour nightmare's my dream\nJust wait until they fall to my wicked schemes\n\n[Chorus]\nI never thought of myself as mean\nI always thought that I'd be the queen\nAnd there's no in between\n'Cause if I can't have that\nThen I would be the leader of the dark\nAnd the bad\nNow there's a devil on my shoulder\nWhere the angels used to be\nAnd he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)\nThe queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)\n(Calling me, calling me)\nThe queen of mean\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nSomething's pulling me\nIt's so magnetic\nMy body is moving\nUnsure where I'm headed\nAll of my senses have left me defenseless\nThis darkness around me\nIs promising vengeance\nThe price that I'm willing to pay is expensive\nThere's nothing to lose\nWhen you're lonely and friendless\nSo my only interest is showing this princess\nThat I am the queen\nAnd my reign will be endless (Endless)\n\n[Bridge]\nI want what I deserve\nI want to rule the world\nSit back and watch them learn\nIt's finally my turn\n\n[Chorus]\nIf they want a villain for a queen\nI'm gonna be one like they've never seen\nI'll show them what it means\nNow that I am that\nI will be the ruler of the dark and the bad\n'Cause the devil's on my shoulder\nWhere the angels used to be\nAnd he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)\n(Calling me, calling me)\nThe queen of mean (Calling me, calling

drip too hard, ayy\n(Run that back, Turbo)\nYeah, ayy, look\n\n[Verse 1: Drake & Gunna]\nI bring up money, they change up the topic\nI got a 19 and it fold in my pocket\nShe gave me her number, now I gotta block it\nI'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit\nClean that shit up and I give it right back to him\nIf I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him\nI wanna be there when somebody catches him\nI want a witness to see that shit\nMan, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap\nI bring up hits and they change up the topic\nI got a 19 and it fold in my pocket\nOne hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'\nThey wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it\nYou told a story like shorty was feelin' you\nShe told a story like she split the bill with you\nLook at my story, man, no one could write it\nNow I see a million, I don't get excited\nI might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way\nAin't no real sense in me goin' the other way\nCannot be seen in that shit from the other day\nVirgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway\nPlease don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna\nAnd Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her\nNext time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another\nYou niggas fell off and you'll never recover\n[Verse 2: Gunna]\nPoured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble\nYoung Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double\nHit Eliantte and left with a puddle\nIt's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble\nRun up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle\nSign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother\nPainted all black, the interior butter\nI drip like a leak and that's word to my mother\nYeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter\nFamily a beast, we gon' eat us a supper\nMy dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'\nSound like it could be Drip Season this summer\nAin't no comparin' 'cause we number one\nIn black and white Chanel, I look like a nun\nThe police in shock, don't know who got a gun\nDon't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan\nIt's winter, I still took the top off the don\nThe kid was surprised that my trunk in the front\nI know you a upset they don't shine in the sun\nCuban link look like a box of crayons\nI'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne\nI told the judge, \"Fuck it\", I'm goin' on the run\nYou want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond\n\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nAnd I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides\nWe get M's in by the shoe size\nI don't fuck with y'all type of kind\nI done seen all y\u2019all dickride\nBread winner like I'm Kevin Gates\nAnd I swear to God, I don't get tired\nFrom the trenches, now I'm goin'\nSpend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Lil Baby]\nDon't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna\nRunnin' this shit, only been out two summers\nThat 4x4 truck, I post 300\nBoy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'\nAin't got no feelings, I'm here for the money\nTreat every club like a Magic on Monday\nNiggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted\nGave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach\nBy the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number\nCap to her friend like I been on her bumper\nLately, I been the topic of discussion\nDraco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia\nBad vibes at my show like I'm Usher\nIf she tell me \"No\" once, I won't even touch it\nAll I do is get her out here, abortion\nAct like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'\nDrizzy hit me up like he got another one\nMoney ain't even came in from the other one\nFuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up\nSeem like everything I get on a number one\nThey tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up\nEver catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up\nEvery city we go to, it be lit as fuck\nTryna put the police on us, get rid of us\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nAnd I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides\nWe get M's in by the shoe size\nI don't fuck with y'all type of kind\nI done seen all y\u2019all dickride\nBread winner like I'm Kevin

y'all don't worry nothin'\nAnd I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan\nAnd shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans\nUh, twenty bands, rain dance\nWe could either rain check or we can make plans\nPockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this\nIt's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\nLocked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em\nYou'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open\nLine around the corner, line 'em up the block and over\nSometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus\nMy shades, Dior, my pants, velour\nCreate, explore, expand, conquer\n[Chorus: Skepta]\nI came, I saw, I came, I saw\nI praise the Lord, then break the law\nI take what's mine, then take some more\nIt rains, it pours, it rains,

pack, the loose, the hard (Yeah)\nI listened to X, I peeped the bars (Yeah)\nThe snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs\nThe game's a trap, protect your heart (Yeah)\nI waited in line, return, refine\nThe new design, it's time to shine\nTo shine, to shine, to shine, to shine\nI hustle, I flex, the world is mine\nSo please believe, allow the greaze\nThese niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze\nI make the devil go weak the knees\nYou hate, you're lame, your loss\n\n[Chorus: Skepta]\nI came, I saw, I came, I saw\nI praise the Lord, then break the law\nI take what's mine, then take

his own game, honey, take the cash\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Amy Noonan]\nOoh, and what a lucky girl you will be\nBut no, he didn\u2019t do jack for me\nI want a bean with a beanstalk\nAnd if the magic

getting money chicks come around\nNiggas start hatin' who's holdin' you down\nAll this ice I'm just livin' the life\nBad bitches want me, give me head like lice\nHit club LIV in a rush\nPockets so swole I think they finna bust\nAce in my hand and a 45 tuck\nMoney coming down codeine pourin' up\nSmokin on some dope, always on a float\n20 years in niggas callin me the G.O.A.T\nMoney adding up you haters going broke\nStill in the game while you niggas ridin' oak\nSee me showin' out they muggin' I don't give a fuck\nHow I start my morning off a zip and a double cup\nHating ass niggas, y'all behind me\nBall so hard they want to fine me\nJuicy J, Taylor Gang\nI been rich since the 90's\n\n[Chorus: Young Jeezy]\nEvery time I go out, you know I gotta show out\nEvery time I go out, you know I

band-tastic, white girls like Anne Hathaway\nWay going, way out, they wait for my bandwagon\nShe let me bang and I ain't got a bandana\nOoh (Freaky) that's just how I move\nFast girls, fast money, no

whereabouts\nCopy that, you're acting strange\nSo tell me what is going on\nSo heavy I bet\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)\nI'm hella positive for real, I'm all good no\nI'm fine (and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)\nIt's gotten complicated that's for sure\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you can see it my eyes, you can read on my lips\nI'm trying to get a hold on this\nAnd

foul trouble\nThey can't solve my game; I'm a hard puzzle\nBut I keep three dimes - that's a triple double\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Inferno]\nSick with it\nHustle for the rock I go-go get it\nI'm in it to win it, 919 baby we represent it\nAnd I don't ball hog we got our whole team in it\nSee you just dribble but ain't ever got the heart to finish\nCan't put me out the game I'm in that thing from start to finish\nAnd if I can't drive the lane then best believe I'm about to dish it\nSideline drifting now, I'm gliding down the baseline\nAbout to do a big slam catch me on them inches\nComing from the south side\nThe expectations of us is that we will not rise\nAnd still we prove them wrong, we flexing cause we hot guys\nBring life to the game we will not die\nHa, yeah\nStand tall, yeah you call that the great Wall\nAll I do is ball I get up I can take a fall\nI'm hungry for the top, call it lunchtime\nGame winning shot, yeah it's clutch time\nYou might also like[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Lee]\n(Let's do it)\nOh yeah we balling, balling until we falling\nUntil the last second I'm guessing we gone be brawling\nCause Kentucky here to win, not to watch you play\nWhole world do the dance, say what up UK\nBetter take him out the game, cause they say that boy insane\nWhen he coming down the lane, trying to catch a bang bang\nFirst we flex, show the muscle then jigg on them\nFor the small play, let DeMarcus Cousins get big on them\nYou ain't handling nothing I'm about to catch a steal on them\nPass it to the point, crossover and I'm still on them\nCrowd going bananas so you know that's why we peel on them\nAnd we from the \"R\", ain't nothing like being real on them\nJump shot deadly, you know that we kill on them\nTime to grab the money ball, about to shoot a bill on them\nYeah, North Cal. we gonna show them how to do it\nDo the John Wall it ain't really nothing to it\n\n[Hook:]13Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/92785",

ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT\n\nA million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.\n\nThe insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down the road.\n\nINT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT\n\nThe DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers, smearing the remains all over.\n\nDRIVER\nGoddamn bugs.\nThe camera shows the back of the van, where seven illegal immigrants wait. The driver squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, and then sees something worse up ahead. Headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.\n\nHe bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van.\n\nDRIVER (CONT'D)\nOh shit! Deja me hablar. Oh crap!\n\nEXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT\n\nThe van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue four doors with \"INS\" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward and comes to the window.\n\nThe DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also government issue, looks at him and sighs.\n\nAGENT JANUS\nWell. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where you comin' from?\n\nDRIVER\nI was fishing in Cuernavaca.\n\nAGENT JANUS\nSure you were. What do you say we have a look at your catch, huh? [opens the door] Come on.\n\nAT THE BACK OF THE VAN,\n\nthe Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head.\nAGENT JANUS\nMe, I woulda thrown 'em back.\n(to the passengers, in Spanish)\nVamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!\n\nThey pile out of the van.\n\nAGENT JANUS (CONT'D)\nWhat do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna\nneed it.\n\nAnother car is approaching, fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several Agents pull their weapons.\n\nThe new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.\n\nTWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents.\n\nKAY\nWe'll take it from here.\n\nAGENT JANUS\nWho the hell are you?\n\nKay and Dee flash some form of ID.\n\nKAY\nINS Division 6.\nAGENT JANUS\nDivision 6? I never heard of Division 6.\n\nKAY\nReally?\n\nKay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nWhat're we thinking, Dee?\n\nDEE\nTough call, Kay.\n\nHe walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in subtitled Spanish.\n\nKAY\n!Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey!\n(What's up, how are you?)\nAbuela, no se preocupe, . Bienvenida a los Estados Unidos.\n(Don't worry grandma. Welcome to the United States.)\nA donde vas? Nogales? Buscando trabajo, no? Tu, lo mismo?\n(Where are you going? Nogales?  Looking for work?  You too?)\nY tu? Es un placer verle aqui.\n(And you? It's a pleasure seeing you here.)\n\nOne by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay's calm demeanor. When he reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nQue dices si te rompo la cara?\n(What do you say if I break your face?)\n\nThe Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a hand on the Guy's shoulder.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nEs muy feo, no? Y no hablas ni una palabra del Espa\u00f1ol!\n(You're very ugly, aren't you? You don't speak a word of Spanish!)\n\nAgain, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nWe got a winner here, Dee\n\nDEE  (also laughing)\nOh, I know!\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\n(to the others)\nLos restos estan libres a irse. Largense!\n(The rest of you are free to go. Scram!)\n\nAGENT JANUS\nNo se mueven!\n(Don't move!)\n\nKAY\nTomen el camion, y vayeuse.\n(Get on the road and go.)\n\nAGENT JANUS\nSir! Sir, you can't just --\n\nKAY\nDon't \"Sir\" me! You have no idea who you're dealing with!\n\nSilence on the road. The Driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the van. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\n(to Janus)\nWe're gonna have a little chat with our friend here. You boys can hit the road ... and keep on protecting us from dangerous\naliens.\n\nKay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise, leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway.\n\nAGENT JANUS\nYou ever heard of Division 6?\n\n2ND INS AGENT\nThere is no Division 6. This is bullshit.\n\nAGENT JANUS\nYeah.\n\nEXT. DESERT CLEARING - NIGHT\n\nKay and Dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush.\n\nKAY\nLooks like you jumped off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet dollars to pesos that you're not from anywhere near here.\n\nHe pulls out a knife, and cuts the man's poncho. The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is underneath -- an amphibian/reptile with two independent eyes and he also appeared to have a shell on his back, which had six small arms and hands. The only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the humanesque \"head,\"  which he still lamely holds in one of his hands. It's propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions\nas he holds it.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nMikey?!\n\nMIKEY replies -- an unfathomable combination of GRUNTS, SQUEAKS, and saliva.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nMikey?!  When did they let you out of jail?\n\nMikey replies.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nPolitical refugee. Right.\n\nDEE\nYou know how many treaties articles you've just violated?\n\nMikey makes a lame SQUEAK.\n\nKAY\nOne?\n\nDEE\nTry seven.\n\nMikey continues to talk.\n\nKAY\n(off Mikey's objections)\nThat's enough, Mikey. Hand me that head.\n\nMikey delivers the head prop.\n\nKAY\nNow put up your arms and all your flippers.\n\nAs Mike continues to talk, Janus is climbing a hill behind them. He lets out a terrified GASP. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall\nstalk, whips around. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just over the rise, staring in frozen amazement. As the eye returns to place...\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nAh, shit.\n\nMikey gets mad and changes into an angry stance, with all flippers shaking this, and gets very mad. He knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus, SCREECHING a horrible Space Bastard screech as Agent Janus SCREAMS and freezes, terrified.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nDee! Shoot him!\n\nDee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell out of his hand as he hit the ground.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nDee!\n\nKay drops the head, puts his hand inside the jacket. Mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly. He steps on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide open --\n\n-- there is a SIZZLING sound, a brilliant white flash --\n\n-- and Mikey ERUPTS in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the ground, the trees, and Agent Janus' face. Behind where Mikey was, Kay stands, smoking weapon in hand, and sighs.\n\nEXT. DESERT CLEARING -- NIGHT\n\nJanus walks further into the clearing. Janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.\n\nAGENT JANUS\nTh -- th -- th --\n\nKAY\n(helping)\n\"That.\"\n\nAGENT JANUS\nThat wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --\n\nKAY\nHuman, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on you there, pal.\n\nThe INS AGENTS pull their guns and run toward the rise.\n\nKAY\nOkay, everybody, situation's under control, calm down. If you'll just give me your attention for a moment I'll tell you what happened.\n\nFrom over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nThis is called a \"neuralyzer.\" A gift from some friends from out of town. The red eye here isolates and measures the electronic\nimpulses in your brain. More specifically, the ones for memory.\n\nBehind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses, come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nFellas, give me a splay burn around the perimeter with holes on the perimeter, please; holes at 40, 60, and 80 meters. Right here! Thank you!\n\nTONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the Men in Black. The Men in Black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.\n\n2ND INS AGENT\nWhat in the hell is going on?!\n\nKay moves the dials on the Neuralyzer's back.\n\nKAY\nExcellent question. The answer you're looking for lies right here.\n\nJANUS\nWho are you, really?\n\nKAY\nReally? [puts on sunglasses] I'm just a figment of your\nimagination.\n\nHe holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay  pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nGod, we're a gullible breed.\n\nKay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming around, as if awakening from a concussion.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nI mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be alive after a blast like that.\n\nThe Agents look around, confused.\n\nAGENT JANUS\nWhat -- blast?\n\nKAY\nUnderground gas vein, genius. You guys need to exercise more caution before discharging your firearms.\n\nHe jabs a finger into Janus' chest.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nEspecially you.\n\nDee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away from the group and finds him. He sits down next to him.\n\nDEE\nI'm sorry. About...back there.\n\nKAY\nHappens.\n\nDEE\nDidn't used to.\n\nHe holds up his hands, which tremble with age.\n\nDEE (CONT'D)\nThe spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of me...\n\nHe looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.\n\nDEE (CONT'D)\nThey're beautiful, aren't they?\n\nKAY\nWhat?\n\nDEE\nThe stars. We never just -- look. Anymore. (back to Kay) I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase. I will miss the chase.\n\nKay puts the sunglasses, pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.\n\nKAY\nNo. You won't.\n\nEXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT\n\nA shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure. WE PAN DOWN TO...\n\nA pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME.\n\nA new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.\n\nEdwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a chain under his shirt.\n\nEDWARDS\nStop! NYPD!\n\nHe continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS, overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air.\n\nCOP\nAll yours, Edwards!\n\nThe Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.\n\nTRACK WITH EDWARDS AND THE PERP\n\nAs they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties. The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first Street below.\n\nEDWARDS is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second. He, too, hurdles the guard rail and lands on...\n\nEXT. 41ST STREET AND PARK AVENUE - NIGHT\n\nA DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown traffic. The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS, and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.\n\nEDWARDS pushes through the crowd...\n\nEDWARDS\nWhat the hell? It just be raining black people in New York.\n\nWith the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs out through the side door.\n\nHe spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street.\n\nEdwards spots one of those New York Post delivery trucks, the kind with the open back door, rumbling by.  He runs and jumps into the back.\n\nEXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT\n\nTHE PERP, meanwhile, is running at top speed, when Edwards glides into frame and pushes him towards a wall.\n\nEDWARDS\nDo you see this? N.Y.P.D.! It means I will knock your punk-ass down!\n\nThe Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.\n\nPERP\nHe's coming! He's coming!\n\nEDWARDS\nAnd when he gets here, I'll kick his ass too.\n\nEdwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp pulls out his WEAPON, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand. THE WEAPON smashes into the ground and explodes in fire.\n\nEDWARDS\nYou trying to catch a beat down?\n\nAs Edwards tries to ram his head on the wall, The Perp walks on it to backflip and land safely on his feet and take off again. Edwards hits the wall, and then goes runs after him.\n\nThe Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM. Edwards tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the Perp is gone.\n\nEXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- NIGHT\n\nEdwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it, and in the next instant...\n\nThe Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of the Guggenheim. He scrambles up and over the ledge.\n\nEdward reacts. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and runs inside.\n\nHe runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim.\n\nEXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- ROOF -- NIGHT\n\nOn the roof, the PERP reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and CRUNCHES to the gravel surface. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's locked.\n\nHe tugs on another. It's locked too. He pulls on a third. It swings open --\n\n-- revealing EDWARDS on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon at the Perp.\n\nEDWARDS\nWassup?\n\nPERP\nHe's coming! He's coming because I failed, and now he'll kill me too!\n\nEDWARDS\nYou pissing everybody off today, huh?\n\nPERP\nYou don't understand. Your world is gonna end.\n\nThe Perp blinks with another set of translucent, milky white eyelids, from the side of his eyeballs. Edwards is thrown off.\n\nEDWARDS\nWhat are you?\n\nThe Perp backpedals, toward the edge of the roof.\n\nEDWARDS\nWatch that ledge.Watch it.Come down. We'll get those eyes fixed.Don't even worry about it. Wait a minute. Let me talk to you!\n\nBut the Perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and starts to fall over, crashing to the ground.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT\n\nA lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm country. A truck is parked in the driveway, and a cow grazes next to it. A Man (EDGAR)'s voice is heard.\n\nEDGAR (O.S.)\nI go out, I work my butt off to make a living, all I want is to come home to a nice clean house with a nice fat steak on\nthe table, but instead I get this -- this -- I don't even know what you call this!\n\nIn the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields. But something strange is happening with one of those stars -- it's getting bigger.\n\nEDGAR (O.S.)\nI'll tell you what it looks like, it looks like poison. Don't you take that away, I'm eating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't it?!\n\nNo, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving. Toward us. Fast. It goes from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way into fruit metaphors. The cow starts to walk away from the truck.\n\nEDGAR (O.S.)\nI swear to God, I would not be surprised if it was, the way you skulk around here like a dog been hit too much -- or ain't been\nhit enough, I can't make up my mind.\n\nOkay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting to glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight toward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar's place.\n\nThe blazing fireball barrels through the sky, SNAPS off a couple trees --\n\nEDGAR (O.S.)\nYou're useless, Beatrice! The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck!\n\n-- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.\n\nThe door opens. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun.\n\nEDGAR\nFigures.\n\nEdgar walks across the yard, going into the hulking shell that was his truck. The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.\n\nBEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.\n\nBEATRICE\nWhat is it, Edgar?!\n\nEDGAR\n(turns to her)\nGet your big butt back in that house!\n\nBeatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar approaches the hole. AN OTHERWORLDLY  VOICE comes from deep in the hole.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nPlace projectile weapon on ground.\n\nEdgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.\n\nEDGAR\nYou can have my gun [cocks it] when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers!\n\nThe voice responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nYour proposal is acceptable.\n\nA long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and pulls him down into the hole.\n\nFrom deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to the truck.\n\nIt's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face, arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the prom.\n\nThe thing is pulled back... and Edgar comes out, but rugged and dirty, and makes a sound as he moves his jaw.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nBEATRICE sits at the kitchen table. Edgar first hits the panel door, then opens it. He carries the shotgun. She looks up at him. But his face is a blank.\n\nBEATRICE\nWhat on earth was it?!\n\nHe looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than before. More refined.\n\nEDGAR\nSugar.\n\nBEATRICE\nI've never seen sugar do that.\n\nEDGAR\nGive me sugar.\n\nPuzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar. She holds it out to him.\n\nEDGAR (CONT'D)\nIn water.\n\nFrightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of the sugar into it.\n\nEDGAR (CONT'D)\nMore.\n\nShe puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling.\n\nEdgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck.\n\nBEATRICE\nEdgar, your skin is hanging off your bones.\n\nEdgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He turns around, reaches up --\n\n-- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, by pulling his hair up and stretching his whole face.\n\nEDGAR\nThat better?\n\nBeatrice faints.\n\nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT\n\nThe cow observes as a loud SCRAPING sound comes from the pit left by the spaceship. The flying saucer is rolled out of the pit by Edgar.\n\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT\n\nEDWARDS sits on one side of the table, a POLICE INSPECTOR and a UNIFORMED SERGEANT (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit across from him.\n\nINSPECTOR\nPerpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?\n\nEDWARDS\nNo, sir. He blinked once with one set, then again with another completely different set.\n\nSERGEANT\nSort of a low beam, high beam.\n\nINSPECTOR\nWas that before or after he drew the weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces?\n\nEDWARDS\nAfter, sir.\n\nINSPECTOR\nAnd why do you suppose none of the other officers saw either of these two events?\n\nEDWARDS\n'Cause some of the other officers are a little soggy in the midsection. And they couldn't keep up, sir.\n\nSERGEANT\nHey, Edwards, if you were half the man I am --\n\nEDWARDS\nWhat do you mean? I am half the man you are.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat the hell is your problem?\n\nEDWARDS\nMy problem is you being all up in my damn face all the time.\n\nSERGEANT\nI think he threw him off the roof.\n\nEDWARDS\nMaybe you're next.\n\nINSPECTOR\n(cutting off the Sergeant)\nSergeant. I want to talk to you outside. Now.\n\nSERGEANT\nTen minutes -- take your best shot.\n\nEDWARDS\nTake ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard.\n\nA woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish, dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then\nwhispers to him.\n\nLAUREL\nI believe you. [extends her hand, Edwards grabs it] Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. Find me at the morgue on 26th. I'll tell you what I found.\n\nEDWARDS\nHey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.\n\nHe turns around, but she's already in the corridor behind the room, but is STOPPED by someone who remains in shadow.\n\nSHADOW (O.S.)\nYou're Dr. Weaver, from the coroner's office? Working on the John Doe?\n\nLAUREL\nYes. That's right.\n\nSHADOW (O.S.)\nWould you look right here, please.\n\nA red flash hits Laurel, who keeps still on the hallway. Then KAY steps into the room and closes the door behind him. As he goes to the security camera to turn it off by the power cable...\n\nKAY\nSome night, huh?\n\nEDWARDS\nOh, yeah, some night.\n\nKAY\nThey were gills. Not eyelids. Gills. He was out of breath.\n\nEDWARDS\nWho are you?\n\nKAY\nDid he say anything to you?\n\nEDWARDS\n(scoffing)\nYeah, sure. He said the world was coming to an end.\n\nKAY\nDid he say when?\n\nSilence, as Edwards stares in disbelief.\n\nKAY\nWould you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?\n\nEDWARDS\nAbsolutely.\n\nKAY\nLet's take a ride.\n\nEDWARDS\nWait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.\n\nKAY\nIt's all done.\n\nAt that point, the INSPECTOR appears with a folder, smiles and gives Edwards the thumbs up.\n\nINSPECTOR\nGood work, Edwards.\n\nEdwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay. As they leave.\n\nKAY\nYou ran that guy down on foot? That's tough. That's double tough.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. FORD LTD - A MOMENT LATER - DRIVING\n\nA plain, boxy Ford approaches a pawn shop. Kay and Edwards' voices are heard inside it.\n\nEDWARDS\nSo who you with?\n\nKAY\nI'm part of a secret organization that monitors and polices alien activity on earth.\n\nEDWARDS\nWhatever.\n\nKAY\nWe're here.\n\nKay opens the door and gets out of the car. Edwards follows.\n\nEXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT\n\nEdwards looks around. Sees they're standing in front of a PAWN SHOP.\n\nEDWARDS\nThis is where we're going?\n\nKAY\nYeah.\n\nEDWARDS\nThis is Jack Jeebs' spot. He buys from chain snatchers.\nDoesn't even sell guns.\n\nKAY\nReally?\n\nEDWARDS\nAll right, you think it's worth shaking him up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some answers.\n\nKAY\nDo your \"thing,\" kid.\n\nEdwards goes inside.\n\nINT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT\n\nJACK JEEBS is the sleazy, sarcastic proprietor of the Pawn Shop. He's not easily intimidated.\n\nJEEBS\nOfficer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the proper authorities.\n\nHe casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter.\n\nEDWARDS\nWay I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.\n\nJEEBS\nSure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just work here because I love the hours.\n\nThis pisses Edwards off. He grabs Jeebs by the collar.\n\nEDWARDS\n(getting angry)\nI'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech stuff.\n\nJEEBS\nC'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.\n\nKay walks into the room.\n\nKAY\nWhy don't you show him the imports, Jeebs.\n\nAt the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face.\n\nJEEBS\nH-hiya Kay, how are you?\n\nKAY\nThe imports, Jeebs. Now.\n\nJEEBS\nYou know I got outta that business a long time ago, Kay.\n\nKAY\nWhy do you lie to me? I hate it when you lie.\n\nHe pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead.\n\nJEEBS\nWhoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...\n\nKAY\nI'm going to count to three.\n\nEdwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine.\n\nEDWARDS\nHe'll do it, Jeebs.\n\nKAY\nOne.\n\nEDWARDS\nI've seen him do it.\n\nKAY\nTwo.\n\nEDWARDS\nTalk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's like this.\n\nJEEBS\nHe's always crazy. (to Kay) Take a cruise. Get a massage --\n\nKAY\nThree.\n\nKA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor. Edwards is shocked.\n\nEdwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head.\n\nEDWARDS\nPut down the gun and put your hands on the counter!\n\nKAY\nI warned him.\n\nEDWARDS\nDrop the weapon!\n\nKAY\nYou warned him.\n\nEDWARDS\nYou are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.\n\nKAY\nWill you relax?\n\nJEEBS (O.S.)\n(irritated, in a helium voice)You insensitive prick!\n\nEdwards whirls around to see Jeebs' BODY, growing another head. Only takes four or five seconds. Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs' baby-soft new cheek.\n\nJEEBS (CONT'D)\nDo you know how much that stings?\n\nKAY\nShow us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up another one.\n\nJeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk --\n\n-- but this is all alien junk. Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly weapons of all shapes and sizes.\n\nKAY\nEdwards?\n\nEdwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons. He recognizes one.\n\nEDWARDS\nUh, this. This is what I saw.\n\nKay looks at Jeebs, pissed off.\n\nKAY\nYou sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid.\n\nJEEBS\nHe looked all right to me.\n\nKAY\nA carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs. Who was the target?\n\nJEEBS\nI don't know.\n\nKay raises the weapon again, threatening.\n\nKAY\nJeebs!\n\nJEEBS\nI don't know!\n\nKay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons.\n\nKAY\nThis is all confiscated. All of it. I want you on the next transport off this rock. Or I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.\n\nJeebs nods, point taken. Kay leaves.\n\nEDWARDS\nYeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.\n\nShaken, Edwards follows.\n\nEXT. PAWN SHOP -- NIGHT\n\nEdwards staggers out of the shop, trying to get the day's events straight in his head.\n\nKAY\nSearching for a handle on the moment here? I can't help you, kid.\n\nKay pulls the sunglasses from his pocket and puts them on.\n\nKAY (cont'd)\nOnly comfort I can offer is my promise that tomorrow morning  you won't remember a thing.\n\nEDWARDS\nThat's not exactly some shit you just forget.\n\nHe shows the Neuralyzer to Edwards.\n\nKAY\nEver see one of these?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\n-- the flash dims on EDWARDS and KAY, sitting at a table in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nKAY\n(finishing a joke)\n-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know, but this one's eating my popcorn!\n\nHe busts out laughing. Edwards, across from him, is completely disoriented. He looks down. There's a half-eaten order of broccoli beef and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him.\n\nEDWARDS\nHuh?\n\nKay checks his watch.\n\nKAY\nWhoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.\n\nEDWARDS\nWhere am I?\n\nKAY\nSee what I mean about tequila? You're a bright young man, James. Just lay off the sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.\nsharp.\n\nHe gives a business card before leaving the restaurant.  Edward sees the card, it's just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card: \"MiB\". Edwards looks at it, puzzled. He turns the card over and sees \" 504 Battery Drive.\"\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. GARAGE - DAY\n\nA pest control van, reading \"Zap Em\", approaches a garage.\n\nINT GARAGE - DAY\n\nThe door opens on a garage. The morning light spills on an abundance of cockroaches, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place. An EXTERMINATOR steps inside, carrying a tank of toxic gas.\n\nEXTERMINATOR\nWell, well, well. Movin' right in, are we? Think we own the place?\n\nHe unfurls a hose from the side of the tank.\n\nEXTERMINATOR(CONT'D)\nGot a little eviction notice for you, boys.\n\nHe raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the tank. LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nJust what exactly do you think you're doing?\n\nThe Exterminator turns around. EDGAR stands in the doorway to the garage, staring at him disdainfully.\n\nEXTERMINATOR\n(shrugs)\nTakin' care of your pest problem.\n\nEDGAR\n\"Pest\" problem? \"Pest?\"\n\nEXTERMINATOR\nYeah. You got a hell of an infestation.\n\nEdgar advances on him, slowly.\n\nEDGAR\nYou know, I have noticed an infestation here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum. So convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives.\n\nEXTERMINATOR\nWell -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of 'em?\n\nEDGAR\nIn the worst way.\n\nEdgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Exterminator's face with one hand  and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other. He falls dead on the floor.\n\n\nEXT. GARAGE - DAY\n\nThe Zap-Em truck now has the rear door down and the ramp standing. Edgar rolls the flying saucer towards it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MIB BUILDING - DAY\n\nThe next morning. EDWARDS, holding the small MIB business card in his hand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the utterly nondescript building in front of him: the ventilation tower of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, which connects Manhattan with Brooklyn.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY\n\nEDWARDS steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre room. One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel vent air intake. There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an OLD SECURITY GUARD, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding\nmetal chair halfway across. A symbol resembling an atom nucleus is on the floor.\n\nEdwards walks across the room, his footsteps ECHOING. The Guard looks up.\n\nGUARD\nHelp you?\n\nEDWARDS\nMaybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --\n\nGUARD\nElevator.\n\nAnd he goes back to his comic book. Edwards, maybe out of nothing more than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator. As he draws close, the elevator doors WHOOSH open, expecting him.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - ENTRANCE ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nEdwards steps inside and turns around. The doors close. The elevato moves for a while as Jay stares at the card, and then door on the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him.\n\nFrom behind him, somebody clears their throat. Edwards turns around, and finds himself standing in --\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY\n\nThis back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway. Standing at the front of the room is ZED, a wire-haired career G-man, an old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last night. SIX OTHER HOT RECRUITS sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at Edwards.\n\nOne chair is empty.\n\nZED\nYou're late. Sit down.\n\nEdwards takes the remaining chair. The elevator doors slide shut. Zed continues addressing the Recruits.\n\nZED (CONT'D)\nMy name is Zed. You're all here because you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.\n\nThey all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. He gives it back.\n\nZED (CONT'D)\nAnd we're looking for one of you. Just one. What will follow is a series of simple tests designed to quantify motor skills,\nhand-eye coordination, concentration, stamina -- I see we have a question.\n\nEdwards's hand is, indeed, up.\n\nEDWARDS\nWhy, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are we doing this?\n\nSilence. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. Zed calls on him.\n\nZED\nSon?\n\nAMBITIOUS RECRUIT\n(loud and formal)\nJake Jensen, West Point, graduate with honors. We're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best, sir!\n\nEdwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can't.\n\nZED\nWhat's so funny, Edwards?\n\nEDWARDS\nYour boy, Captain America, here. \"The best of the best of the best, sir!'' ''With honors.'' He's just really excited, and he has no clue why we're here. That's very funny to me. Y'all ain't laughing, though.\n\nEDWARDS\nWant to get down on this?\n\nZED\nOkay. Let's get going.\n\nThe recruits get the written test. It's a thick document -- reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams.\n\nEDWARDS is struggling to just open it: he rips through the first page, and then breaks the pencil trying to break the tape holding it together.  Behind the dark glass, Kay stands, staring, unemotional.\n\nThe RECRUITS are all struggling to get a place to write in their chairs, given no desks were provided. One even has his pencil TEAR through the page.\n\nEdwards looks up. In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table. Edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --\n\n-- and drags it, SCREECHING DEAFENINGLY, back to his chair. Everybody looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.\n\nEdwards sits back down, now writing on the table.  That's better.\n\nEDWARDS\nWant to get down on this?\n\nThey stare silently.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY\n\nSEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty, triangular room. A claxon rings, and it's shown the SEVEN RECRUITS are in front of the table. The two far walls pull apart. The whole room starts being covered in stroboscopic lights, while an urban landscape featuring human and alien carboard figures shows. The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim.  Everyone but Edwards shoots. And then a second later, he fires. The lights come down. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED\nwith it. Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards.\n\nZED\nThe hell happened?\n\nEDWARDS\nHesitated, sir.\n\nZed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl.\n\nZED\nMay I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?\n\nEDWARDS\nShe was the only one who actually seemed dangerous. At the time.\n\nZED\nAnd how did you come to that conclusion?\n\nEDWARDS\nFirst, I was going to pop this guy hanging from the streetlight but I realized he's just working out. How'd I feel if somebody bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill?Then I saw this snarling beast guy, and I noticed he had a tissue in his hand and realized he's not snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues\nin his hand. Ain't no real threat there. Then I saw Tiffany. I'm thinking, eight-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto... bunch of monsters at night with quantum physics books. She about to start some shit, Zed. She's about eight. Those books are way too advanced for her. If you ask me, she's up to something.  Honestly, I'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.\n\nSideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs.\n\nEDWARDS (CONT'D)\nOr, uh -- do I owe her an apology?\n\nZed walks away.\n\nEDWARDS\nThat was a good shot though, right?\n\nUncomfortable looks.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY\n\nZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.\n\nZED\nHe's got a real problem with authority.\n\nKAY\nSo do I. But this kid ran down a cephlapoid on foot, boss. That's got to be tough enough.\n\nZED\nI hope you know what you're doing.\n\nZed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group.\n\nZed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off.\n\nZED (CONT'D)\nCongratulations, you're everything we've come to expect from years of government training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we\nhave one more test to administer, an eye exam.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY\n\nThe RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.\n\nKAY is outside the door, waiting for him.\n\nKAY\nWhere are you going?\n\nEdwards recognizes him from last night and walks towards him.\n\nEDWARDS\nYou! Hey, what's goin' on?\n\nOnce Edwards approaches, Kay gives him a folder. Both start walking down the corridor.\n\nKAY\nBack in the mid-fifties, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet.\n\nAs they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket.\n\nZED\nNow, if you'll look directly at the end of this device.\n\nHe holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses.\n\nEdwards then turns to the folder, and starts reading from it. As Kay talks and both walk, Zed's neuralyzer FLASHES.\n\nKAY\nEverybody thought the agency was a joke. Except the aliens. They made contact on March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.\n\nCut to Edwards' point of view - the folder has thick with eight by ten photographs. He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and fluorescent lights... and one young man resembling young KAY in a plaid shirt holding a bouquet.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nThere were nine of us that night. Seven agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back road.\n\nYet another photograph, this one showing the young man  giving the tall alien the flowers.\n\nEDWARDS\nOh, you brought that tall man some flowers.\n\nKay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as the first.\n\nKAY\nThey were intergalactic refugees with a simple request. Let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet.  Ever see \"Casablanca?\" [Edwards replies yes] Same thing, no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all evidence of their landing.\n\nAnother picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.\n\nEDWARDS\nSo these are real flying saucers and the World's Fair was a cover-up for their landing?\n\nKAY\nWhy else would we hold it in Queens? (another hallway) More nonhumans arrive every year. They live among us, in secret.\n\nEDWARDS\nI see. Not to change the subject, but when was your last CAT scan?\n\nKAY\nEvery six months; it's company policy.\n\nEDWARDS\nMake another appointment. Tell your boy Zed I had an absolutely wonderful time and thank you for everything but show me the door.\n\nThey have stopped next to an unmarked door. Kay throws it open and steps inside.\n\nKAY\nAll right. I'm going to get some coffee. You want some coffee?\n\nEDWARDS\nNo, thank you, I'm fine.\n\nAs Kay walks into the kitchenette, THREE WORM-LIKE ALIENS standing around a water cooler. Impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of\nEsperanto and microphone feedback. One holds the coffee pot, another drinks and smokes.\n\nKAY\nHow you doing, fellas?\n\nWORMS\nHi Kay!\n\nKay grabs a paper cup, approaches the one with the pot.\n\nKAY\nThat's not decaf, is it?\n\nWORM\nViennese cinnamon.\n\nKAY\nDon't tell me we've only got that powdered stuff for cream again?\n\nOne of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nWell, that's good. Good. Good.\n\nHe finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated, dumps some in his coffee.\n\nKAY\nYou guys getting along all right?\n\nThey reply in their language.\n\nKAY\nDon't work too hard.\n\nHe comes back outside, closing the door behind him.\n\nWORM\nSo, you guys seen the cahuengas on...\n\nKay approaches the slack-jawed Edwards.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nSure you don't want coffee?\n\nWORM\nCahuengas, yeah, but how about the zapoata?\n\nAs the worms laugh, the scene cuts.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY\n\nEDWARDS, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside KAY on a bench in Battery Park. Kay drinks his coffee while they talk.\n\nKAY\nAny given time, around fifteen hundred landed aliens are on the planet, the majority right here in Manhattan. Most aliens are decent enough, just trying to make a living.\n\nEDWARDS\nCab drivers?\n\nKAY\nNot as many as you'd think. Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue. Don't want one, either. They're happy. They think\nthey've got a pretty good bead on things.\n\nEDWARDS\nWhy the big secret? People are smart, they can handle it.\n\nKAY\nA person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals. You know it.  A thousand years ago everybody knew Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat. Fifteen minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet.  Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.\n\nEDWARDS\nSo what's the catch?\n\nKAY\nThe catch.The catch is you will sever every human contact. Nobody will ever know you exist anywhere. Ever. l give you to sunrise to think it over.\n\nKay gets up and walks away.\n\nEDWARDS\nIs it worth it?\n\nKAY\nYeah, it's worth it... if you're strong enough.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. BATTERY PARK - DUSK\n\nAlmost nighttime now, and the park is empty. EDWARDS is still on the bench. And still thinking. Above him, the stars are coming out.\n\nSlowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING\n\nWe are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor.\n\nWe see the Zap Em van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY\n\nEDWARDS stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he first came into yesterday. The guard is still there.\n\nEDWARDS\nWhat's up, pops?\n\nThe elevator doors open and KAY, obviously summoned by the OLD SECURITY GUARD, stands waiting for him.\n\nEDWARDS\nOne thing you gotta know right now.\n\nEdwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nInside the elevator, the doors WHOOSH shut, KAY turns a key in a certain floor number, and the descent begins. EDWARDS continues.\n\nEDWARDS\nAll right. I'm in because there's some next-level shit going on around here, and I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there\nare a couple of things we need to get straight. First off, you chose me, so you recognize the skills. I don't want nobody calling me \"son\" or \"kid\" or \"sport.\" Cool?\n\nKAY\nWhatever you say, slick. But I need to tell you something about all your skills. As of right now...\n\nThe elevator doors --\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\n-- slide open on Men in Black headquarters.\n\nKAY\n...they mean precisely dick.\n\nIt's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling, shuffling papers.\n\nKAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out over the whole place.\n\nKay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking the documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien tongues.\n\nEdwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as he addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor.\n\nPASSPORT OFFICER\nPurpose of trip?\n\nARQUILLIAN\nDiplomatic mission.\n\nPASSPORT OFFICER\nDuration of stay?\n\nARQUILLIAN\nLunch.\n\nPASSPORT OFFICER\nCarrying any fruits or vegetables?\n\nAs Edwards passes by an alien resembling a giant slub and just stares, fascinated, Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries him along.\n\nKAY\nLet's go. He's a little...grouchy.\n\nKay moves him into the central hall.\n\nKAY\nThree-hour delay in customs after a 17 trillion mile flight gonna make anybody cranky. Right?\n\nEDWARDS\nWhat branch of the government do we report to?\n\nKAY\nNone. They ask too many questions.\n\nEDWARDS\nSo who pays for all this?\n\nKAY\nOh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we confiscated from our out-of-state visitors. Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.\n\nAT A STORAGE CAGE, Kay turns a key in the lock of a caged-in area and throws the door open. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops.\n\nKAY\n(picking something up)\nThis is a fascinating little gadget. A new recording device to replace CD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album again.  (something else) This is amusing. Universal translator.\n\nHe holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like a lapel microphone.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nWe're not supposed to have it. I'll tell you why.  Human thought is so primitive it's looked upon as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies. That kind of makes you proud, doesn't it?\n\nEdwards touches up a small yellow ball that stands floating above a torch-like device.\n\nEDWARDS\nWhat's this?\n\nTHE BALL ZINGS OUT OF EDWARDS' HANDS -- it flies out into the main complex -- hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room, faster than the eye can follow --\n\nVARIOUS SHOTS OF HUMANS AND ALIENS ducking, dodging, and jumping out of its way. One experiment room has all the beakers and such breaking. In Zed's office, the boss barely notices the bouncing ball.\n\nEDWARDS\n(to various people as the ball approaches or hits them)\nRelax! Watch your head!  Somebody get him some ice.Move! Just move when it's coming at you!Damn! I'm going to pay for that!\n\nON KAY as he calmly, a little wearily, slips an odd-looking metal glove over his right hand...\n\nHe raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it -- Kay catches the ball, calmly.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nCaused the '77 New York blackout. Practical joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it was funny as hell.\n\nThey leave the room.\n\nEDWARDS\nSorry! It was a accident. Sorry.\n\nON THE MAIN FLOOR, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant screen on the far wall.\n\nKAY\nObservation, the heart of our little endeavor. Meet the twins. Idikiukup and Bob.\n\nKay gestures to two small, bony CREATURES with eight arms each and a single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads. They turn around and wave two or three arms each.\n\nThe screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nThis map shows the location of every registered alien on earth at any given time. Some of them we keep under constant surveillance.\n\nHe hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by ten big screens.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nEveryone on these screens is an alien. In public -- normal. In private -- you'll get the idea.\n\nON THE SCREENS, we see live images of ten humans who are actually aliens.\n\nEDWARDS\nOh, man.\n\nKAY\nIt makes no sense?\n\nEDWARDS\nIt makes perfect sense.When I was in third grade, everyone said I was crazy...  but I knew our teacher was from Venus or something like that.\n\nKAY\nMrs. Edelson.Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.\n\nEdwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots \"Irma Edelson\"  onto the screen.\n\nEDELSON\nClass...  be quiet and pay attention! If I have to tell you one more time--\n\nZED's voice is then heard.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nEdwards!\n\nEdwards turns around\n\nZED\nLet's put it on.\n\nEDWARDS\nPut what on?\n\nZED\nThe last suit you'll ever wear.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY\n\nThe MIB locker room is all gray, each locker with a single letter. Edwards approaches a locker reading \"J\". ZED'S VOICE comes over:\n\nZED (O.S.)\nFrom now on, you'll dress only in attire specially sanctioned by MIB Special Services.\n\nEDWARDS takes out revealing a BLACK SUIT hung from a hanger in the middle. Above it, on the shelf, a WHITE SHIRT, a WRISTWATCH and a pair of BLACK SUNGLASSES. On the bottom, a pair of SHINY BLACK SHOES.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\nKAY is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, library card, everything.  One by one, KAY deletes Edwards's identity cards.\n\nZED'S VOICE continues:\n\nZED (O.S.)\nYou'll conform to the identity we give you, eat where we tell you, live where we tell you.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING LASER BOOTH - DAY\n\nEDWARDS stands in a cramped white booth.\n\nHe holds both his hands on a TEN-FINGERED KEYPAD, pressing down hard. The pad glows red, a SEARING sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nYou will have no identifying marks of any kind.  You will not stand out in any way. Your entire image is carefully crafted to leave no lasting memory whatsoever with anyone you encounter.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY\n\n\nFeet slip into black shoes.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nYou're a rumor, recognizable only as deja vu and dismissed just as quickly. You don't exist; you were never even born.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\nOn the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- JAMES DARREL EDWARDS III. Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name.\n\nThe watch is put on the wrist.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nAnonymity is your name. Silence your native tongue.\n\nMore letters are eliminated from his name. It reads \"JAMES DARREL ED...\" then \"JAMES DARR...\"\n\nThe glasses are removed and put on the coat's pocket.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nYou are no longer part of \"the system.\"\n\n\"JAMES...\" \"JAM...\"\n\nZED (O.S.)\nWe're above the system. Over it. Beyond it.\n\nA tie pushed up. The earring is removed.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nWe're \"them.\" We're \"they.\"\n\nOn screen, all that's left is the letter \"J.\"\n\nZED (O.S.)\nWe are the Men in Black.\n\nKay's screen reads \"New Entry: J. Database Updated\" as the atom logo shows in the background. Jay's voice is heard.\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nThe difference between you and me?\n\nKay moves. Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, JAMES D EDWARDS III -- or, rather, JAY -- reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and slips 'em on.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\nI make this look good.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY\n\nOut of one of the \"Rosenberg Fine Jewelry\" shops on Thirty-Fifth Street comes a short, old man (ROSENBERG), carrying a bag with a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box. He talks to the cat.\n\nROSENBERG\nWe're going to go for a ride. I'll put you down here for a minute then Daddy will be right back.\n\nCarefully, he puts the bag on a pane with flowers as he locks the revolving door to his distinctive shop.\n\nThe Zap-Em Truck then approaches the shop. The cat stares at Edgar as he struggles to position itself in a \"not-suspicious\" position.\n\nROSENBERG\nOkay, now we're ready to go for a little ride.\n\nThat finished, Rosenberg picks up the bag, puts the box in his pocket, then waddles off down the street.\n\nROSENBERG\nWe're going to meet with Daddy's friend who you'll like.\n\nEdgar then starts the van and moves it along.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - ZED'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nZed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are six video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image.\n\nWhile Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk.\n\nZED\nOkay, let's see. (to one of the monitors) Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of Sinalee touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight.\n\nBEE, an agent on one of the monitors, nods.\n\nBEE\nHumanoid?\n\nZED\nYou wish. Bring a sponge. (going through memos) And here. Red-letter from last night -- we had an un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate New York farm country. Keep your ears open for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a galactic kegger down here.\n\nNext to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly.  Zed looks over at it.\n\nZED\nWell, well, well -- we got a skimmer.\n\nKAY\n(to Jay)\nLanded alien out of zone.\n(to Zed)\nWho is it?\n\nZED\nRedgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan but he's way out of town right now, stuck in traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why don't you take junior with you? This is a good one for him to warm up on.\n\nKay gets up.\n\nZED\n(to Jay)\nGo get 'em, Tiger.\n\nZed then looks again that the monitor reporting on Redgick.\n\nEXT. MIB BUILDING - BATTERY PARK - DAY\n\nJAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters.\n\nJAY\n(imitating Zed)\n\"We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger...\"\n\nKay frowns at him.\n\nJAY\nZed. He just...\n\nAn MIB MECHANIC pulls up in Kay's black LTD and hops out, leaving the door open. Jay sizes up the car.\n\nJAY\nUnlimited technology from the whole universe... and we cruise around in a Ford P.O.S.\n\nINT. MIB LTD - DAY\n\nThey get in and slam the doors. Kay fastens his seatbelt.\n\nKAY\nFasten seat belt.\n\nHe  starts the car and the engine HUMS quietly.\n\nJAY\nWe got to work on your people skills. You'd get a much better reaction if you were more polite.\n\nKay shifts on reverse, glares at Jay and extends his hands above the wheel.\n\nKAY\nFasten seat belts, please.\n\nJAY\nGood. Did you hurt yourself?\n\nKay steps on the gas. The awesome power of the car kicks in and Jay sails forward, THWACKING into the dash. Kay shifts into forward and taps the gas, SLAMMING Jay back into his seat.\n\nJay's hand falls by accident on a lever between the seats, with a big red button on it.\n\nKAY\nOh, the red button there. Don't ever, ever touch it.\n\nJay jerks his hand away.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. R&L RESTAURANT - DAY\n\nThe exterior of R&L, a Russian diner. A cab stops on the door, ROSENBERG steps out of it.\n\nCAB DRIVER\nAll right, pop,that'll be $72   there.\n\nRosenberg puts the bag with the cat atop the taxi.\n\nROSENBERG\nOkay, sweetie, let me pay the impolite driver.\n\nA moment later, the Zap-Em van pulls to a stop across the street.\n\nINT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY\n\nROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid fifties. The man (an ARQUILLIAN, and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien on a \"diplomatic mission\" from passport control) rises from his chair.\n\nRosenberg walks carefully over to the table, puts the bag on the floor, but does not sit down. He and ROSENBERG embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to\nit, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion.\n\nFinally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled.\n\nROSENBERG\nSorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this planet are terrible.\n\nARQUILLIAN\nYour majesty, you are in grave danger.\n\nROSENBERG\nYeah, and they overcharge you every time.\n\nARQUILLIAN\nSir, a bug landed here. We must get you off the planet.\n\nROSENBERG\nA bug? He must know why I'm here.\n\nARQUILLIAN\nWe think he does.(noticing the ornate box on the table) Is that what I think it is?\n\nROSENBERG\nNo, just some diamonds for your children. Do we have time to eat?\n\nThe Arquillian relaxes.\n\nARQUILLIAN\nSure. I ordered you some pirogi.\n\nINT. LESHKO'S DINER - KITCHEN - DAY\n\nIn the kitchen, the Russian COOK slaps two orders of pirogi up on the stainless steel counter --\n\nCOOK\nTable six is up!\n\nHe sees someone approaching...\n\nCOOK\nWhere is Ivan?\n\nVOICE (O.S.)\nGave him a break.\n\nThe voice is suspiciously like Edgar's. The cook turns away to his grill. A HAND reaches in, takes the plates, one with each hand. We follow, but see only the arm and aproned midsection of the waiter carrying it.  As he steps away, we see a storage shelf crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed\ntomatoes --\n\n-- and the DEAD IVAN, literally folded in half and stuffed in among the shelves.\n\nINT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY\n\nROSENBERG and the ARQUILLIAN raise their glasses in a toast. Now it's clear that the waiter approaching in the background is Edgar.\n\nARQUILLIAN\nTo the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire.\n\nROSENBERG\nTo the safety of the galaxy.\n\nThey CLINK glasses and drink, just as Edgar arrives. The plates are put down. Close in on Rosenberg's, from his POV, catching a glimpse of the Waiter's hand --\n\n-- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter's sleeve and scurries in the dish. Rosenberg looks up to the waiter's face, paralyzed with fear. He seems to know what dire implications Edgar's presence holds.\n\nROSENBERG\n(in English again)\nYou can kill us both -- but you will not find it.\n\nThe Arquilian looks at Edgar, is also afraid. Rosenberg's cat is seen  raising his head on the bag.\n\nEDGAR\nYou're right about one thing.\n\nSuddenly a long STINGER whips out from under the back of Edgar's apron and zips under the table. It hits Rosenberg's neck, and then the Arquillian. Both lurch forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain. They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi.\n\nEdgar moves quickly, grabs the ornate box, and leaves, flipping a table on the way. Rosenberg's cat leaps back onto the table and SNARLS at him as he goes. He turns around and grunts at the cat, who proceeds to angrily make a defying gesture. We can see his collar reads \"ORION\" before the cat hisses again.\n\nEdgar turns around and walks further towards the exit. Another waiter moves to the  door frame.\n\nMAN\nYou're not going anywhere, pal.\n\nEdgar tosses him away, making the waiter's tray loudly fall and make noise. Edgar then pushes the door and walks down the street, with the patron next to the door staring.\n\nPASSERBY\nWhat's going on?\n\nEdgar just hits and makes the man fall.\n\nEXT. R&L RESTAURANT - DAY\nEdgar is walking down the street, holding his hip and stretching his arm. The restaurant staff are all gathering at the door to stare at him, as does another man passing by the street.\n\nINT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY\nThe cat stares angrily.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY\n\nA car has pulled over. KAY  approaches the DRIVER.\n\nKAY\nLicense and registration, please.\n\nThe Driver hands over some documents.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nOther license and registration, please.\n\nThe guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Jay peers over Kay's shoulder.\n\nKAY\nYou're restricted to Manhattan. Where are you going, Redgie?\n\nREDGICK\nIt's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!\n\nIt can be seen the back seat that MRS. REDGICK, with a big belly, lies down, MOANING in pain, making contraction gestures.\n\nKAY\nAll right. No big deal.\n\nHe opens the door.\n\nKAY (cont'd)\nOkay, you come with me, Redge.\n\nRedgwick steps out the car, looks at his screaming wife one last time. Kay closes the door, turns to Jay.\n\nKAY\nYou handle it.\n\nJAY\nWhat? Me?\n\nKay approaches Redgwick.\n\nKAY\nSure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.\n\nREDGICK\nHe knows what he's doing?\n\nKAY\nHe does it all the time. Let the man work.\n\nINT. REDGWICK'S CAR - DAY\n\nFrom Mrs. Redgwick's point of view, her open legs and Jay outside the door.  He smiles, gestures happily, and then does an imitation of the \"breathing lesson in Lamaze class\". Then he looks down to the woman's crotch...\n\nJAY\nKay! Damn, man! So-- Something's peaking!\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY\nA few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him. The car has all sorts of stuff above the trunk, so nothing inside the cabin can be seen. A TENTACLE whips out from inside the car, wraps around Jay and pulls him. He struggles trying to get released. The other two never break their conversation.\n\nKAY\nCroagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th. You were headed out of town.\n\nREDGICK\nWell, we're, uh -- meeting someone.\n\nKAY\n(still to Redgick)\nSo? Who you meeting?\n\nREDGICK\nWell, it's -- a ship.\n\nKAY\nReally? I didn't see a departure clearance for today.\n\nREDGICK\nYou didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.\n\nThe tentacle starts dangling Jay upside down above the car.\n\nJAY\nKay! Kay!\n\nKAY\nYou're doing fine, ace.\n\nJAY\nKiss my ass!\n\nKAY\n(back to Redgick)\nWhat kind of emergency? What's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden?\n\nJay is pulled inside the car. And then as the vehicle shakes he emerges still wrapped on the tentacle through the other side.\n\nREDGICK\nWe just don't like the neighborhood anymore. Some of the -- new arrivals.\n\nJay starts being bashed on the car ceiling.\n\nKAY\nNew arrivals? Have anything to do with the crasher from last night?\n\nRedgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes away. Jay is pulled inside the car again.\n\nJAY\n(Screaming)\nExcuse me, miss!\nBut in that moment, Jay is ejected with great speed from inside the car. Redge runs towards him. Jay falls, flat on his back in the dirt, the multi-tentacled squidlike baby resting squarely on his chest.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\nOh -- oh -- oh -- man.\n\nKay and Redgwick approach. Kay claps him on the back.\n\nKAY\nCongratulations, Redge! It's a squid.\n\nJay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest.\n\nJAY\n(misty)\nHe's... actually kind of...\n\nIt vomits slime on him. Jay spits the one that fell in his mouth, and then the \"squid\" blinks.\n\nJAY\n...cute.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIB LTD - DAY\n\nBack in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY starts up the car.\n\nKAY\nAnything about that seem unusual to you?\n\nJay just looks at him, very Jack Benny.\n\n\nKAY\nWhat kind of \"new arrival\" would scare Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn?\n(thinks)\nLet's check the hot sheets.\n\nEXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY\n\nCLOSE ON on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them. There are headlines like \"POPE A FATHER!\"and \"TOP DOCTORS BAFFLED -- BABY BORN PREGNANT!\" and \"MAN EATS OWN HOUSE!\" (the subhead on that one is \"And\nThat's Just the Appetizer, Says Neighbor.\")\n\nKAY and JAY are at a downtown newsstand. Kay is furiously searching through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed.\n\nJAY\nThese are the hot sheets?\n\nKay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a buck.\n\nKAY\nBest investigative reporting on the planet.  Read the New York Times if you want. They get lucky sometimes.\n\nJAY\nI cannot believe you're looking for tips in a supermarket tabloid.\n\nKAY\nNot looking for. Found.\n\nHe SMACKS the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming:\n\nFarm wife says\n\"ALIEN STOLE MY HUSBAND'S SKIN!\"\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY\n\nThe LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to\nBeatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed. The wrecked pickup truck is still there. JAY and KAY get out, very undercover cop. Jay starts up the driveway.\n\nKAY\nWait, slow down.\n\nJAY\nWhy?\n\nKAY\nGive her time to get the wrong impression. Makes things smoother.\n\nBEATRICE appears in the door to the house, curious.\n\nBeatrice calls to them.\n\nBEATRICE\nCan I help you gentlemen?\n\nKAY\nHow do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a few questions about your visitor.\n\nBEATRICE\nAre you here to make fun of me too?\n\nKAY\nNo ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we come in?\n\nBEATRICE\nSure. Lemonade?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nBeatrice speaks sitting on the couch.\n\nBEATRICE\nThe chief of police himself come up to the house and did a full-out professional investigation. Took a police report and writ down everything I said... from A to Z, not believing one thing I said. Sort of poking fun at me. And they said to me, \"If he was murdered, how could he walk back in the house?\"\n\nJAY sips some of her lemonade and winces, before spitting it back.\n\nBEATRICE\nAnd I gotta admit, I was a little stumped by that one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.\n\nKay is nodding, while Jay checks out the room. He puts the glass on the table, and picks up a  framed PHOTO OF EDGAR\n\nBEATRICE\nIt was more like something else that was wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.\n\nA GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay pokes Kay, shows him the picture with Edgar proudly holding his shotgun in the middle of the bog.\n\nJAY\nDude was that ugly before he was an alien.\n\nBEATRICE\nI'm sorry.\n\nKAY\nGo on.\n\nBEATRICE\nAnyway, when I came to, he was gone.\n\nKAY\nDid he say anything?\n\nBEATRICE\nYes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I remember.\n\nKAY\nSugar water.\n\nKay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Jay puts his as well.\n\nBEATRICE\nYeah, I remember that right. 'Cause I thought that was odd. That he asked me for sugar water and not lemonade or ice water or... regular water or... tap water.\n\nKay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead as if hypnotized. Kay takes his glasses off, Jay follows.\n\nKAY\nOkay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted\nthe light from Venus --\n\nJAY\nWait a minute. You flash that thing, it erases her memory and you just make up a new one?\n\nKAY\nStandard issue neuralyzer.\n\nJAY\nThat weak-ass story is the best you can come up with?\n\nKAY\nAll right. On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at your mother's for a few days and get over it. Decide you're better off.\n\nJAY\n(butting in)\nWell, yeah, because he never appreciated you anyway. Okay. You know what? (points at Beatrice) You. Kicked. Him. Out. Alright? Now you're gonna do what he said, you're gonna go stay with your mother. Then you're gonna go get yourself some new dresses, some new shoes, maybe go somewhere where you can get a facial. (looks around the house) Oh, and I'd hire a decorator to come in here quick because, damn.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY\n\nKAY is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. He holds a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  The analyzer shifts colors.  Red. Then Yellow.\n\nJAY\n(from up outside the hole)\nYo, Kay, check it out. When do I get my own flashy memory messer-upper thing?\n\nKAY\nWhen you grow up.\n\nJay scratches his eyebrow with his middle finger. Kay returns to stare at the analyzer.\n\nKAY\nPlease -- not green.\n\nPurple. And then green.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nDamn.\n\nKay stands up.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nI don't suppose you know what kind of alien life form leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water, do you?\n\nJAY\nUh, wait, that was on \"Final Jeopardy!\" last night. Damn, Alex said...\n\nKay snatches up a cellphone.\n\nKAY\nZed, we have a bug.\n\nHe turns off the radio and starts walking out the hole.\n\nJAY\nSo. What? We don't like bugs?\n\nKAY\nBugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They consume, infest and destroy. They live off the death and decay of other species.\n\nJAY\nYou were stung as a child, right?\n\nKAY\nImagine a giant cockroach with unlimited strength, a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper is tear-assing around Manhattan Island in a brand new Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?\n\nJAY\nWhat's the move?\n\nKAY\nWith the bug in town, we watch the morgues.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nThe stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police headquarters. ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with \"City Morgue\" written across them. The words split in half as the stretcher BANGS through the doors.\n\nINT. MORGUE - DAY\n\nThe city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses parked left and right. Busy day in the Apple. The Cop wheeling the stretcher calls out to the CORONER, who's hunched over another body.\n\nCOP\nWhere do you want contestant number three?\n\nThe coroner turns around. It's DR. LAUREL WEAVER, the woman who tried to speak to Jay before. She sighs and waves a hand.\n\nLAUREL\nBy the wall, I guess.\n(noticing)\nWhat's with the cat?\n\nCOP\nOh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat. Sign here.\n\nLaurel signs his clipboard.\n\nLAUREL\nWhat's the problem with the cat?\n\nCOP\nYour problem.\n\nLaurel gives him a dirty look as he leaves.\n\nLAUREL\nI hate the living.\n\nShe goes over to the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg's cat gently.\n\nLAUREL\nShall we?\n\nShe wheels the stretcher under the lights.\n\nINT. MORGUE - LATER - DAY\n\nThe Arquilian is in an open drawer of the  cold chambers, while Laurel is hunched over Rosenberg's corpse. Fascinated by something, she digs deeper. And deeper. And looks up, her face a mixture of alarm and excitement.\n\nLAUREL\nOh, my God. Buddy, what are you?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nTwo men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside the morgue. They hasten down the hallway, their shoes CLICKING in perfect lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end.\n\nJAY and KAY. Men in Black on a mission.\n\nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT\n\nIn her darkened office, LAUREL is on her desk, recording her report.\n\nLAUREL\n(into recorder)\nSubject was approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a post-mortem increase in body temperature. Examiner attempted to verify result\nrectally, only to find subject was, uh, without rectum. Which can only be described  as...well...as really...\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nWeird?\n\nKay turns on the lights.\n\nKAY (cont'd)\nDr. Leo Menville, Department of Public Health. This is Dr. White.\n\nLAUREL\n(checking her watch)\nYou boys must not have much of a home life.\n\nKAY\nWe watch the morgues very carefully. You've got something unusual?\n\nLAUREL\nI'd say so -- triple homicide.\n\nShe gets up and takes them to the cold chambers.\n\nLAUREL (CONT'D)\nThe first corpse was perfectly normal, except that he was broken in half, but when I opened up the other two -- well, look.\n\nShe pulls back a drawer, revealing a body covered in a sheet.\n\nLAUREL (CONT'D)\nThere's a skeletal structure at work here unlike anything I've ever seen.\n\nPulling the sheet from the face reveals the Arquillian.\n\nKAY\nI'll have a look at this one. Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body?\n\nLAUREL\nThis way, Doctor.\n\nJay and Laurel cross the room, to where ROSENBERG's corpse lies out on another gurney.\n\nLAUREL (CONT'D)\nThis one's even stranger. I did a full laparotomy. I started with the lesser curvature of the stomach -- though, if you want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal junction.\n\nJAY\nI think, uh, we should start at the same place you did.\n\nLAUREL\nAll right.\n\nShe pulls out a glove box, hands Jay one and puts on the other. Rosenberg's cat steps on Jay's shoe.\n\nJAY\nYour cat?\n\nLAUREL\nGuess it is now. Came in with the bodies. Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won't mind.\n\nJay is reluctant and retches, but puts his hand on the hole.\n\nLAUREL (CONT'D)\nYou have very pretty eyes.\n\nJAY\nThank you.\n\nLaurel continues to guide him on the thick of the corpse.\n\nLAUREL (CONT'D)\nFeel that? Where the piloric junction would be?\n\nJAY\nOh, yes. Exactly.\n\nLAUREL\nNow push that aside. Notice anything strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?\n\nJAY\nNope. All fine.\n\nLAUREL\nDoctor, they're all missing.\n\nJAY\n(quickly)\nWell, of course they are. What I'm pointing out is that there are no pieces of them left. So they're intact, wherever they are.\nThat we can be sure of.\n\nLAUREL\nHave we met before? I have the strangest feeling of deja vu.\n\nJAY\nYeah, me too.\n\nLAUREL\nReally? Okay. You wanna know what I really think?\n(re: Kay)\nBut don't tell that guy. He looks like he's already under enough stress.\n(then)\nThis body is not really a body, but it's actually some sort of transport unit for something else altogether. The question is:\nwhat?\n\nJay just looks at her intrigued.\n\nLAUREL\nIs this freaking you out?\n\nJAY\nNo, girl.\n\nAfter a particularly gross GUSHY sound, he looks away, toward her. She's staring at him.\n\nLaurel leans over and lowers her voice, just for him.\n\nLAUREL\nYou know what I like to do sometimes? When it's really late?\n\nJAY\n(intrigued)\nNo...\n\nAs she starts talking...\n\nKAY\nDoctor White...\n\nLaurel just flips her hair as the chat is interrupted.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\nExcuse me.\n\nShe nods positively. He walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian. But Jay never takes his eyes off Laurel.\n\nKAY\nWhat do you think?\n\nJAY\n(of Laurel)\nVery interesting.  She got a real Queen of the Undead thing goin' on.\n\nKAY\nOf the body.\n\nJAY\nGreat body.\n\nKAY\nThe dead body?\n\nJAY\nMan, you have to look at that thing.\n\nLAUREL (O.S.)\nDr. White.\n\nKAY\n(pointing at the Arquillian)\nRecognize him?\n\nJAY\nYeah, he looks like the big guy I saw down at headquarters, only deader.\n\nLAUREL (CONT'D)\n(louder)\nDr. White.\n\nKAY\nWhat do you think killed him?\n\nJAY\nA bug?\n\nJay, in conversation with Kay, does not respond to what is not his name. Laurel enters the frame.\n\nLAUREL\n(shouting)\nDR. WHITE!\n\nKay nudges Jay.\n\nKAY\nYou're up, Slugger.\n\nJay turns and races across the room to rejoin her.\n\nLAUREL\nLook at this.\n\nJay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's ear.\n\nJAY\nWhat the hell is that?\n\nHe reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft CLICK --\n\n-- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch.\n\nJay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and Rosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial skull.\n\nA TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD.\n\nThough not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.\n\nThe Tiny Little Green Man forces words out of his mouth.\n\n\"ROSENBERG\"\nMust -- to pre -- prevent -- -- contest?\n\nJAY\nIt's all right -- What are you trying to say? Struggle?\n\nLAUREL\nWar?\n\nThe Green Man nods vigorously. That's it.\n\nBALTIAN\n(faltering)\nGalaxy is on -- or -- or -- Orion's -- Be-Be... What is word?\n\nJAY\nBed? Belt? Orion's Belt?\n\nThe Green man nods again, falls, and dies. The cat staring from above meows in sadness. Jay and Laurel look at the little dead alien, then at each other.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\n\"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt?\"  The hell does that mean? (turns around) Hey! Dr., uh, whatever, come here!\n\nKay begins over. Laurel looks at them.\n\nLAUREL\n\"Doctor Whatever\"? You're not with the Department of Public Health, are you?\n\nKay looks at the mess -- the body, the little dead man.\n\nKAY\nRosenberg. Ah, damn. The Arquillians will not like this. He was one of the royal family.\n\nLaurel smiles.\n\nLAUREL\nI knew it. This is an alien. And you're from some government agency who wants to keep it under wraps...\n\nKay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel.\n\nJAY\nHe said \"to prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt.\"\n\nKay puts on his glasses, Jay follows as Kay starts adjusting the neuralyzer.\n\nLAUREL\n... This make total sense. How else do you\nexplain New York? The other night I'm in a\ncab, this guy...\n\nFLASH! Kay blanks her out.\n\nKAY\n\"Galaxy on Orion's Belt\" doesn't make sense.\n\nJAY\nThat's what the little dude inside the big dude's head said. Right after...\n(seeing the dazed Laurel)\nDamn, man, you did the flashy thing already.\n\nLAUREL\n(as if awakening)\nWhoever you guys are,  you have to show ID if you're\ngoing to be in the morgue.\n\nKay puts on the glasses again.\n\nKAY\nOf course, young lady. Look at this for me, please.\n\nFLASH! He neuralyzes her again, Jay struggling to put the glasses quickly. Jay slaps his hand.\n\nJAY\nWould you stop that?\n\nKAY\nWhat?\n\nJAY\nThat thing is gonna give her brain cancer or something!\n\nKAY\nNever hurt her before. We have to close all the doors here. Special Services will be here any minute.\n\nThey start walking away.\n\nJAY\n\"Never hurt her before\"?! How many times have you done the flashy thing to this poor woman?!\n\nKAY\n(evasive)\nCouple.\n\nJAY\nAren't you worried about, you know, long term damage?\n\nKAY\n(more evasive)\nLittle.\n\nJAY\nHave you ever flashy-thinged me?\n\nKAY\nNah.\n\nJAY\nI ain't playin' with ya! Have ya?\n\nKAY\nNo.\n\nEXT. MORGUE - NIGHT\n\nJay and Kay exit the morgue and walk towards their car.\n\nJAY\nI think I should be in charge of the flashy thing department.\n\nKAY\nNot while I'm around, ace.\n\nJAY\nYou won't be happy till you fricassee someone's brain out.\n\nAn MIB containment vehicle pulls up, and two men dressed in black suits get out.\n\nKAY\n(to an MIB Agent)\nWe've got two dead aliens in there, and a deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory.\n\nAGENT\nYes, sir.\n\nJay stares at him.\n\nKAY\nMake it a happy memory.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. ZAP EM VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT\n\nThe Zap Em van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside, throaty WAILS of frustration can be heard.\n\nInside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his way into it.\n\nHe BELLOWS in rage and it finally CRACKS a hinge. Edgar snaps it up, and wrenches the top off the box.\n\nInside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty.\n\nEdgar gets angry.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. ZAP EM VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT\n\nThe van shakes as Edgar wallows.\n\nEDGAR\nWHERE IS IT?!\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MIB BUILDING - MAGIC HOUR\n\nAs lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING\n\nDespite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast.\n\nKay is in a computer, slightly disheveled. On the screen, some sort of database search software. He types \"RESTON, ELIZABETH ANN\" on name, \"TRURO\". The image changes to a satellite view of North America, while the word \"SEARCHING\" blinks, encouraging patience. The printout changes to\n\"SUBJECT ACQUIRED.\" It quickly zooms in on the Northeast.\n\nKay types some more. On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Massachusetts. As Kay types some more, Jay's voice is heard.\n\nJAY (OS)\nHey, Zed.\n\nJay appears holding a cup of coffee.\n\nJAY\nDoesn't anybody believe in sleep around here?\n\nZED\nThe twins keep us on Centaurian time -- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months -- you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a psychotic episode.\n\nThe large screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION ORION.\n\nZED\nHere's Orion; the brightest grouping of\nstars in the northern sky...\n(pointing)\nand here's Orion's belt --\n\nHe indicates the three stars that make up the belt.\n\nJAY\nThat's what the little guy was talking about, \"To prevent war, the galaxy's on Orion's belt...\"\n\nZED\nThere are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The belt is just these three stars; galaxies are huge, made up of billions of stars.\nYou heard wrong.\n\nJAY\nLook, whatever, I know what I heard.\n\nBack to Kay, the computer zooms, then a city, then a neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, the \"Elizabeth Ann Reston\", is tending to her garden. Whoever she is, she's lovely. Kay smiles as  Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars'll be out tonight. He then types and the image freezes on her face. Jay is standing behind him.\n\nJAY\nPretty lady...\n\nKay clicks something, the software blackens and goes \"Subject Lost\". Jay drags a chair and sits down, sipping his coffee, as Kay rearranges his desk.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\nThe grumpy guy's story is starting to come into focus a little bit here. You were the guy in the picture you showed me with the flowers.  And, I take it, she never got those flowers.\n\n\nKAY\nNo.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\nSo, what, she ever get married or anything?\n\nKAY\nNo.\n\nJay looks at him: \"Is this me in thirty years?\" Kay rolls his eyes.\n\nJAY\nWell, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.\n\nKAY\nTry it.\n\n\nZED (O.S.)\nKay.\n\nKay gets up, Jay follows, up to Zed in the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering LIGHT.\n\nSome lights are starting to go out.\n\nZED\nWe've had twelve jumps in the last hour. Redgick was just the beginning.\n\nJAY\nWhat do they know that we don't know?\n\nKay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Another light flickers out.\n\nKAY\nWhy do rats desert the ship?\n(to the twins)\nGo to Lem Sat IV with a proton induction thermoscan, please.\n\nON THE SCREEN Earth changes to a green radar-like diagram.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nThank you. Okay, Lem Sat XVIII.\n\nNow there's a view of the earth from space. Nothing unusual.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nAll right, four thousand.\n\nNow we're looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see something that doesn't belong in this picture:\n\nA BATTLE CRUISER far off to one side of the earth.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nThat's an Arquillian battle cruiser.\n\nZEED\nAnd we've got a dead Arquillian prince.\n\nA COMMUNICATION STARTS COMING OVER THE SPEAKERS -- a sound like a cat and mouse caught in a blender.\n\nKAY\nSpeak of the devil.\n\nThe communication continues.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nThey sound pissed.\n\nThe communication continues.\n\nZED\n(to the twins)\nBoys, translate that and step on it!\n(to Kay)\nGo to Rosenberg's store and see what you can turn up.\n\nKay and Jay walk away.\n\nZED (CONT'D)\nAnd Kay -- Give the kid a weapon.\n\nZed glances back to see the huge gun turrets on the Arquillian Battle Cruiser HUM and WHIR as they swing around into position, pointed down at the unwitting planet below.\n\nIN THE EQUIPMENT LOCKER Kay pulls out the ENORMOUS, MANY-BARRELED SHOTGUN.\n\nKAY\nSeries four de-atomizer.\n\nJAY\nI like that.\n\nKay pulls out another weapon, the TINIEST GUN WE'VE EVER SEEN.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\n\"Noisy Cricket.\"\n\nJAY\nKay, no, no, come on, man. You get a series four de-atomizer and I get a \"Midget Cricket?!\"\n\nKay panics and pushes Jay's hand away as he almost points the gun at him.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\n(looks at the gun) I'm afraid I'm going to break it.\n\nINT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY\n\nOut the window behind him, we can see the Zap-Em van, double parked in the street in front. SMASH! EDGAR smashes the revolving door of Rosenberg's jewelry shop. EDGAR steps inside.\n\nAll the gems and jewels are under glass counters. Edgar starts SMASHING the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside.\n\nEdgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed pictures on the walls. He stops at one particular picture, staring intently at it. It's Rosenberg a glamor shot of Rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed on a satin pillow. There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some posed with Rosenberg, some by itself. This animal was important to Rosenberg.\n\nEdgar retches, as if got to some conclusion. From outside, the ROAR of an engine distracts Edgar. He turns around, in time to see the van lurch as a tow truck lifts its front wheels off the ground.\n\nEXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY\n\nEDGAR rushes outside as the tow truck DRIVER gets the van up on the hoist.\n\nEDGAR\nHey, that's my truck!\n\nDRIVER\nAnd make sure you tell them that at the impound.\n\nEdgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve gauge. He points it at the tow truck Driver. The tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun.\n\nDRIVER (CONT'D)\nPlease...\n\nHe keeps hitching up the van. The MiB car parks nearby, JAY and KAY enter the ramsacked jewelry shop.\n\nINT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY\n\nThey look around and see the recent demolition caused by Edgar. Jay furrows his brow.\n\nJAY\nWho robs a jewelry store and leaves the jewels?\n\nKAY\nSomeone who's not looking for jewels.\n\nJay moves behind the counter. On the wall there is an ornate locker full of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS, and several PHOTOS OF A CAT on the wall.\n\nJAY\nThis guy had a serious crush on his cat.\n\nJay's attention is broken by a gunshot. Outside, EDGAR, the farmer's rifle and the driver's shotgun, heads for the tow truck.\n\nJay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face?\n\nJay points the Noisy Cricket at him and YELLS...\n\nJAY\nKay! GET DOWN!\n\nAnd then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar is driving down the street as Jay picks himself up, passing by a Kay that's lying down, covered in glass shards.\n\nJAY\nMan! That's him. That's the bug! In the Edgar suit!\n\nJay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar.\n\nKay runs out after Jay.\n\nEXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY\n\nJay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into some garbage, while his SHOT...\n\nHits the rigging between the Zap-Em  Van and the town truck, separating the two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it accelerates too quickly.\n\nEdgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire.\n\nJAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through the air and CRASHING through the window of a parked car.\n\nKay appears and  yanks Jay out of the car.\n\nKAY\nWe do not discharge our weapons in view of the public.\n\nJAY\nCan we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up the world if we don't...\n\nKAY\nThere's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this\nplanet, and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they don't know about it.\n\nKay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the store. There's smoking rubble everywhere.\n\nKAY\nDon't worry about the bug. He's not leaving town. We've got his ship.\n\nAfter gesturing to the back of the Zap-Em van, where Edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone.\n\nKAY\n(into phone)\nZed, we're gonna need a containment crew down here at McDougal, south of Houston.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\nBack at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one every five or ten seconds. A WARNING BUZZER is sounding, over and over, and HUMAN STAFFERS are rushing left and right.\n\nZED is in his office.\n\nZED\nContainment may be a moot point, my friend. The exodus continues. It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.\n\nZed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor.\n\nZED\nYou sorry little ingrates!\n\nThe worms dismiss Zed, and then start singing a melody similar to the \"Star-Spangled Banner\".\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nWhat about the Arquillians?\n\nZED\nWe've only translated a part of the message so far: \"Deliver the Galaxy.\"\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nNo, they don't want much, do they?\n\nZED\nOh, it gets better... They're holding us responsible.\n\nHe looks up at the screen. It reads:\nMIB\nDELIVER THE GALAXY.\n\nCut to:\nEXT. UPTOWN NEWSSTAND - DAY\n\nThe tow truck SQUEALS to a halt at a curb.  EDGAR gets out and walks away, fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar.\n\nEDGAR\nWhere do you keep your dead?\n\nVENDOR\n(thinks)\nI don't have any dead.\n\nEDGAR\nWhere?!\n\nVENDOR\nI don't know, the city morgue!\n\nEdgar shoves him away roughly. But before he leaves, his eye catches a postcard display marked \"LANDMARKS OF THE NEW YORK CITY AREA.\" Edgar stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at. He reaches out and picks up a color postcard.\n\nHe raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and hurries off.\n\nVENDOR\nThat's three for a dollar, sir!\n\nCut to:\nEXT.

STREET - KEY KIOSK - DAY\n\nKay's LTD SCREECHES to a halt in front of the kiosk on Orchard Street. JAY and KAY leap out and Jay spots the VENDOR on the counter. He's wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face aquiver with ticks and mannerisms. He has a small dog in front of him.\n\nJay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter.\n\nJAY\nOf course that guy's an alien. That's gotta be the worst disguise I've ever seen.\n\nA voice answers him, but not the Vendor's.\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nYou don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.\n\nJay looks down. The voice is coming from the dog. This is FRANK THE PUG. Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to make sure no one hears.\n\nKAY\nYou busy, Frank?\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nSorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my ride's leaving in --\n\nKay grabs Frank. He yelps like, well, a dog.\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nHey! Get your paws off me!\n\nKAY\nCall the pound. We got a stray.\n\nPASSERBYS glare at Kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor little dog. Jay tries to explain.\n\nJAY\nThe, uh...dog owes my friend some money.\n\nKAY\n(to Frank) Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nI know nothing.\n\nKAY\nNot a thing?\n\nKay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer.\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nStop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of a galaxy. They thought he would be safe here on earth.\n\nKAY\nAnd the bug had other plans.\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nThe galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe. If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the\nArquillians goodbye.\n\nJAY\nAsk him about the belt.\n\nKAY\n(to Frank)\nRosenberg said something about a galaxy on \"Orion's belt.\" What's he talking about, Frank?\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nBeats me.\n\nKay shakes Frank the Pug once more.\n\nJAY\n(to a person passing by)\nThey're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nThe galaxy is here.\n\nKAY\nHere?\n\nJAY\nThe galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and planets? How's it here?\n\nIf a dog can smirk, Frank does.\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nYou humans, when're you gonna learn that size doesn't matter? Just 'cause something's important, doesn't mean it's not very, very small.\n\nKAY\nHow small?\n\nFRANK THE PUG\nTiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked before the flight.\n\nKay lets go of Frank, turns to Jay, who is lost in thought.\n\nKAY\n(to Frank the Pug) Get out of here. (then to Jay) The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.\n\nJay suddenly notices Frank the Pug bark at a cat farther down the sidewalk.\n\nJAY\nKay...\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MORGUE - DAY\n\nIn the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying.\n\nLaurel jumps.\n\nLAUREL\nBoy, when you want attention --\n\nShe pets the cat. As she does, the cat's collar shines in the light. Laurel turns the name tag to face her.\n\nCLOSE ON A PRECIOUS JEWEL, AND THE WORD \"ORION.\"\n\nAs it is written across the collar of the cat.\n\nLAUREL (O.S)\n\"Orion.\" That's a pretty name.\n\nFrom out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING.\n\nLaurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a marble that has a glowing thing inside it.\n\nLAUREL (CONT'D)\nWhat's this?\n\nShe peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement.\n\nLAUREL\nWow.\n\nINT. ICON - DAY\n\nIt's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes\nbeatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield.\n\nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nEdgar enters the morgue, shotgun in one hand. He gets to the bell on the countertop, BANGS it over and over. Orion hisses, and rushes inside the morgue. The morgue attendant, TONY, emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas Shrugged and a fly swatter.\n\nTONY\nThank you for making sure the bell works.\n\nSuddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY. Edgar winces.\n\nTONY (CONT'D)\n(to Edgar)\nWhat's up, Farmer John?\n\nEDGAR\nA man came in here earlier. A dead man.\n\nTONY\nAnd this means what to me?\n\nEDGAR\nHe was a very dear friend of mine. And I believe he had an animal with him. A gift I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to me. I would like it back.\n\nTONY\nI'll need a picture ID, written proof of ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of kinship with --\n\nWHACK! Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its maker. Edgar grits his teeth.\n\nTONY (CONT'D)\n-- the deceased.\n\nEDGAR\nDon't -- do that.\n\nWHACK! Still another fly goes down.\n\nTONY\nDo what?\n\nEDGAR\nDon't -- do it.\n\nTony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve.\n\nTONY (CONT'D)\nOh, man!\n\nHe ducks under the counter --\n\n-- and comes up with two cans of bug spray. Edgar exhales an inhuman growl, and the terrified face of Tony is seen before we...\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MORGUE - DAY\n\nKay's LTD pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and JAY and KAY jump out.\n\nJAY\nLook, Kay, let me handle this one.\n\nKAY\nWhat?\n\nJAY\nAll we gotta do is get a cat. It's not really that hard. But if you go in, you'll lay your Jack Webb on her. Flash your brain ray all in her face. She'll wind up with leukemia. She's a doctor. She\ndon't need you flashing away half her med school classes. Five minutes.\n\nKAY\nTwo minutes!\n\nJAY\nOK.\n\nAnd he continues into the morgue, leaving Kay waiting outside.\n\nINT. MORGUE - DAY\n\nLAUREL SLAMS into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by EDGAR. He leans in, close, furious, the driver's pistol in one hand.\n\nEDGAR\nWhere is the animal?!\n\nLAUREL\nI told you, I don't know!\n\nOrion is running behind their backs.\n\nEDGAR\nLet's see if we can find it.\n\nHe grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue. Then  the BELL and a VOICE from the corridor outside.\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nHello? Anybody here?\n\nEdgar stops.  The bell DINGS again.\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nHello?\n\n\nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nIn the corridor, JAY looks around. No Tony, no answer to the bell.  He DINGS once more, then heads into the back.\n\nINT. MORGUE - DAY\n\nJAY comes into the morgue. LAUREL is in there, standing right up next to an examination table, but there is no corpse on the table, just a sheet draped over it. She just stands there, in the middle of the room, staring at Jay.\n\nJAY\nUh, hi.\n\nLAUREL\n(oddly)\nHello.\n\nJAY\n(flashes a badge)\nI'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth precinct. A cat came in here with a corpse the other day. \"Orion\" on the name tag.\n\nLAUREL\nYes. That's right.\n\nJAY\nRight, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a witness in a murder case and I'm going to need to take it with me.\n\nLAUREL\nI don't know where the cat is.\n\nJAY\nYou don't?\n\nLAUREL\nNo.\n(lowers her voice to a whisper)\nMaybe you could take me with you instead.\n\nJay looks at her.\n\nJAY\nDamn, you do start fast, don't you?\n\nLAUREL\nI'd really like to go with you. Now.\n\nJay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this woman. Edgar is seen below the table, trying to see through the sheet, grabbing Laurel's ankle with one hand and clenching the gun with the other.\n\nJAY\nAnd, uh, why exactly is that?\n\nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nKAY comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor.  He checks his watch, then leans against the counter and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. Waiting.\n\nINT. MORGUE - DAY\n\nLaurel seems to be going crazy. She seems irritated with him, but it doesn't go with what she's saying.\n\nLAUREL\nI have something I need to show you.\n\nShe looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist. Edgar does a heads up as if thinking \"Huh?\".\n\nJAY\nNow slow down, you don't have to hit the gas like that.\n\nShe leans in and lowers her voice.\n\nLAUREL\nYou don't understand. You really need to see this.\n\nJAY\nI will, I will. One thing, I got to drive. It's not some macho trip. I'm saying that's the way I get down.\n\nEdgar is rolling his eyes down the table.\n\nLAUREL\nLook...\n\nINT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nKay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a SIZZLE, hit from a gob of goo.\n\nKay furrows his brow. Odd. He looks up, sharply.\n\nAbove him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.\n\nINT. MORGUE - DAY\n\nLaurel is at the end of her rope.\n\nLAUREL\nLook, stud, I don't know how many more times I'm going to get to tell you this. There's something --\n\nShe points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her.\n\nLAUREL (CONT'D)\n-- that you have to help me with.\n\nJay's smile vanishes as if he understands. Laurel nods positively, Edgar scoffs below. Jay reaches for the gun on his jacket.\n\nORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on top of the examination table.\nEdgar snaps an arm up and grabs the cat, turning the table. Laurel screams.\n\nKay enters the morgue holding a pistol, gets right next to Jay already pointing the Noisy Cricket at Edgar, who holds the pistol under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own.\n\nKAY\nFreeze it, Bug!\n\nEdgar is walking backwards holding Laurel.\n\nLAUREL\n(to Jay)\nCHRIST, are you THICK!\n\nJAY\nHow was I supposed to know!?!\n\nLAUREL\nWhat did I have to do, SING it for you!?!\n\nJAY\nIf you weren't coming on like--\n\nLAUREL\nOh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence, men just --\n\nEDGAR\nEverybody shut UP!\n\nKAY\nLet her go, Shit Eater.\n\nEDGAR\nListen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that kind of talk in my end of the universe, but compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all right?!\n\nKAY\nYou're breakin' my heart. Show me your face and I'll cure all your ills.\n\nEDGAR\nHave you ever pulled the wings off a fly?\n\nEdgar grabs Laurel's neck.\n\nEDGAR (CONT'D)\nWould you care to see the fly get even?\n\nKAY\nHow far can you go with no ship? If that's what you call that space trash we got locked in the office.\n\nEDGAR\nPut the weapons down!\n\nKAY\nNever gonna happen, Insect.\n\nThe Galaxy is seen hanging from Edgar's gun hand. Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance, slowly, cornering him.\n\nJAY\nIt's okay, Laurel!\n\nLAUREL\nHOW is it okay?!\n\nJAY\nI mean it's going to be okay!\n\nEDGAR\nDon't bet on it, meat sack.\n\nAnd with that he turns, leaps --\n\n-- and CRASHES right through the window, into the air shaft.\n\nEXT. MORGUE (SIDE STREET) - DUSK\n\nEDGAR, still clutching LAUREL, EXPLODES up over a railing.\n\nNobody looks twice as Edgar, dragging Laurel (with his arm over her mouth), races toward the nearby  Manhattan Street.\n\nINT. MORGUE - AIR SHAFT - DUSK\n\nJay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and the walls are smooth anyway.  They turn and run back.\n\nEXT. OUTSIDE MORGUE - DUSK\n\nEDGAR, with LAUREL, RUNS right in front of a CAB, which screeches to a halt inches from them.\n\nINT. MORGUE - DUSK\nJay and Kay  rush out of the morgue.\n\nINT.  CAB - EXT. OUTSIDE MORGUE - DUSK\nEdgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the Cabbie out the door. He then pulls the wooden seat-beads, throws them atop the Cabbie, and pushes Laurel in before him, leaving her behind the wheel. He then tosses a crown that wason the car panel on the cabbie before taking the seat and closing the door.\n\nEdgar shows Laurel the POSTCARDS  he took from the display on the newsstand.\n\nEDGAR\nTake me here.\n\nLAUREL\nWhat???\n\nEdgar reveals two bug mandibles inside his mouth and SLAMS HIS FOOT on the gas pedal.\n\nLaurel's head snaps back as the car rocks forward.\n\nThe furious Cab Driver runs off after it, still yelling as he disappears around the corner.\n\nCUT TO:\nINT. CAB - AFTERNOON\n\nEdgar opens his mouth and swallows the icon, as Laurel stares in disbelief. He smiles.\n\nCUT TO: NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK\nThe car screeches out into traffic, swerving wildly as Laurel is forced to make a 90-degree turn. The car fishtails wildly, swiping an oncoming car as it straightens and heads into the traffic.\n\nCUT TO: OUTSIDE MORGUE\nA second later, KAY and JAY rush out into the street. The cab is nowhere to be seen. Jay runs into the street, noticing the wooden beads and crown.\n\nJAY\nHe's in a cab!\n\nAnd Jay jumps down the rain and runs towards the street. Kay doesn't even change his expression as he walks the other way.\n\nCUT TO: NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK\nJay is running down the street, where DOZENS of cabs are waiting at the intersection.  He's running from cab to cab, and points his gun to one where there is a passenger in the front.\n\nJAY\nDon't move! Don't move! Don't move!\n\n-- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found.\n\nPASSENGER\nHey, man, what?\n\nUp ahead the light turns green and the tide of taxis wash away, leaving Jay on the street. Kay stops the LTD right next to Jay.\n\nKAY\nHe's not leaving the planet in a cab. Let's go.\n\nJay enters through the back door. Kay drives away.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nJay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in frenetic activity in response to the threat from above.\n\nKAY\n(to tech at a desk)\nCome with me. Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's not leaving the island.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nWhat've we got from our friends upstairs?\n\nZED\nSame thing: \"Deliver the galaxy.\"\n\nKAY\nYeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but we've got his ship. He's got to be looking for a way out.\n\nJust then, a loud ALARM wails.\n\nCOMPUTER VOICE\nWarning. Protonic fusion detection.\n\nAT THE MAIN VIEWING SCREEN, A GREEN LINE shoots out from the Arquillian ship, striking the North Pole.\n\nEvery bell, whistle and light imaginable is going off.\n\nJAY\nWHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?!\n\nZED\nArquillian battle rules, kid. First we get an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we have a galactic standard week to respond.\n\nJAY\nA galactic standard week? How the hell long is that?\n\nKAY\nOne hour.\n\nJAY\nOne hour? Then what?\n\nKay seems to be holding laughter. Viewing the screen, it now reads:\nMIB\nDELIVER THE GALAXY\nOR THE EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED...\nSORRY\n\nJAY (O.S.)\nThat's bullshit.\n\nThe message now has a countdown that starts rolling from 1:00:00:00 in \"Earth Time Remaining\"\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nKid, to keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nAnd whatever planet it's on.\n\nJAY\nYou're talking about US!\n\nZED\nSucks, doesn't it?\n\nAs Kay and Zed look through a map, Jay walks, deep in thought. Over him we hear:\n\nKAY\nI'm getting the location of every interstellar vehicle within 100 miles.\n\nZED\nI already did. Frank took the last ship on the planet.\n\nKAY\nSnedens Landing and Throg's Neck.\n\nZED\nThey're gone.\n\nKAY\nAtlantic City?\n\nZED\nAdios.\n\nKAY\nBayonne?\n\nZED\nGone.\n\nKAY\nThere's Three Mile Island.\n\nZED\nGone.\n\nJAY\nY'all.\n\nKAY\nStaten Island?\n\nZED\nGone, thank God.\n\nJAY\nFellas!\n\nKAY\nWe're running out of time. If the bug leaves with the galaxy--\n\nJAY\nHey. Old guys!\n\nKay and Zed both look up at once, scowling.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\nDo those still work?\n\nThey follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by --\n\n-- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we --\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT\n\n-- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away. EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind her, still holding his weapon on her.\n\nEDGAR\nYou're coming with me.\n\nLAUREL\nWhat?! Why?!\n\nEDGAR\nIt's a long trip. I'll need a snack.\n\nAnd he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships.  It's shown a postcard on the passenger's seat featuring the World's Fair towers.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT\n\nKay turns sharply to the right, SMACKING Jay around. Looking up ahead, he sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel.\n\nJAY\nWait, the tunnel?!\n\nKAY\nYou know a better way to Queens?\n\nJAY\nIt's gonna be packed.\n\nEXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\nThe LTD races through the tunnel at top speed. It's clear driving for a few seconds, but then they round a bend --\n\n-- and there's a traffic jam up ahead.\n\nINT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT\n\nKay approaches the line of cars at top speed, with no intention of slowing down. Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.\n\nKAY\nRemember the little button?\n\nJAY\nYeah?!\n\nKAY\nPush the red button.\n\nJay JAMS his finger down on the red flashing button.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nYou may want to wear a seat belt.\n\nEXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MIB LTD - NIGHT\n\nAs the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve, its shape actually changing. The sides and back extend as some sort of endoskeleton pushes the \"normal\" panels out. It becomes a larger, wirier machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and metallic tendons.\n\nJAY\nKay! Kay!\n\nKay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last possible moment it swerves off to the side, a SUCKING SOUND coming from underneath it. Jay is heard screaming as...\n\nInstead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic below.\n\nIt keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels clinging to the roof of the tunnel.\n\nINT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT\n\nJay falls from his seat with a CLUNK, onto the upside down ceiling of the car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they tear through the tunnel, ZOOMING over the bottlenecked traffic underneath.\n\nKAY\nYou're much too tense. You're a young man. You need to relax. Learn to take some joy in your work.\n\nClose on the car's 8-track player.\n\nKAY (O.S.)\nYou like music?\n\nKay puts on a tape labeled \"Elvis - Promised Land\", which instantly starts playing.\n\nJAY\nMan!\n\nKAY\nThat's better.\n\nKay mouths along with the song, as Jay struggles to position himself on the ceiling.\n\nEXT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT\n\nFrom outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel. A ceiling panel is approaching...\n\nJAY\nKay! Kay!\n\nKay swerves the vehicle to dodge the arrow.\n\n\nINT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT\n\nJAY\nYou do know Elvis is dead?\n\nKAY\nNo, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.\n\nAnd they disappear out the other end of the tunnel --\n\nINT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT\n\n-- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat.\n\nHe cranks the wheel to the left.\n\nEXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT\n\nApproaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window --\n\n-- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT\n\nEDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships, pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top.\n\nLAUREL\nYou don't want to eat me. I'm a very important person on my planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even. There are those who worship me, yes. I'm not trying to impress you with this, I'm just letting you know. It could start a war.\n\nEDGAR\nGood. War means food for my family, all seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot of mouths to feed, your highness.\n\nLAUREL\nYou're a wonderful father, but I'm staying here!\n\nAnd with that she elbows him in the back of the head. Edgar reels, and tosses her in a nearby tree.\n\nLaurel lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the ground.\n\nAbove, Edgar gestures as if \"goodbye\" and just keeps climbing. He eventually enters the flying saucer from a hatch below.\n\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT\n\nThe LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds.\n\nAT THE TRUNK, KAY grab the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet. Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. He hands it to Jay.\n\nJAY\nNow, that's what I'm talking about.\n\nKay gets a similar gun.\n\nKAY\nRoaches check in.\n\nHe cocks the gun. Jay does the same.\n\nJAY\nBut they don't check out.\n\nKay walks away, to get a clear view, Jay follows.\n\nINT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nThe MIB staffers are in frenetic activity as the claxons still ring.\n\nCOMPUTER\nWarning: Eight minutes to the destruction of Earth.\n\nZed watches the monitor reading exactly that. He finally starts to look worried.\n\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT\n\nAs if on cue, the saucer Edgar enter closes and begins to HUM. Lights ignite, and the ship begins to rise.\n\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT\n\nLaurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement.\n\nEXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT\n\nAt Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side, the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible.\n\nBut at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the ball is headed.\n\nAll eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen, his jaw drops --\n\n-- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall behind him. The crowd BOOS viciouly.\n\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT\n\nKay fiddles with the weapon he took from the trunk.\n\nKAY\nWe'll use pulsar level five, sub-sonic implosion factor --\n\nJAY\nWhat?\n\nKay cocks the gun, points it at the sky.\n\nKAY\nJust shoot the damn thing on the count of three.\n\nJay raises his weapon too.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nOne...two... three!\n\nThey pull their triggers. Jay takes a step back from the recoil As two enormous shock waves roll out from the barrel of the guns.\n\nEXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT\n\nThe shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship, then it HITS the ship --\n\n-- which explodes. Hurtling back toward them.\n\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT\n\nThe saucer BREAKS through the flags near the Unisphere and then CRASHES through the enormous steel globe, and THUDS to the earth, CRASHING through brush, dirt and rock...\n\nstopping just a few steps away from Jay and Kay, who just stood there watching the crash-land.\n\nA hatch comes up...revealing Edgar, more decomposed than ever walking slowly toward them, with contained fury.\n\nEDGAR\nYou idiots! You don't get it. I've won. It's over.You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a few seconds you won't even be matter!\n\nKAY\nYou are under arrest for violating number 4-1-53 of the Tycho accord.\n\nKAY\nSo hand over any galaxy you might be carrying and step away from your busted-ass vehicle and put your hands on your head.\n\nEdgar points up and smiles as he walks down the landing ramp.\n\nEDGAR\nI'll put my hands on my head!\n\nEdgar does that.\n\nEDGAR\nLike this?\n\nThen flexes his arms, still encased in flesh. His giant pincers RIP free of the rotting skin.\n\nHe extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be twelve feet across.\n\nNow the skin and clothes on Edgar's legs begins to CRACK and SHRED. They BURST APART, revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs. The bug raises himself aloft on his legs.\n\nHe sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes the way of the arms and legs. The torso EXPLODES in great rendering of cloth and skin, and finally\n\nEdgar's head simply BURSTS apart, SPATTERING against the walls. Edgar now reveals himself as he really is: a giant cockroach, a scaly tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each.\n\nKay and Jay pump their guns and aim at the Bug.\n\nSuddenly the Bug SPITS. And a HUGE, SLIMY WAD OF GOO shoots from him and engulfs both shotguns. The Bug snorts it back, tearing them from Jay and Kay's grasp, then swallowing them.\n\nJay and Kay have only a second to react before --\n\nThe Bug SWIPES at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone brushing aside a gnat -- and SENDS THEM FLYING FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR.\n\nJay and Kay hit the ground with loud grunts.\n\nJAY\nThat did not go at all like I had planned.\n\nKAY\nWhatever happens, don't let him on the second ship.\n\nJAY\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nKAY\nKeep him on this planet.\n\nJAY\nKay, where are you going?\n\nKAY\nGetting my gun back.\n\nJAY\nWhat!?\n\nKay gets to his feet and starts walking after the Bug. Kay steps in front of the departing Bug and yells.\n\nKAY (CONT'D)\nHey, Bug! You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?\n\nThe Bug stops. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off against the giant alien. The Bug's dripping fangs inches from Kay's face.\n\nKAY\nYou're just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me! Eat me!\n\nThe Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS, lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth.\nJAY looks on, in stunned horror...\n\nJAY\nKay! Kay!\n\nThe Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. His mandibles push Kay down the Bug's throat.\n\nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT\n\nLaurel is watching in horror on the tree.\n\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT\nTHE BUG  STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH.\n\nINT. BUG - NIGHT\n\nKay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging.\n\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT\n\nJay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug.\n\nThe concrete HITS the Bug's head -- it falls and gives an angry yelp.\n\nJAY\nWhat's up?\n\nJay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug.\n\nJAY\nYou just going to eat and run, huh? What about dessert?\n\nThe Bug kicks Jay with his second pair of limbs.\n\nThe hurled Jay falls near a burning tree branch. Dizzy, he starts to get up.\n\nJAY\nThat's it? Where you going?This party's just getting started.\n\nHe grabs the burning branch.\n\nJAY\nWhere're you going? Where you going?\n\nJay waves the flames in front of the bug, who dodges the branch.\n\nJAY\nListen. There's one way off this planet, baby, and that's through me.\n\nThe Bug punches Jay in the face. He falls on the ground, and narrowly misses being stepped on.\n\nJay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently vulnerable underbelly, right above him.\n\nHe grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up, into the Bug's gut, when;\n\nThe Bug bends its head down between its legs.\n\nJay falls to the ground again.\n\nThe Bug starts climbing the tower. Jay howls in frustration.\n\nIn frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, grabbing its tail, trying to drag it down. The Bug notes, and looks down. He shakes the tail until Jay is hurled away, sending him SAILING twenty feet through the air.\n\nJay CRASHES into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage.\n\nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT\n\nLaurel's branch breaks, she falls a small bit to the ground, near the burning branch. She promptly gets up.\n\nEXT. WORLD'S FAIR -  NIGHT\n\nThe Bug continues to climb the tower, and in the distance, a battered Jay gets up. Despite struggling to talk, he continues to taunt the Bug. Laurel is watching him from behind a bush.\n\nJAY\nWhere're you going? Why you runnin', huh? I'm still standing. Come on.\n\nJay extends his arm at the creature.\n\nJAY\nBring it. Bring it.\n\nHe notices something on his arm...two cockroaches in his sleeve.\n\nJay has one last desperate idea...He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces.\n\nTENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROACHES pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling like a black glittering river, away from the garbage...\n\nCLOSE ON JAY'S FOOT as he steps on the roach.  CRUNCH.\n\nON THE BUG as he flinches on the ladder -- he hates that sound.\n\nON JAY. He smiles.\n\nJAY\nI'm sorry. Was that your auntie?\n\nON THE BUG. He turns around, anger burning in his eyes.\n\nJay knows he's getting to him. He moves his foot over another roach.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\nThat must mean that's your uncle, huh?\n\nCRUNCH! He crushes another one.\n\nJAY (CONT'D)\nYou know you all look alike.\n\nThe Bug falls down from the steps and starts to walk towards Jay.\n\nJAY\nWell, well. Big bad bug got a bit of a soft spot, huh?\n\nJay keeps crunching roaches while the Bug gets near him . Laurel is still watching.\n\nJAY\nWhat I can't understand is why you...  got to come down here bringing all this ruckus. Snatching up galaxies and everything. My attitude is, don't start nothing, won't be nothing.\n\nThe Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.\n\nJAY\nYou need to ease up out my face before something bad happen to you.\n\nThe triggering noise of the Deatomizer is heard.\n\nJAY\nToo late.\n\nKay BLASTS a hole right in the middle of the Bug's midsection. The front of the Bug's thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay.\n\nThe Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end falls nearby; the head flying behind Jay.\n\nKay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping the atomizer from his slippery fingers.\n\nThe other gun sails off into the darkness. Both spit the bug juice that fall on their mouths.\n\nThe Galaxy drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and CLATTERS to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor.\n\nJay calmly bends down and picks it up, as Kay pulls out his pocket phone and hits a number.\n\nKAY\nZed. Call the Arquillians. Tell 'em we have the galaxy.\n\nZED (O.S)\nYou got it, friend.\n\nKay flips the phone closed.\n\nJAY\nGoing to get your gun back, huh?\n\nKAY\nI like this gun.\n\nAs the two talk, THE FRONT HALF OF THE BUG is crawling in the background.\n\nJAY\nWhile you were in there playing around, I was here doing all the work. First, I had to bean him in the head with this big rock.              Then I was going to hit him with a two-by-four. He kicked me. You know, it hurt. Then I got the fire. I was ''yah'' with the fire.\n\nKAY\nNot bad for your second day of work, is it?\n\nJAY\nThis definitely rates about a  9.0 on my weird-shit-o-meter.\n\nKAY\nShould've been here for the Zeronion migration in  1968. I guess you weren't even alive in '68.\n\nHISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. And just before the jaws snap down on their heads...\n\nBOOM! The Bug's head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further.\n\nThey turn to see...\n\nLAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the barrel smoking.\n\nLAUREL\nInteresting job you guys got.\n\nJay spits the new bug goo that covered him.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nWe see JAY and KAY walking towards the MIB HQ.\n\nJAY\nLook, I know we got rules and everything, but... she did help us bust that bug. Maybe we don't have to flashy thing her.\n\nKay pulls out the neuralyzer.\n\nJAY\nCome on. Who she gonna tell? She hang out with all dead people.\n\nKAY\nIt's not for her.It's for me.\n\nJAY\nWhat?\n\nKAY\n(looking up at the sky) They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.\n\nJAY\nKay, you're scaring your partner.\n\nKAY\nI haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.\n\nJAY\nWait a minute, Kay. I can't do this job by myself.\n\nLAUREL (O.S.)\nHey, guys.\n\nCut to Kay's LTD is parked nearby, LAUREL leaning her back against the car.\n\nLAUREL\nMy apartment isn't anywhere near here. It's not on the same island.\n\nKay starts dialing back the neuralyzer, shows the dials to Jay.\n\nKAY\nDays. Months. Years. Always face it forwards.\n\nHe hands the neuralyzer to Jay. Taps his pocket. Indicates for him to put his glasses on. Jay resists.\n\nKAY\nI've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach. That's one of a hundred memories I don't want.\n\nJay takes the neuralyzer. Slips on his glasses.\n\nKAY\nSee you around, sport.\n\nJay raises the neuralyzer. With a brilliant FLASH, the screen turns white.\n\nJAY\nNo, you won't.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

ELLE, (formerly Laurel), is waiting, leaning against the hood. Tailored black suit. Black shoes. Short-cropped hair. The look never looked better.\n\nELLE\nZed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9 emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks -- Bulls game.\n\nIt's apparent Jay has a new \"hip\" getup - oval-rim sunglasses, long Nehru jacket, and band collar without a necktie.\n\nJAY\nPut in a call for Dennis Rodman, e's from that planet.\n\nELLE\nRodman? You're kidding.\n\nJAY\nNope.\n\nELLE\nNot much of a disguise.\n\nBoth car doors SLAM, Jay drops it in gear, and the LTD BLASTS away from the curb.\n\nEXT. NEW YORK CITY BLOCK - DAY\n\nThe LTD is just one of many cars in a jam-packed Manhattan city block.\n\nFROM UP IN THE CLOUDS\n\nManhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl.\n\nFROM THE STRATOSPHERE\n\nThe east coast of the United States is just part of a much larger land mass.\n\nFROM THE EOSPHERE\n\nNorth America is just a small portion of the planet Earth.\n\nFROM SPACE\n\nEarth is just a tiny ball in our solar system.\n\nFROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MILKY WAY\n\nOur solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field.\n\nFROM OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY\n\nThe Milky Way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy spirals.\n\nFROM THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE\n\nThere seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists seems to be contained in one tiny ball --\n\n-- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red dirt.\n\nAn ALIEN HAND reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering and bouncing across the dirt, where it HITS another ball. The hand grabs both balls, and puts the marbles in a pouch, where they CLICK a dozen other big blue balls just like it.\n\nFADE OUT.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/171036", "artist_names": "Christina Aguilera", "full_title": "Not Myself Tonight by\u00a0Christina\u00a0Aguilera", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/eee353dae3e1b2ed88d0181cfbbcb7f4.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/eee353dae3e1b2ed88d0181cfbbcb7f4.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 171036, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 230604, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1656240202, "path": "/Christina-aguilera-not-myself-tonight-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 13, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Christina-aguilera-not-myself-tonight-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2010, "month": 4, "day": 6}, "release_date_for_display": "April 6, 2010", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Apr. 6, 2010", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bb1ce1ec12a707e92466156062782c20.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bb1ce1ec12a707e92466156062782c20.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 11893}, "title": "Not Myself Tonight", "title_with_featured": "Not Myself Tonight", "updated_by_human_at": 1656240202, "url": "https://genius.com/Christina-aguilera-not-myself-tonight-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1211", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/58efea3ee217eac7ea7a76563ee9edd3.1000x333x1.jpg", "id": 1211, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f72345df98b6937ea8a111daa5767739.400x400x1.jpg", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Christina Aguilera", "slug": "Christina-aguilera", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Christina-aguilera", "iq": 478}, "artist": "Christina Aguilera", "lyrics": "Not Myself Tonight Lyrics[Intro]\nYou know\nTonight I'm feeling a little out of control\nIs this me?\nYou wanna get crazy?\n'Cause I don't give a...

out\nOn the front step and a car rolls by with the windows rolled down\nAnd that War song is playing, \u201cWhy Can\u2019t We Be Friends?\u201d\nSomeone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs\n[Chorus 1]\nFunny the way it is, and if you think about it\nSomebody\u2019s going hungry and someone else is eating out\nFunny the way it is, not right or wrong\nSomebody\u2019s heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe way your mouth feels in a lover's kiss\nLike a pretty bird on a breeze or water to a fish\nA bomb blast brings the building crashing to the floor\nHear the laughter while the children play war\n\n[Chorus 2]\nFunny the way it is, and if you think about it\nOne kid walks ten miles to school, another\u2019s dropping out\nFunny the way it is, not right or wrong\nOn a soldier\u2019s last breath, his baby\u2019s being born\n\n[Bridge]\nStanding on the bridge, watch the water passing under me\nIt must\u2019ve been much harder when there was no bridge, just water\nNow the world is small, remember how it used to be\nWith mountains and oceans and winters and rivers and stars\n\n[Breakdown]\nWatch the sky in a jet plane, so far out of my

don't like my style\nWe can take it to the street\nWe can take it to the street\n\n[Verse 1: Shwayze]\nYo\nLittle girls in the city, dress up pretty\nGo out and get messed up and shitty\nGirls by the sea, dress like hippies\nAnd rock love beads and go skinny-dippin'\nGirls in the hills, go day trippin'\nTo get their nails done, and hair straightened\nLittle girls in the 818\nGet hot when I roll over Laurel Canyon\n[Pre-Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]\nLet me tell you about a girl I know\nShe like hip-hop and rock 'n' roll\nShe walk slow down the avenue\nI ain't met her, but I'll get her when I do\nLet me tell you about a girl I love\nShe stay at home 'cause she hate the club\nBaby butt, pretty little features\nI ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her\n\n[Chorus: Cisco]\nBaby will you be my Corona and lime?\nAnd I will be your main squeeze\nAnd if your brother don't like my style\nWe can take it to the street\nWe can take it to the street\n\n[Verse 2: Shwayze]\nGirls in New York look like giraffes\nLong neck, long legs, tiny tits and ass\nGirls from L.A. rock oversized shades\nAnd chill all day, 'cause they already paid\nGirls in Miami, string bikinis\nBump techno by DJ Tiesto\nGirls from Detroit, like electro\nAnd dance all night 'til they break they neck, yo\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]\nLet me tell you about a girl I know\nShe like hip-hop and
