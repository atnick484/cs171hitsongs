goodbye\n[Verse 2]\nThey held each other tight\nAs they drove on through the night\nThey were so excited!\nWe got just one shot of life\nLet's take it while we're still not afraid\nBecause life is so brief\nAnd time is a thief when you're undecided\nAnd like a fistful of sand\nIt can slip right through your hands\n\n[Chorus]\nYoung hearts be free tonight\nTime is on your side\nDon't let them put you down\nDon't let 'em push you around\nDon't let 'em ever change your point of view\n\n[Verse 3]\nParadise was closed\nSo they headed for the coast in a blissful manner\nThey took a two-room

thing to put them away\nI drank four or five bottles of wine\nI kept a glass in my hand all the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nBreakin' those habits\nWas hard to do\nBut nothin' compared to the changes\nThat you put me through\n[Chorus]\nTryin' to live my life without you babe\nIt's the hardest thing I'll ever do\nTryin' to forget the love we once shared\nIt was the hardest burden I'll ever bear\n\n[Verse 3]\nI had the worst reputation in town\nFor chasing all the women around\nI thought changin' my way of living was hard to do\nBut it's nothin' compared to the changes that you put me through\n\n[Bridge]\nI've done everything I tried to do\nBut it's gonna take a miracle to get me over you\n\n[Chorus]\nTryin' to live my life without you babe\nIt's the hardest thing I'll ever

To Say LyricsLucky at love, well maybe so\nThere's still a lot of things you'll never know\nLike why each time the sky begins to snow, you cry\n\nYou're faithful to her in your careless way\nAnd so you miss her when she's far away\nBut every time you think you've got it straight, you fall\n\nYou face the future with a weary past\nThose dreams you banked upon are fading fast\nYou know you love her, but it may not last, you fear\nIt's never easy and it's never clear\nWho's to navigate and who's to steer\nAnd so you flounder, drifting ever near the rocks\n\nIt's hard to say where love went wrong\nIt's hard to say just when (it's so hard to say)\nIt's hard to walk away from love\nIt may never come again\n\nYou do your best to keep your hand in play\nAnd try to keep those lonesome blues at bay\nYou think you're winning but it's hard to say, sometimes\n\nIt's hard to say where love went wrong\nIt's hard to say just when (it's so hard to say)\nIt's hard to walk away from love\nIt may never come again\n\nLucky at love, well maybe so\nThere's still a lot of things you'll never know\nLike why each time the sky begins to snow, you cry\nWell, you cry\nOoh, you still have to cryYou

blues\nAnd I've given up hope for the afternoon soaps\nAnd a bottle of cold brew\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nIs it any wonder I'm not crazy?\nIs it any wonder I'm sane at all?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I'm so tired of losing, I got nothing to do\nAnd all day to do it\nWell, I'd go out cruisin', but I've no place to go\nAnd all night to get there\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nIs it any wonder I'm not a criminal?\nIs it any wonder I'm not in jail?\n\n[Chorus]\nIs it any wonder I've got too much time on my hands?\nIt's ticking away with my sanity\nI've got too much time on my hands\nIt's hard to believe such a calamity\nI've got too much time on my hands\nAnd it's ticking away, ticking away from me\n\nToo much time on my hands\n(It's t-t-t-t-ticking away)\nToo much time on my hands\n(And I don't know what to do with myself)\nToo much time on my hands\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\nToo much time on my hands\nToo much time on my hands\nToo much time on my hands\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, I'm a jet fuel genius - I can solve

single time to prove the county wrong\nHis mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow\nSomething always told me they were reading Tommy wrong\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison\nI looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son\nI still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy\n\"Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun\"\n[Chorus]\nPromise me, son, not to do the things I've done\nWalk away from trouble if you can\nNow it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek\nI hope you're old enough to understand\nSon, you don't have to fight to be a man\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky\nIn her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man\nOne day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling\nThey took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them\nTommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying\nThe torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand\nHe reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture\nAs a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise me, son, not to do the things I've done\nWalk away from trouble if you can\nNow it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek\nI hope you're old enough to understand\nSon, you don't have to fight to be a man\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe Gatlin boys just laughed at him\nWhen he walked into the barroom\nOne of them got up and met him half way cross the floor\nTommy turned around they said, \"Hey look, old yella's leavin'\"\nBut you could've heard a pin drop\nWhen Tommy stopped and locked the door\nTwenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him\nHe wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all\nWhen Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing\nHe said, \"This one's for Becky\" as he watched the last one fall\nN' I heard him say\nYou might also like[Chorus 2]\nI promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done\nI walk away from trouble when I can\nNow please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek\nAnd Papa, I sure hope you understand\nSometimes you gotta fight when you're a man\n\n[Outro]\nEveryone considered him the coward of the county3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/924884", "artist_names": "Dionne Warwick", "full_title":

filled with out-of-towners touring\nI knew that it wasn't my thing\nI really wasn't caring, but I felt my eyes staring\nAt a guy who stuck out in the crowd\nHe had the kind of body that would shame Adonis\nAnd a face that would make any man proud\n[Chorus]\nOh, what, wow\nHe's the greatest dancer\nOh, what, wow\nThat I've ever seen\nOh, what, wow\nHe's the greatest dancer\nOh, what,

please take me home\nHe wears the finest clothes, the best designers, heaven knows\nOoh, from his head down to his toes\nHalston, Gucci, Fiorucci\nHe looks like a still, that man is dressed to

"My Life Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nGot a call from an old friend, we used to be real close\nSaid he couldn't go on the American way\nClosed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast\nNow he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright\nI don't want you to tell me it's time to come home\nI don't care what you say anymore, this is my life\nGo ahead with your own life, leave me alone\n[Post-Chorus]\nI never said you had to offer me a second chance\n(I never said you had to...)\nI never said I was a victim of circumstance\n(I never said...)\n\n[Refrain]\nI still belong (Still belong)\nDon't get me wrong (Get me wrong)\nAnd you can speak your mind\nBut not on my time\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place\nThen they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else\nAh, but sooner or later, you sleep in your own space\nEither way, it's okay, you wake up with yourself\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright\nI don't want you to tell me it's time to come home\nI don't care what you say anymore, this is my life\nGo ahead with your own life, leave me alone\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI never said you had to offer me a second chance\n(I never said you had to...)\nI never said I was a victim of circumstance\n(Of circumstance...)\nSee Billy

care what you say anymore, this is my life\nGo ahead with your own life, leave me alone\n\n[Outro]\nKeep it to yourself, it's my life\nKeep it to yourself, it's my life\nKeep it to yourself, it's my

down on me, like rivers in my sleep\nAnd in my dream of laughter, you came creepin' with your fears\nTelling me your sorrows, in the tracings of your tears\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's a strange way to tell me you love me\nWhen your sorrow is all I can see\nIf you just want to cry to somebody, don't cry to me, no\nDon't cry to me, no\n[Verse 2]\nDidn't I hear your voice this morning, didn't you call my name?\nI heard you whisper softly, but the words were never plain\nAnd in your dream of darkness, I came shinin' like the sun\nWaiting for the laughter, but the laughter never

(you should know by now)\nYou're a native New Yorker\n(New York girl, ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMusic plays, everyone's dancin' closer and closer\nMakin' friends and findin' lovers\nThere you are, lost in the shadows\nSearchin' for someone (searchin' for someone)\nTo set you free from New York City\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd, whoa\nWhere did all those yesterdays go?\nWhen you still believed\nLove could really be like a Broadway show\nYou were the star, when did it close?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nOh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)\nYou're a native New Yorker\nNo one opens the door\nFor a native New Yorker\n(Runnin' pretty, New York City girl)\n\n[Interlude]\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh\nNative, native, native, ooh)\n\n(Where did all those yesterdays go?\nWhen you still believed\nLove could really be like a Broadway show\nYou were the star)\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're a native New Yorker\nYou should know the score by now\nYou're a native New Yorker\nYou should know the score\nYou should know the score by

name\nWhen the drinks finally hit her, she said \"I'm no quitter\nBut I finally quit living on dreams\nI'm hungry for laughter and here ever after\nI'm after whatever the other life brings\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the mirror I saw him, and I closely watched him\nI thought how he looked out of place\nHe came to the woman, who sat there beside me\nHe had a strange look on his face\nThe big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain\nFor a minute I thought I was dead\nBut he started shaking his big heart was breaking\nHe turned to the woman and said\n[Chorus]\n\"You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille\nWith four hungry children and a crop in the field\nI've had some bad times, lived through some sad times\nBut this time your hurting won't heal\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nAfter he left us I ordered more whiskey\nI thought how she'd made him look small\nFrom the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room\nWe walked without talking at all\nShe was a beauty, but when she came to me\nShe must have thought I'd lost my mind\nI couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her\nKept coming back time after time\n\n[Chorus]\nYou picked a fine time to leave me Lucille\nWith four hungry children and a crop in the field\nI've had some bad times, lived through some sad times\nBut this time your hurting won't heal\nYou picked a fine time to

love that I had\nWith you\nThere's a heaven so earth ain't so bad\n\nAnd tell me\nWhen will our eyes meet?\nWhen can I touch you?\nWhen will this strong yearning end?\nAnd when will I hold you

days are all filled with an easy country charm\nThank God I'm a country boy\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle\nWhen the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle\nAnd life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle\nThank God I'm a country boy\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the work's all done and the sun's setting low\nI pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow\nThe kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low\nThank God I'm a country boy\nI'd play \"Sally Goodin'\" all day if I could\nBut the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good\nSo I fiddle when I can and I work when I should\nThank God I'm a country boy\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle\nWhen the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle\nAnd life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle\nThank God I'm a country boy\nWhoo\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels\nI never was one of them money hungry fools\nI'd rather have my fiddle and my farming tools\nThank God I'm a country boy\nYeah, city folk driving in a black limousine\nA lot of sad people thinking that's a-mighty keen\nWell son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean\nI thank God I'm

life, play my fiddle with pride\nThank God you're a country boy.\"\nMy daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle\nHe taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle\nHe taught me how to love and how to give just a little\nAnd thank God I'm a country boy\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle\nWhen the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle\nLife ain't

we said\nAnd coming apart at the seams\nWe try to talk it over\nBut the words come out too rough\n\n[Refrain]\nI know you were trying\nTo give me the best of your love\n[Verse 2]\nBeautiful faces\nAnd loud, empty places\nLook at the way that we live\nWasting our time on cheap talk and wine\nLeft us so little to give\nThat same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud\nThat we could never rise above\n\n[Refrain]\nBut here in my heart\nI give you the best of my love\n\n[Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling\nYou get the best of my love\n(You get the best of my love)\nOh-oh-oh-oh, sweet darling\nYou get the best of my love\n(You get the best of my love)\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm going back in time\nAnd it's a sweet dream\nIt was a quiet night\nAnd I would be all right\nIf I could go on sleeping\nSee Eagles LiveGet tickets as low as $147You might also like[Verse 3]\nBut every morning\nI wake up and worry\nWhat's gonna happen today\nYou see it your way\nAnd I see it mine\nBut we both
