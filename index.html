            <p class='textInContainer' id="genreTextRock"> Nice choice! Surprisingly, out of the top 50 songs with the most weeks on the board in the last 20 years, only 6 of them have been rock songs. Crazy!</p>
            <p class='textInContainer' id="genreTextRap"> Nice choice! Rap seems to rarely be on the billboard top 100 for a long amount of time, but it's on the rise in recent years.</p>
